michael connelly the overlook a book in the harry bosch series to the librarian who gave me to kill a mockingbird one the call came at midnight harry bosch was awake and sitting in the living room in the dark he liked to think that he was doing this because it allowed him to hear the saxophone better by masking one of the senses he accentuated another but deep down he knew the truth he was waiting the call was from larry gandle his supervisor in homicide special it was boschs first call out in the new job and it was what he had been waiting for harry you up im up whos that you got playing frank morgan live at the jazz standard in new york thats george cables youre hearing now on piano sounds like all blues you nailed it good stuff i hate to take you away from it bosch used the remote to turn the music off whats the call lieutenant hollywood wants you and iggy to come out and take over a case theyve already caught three today and cant handle a fourth this one also looks like it might become a hobby it looks like an execution the los angeles police department had seventeen geographic divisions each with its own station and detective bureau including a homicide squad but the divisional squads were the first line and couldnt get bogged down on longrunning cases when a murder came with any sort of political celebrity or media attachment it was usually shuttled down to homicide special which operated out of the robberyhomicide division in parker center any case that appeared to be particularly difficult and timeconsumingthat would invariably stay active like a hobbywould also be an immediate candidate for homicide special this was one of those where is it bosch asked up on that overlook above the mulholland dam you know the place yeah ive been up there bosch got up and walked to the dining room table he opened a drawer designed for silverware and took out a pen and a small notebook on the first page of the notebook he wrote down the date and the location of the murder scene any other details i should know bosch asked not a lot gandle said like i said it was described to me as an execution two in the back of the head somebody took this guy up there and blew his brains out all over that pretty view bosch let this register a moment before asking the next question do they know who the dead guy is the divisionals are working on it maybe theyll have something by the time you get over there its practically in your neighborhood right not too far gandle gave bosch more specifics on the location of the crime scene and asked if harry would make the next call out to his partner bosch said he would take care of it okay harry get up there and see whats what then call me and let me know just wake me up everybody else does bosch thought it was just like a supervisor to complain about getting woken up to a person he would routinely wake up over the course of their relationship you got it bosch said bosch hung up and immediately called ignacio ferras his new partner they were still feeling their way ferras was more than twenty years younger and from another culture the bonding would happen bosch was sure but it would come slowly it always did ferras was awakened by boschs call but became alert quickly and seemed eager to respond which was good the only problem was that he lived all the way out in diamond bar which would put his eta at the crime scene at least an hour off bosch had talked to him about it the first day they had been assigned as partners but ferras wasnt interested in moving he had a family support system in diamond bar and wanted to keep it bosch knew that he would get to the crime scene well ahead of ferras and that would mean he would have to handle any divisional friction on his own taking a case away from the divisional squad was always a delicate thing it was a decision usually made by supervisors not by the homicide detectives on the scene no homicide detective worth the gold trim on his badge would ever want to give away a case that just wasnt part of the mission see you there ignacio bosch said harry ferras said i told you call me iggy everybody does bosch said nothing he didnt want to call him iggy he didnt think it was a name that matched the weight of the assignment and mission he wished that his partner would come to that realization and then stop asking him bosch thought of something and added an instruction telling ferras to swing by parker center on his way in and pick up the city car they were assigned it would add minutes to his arrival time but bosch planned to drive his own car to the scene and he knew he was low on gas okay see you there bosch said leaving names out he hung up and grabbed his coat out of the closet by the front door as he put his arms into it he glanced at himself in the mirror on the inside of the door at fiftysix years old he was trim and fit and could even stand to add a few pounds while other detectives his age were getting round in the middle in homicide special there was a pair of detectives known as crate and barrel because of their widening dimensions bosch didnt have to worry about that the gray had not yet chased all of the brown out of his hair but it was getting close to victory his dark eyes were clear and bright and ready for the challenge awaiting him at the overlook in his own eyes bosch saw a basic understanding of homicide work that when he stepped out the front door he would be willing and able to go the distancewhatever that entailedto get the job done it made him feel as though he were bulletproof he reached across his body with his left hand to pull the gun out of the holster on his right hip it was a kimber ultra carry he quickly checked the magazine and the action and then returned the weapon to its holster he was ready he opened the door the lieutenant had not known a lot about the case but he had been right about one thing the crime scene was not far from boschs home he dropped down to cahuenga and then took barham across the freeway from there it was a quick run up lake hollywood drive to a neighborhood of homes clustered on the hills surrounding the reservoir and the mulholland dam they were expensive homes he worked his way around the fenced reservoir stopping only for a moment when he came upon a coyote in the road the animals eyes caught the headlights and glowed brightly it then turned and sauntered slowly across the road disappearing into the brush it was in no hurry to get out of the way almost daring bosch to do something it reminded him of his days on patrol when he saw the same challenge in the eyes of most of the young men he encountered on the street after passing the reservoir he took tahoe drive farther up into the hills and then connected with the eastern terminus of mulholland drive there was an unofficial overlook of the city here it was posted with no parking and overlook closed at dark signs but these were routinely ignored at all hours of the day and night bosch pulled in behind the grouping of official vehiclesthe forensics van and the coroners wagon as well as several marked and unmarked police cars there was an outer perimeter of yellow police tape surrounding the crime scene and inside this boundary was a silver porsche carrera with its hood open it had been sectioned off by more yellow tape and this told bosch that it was most likely the victims car bosch parked and got out a patrol officer assigned to the outer perimeter took down his name and badge numberand allowed him under the yellow tape he approached the crime scene two banks of portable lights had been erected on either side of the body which was in the center of a clearing that looked down upon the city as bosch approached he saw forensics techs and coroners people working on and around the body a tech with a video camera was documenting the scene as well harry over here bosch turned and saw detective jerry edgar leaning against the hood of an unmarked detective cruiser he had a cup of coffee in his hand and appeared to be just waiting he pushed himself off the car as bosch came over edgar had been boschs partner once back when he had worked in hollywood division back then bosch was a team leader on the homicide squad now edgar was in that position been waiting on somebody from rhd edgar said didnt know it would be you man its me you working this solo no my partners on the way your new partner right i havent heard from you since that mess over in echo park last year yeah so what do you have here bosch didnt want to talk about echo park with edgar with anyone as a matter of fact he wanted to stay focused on the case at hand it was his first call out since his transfer to homicide special he knew there would be a lot of people watching his moves some of them would be people hoping he would fail edgar turned so that bosch could see what was spread out on the trunk of the car bosch took out glasses and put them on as he leaned in close to look there wasnt a lot of light but he could see an array of evidence bags the bags separately contained items taken from the body these included a wallet a key ring and a clipon name tag there was also a money clip with a thick fold of currency and a blackberry that was still on its green light flashing and ready to transmit calls its owner would never make or receive the coroners guy just gave me all of this edgar said they should be done with the body in about ten minutes bosch picked up the bag containing the id tag and angled it toward the light it said saint agathas clinic for women on it was a photograph of a man with dark hair and dark eyes it identified him as dr stanley kent he was smiling at the camera bosch noticed that the id tag was also a swipe key that could open locked doors you talk to kiz much edgar asked it was a reference to boschs former partner who had transferred after echo park to a management job in the ocpthe office of the chief of police not too much but shes doing fine bosch moved on to the other evidence bags and wanted to move the conversation away from kiz rider and onto the case at hand why dont you run down what youve got for me jerry he said happy to edgar said the stiff was found about an hour ago as you can see from the signs out on the street there is no parking up here and no loitering after dark hollywood always has a patrol swing by here a few times a night to chase lookyloos away keeps the rich locals up here happy i am told that house over there is madonnas or it was he pointed to a sprawling mansion about a hundred yards from the clearing the moonlight silhouetted a tower rising from the structure the mansions exterior was striped in alternating hues of rust and yellow like a tuscan church it was on a promontory that afforded anyone looking through its windows a magnificent sweeping view of the city below bosch imagined the pop star up in the tower looking down on the city that lay at her command bosch looked back at his old partner ready for the rest of the report the patrol car swings around about eleven and sees the porsche with the hood open engines in the back of those porsches harry it means the trunk was open got it okay so you knew that already anyway the patrol car pulls up they dont see anybody in or around the porsche so the two officers get out one of them walks out into the clearing and finds our guy hes facedown and has two in the back of the head an execution clean and simple bosch nodded at the id tag in the evidence bag and this is the guy stanley kent looks that way the tag and the wallet both say hes stanley kent fortytwo years old from just around the corner on arrowhead drive we ran the plate on the porsche and it comes back to a business called k and k medical physicists i just ran kent through the box and he came up pretty clean hes got a few speeding tickets on the porsche but thats it a straight shooter bosch nodded as he registered all the information you are going to get no grief from me taking over this case harry edgar said i got one partner in court this month and i left my other one at the first scene we caught todaya threebagger with a fourth victim on life support at queen of angels bosch remembered that hollywood ran its homicide squad in threeman teams instead of the traditional partnerships any chance the threebagger is connected to this he pointed to the gathering of technicians around the body on the overlook no thats a straight gang shootemup edgar said i think this thing is a whole different ball game and im happy for you to take it good bosch said ill cut you loose as soon as i can anybody look in the car yet not really waiting on you okay anybody go to the victims house on arrowhead no on that too anybody knock on any doors not yet we were working the scene first edgar obviously had decided early that the case would be passed to rhd it bothered bosch that nothing had been done but at the same time he knew it would be his and ferrass to work fresh from the start and that wasnt a bad thing there was a long history in the department of cases getting damaged or bungled while in transition from divisional to downtown detective teams he looked at the lighted clearing and counted a total of five men working on or near the body for the forensics and coroners teams well he said since youre working the crime scene first did anybody look for foot impressions around the body before you let the techs approach bosch couldnt keep the tone of annoyance out of his voice harry edgar said his tone now showing annoyance with boschs annoyance a couple hundred people stand around on this overlook every damn day we coulda been looking at footprints till christmas if wed wanted to take the time i didnt think we did we had a body lying out here in a public place and needed to get to it besides that it looks like a professional hit that means the shoes the gun the car everythings already long gone by now bosch nodded he wanted to dismiss this and move on okay he said evenly then i guess youre clear edgar nodded and bosch thought he might be embarrassed like i said harry i didnt expect it to be you meaning he would not have dogged it for harry only for somebody else from rhd sure bosch said i understand after edgar left bosch went back to his car and got the maglite out of the trunk he walked back to the porsche put on gloves and opened the driverside door he leaned into the car and looked around on the passenger seat was a briefcase it was unlocked and when he popped the snaps it opened to reveal several files a calculator and various pads pens and papers he closed it and left it in its place its position on the seat told him that the victim had likely arrived at the overlook by himself he had met his killer here he had not brought his killer with him this bosch thought might be significant he opened the glove box next and several more clipon ids like the one found on the body fell to the floorboard he picked them up one by one and saw that each access badge had been issued by a different local hospital but the swipe cards all bore the same name and photo stanley kent the man bosch presumed who was lying dead in the clearing he noticed that on the back of several of the tags there were handwritten notations he looked at these for a long moment most were numbers with the letters l or r at the end and he concluded that they were lock combinations bosch looked farther into the glove box and found even more ids and access key cards as far as he could tell the dead manif he was stanley kent had clearance access to just about every hospital in los angeles county he also had the combinations to security locks at almost every one of the hospitals bosch briefly considered that the ids and key cards might be counterfeits used by the victim in some sort of hospital scam bosch returned everything to the glove box and closed it he then looked under and between the seats and found nothing of interest he backed out of the car and went to the open trunk the trunk was small and empty but in the beam of his flashlight he noted that there were four indentations in the carpet lining the bottom it was clear that something square and heavy with four legs or wheels had been carried in the trunk because the trunk was found in the open position it was likely that the objectwhatever it washad been taken during the killing detective bosch turned and put the beam of his light into the face of a patrolman it was the officer who had taken his name and badge number at the perimeter he lowered the light what is it theres an fbi agent here shes asking permission to enter the crime scene where is she the officer led the way back to the yellow tape as bosch got close he saw a woman standing next to the open door of a car she was alone and she wasnt smiling bosch felt the thud of uneasy recognition hit his chest hello harry she said when she saw him hello rachel he said two it had been almost six months since he had seen special agent rachel walling of the federal bureau of investigation as he approached her at the tape bosch was sure that not a day had gone by in that time when he hadnt thought about her he had never imagined however that they would be reunitedif they ever were reunitedin the middle of the night at a murder scene she was dressed in jeans an oxford shirt and a dark blue blazer her dark hair was unkempt but she still looked beautiful she obviously had been called in from home just as bosch had she wasnt smiling and bosch was reminded of how badly things had ended the last time look he said i know ive been ignoring you but you didnt have to go to all the trouble of tracking me down at a crime scene just to its not really a time for humor she said cutting him off if this is what i think it might be theyd last had contact on the echo park case he had found her at the time working for a shadowy fbi unit called tactical intelligence she had never explained what exactly the unit did and bosch had never pushed it since it wasnt important to the echo park investigation he had reached out to her because of her past tenure as a profilerand their past personal history the echo park case had gone sideways and so had any chance for another romance as bosch looked at her now he knew she was all business and he had a feeling he was about to find out what the tactical intelligence unit was all about what is it you think it might be he asked ill tell you when i can tell you can i please see the scene reluctantly bosch lifted the crime scene tape and returned her perfunctory attitude with his standard sarcasm come on in then agent walling he said why dont you just make yourself at home she stepped under and stopped at least respecting his right to lead her to his crime scene i actually might be able to help you here she said if i can see the body i might be able to make a formal identification for you she held up a file that she had been carrying down at her side this way then bosch said he led her to the clearing where the victim was cast in the sterilizing fluorescent light from the mobile units the dead man was lying on the orange dirt about five feet from the dropoff at the edge of the overlook beyond the body and over the edge the moonlight reflected off the reservoir below past the dam the city spread out in a blanket of a million lights the cool evening air made the lights shimmer like floating dreams bosch put out his arm to stop walling at the edge of the light circle the victim had been rolled over by the medical examiner and was now faceup there were abrasions on the dead mans face and forehead but bosch thought he could recognize the man in the photos on the hospital tags in the glove box stanley kent his shirt was open exposing a hairless chest of pale white skin there was an incision mark on one side of the torso where the medical examiner had pushed a temperature probe into the liver evening harry said joe felton the medical examiner or i guess i should say good morning whos your friend there i thought they teamed you with iggy ferras i am with ferras bosch responded this is special agent walling from the fbis tactical intelligence unit tactical intelligence what will they think of next i think its one of those homeland securitytype operations you know dont ask dont tell that sort of thing she says she might be able to confirm an id for us walling gave bosch a look that told him he was being juvenile all right if we come in doc bosch asked sure harry were pretty much squared away here bosch started to step forward but walling moved quickly in front of him and walked into the harsh light without hesitation she took a position over the body she opened the file and took out a color face shot she bent down and held it next to the dead mans face bosch stepped in close at her side to make a comparison himself its him she said stanley kent bosch nodded his agreement and then offered his hand to her so that she could step back over the body she ignored it and did it without help bosch looked down at felton who was squatting next to the body so doc you want to tell us what weve got here bosch stooped down on the other side of the body to get a better look weve got a man who was brought here or came here for whatever reason and was made to get down on his knees felton pointed to the victims pants there were smudges of orange dirt on both knees then somebody shot him twice in the back of the head and he went down face first the facial injuries you see came when he hit the ground he was already dead by then bosch nodded no exit wounds felton added probably something small like a twentytwo with the ricochet effect inside the skull very efficient bosch realized now that lieutenant gandle had been speaking figuratively when he mentioned that the victims brains had been blown across the view from the overlook he would have to remember gandles tendency toward hyperbole in the future time of death he asked felton going by the liver temp i would say four or five hours the medical examiner replied eight oclock give or take that last part troubled bosch he knew that by eight it would have been dark and all the sunset worshippers would have been long gone but the two shots would have echoed from the overlook and into the houses on the nearby bluffs yet no one had made a call to the police and the body wasnt found until a patrol car happened by three hours later i know what you are thinking felton said what about the sound there is a possible explanation guys lets roll him back over bosch stood up and stepped out of the way while felton and one of his assistants turned the body over bosch glanced at walling and for a moment their eyes locked until she looked back down at the body turning the body had exposed the bullet entry wounds in the back of the head the victims black hair was matted with blood the back of his white shirt was spattered with a fine spray of a brown substance that immediately drew boschs attention he had been to too many crime scenes to remember or count he didnt think that was blood on the dead mans shirt thats not blood is it no its not felton said i think well find out from the lab that its good old cocacola syrup the residue you might find in the bottom of an empty bottle or can before bosch could respond walling did an improvised silencer to dampen the sound of the shots she said you tape an empty plastic liter coke bottle to the muzzle of the weapon and the sound of the shot is significantly reduced as sound waves are projected into the bottle rather than the open air if the bottle had a residue of coke in it the liquid would be spattered onto the target of the shot felton looked at bosch and nodded approvingly whered you get her harry shes a keeper bosch looked at walling he too was impressed internet she said bosch nodded though he didnt believe her and there is one other thing you should note felton said drawing attention back to the body bosch stooped down again felton reached across the body to point at the hand on boschs side we have one of these on each hand he was pointing to a red plastic ring on the middle finger bosch looked at it and then checked the other hand there was a matching red ring on the inside of each hand the ring had a white facing that looked like some sort of tape what are they bosch asked i dont know yet felton said but i think i do walling said bosch looked up at her he nodded of course she knew theyre called tld rings walling said stands for thermal luminescent dosimetry its an earlywarning device its a ring that reads radiation exposure the news brought an eerie silence to the gathering until walling continued and ill give you a tip she said when they are turned inward like that with the tld screen on the inside of the hand that usually means the wearer directly handles radioactive materials bosch stood up okay everybody he ordered back away from the body everybody just back away the crime scene techs the coroners people and bosch all started moving away from the body but walling didnt move she raised her hands like she was calling for a congregations attention in church hold on hold on she said nobody has to back away its cool its cool its safe everybody paused but nobody moved back to their original positions if there was an exposure threat here then the tld screens on the rings would be black she said thats the early warning but they havent turned black so were all safe additionally i have this she pulled back her jacket to reveal a small black box clipped to her belt like a pager radiation monitor she explained if we had a problem believe me this thing would be screaming bloody murder and id be running at the front of the pack but we dont everything is cool here okay the people at the crime scene hesitantly started to return to their positions harry bosch moved in close to walling and took her by an elbow can we talk over here for a minute they moved out of the clearing toward the curb at mulholland bosch felt things shifting but tried not to show it he was agitated he didnt want to lose control of the crime scene and this sort of information threatened to do just that what are you doing here rachel he asked whats going on just like you i got a call in the middle of the night i was told to roll out that tells me nothing i assure you that i am here to help then start by telling me exactly what you are doing here and who sent you out that would help me a lot walling looked around and then back at bosch she pointed out beyond the yellow tape can we bosch held out his hand telling her to lead the way they went under the tape and out into the street when he judged that they were out of earshot of everyone else at the crime scene bosch stopped and looked at her okay this is far enough he said what is going on here who called you out here she locked eyes with him again listen what i tell you here has to remain confidential she said for now look rachel i dont have time for stanley kent is on a list when you or one of your colleagues ran his name on the national crime index computer tonight a flag went up in washington dc and a call went out to me at tactical what was he a terrorist no he was a medical physicist and as far as i know a lawabiding citizen then whats with the radiation rings and the fbi showing up in the middle of the night what list was stanley kent on walling ignored the question let me ask you something harry has anyone checked on this mans home or wife yet not yet we were working the crime scene first i plan to then i think we need to do that right now she said in an urgent tone you can ask your questions along the way get the guys keys in case we need to go in and ill go get my car walling started to move away but bosch caught her by the arm im driving he said he pointed toward his mustang and left her there he headed to the patrol car where the evidence bags were still spread on the trunk as he made his way he regretted having already cut edgar loose from the scene he signaled the watch sergeant over listen i have to leave the scene to check on the victims house i shouldnt be gone long and detective ferras should be here any minute just maintain the scene until one of us gets here you got it bosch pulled out his cell phone and called his partner where are you i just cleared parker center im twenty minutes away bosch explained that he was leaving the scene and that ferras needed to hurry he disconnected grabbed the evidence bag containing the key ring off the cruisers trunk and shoved it into his coat pocket as he got to his car he saw walling already in the passenger seat she was finishing a call and closing her cell phone who was that bosch asked after getting in the president my partner she replied i told him to meet me at the house wheres your partner hes coming bosch started the car as soon as they pulled out he began asking questions if stanley kent wasnt a terrorist then what list was he on as a medical physicist he had direct access to radioactive materials that put him on a list bosch thought of all the hospital name tags he had found in the dead mans porsche access where in the hospitals exactly thats where its kept these are materials primarily used in the treatment of cancer bosch nodded he was getting the picture but still didnt have enough information okay so what am i missing here rachel lay it out for me stanley kent had direct access to materials that some people in the world would like to get their hands on materials that could be very very valuable to these other people but not in the treatment of cancer terrorists exactly are you saying that this guy could just waltz into a hospital and get this stuff arent there regulations walling nodded there are always regulations harry but just having them is not always enough repetition routinethese are the cracks in any security system we used to leave the cockpit doors on commercial airlines unlocked now we dont it takes an event of lifealtering consequences to change procedures and strengthen precautions do you understand what i am saying he thought of the notations on the back of some of the id cards in the victims porsche could stanley kent have been so lax about the security of these materials that he wrote access combinations on the back of his id cards boschs instincts told him the answer was probably yes i understand he told walling so then if you were going to circumvent an existing security system no matter how strong or weak who would you go to she asked bosch nodded somebody with intimate knowledge of that security system exactly bosch turned onto arrowhead drive and started looking at address numbers on the curb so youre saying this could be an event of lifealtering consequences no im not saying that not yet did you know kent bosch looked at walling as he asked and she looked surprised by the question it had been a long shot but he threw it out there for the reaction not necessarily the answer walling turned from him and looked out her window before answering bosch knew the move a classic tell he knew she would now lie to him no i never met the man bosch pulled into the next driveway and stopped the car what are you doing she asked this is it its kent s house they were in front of a house that had no lights on inside or out it looked like no one lived there no it isnt walling said his house is down another block and she stopped when she realized bosch had smoked her out bosch stared at her for a moment in the dark car before speaking you want to level with me now or do you want to get out of the car look harry i told you there are things i cant get out of the car agent walling ill handle this myself look you have to under this is a homicide my homicide get out of the car she didnt move i can make one phone call and youd be removed from this investigation before you got back to the scene she said then do it id rather be kicked to the curb right now than be a mushroom for the feds isnt that one of the bureaus slogans keep the locals in the dark and bury them in cow shit well not me not tonight and not on my own case he started to reach across her lap to open her door walling pushed him back and raised her hands in surrender all right all right she said what is it you want to know i want the truth this time all of it three bosch turned in his seat to look directly at walling he was not going to move the car until she started talking you obviously knew who stanley kent was and where he lived he said you lied to me now was he a terrorist or not i told you no and that is the truth he was a citizen he was a physicist he was on a watch list because he handled radioactive sources which could be usedin the wrong handsto harm members of the public what are you talking about how would this happen through exposure and that could take many different forms individual assaultyou remember last thanksgiving the russian who was dosed with polonium in london that was a specific target attack though there were ancillary victims as well the material kent had access to could also be used on a larger scalea mall a subway whatever it all depends on the quantity and of course the delivery device delivery device are you talking about a bomb somebody could make a dirty bomb with the stuff he handled in some applications yes i thought that was an urban legend that theres never actually been a dirty bomb the official designation is iedimprovised explosive device and put it this way its only an urban legend until precisely the moment that the first one is detonated bosch nodded and got back on track he gestured to the house in front of them how did you know this isnt the kent house walling rubbed her forehead as though she were tired of his annoying questions and had a headache because i have been to his house before okay early last year my partner and i came to kent s house and briefed him and his wife on the potential dangers of his profession we did a security check on their home and told them to take precautions we had been asked to do it by the department of homeland security okay yeah okay and was that routine for the tactical intelligence unit and the department of homeland security or was that because there had been a threat to him not a threat specifically aimed at him no look were wasting then to who a threat to who walling adjusted her position in the seat and let her breath out in exasperation there wasnt a threat to anyone specifically we were simply taking precautions sixteen months ago someone entered a cancer clinic in greensboro north carolina circumvented elaborate security measures and removed twentytwo small tubes of a radioisotope called cesium onethirtyseven the legitimate medical use of this material in that setting was in the treatment of gynecological cancer we dont know who got in there or why but the material was taken when news of the theft went out on the wire somebody in the joint terrorism task force here in la thought it would be a good idea to assess the security of these materials in local hospitals and to warn those who have access to and handle the stuff to take precautions and to be alert can we please go now and that was you yes you got it it was the federal trickledown theory at work it fell to me and my partner to go out and talk to people like stanley kent we met him and his wife at their house so we could do a security check of the place at the same time we told him that he should start watching his back that is the same reason i was the one who got the call when his name came up on the flag bosch dropped the transmission into reverse and pulled quickly out of the driveway why didnt you just tell me this up front in the street the car jerked forward as bosch threw it into drive because nobody got killed in greensboro walling said defiantly this whole thing could be something different i was told to approach with caution and discretion im sorry i lied to you a little late for that rachel did your people get the cesium back in greensboro she didnt answer did you no not yet the word is that it was sold on the black market the material itself is quite valuable on a monetary basis even if used in the proper medical context thats why we are not sure what weve got here thats why i was sent in ten more seconds they were at the correct block of arrowhead drive and bosch started looking at address numbers again but walling directed him that one up on the left i think with the black shutters its hard to tell in the dark bosch pulled in and chunked the transmission into park before the car had stopped he jumped out and headed to the front door the house was dark not even the light over the door was lit but as bosch approached the front door he saw that it had been left ajar its open he said bosch and walling drew their weapons bosch placed his hand on the door and slowly pushed it open with guns up they entered the dark and quiet house and bosch quickly swept the wall with his hand until he found a light switch the lights came on revealing a living room that was neat but empty with no sign of trouble mrs kent walling called out loudly then to bosch in a lower voice she said theres just his wife no children walling called out once more but the house remained silent there was a hallway to the right and bosch moved toward it he found another light switch and illuminated a passageway with four closed doors and an alcove the alcove was a home office that was empty he saw a blue reflection on the window that was cast by a computer screen they passed by the alcove and went door by door clearing what looked like a guest bedroom and then a home gym with cardio machines and with workout mats hanging on the wall the third door was to a guest bathroom that was empty and the fourth led to the master bedroom they entered the master and bosch once more flicked up a wall switch they found mrs kent she was on the bed naked gagged and hogtied with her hands behind her back her eyes were closed walling rushed to the bed to see if she was alive while bosch moved through the bedroom to clear the bathroom and a walkin closet there was no one when he got back to the bed he saw that walling had removed the gag and used a pocketknife to slice through the black plastic snap ties that had been used to bind the womans wrists and ankles together behind her back rachel was pulling the bedspread over the unmoving womans naked body there was a distinct odor of urine in the room is she alive bosch asked shes alive i think shes just passed out she was left here like this walling started rubbing the womans wrists and hands they had turned dark and almost purple from lack of blood circulation get help she told him annoyed with himself for not reacting until ordered bosch pulled out his phone and walked out into the hallway while he called the central communications center to get paramedics rolling ten minutes he said after hanging up and coming back into the bedroom bosch felt a wave of excitement go through him they now had a live witness the woman on the bed would be able to tell them at least something about what had happened he knew that it would be vitally important to get her talking as soon as possible there was a loud groan as the woman regained consciousness mrs kent its okay walling said its okay youre safe now the woman tensed and her eyes widened when she saw the two strangers in front of her walling held up her credentials fbi mrs kent do you remember me what what iswheres my husband she started to get up but then realized she was naked beneath the bedcovers and tried to pull them tightly around herself her fingers were apparently still numb and couldnt find purchase walling helped pull the spread around her where is stanley walling knelt at the bottom of the bed so that she was on an equal level with her she looked up at bosch as if seeking direction on how to handle the womans question mrs kent your husband is not here bosch said i am detective bosch with the lapd and this is agent walling with the fbi were trying to find out what happened to your husband the woman looked up at bosch and then at walling and her eyes held on the federal agent i remember you she said you came to the house to warn us is that what is happening do the men who were here have stanley rachel leaned in close and spoke in a calming voice mrs kent weits alicia right alicia we need for you to calm down a little bit so that we can talk and possibly help you would you like to get dressed alicia kent nodded okay well give you some space here walling said you get dressed and well wait for you in the living room first let me ask have you been injured in any way the woman shook her head are you sure walling didnt finish as though she were intimidated by her own question bosch wasnt he knew they needed to know precisely what had happened here mrs kent were you sexually assaulted here tonight the woman shook her head again they made me take off my clothes that was all they did bosch studied her eyes hoping to read them and be able to tell if she was telling a lie okay walling said interrupting the moment well leave you to get dressed when the paramedics arrive we will still want them to check you for injuries ill be fine alicia kent said what happened to my husband were not sure whats happened bosch said you get dressed and come out to the living room then well tell you what we know clutching the bedspread around herself she tentatively stood up from the bed bosch saw the stain on the mattress and knew that alicia kent had either been so scared during her ordeal that she had urinated or the wait for rescue had been too long she took one step toward the closet and appeared to be falling over bosch moved in and grabbed her before she fell are you all right im fine i think im just a little dizzy what time is it bosch looked at the digital clock on the rightside bed table but its screen was blank it was turned off or unplugged he turned his right wrist without letting go of her and looked at his watch its almost one in the morning her body seemed to tighten in his grasp oh my god she cried its been hourswhere is stanley bosch moved his hands to her shoulders and helped her stand up straight you get dressed and well talk about it he said she walked unsteadily to the closet and opened the door a fulllength mirror was attached to the outside of the door her opening it swung boschs reflection back at him in the moment he thought that maybe he saw something new in his eyes something not there when he had checked himself in the mirror before leaving his house a look of discomfort perhaps even a fear of the unknown it was understandable he decided he had worked a thousand murder cases in his time but never one that had taken him in the direction he was now traveling maybe fear was appropriate alicia kent took a white terrycloth robe off a hook on a wall inside the closet and carried it with her to the bathroom she left the closet door open and bosch had to look away from his own reflection walling headed out of the bedroom and bosch followed what do you think she asked as she moved down the hall i think were lucky to have a witness bosch replied shell be able to tell us what happened hopefully bosch decided to make another survey of the house while waiting for alicia kent to get dressed this time he checked the backyard and the garage as well as every room again he found nothing amiss though he did note that the twocar garage was empty if the kents had another car in addition to the porsche then it wasnt on the premises following the walkthrough he stood in the backyard looking up at the hollywood sign and calling central communications again to ask that a second forensics team be dispatched to process the kent house he also checked on the eta of the paramedics coming to examine alicia kent and was told that they were still five minutes away this was ten minutes after he had been told that they were ten minutes away next he called lieutenant gandle waking him at his home his supervisor listened quietly as bosch updated him the federal involvement and the rising possibility of a terrorism angle to the investigation gave gandle pause well he said when bosch was finished it looks like i will have to wake some people up he meant he was going to have to send word up the department ladder of the case and the larger dimensions it was taking on the last thing an rhd lieutenant would want or need would be to get called into the ocp in the morning and asked why he hadnt alerted command staff earlier to the case and its growing implications bosch knew that gandle would now act to protect himself as well as to seek direction from above this was fine with bosch and expected but it gave him pause as well the lapd had its own office of homeland security it was commanded by a man most people in the department viewed as a loose cannon who was unqualified and unsuited for the job is one of those wakeups going to captain hadley bosch asked captain don hadley was the twin brother of james hadley who happened to be a member of the police commission the politically appointed panel with lapd oversight and the authority to appoint and retain the chief of police less than a year after james hadley was placed on the commission by mayoral appointment and the approval of the city council his twin brother jumped from being second in command of the valley traffic division to being commander of the newly formed office of homeland security this was seen at the time as a political move by the thenchief of police who was desperately trying to keep his job it didnt work he was fired and a new chief appointed but in the transition hadley kept his job commanding the ohs the mission of the ohs was to interface with federal agencies and maintain a flow of intelligence data in the last six years los angeles had been targeted by terrorists at least two times that were known in each incident the lapd found out about the threat after it had been foiled by the feds this was embarrassing to the department and the ohs had been formed so that the lapd could make intelligence inroads and eventually know what the federal government knew about its own backyard the problem was that in practice it was largely suspected that the lapd remained shut out by the feds and in order to hide this failing and to justify his position and unit captain hadley had taken to holding grandstanding press conferences and showing up with his blackclad ohs unit at any crime scene where there was a remote possibility of terrorist involvement an overturned tanker truck on the hollywood freeway brought the ohs out in force until it was determined that the tanker was carrying milk a shooting of a rabbi at a temple in westwood brought the same response until the incident was determined to have been the product of a love triangle and so it went after about the fourth misfire the commander of the ohs was baptized with a new name among the rank and file captain don hadley became known as captain done badly but he remained in his position thanks to the thin veil of politics that hung over his appointment the last bosch had heard about hadley through the department grapevine was that he had put his entire squad back into the academy for training in urban assault tactics i dont know about hadley gandle said in response to bosch hell probably be looped in ill start with my captain and hell make the call on who gets the word from there but thats not your concern harry you do your job and dont worry about hadley the people you have to watch your back with are the feds got it remember with the feds its always time to worry when they start telling you just what you want to hear bosch nodded the advice followed a timehonored lapd tradition of distrusting the fbi and of course it was a tradition honored for just as long by the fbi in terms of distrusting the lapd right back it was the reason the ohs was born when bosch came back into the house he found walling on her cell phone and a man he had never seen before standing in the living room he was tall midforties and he exuded that undeniable fbi confidence bosch had seen many times before the man put out his hand you must be detective bosch he said jack brenner rachels my partner bosch shook his hand the way he said rachel was his partner was a small thing but it told bosch a lot there was something proprietary about it brenner was telling him that the senior partner was now on the job whether that would be rachels view of it or not so you two have met bosch turned walling was off the phone now sorry she said i was filling in the special agent in charge hes decided to devote all of tactical to this hes running out three teams to start hitting the hospitals to see if kent has been in any of the hot labs today the hot lab is where they keep the radioactive stuff bosch asked yes kent had access through security to just about all of them in the county we have to figure out if he was inside any of them today bosch knew that he could probably narrow the search down to one medical facility saint agathas clinic for women kent was wearing an id tag from the hospital when he was murdered walling and brenner didnt know that but bosch decided not to tell them yet he sensed the investigation was moving away from him and he wanted to hold on to what might be the one piece of inside information he still had what about the lapd he asked instead the lapd brenner said jumping on the question ahead of walling you mean what about you bosch is that what youre asking yeah thats right where do i stand in this brenner spread his hands in a gesture of openness dont worry youre in youre with us all the way the federal agent nodded like it was a promise as good as gold good bosch said thats just what i wanted to hear he looked at walling for confirmation of her partners statement but she looked away four when alicia kent finally came out of the master bedroom she had brushed her hair and washed her face but had put on only the white robe bosch now saw how attractive she was small and dark and exoticlooking in some way he guessed that taking her husbands name had hidden a bloodline from somewhere far away her black hair had a luminescent quality to it it framed an olive face that was beautiful and sorrowful at the same time she noticed brenner and he nodded and introduced himself alicia kent seemed so dazed by what was happening that she showed no recognition of brenner in the way that she had remembered walling brenner directed her to the couch and told her to sit down where is my husband she demanded this time with a voice that was stronger and calmer than before i want to know what is going on rachel sat down next to her ready to console if necessary brenner took a chair near the fireplace bosch remained standing he never liked to be sitting down all cozy when he delivered this sort of news mrs kent bosch said taking the lead in a proprietary effort to keep his hold of the case i am a homicide detective i am here because earlier tonight we found the body of a man we believe to be your husband i am very sorry to tell you this her head dropped forward as she received the news then her hands came up and they covered her face a shudder went through her body and the sound of a helpless moan came from behind her hands then she started to cry deep sobs that shook her shoulders so much that she had to lower her hands to hold the robe from coming open walling reached over and put a hand on the back of her neck brenner offered to get her a glass of water and she nodded while he was gone bosch studied the woman and saw the tears streaking her cheeks it was dirty work telling someone that their loved one was dead he had done it hundreds of times but it wasnt something you ever got used to or even good at it had also been done to him when his own mother was murdered more than forty years before he got the news from a cop just after he climbed out of a swimming pool at a youth hall his response was to jump back in and try to never come back up brenner delivered the water and the brandnew widow drank half of it down before anyone could ask a question there was a knock on the door and bosch stepped over and let in two paramedics carrying big equipment boxes bosch moved out of the way while they came forward to assess the womans physical condition he signaled walling and brenner into the kitchen where they could confer in whispers he realized that they should have talked about this earlier so how do you want to handle her bosch asked brenner spread his hands wide again as though he was open to suggestions it appeared to be his signature gesture i think you keep the lead the agent said well step in when needed if you dont like that we could no thats good ill keep the lead he looked at walling waiting for an objection but she was fine with it too he turned to leave the kitchen but brenner stopped him bosch i want to be up front with you brenner said bosch turned back meaning meaning i had you checked out the word is you what do you mean you checked me out you asked questions about me i needed to know who were working with all i knew about you prior to this is what id heard about echo park i wanted if you have any questions you can ask me brenner raised his hands palms out fair enough bosch left the kitchen and stood in the living room waiting for the paramedics to finish with alicia kent one of the medical men was putting some sort of cream on the chafe marks on her wrists and ankles the other was taking a bloodpressure reading bosch saw that bandages had been placed on her neck and one wrist apparently covering wounds that he hadnt noticed before his phone buzzed and bosch went back into the kitchen to take the call he noticed that walling and brenner were gone apparently having slipped into another part of the house it made bosch anxious he didnt know what they were looking for or up to the call was from his partner ferras had finally made it to the crime scene is the body still there bosch asked no the me just cleared the scene ferras said i think forensics is finishing up too bosch updated him on the direction the case appeared to be going telling him about the federal involvement and the potentially dangerous materials stanley kent had had access to he then directed him to start knocking on doors and looking for witnesses who might have seen or heard something relating to the killing of stanley kent he knew it was a long shot because no one had called after the shooting should i do that now harry its the middle of the night and people are slee yes ignacio you should do it now bosch wasnt worried about waking people up there was a good chance that the generator that powered the crime scene lights had awakened the neighborhood anyway but the canvassing of the neighborhood had to be done and it was always better to find witnesses sooner rather than later when bosch came out of the kitchen the paramedics had packed up and were leaving they told bosch that alicia kent was physically fine with minor wounds and skin abrasions they also said they had given her a pill to help calm her and a tube of the cream to continue to apply to the chafe marks on her wrists and ankles walling was sitting on the couch next to her again and brenner was back in his seat by the fireplace bosch sat down on the chair directly across the glass coffee table from alicia kent mrs kent he began we are very sorry for your loss and the trauma you have been through but it is very urgent that we move quickly with the investigation in a perfect world we would wait until you were ready to talk to us but its not a perfect world you know that better than we do now we need to ask you questions about what happened here tonight she folded her arms across her chest and nodded that she understood then lets get started bosch said can you tell us what happened two men she responded tearfully i never saw them i mean their faces i never saw their faces there was a knock at the door and i answered there was no one there then when i started to close the door they were there they jumped out they had on masks and hoodslike a sweatshirt with a hood they pushed their way in and they grabbed me they had a knife and one of them grabbed me and held it against my throat he told me he would cut my throat if i didnt do exactly what he told me to do she lightly touched the bandage on her neck do you remember what time this was bosch asked it was almost six oclock she said it had been dark for a while and i was about to start dinner stanley comes home most nights at seven unless hes working down in the south county or up in the desert the reminder of her husbands habits brought a new rush of tears into alicia kents eyes and voice bosch tried to keep her on point by moving to the next question he thought he already detected a slowing down of her speech the pill the paramedics gave her was taking effect what did the men do mrs kent he asked they took me to the bedroom they made me sit down on the bed and take off all my clothes then theyone of themstarted to ask me questions i was scared i guess i got hysterical and he slapped me and he yelled at me he told me to calm down and answer his questions what did he ask you i cant remember everything i was so scared try mrs kent its important it will help us find your husbands killers he asked me if we had a gun and he asked me where the wait a minute mrs kent bosch said lets go one at a time he asked you if you had a gun what did you tell him i was scared i said yes we had a gun he asked where it was and i told him it was in the drawer by the bed on my husbands side it was the gun we got after you warned us about the dangers stan faced with his job she said this last part while looking directly at walling werent you afraid that they would kill you with it bosch asked why did you tell them where the gun was alicia kent looked down at her hands i was sitting there naked i was already sure they were going to rape me and kill me i guess i thought it didnt matter anymore bosch nodded as if he understood what else did they ask you mrs kent they wanted to know where the keys to the car were i told them i told them everything they wanted to know is that your car they were talking about yes my car in the garage i keep the keys on the kitchen counter i checked the garage its empty i heard the garage doorafter they were here they mustve taken the car brenner abruptly stood up we need to get this out he interjected can you tell us what kind of car it is and the license plate number its a chrysler three hundred i cant remember the number i could look it up in our insurance file brenner held his hands up to stop her from getting up not necessary ill be able to get it im going to call it in right away he got up to go to the kitchen to make the call without disturbing the interview bosch went back to his questions what else did they ask you mrs kent they wanted our camera the camera that worked with my husbands computer i told them stanley had a camera that i thought was in his desk whenever i answered a question one manthe one who asked themwould then translate to the other and then that man left the room i guess he went to get the camera now walling stood up and headed toward the hallway leading to the bedrooms rachel dont touch anything bosch said i have a crime scene team coming walling waved as she disappeared down the hall brenner then came back into the room and nodded to bosch the bolos out he said alicia kent asked what a bolo was it means be on the lookout bosch explained theyll be looking for your car what happened next with the two men mrs kent she grew tearful again as she answered they they tied me in that awful way and gagged me with one of my husbands neckties then after the one came back in with the camera the other took a picture of me like that bosch noted the look of burning humiliation on her face he took a photograph yes thats all then they both left the room the one who spoke english bent down and whispered that my husband would come to rescue me then he left that brought a long space of silence before bosch continued after they left the bedroom did they leave the house right away he asked the woman shook her head i heard them talking for a little while then i heard the garage door it rumbles in the house like an earthquake i felt it twiceit opened and closed after that i thought they were gone brenner cut into the interview again when i was in the kitchen i think i heard you say that one of the men translated for the other do you know what language they were speaking bosch was annoyed with brenner for jumping in he intended to ask about the language the intruders used but was carefully covering one aspect of the interview at a time he had found in previous cases that it worked best with traumatized victims i am not sure the one who spoke in english had an accent but i dont know where it was from i think middle eastern i think when they spoke to each other it was arabic or something it was foreign very guttural but i dont know the different languages brenner nodded as if her answer was confirming something do you remember anything else about what the men might have asked you or said in english bosch asked no thats all you said they wore masks what kind of masks she thought for a moment before answering the pullover kind like you see robbers put on in movies or people wear for skiing a wool ski mask she nodded yes exactly okay were they the kind with one hole for both eyes or was there a separate hole for each eye um separate i think yes separate was there an opening for the mouth uh yes there was i remember watching the mans mouth when he spoke in the other language i was trying to understand him thats good mrs kent youre being very helpful what havent i asked you i dont understand what detail do you remember that i havent asked you for she thought about it and then shook her head i dont know i think ive told you everything i can remember bosch wasnt convinced he began to go through the story with her again coming at the same information from new angles it was a triedandtrue interview technique for eliciting new details and it did not fail him the most interesting bit of new information to emerge in the second telling was that the man who spoke english also asked her what the password was to her email account why would he want that bosch asked i dont know alicia kent said i didnt ask i just gave them what they wanted near the end of the second telling of her ordeal the forensics team arrived and bosch called for a break in the questioning while alicia kent remained on the couch he walked the tech team back to the master bedroom so they could start there he then stepped into a corner of the room and called his partner ferras reported that he had found nobody so far who had seen or heard anything on the overlook bosch told him that when he wanted a break from knocking on doors he should check into stanley kent s ownership of a gun they needed to find the make and model it was looking like his own gun was probably the weapon he was killed with as bosch closed the phone walling called to him from the home office harry found her and brenner standing behind the desk and looking at a computer screen look at this walling said i told you he said you shouldnt be touching anything yet we dont have the luxury of time anymore brenner said look at this bosch came around the desk to look at the computer her email account was left open walling said i went into the sent mail file and this was sent to her husbands email at sixtwentyone pm last night she clicked a button and opened up the email that had been sent from alicia kents account to her husbands the subject line said home emergency read immediately embedded in the body of the email was a photograph of alicia kent naked and hogtied on the bed the impact of the photo would be obvious to anyone not just a husband below the photograph was a message we have your wife retrieve for us all cesium sources available to you bring them in safe containment to the mulholland overlook near your home by eight oclock we will be watching you if you tell anyone or make a call we will know the consequence will be your wife being raped tortured and left in to many pieces to count use all precautions while handling sources do not be late or we will kill her bosch read the message twice and believed he felt the same terror stanley kent must have felt we will be watching we will know we will kill her walling said no contractions the too in too many pieces is spelled wrong and then the odd construction of some of the sentences i dont think this was written by someone whose original language is english as she said it bosch saw it and knew that she was right they send the message right from here brenner said the husband gets it at the office or on his pdadid he have a pda bosch had no expertise in this area he hesitated a personal digital assistant walling prompted you know like a palm pilot or a phone with all the gadgets bosch nodded i think so he said there was a blackberry cell phone recovered it looks like it has a minikeyboard that works brenner said so no matter where he is he gets this message and can probably view the photo too all three of them were quiet while the impact of the email registered finally bosch spoke feeling guilty now about holding back earlier i just remembered something there was an id tag on the body from saint aggys up in the valley brenners eyes took on a sharpness you just remembered a key piece of information like that he asked angrily thats right i for it doesnt matter now walling interjected saint aggys is a womens cancer clinic cesium is used almost exclusively for treating cervical and uterine cancer bosch nodded then we better get going he said five saint agathas clinic for women was in sylmar at the north end of the san fernando valley because it was the dead of night they were making good time on the freeway up bosch was behind the wheel of his mustang one eye on the fuel needle he knew he was going to need gas before coming back down into the city it was he and brenner in the car it had been decidedby brennerthat walling should stay behind with alicia kent to continue both questioning and calming her walling didnt seem happy about the assignment but brenner asserting his seniority in the partnership didnt give her room to debate it brenner spent most of the drive taking and making a series of cell calls to and from superiors and fellow agents it was clear to bosch from the side of things he was able to hear that the big federal machine was gearing up for battle a greater alarm had now been sounded the email sent to stanley kent had brought things into better focus and what was once a federal curiosity had now gone completely off the scale when brenner finally closed the phone and put it back in his jacket pocket he turned slightly in his seat and looked over at bosch ive got a rat team heading to saint aggys he said theyll go into the materials safe to check it out a rat team radiologicalattack team whats their eta didnt ask but they might beat us theyve got a chopper bosch was impressed it meant that there had been a rapidresponse team on duty somewhere in the middle of the night he thought about how he had been awake and waiting for the call out that night the members of the radiologicalattack team must wait for the call they hope never comes he remembered what he had heard about the lapds own ohs unit taking training in urban assault tactics he wondered if captain hadley had a rat team too theyre going full field on this brenner said the department of homeland security is overseeing from dc this morning at nine there will be meetings on both coasts to bring everybody together on it who is everybody theres a protocol well bring in homeland the jttf everybody itll be alphabet soup the nrc the doe rap who knows before we get this contained we might even have fema setting up a tent its going to be federal pandemonium bosch didnt know what all the acronyms stood for but didnt need to they all spelled out feds to him who will be running the show brenner looked over at bosch everybody and nobody like i said pandemonium if we open up that safe at saint aggys and the cesium is gone then our best shot at tracking it and getting it back will be to do it before all hell breaks loose at nine and we get micromanaged to death from washington bosch nodded he thought maybe he had misjudged brenner the agent seemed to want to get things done not wallow in the bureaucratic mire and whats the lapd status going to be in a fullfield investigation i already told you the lapd remains in nothing changes on that you remain in harry my guess is that bridges are already being built between our people and your people i know the lapd has its own homeland security office i am sure they will be brought in were obviously going to need all hands on deck with this bosch glanced over at him brenner looked serious have you worked with our ohs before bosch asked on occasion we shared some intelligence on a few things bosch nodded but felt that brenner was being disingenuous or was completely naive about the gulf between the locals and the feds but he noted that he had been called by his first name and wondered if that was one of the bridges being built you said you checked me out who did you check with harry were working well here why stir it up if i made a mistake i apologize fine whod you check me out with look all im going to tell you is that i asked agent walling who the lapd point man was and she gave me your name i made a few calls while driving in i was told you were a very capable detective that you had more than thirty years in that a few years back you retired didnt like it too much and came back to the job to work cold cases things went sideways in echo park a little thing you dragged agent walling into you were off the job a few months while that was uh cleared up and now youre back and assigned to homicide special what else harr what else okay the word i got is that you can be difficult to get along withespecially when it comes to working with the federal government but i have to say so far i dont see any of that at all bosch figured that most of this information had come from rachelhe remembered seeing her on the phone and her saying it was her partner he was disappointed if she had said such things about him and he knew that brenner was probably holding back most of it the truth was that hed had so many runins with the fedsgoing back well before he ever met rachel wallingthat they probably had a file on him as thick as a murder book after a minute or so of silence bosch decided to change direction and spoke again tell me about cesium he said what did agent walling tell you not much its a byproduct the fission of uranium and plutonium creates cesium when chernobyl hit meltdown cesium was the stuff that was dispersed into the air it comes in powder or a silvergray metal when they conducted nuke tests in the south pacific i dont mean the science i dont care about the science tell me about what we are dealing with here brenner thought for a moment okay he said the stuff were talking about comes in pieces about the size of a pencil eraser it is then contained in a sealed stainless steel tube about the size of a fortyfivecaliber bullet cartridge when used in the treatment of a gynecological cancer it is placed inside the womans bodyin the uterusfor a calculated amount of time and it irradiates the targeted area it is supposed to be very effective in quick doses and it is the job of a guy like stanley kent to make that calculusto run the physics down and determine how long a dose is called for he would then go and get the cesium out of the hospitals hot safe and deliver it in person to the oncologist in the operating room the system is set up so that the doctor administering the treatment actually handles the stuff for as little time as possible because the surgeon cant wear any protection while performing a procedure hes got to limit his exposure you know what i mean bosch nodded do these tubes protect whoever handles them no the only thing that knocks down the gamma rays from cesium is lead the safe they keep the tubes in is lined with lead the device they transport them in is made of lead okay so how bad is this stuff going to be if it gets out there in the world brenner gave it some thought before answering out there in the world it is all about quantity delivery and location he said those are the variables cesium has a thirtyyear halflife generally they consider ten halflifes the safety margin youre losing me whats the bottom line the bottom line is that the radiation danger diminishes by half every thirty years if you set off a good amount of this stuff in an enclosed environmentlike maybe a subway station or an office buildingthen that place could be shut down for three hundred years bosch was stunned as he registered this what about people he asked also depends on dispersal and containment a highintensity exposure could kill you within a few hours but if its dispersed by an ied in a subway station then my guess is the immediate casualties would be very low but a body count is not what this would be about its the fear factor that would be important to these people you set something off like this domestically and whats important is the wave of fear it sends through the country a place like los angeles it would never be the same again bosch just nodded there was nothing else to say six at saint aggys they entered through the main lobby and asked the receptionist for the chief of security they were told that the security chief worked days but that she would locate the nightshift security supervisor while they waited they heard the helicopter land on the long front lawn of the medical center and soon the fourmember radiological team came in each man wearing a radiation suit and carrying a face guard the leader of the groupit said kyle reid on his nameplatecarried a handheld radiation monitor finally after two prompts to the woman at the front desk a man who looked like he had been rousted from a bed in a spare patient room greeted them in the lobby he said his name was ed romo and he couldnt seem to take his eyes off the hazmat suits worn by the members of the lab team brenner badged romo and took charge bosch didnt object he knew that they were now on turf where the federal agent would be best suited to walk point and maintain investigative velocity we need to go to the hot lab and check the materials inventory brenner said we also need to see any records or keycard data that will show us who has been in and out of there in the last twentyfour hours romo didnt move he paused as if groping for understanding of the scene in front of him whats this about he finally asked brenner took a step closer to him and invaded his space i just told you what its about he said we need to get into the hot lab in oncology if you cant get us in there then find somebody who can now i gotta make a call first romo said good make it ill give you two minutes and then were going to run you over the whole time he was making the threat brenner was smiling and nodding romo took out a cell phone and stepped away from the group to make the call brenner gave him the space he looked at bosch with a sardonic smile last year i did a security survey here they had a key lock on the lab and the safe and that was it they upgraded after that but you build a better mousetrap and the mice just get smarter bosch nodded ten minutes later bosch brenner romo and the rest of the lab team all stepped out of the elevator in the medical clinics basement romos boss was on his way in but brenner was not waiting romo used a key card to gain entrance to the oncology lab the lab was deserted brenner found an inventory sheet and a lab log on an entrance desk and started reading there was a small video monitor on the desk that showed a camera view of a safe he was here brenner said when bosch asked seven oclock according to this reid pointed to the monitor does that record he asked romo can we see what kent did when he was in there romo looked at the monitor as though it were the first time he had ever seen it um no its just a monitor he finally said whoevers on the desk is supposed to watch whatever is taken out of the safe romo pointed to the far end of the lab where there was a large steel door the trefoil warning symbol for radioactive materials was posted on it at eye level along with a sign caution radiation hazard protective equipment must be worn cuidado peligro de radiación se debe usar equipo de protección bosch noticed that the door had a pushbutton combination lock as well as a magnetic keycard swipe slot it says here that he took one source of cesium brenner said as he continued to study the log one tube its a transfer case he was taking the source over to burbank medical center for a procedure there it names the case a patient named hanover it says that there were thirtyone pieces of cesium left in inventory is that all you need then romo asked no brenner said we have to physically inspect the inventory well need to enter the safe room and then open the safe whats the combination i dont have it romo said who does the physicists the head of the lab the chief of security and where is the chief of security i told you hes coming get him on the speaker brenner pointed to the phone on the desk romo sat down he put the phone on speaker and tapped in a number from memory it was answered immediately this is richard romo ed romo leaned forward to the phone and looked as though he was embarrassed by the revelation of the obvious nepotism at play uh yeah dad this is ed the man from the fb mr romo brenner cut in this is special agent john brenner of the fbi i believe we met and spoke about security issues a year ago how far away are you sir twenty to twentyfive minutes i remember thats too far sir we need to open the hot lab safe right now to determine its contents you cant open that without hospital approval i dont care who mr romo we have reason to believe the contents of the safe were turned over to people without the interests or safety of the american people in mind we need to open the safe so that we know exactly what is here and what is missing and we cant wait twenty to twentyfive minutes to do it now i have properly identified myself to your son and i have a radiation team in the lab right now we have to move sir now how do we open the safe there was silence from the speakerphone for a few moments then richard romo relented ed i take it you are calling from the desk in the lab yeah okay unlock it and open the bottomleft drawer ed romo rolled his chair back and studied the desk there was a key lock on the upperleft drawer that apparently unlocked all three drawers which key he asked hold on over the speakerphone there was the sound of a key ring being jingled try fourteenfourteen ed romo pulled a key ring off his belt and went through the keys until he found one stamped with the number he then inserted it into the lock on the desk drawer and turned it the bottom drawer was now unlocked and he pulled it open got it okay theres a binder in the drawer open it up and look for the page with the combination lists for the safe room its changed week to week holding the binder in his hands romo started to open it at an angle that would allow only him to see the contents brenner reached across the desk and roughly took the binder from him he opened it on the desk and started leafing through pages of safety protocols where is it he said impatiently to the speakerphone it should be in the final section it will be clearly marked as hot lab combinations there is one catch though we use the previous week the combination for the current week is wrong use last weeks combo brenner found the page and drew his finger down the listing until he found the combination for the previous week okay got it what about the safe inside richard romo answered from his car you will use the key card again and another combination that one i know it doesnt change it is sixsixsix original brenner held his hand out to ed romo give me your key card romo complied and brenner then handed the card to reid okay kyle go brenner ordered the door combo is fivesixoneeightfour and you heard the rest reid turned and pointed to one of the others in hazmat suits itll be tight in there just miller and i go in the leader and his chosen second snapped on their face guards and used the key card and combination to open the safe room door miller carried the radiation monitor and they entered the safe room pulling the door closed behind them you know people go in there all the time and they dont wear space suits ed romo said im happy for them brenner said this situation is a little different dont you think we dont know what may or may not have been let loose in that environment i was just saying romo said defensively then do me a favor and dont say anything son let us do our job bosch watched on the monitor and soon saw a glitch in the security system the camera was mounted overhead but as soon as reid bent down to type the combination into the materials safe he blocked the cameras view of what he was doing bosch knew that even if someone had watched kent when he went into the safe at pm the evening before he could easily have hidden what he was taking less than a minute after going into the safe room the two men in hazmat suits stepped out brenner stood up the men unsnapped their face guards and reid looked at brenner he shook his head the safes empty he said brenner pulled his phone from his pocket but before he could punch in a number reid stepped forward holding out a piece of paper torn from a spiral notebook this was all that was left he said bosch looked over brenners shoulder at the note it was scribbled in ink and difficult to decipher brenner read it out loud i am being watched if i dont do this theyll kill my wife thirtytwo sources cesium god forgive me no choice seven bosch and the federal agents stood silently there was an almost palpable sense of dread hanging in the air in the oncology lab they had just confirmed that stanley kent took thirtytwo capsules of cesium from the safe at saint agathas and then most likely turned them over to persons unknown those persons unknown had then executed him up on the mulholland overlook thirtytwo capsules of cesium bosch said how much damage could that do brenner looked at him somberly we would have to ask the science people but my guess is that it could get the job done he said if somebody out there wants to send a message it would be heard loud and clear bosch suddenly thought of something that didnt fit with the known set of facts wait a minute he said stanley kent s radiation rings showed no exposure how could he have taken all the cesium out of here and not lit up those warning devices like a christmas tree brenner shook his head dismissively he obviously used a pig a what the pig is what they call the transfer device it basically looks like a lead mop bucket on wheels with a secured top of course its heavy and built low to the groundlike a pig so they call it a pig and he could just waltz right in and out of here with something like that brenner pointed at the clipboard on the desk interhospital transfers of radioactive sources for cancer treatment are not unusual he said he signed out one source but then took them all thats what was unusual but who was going to open up the pig and check bosch thought about the indentations he had seen in the floor of the porsches trunk something heavy had been carried in the car and was then removed now bosch knew what it was and it was just one more indication of the worstcase scenario bosch shook his head and brenner thought it was because he was making a judgment about security in the lab let me tell you something the agent said before we came in last year and revamped their security anybody wearing a doctors white coat could have walked right in here and gotten whatever he wanted out of the safe security was nothing i wasnt making a comment on security i was i have to make a call brenner said he moved away from the others and pulled out his cell phone bosch decided to make his own call he pulled out his phone found a corner for privacy and called his partner ignacio its me im just checking in call me iggy harry whats happening with you nothing good kent emptied the safe all the cesium is gone are you kidding me thats the stuff you said could be used to make a dirty bomb thats the stuff and it looks like he turned over enough of it to do the job are you still at the scene yeah and listen ive got a kid here who mightve been a witness what do you mean mightve been a witness who is it a neighbor no its sort of a screwy story you know that house that was supposedly madonnas yeah yeah well she used to own it but doesnt anymore i go up there to knock on the door and the guy who lives there now says he didnt see or hear anythingim getting the same thing at every door i knock on so anyway im leaving when i spot this guy hiding behind these big potted trees in the courtyard i draw down on him and call backup you know thinking maybe hes our shooter from the overlook but thats not what it is turns out its a kidtwenty years old and just off the bus from canada and he thinks madonnas still living in the house hes got a star map that still lists her as living there and hes trying to see her or somethinglike a stalker he climbed over a wall to get into the courtyard did he see the shooting he claims he didnt see or hear anything but i dont know harry im thinking he mightve been stalking madonnas place when the thing went down on the overlook he then hides and tries to wait it out only i find him first bosch was missing something in the story why would he hide why wouldnt he just get the hell out of there we didnt find the body till three hours after the shooting yeah i know that part doesnt make sense maybe he was just scared or thought that if he was seen in the vicinity of the body he might get tagged as a suspect or something bosch nodded it was a possibility you holding him on the trespass he asked yeah i talked to the guy who bought the place from madonna and hell work with us hell press charges if we need him to so dont worry we can hold him and work him with it good take him downtown put him in a room and warm him up you got it harry and ignacio dont tell anybody about the cesium right i wont bosch closed the phone before ferras could tell him to call him iggy again he listened to the end of brenners conversation it was obvious that he wasnt talking to walling his manner and tone of voice was deferential he was talking to a boss according to the log here seven oclock he said that puts the transfer at the overlook at around eight so were talking about a sixandahalfhour lead at this point brenner listened some and then started to speak several times but was repeatedly cut off by the person on the other end of the line yes sir he finally said yes sir were on our way back in now he closed the phone and looked at bosch im going back in on the chopper i have to lead a teleconference debriefing with washington id take you with me but i think youd be better off on the ground chasing the case ill have someone pick up my car later no problem did your partner come up with a witness is that what i heard bosch had to wonder how brenner had picked that up while conducting his own phone conversation maybe but it sounds like a long shot im going downtown to see about that right now brenner nodded solemnly then handed bosch a business card if you get anything give me a call all my information is on that anything at all call bosch took the card and put it in his pocket he and the agents then left the lab and a few minutes later he watched the federal chopper take off into the black sky he got in his car and pulled out of the clinics parking lot to head south before hitting the freeway he gassed up at a station on san fernando road traffic coming down into the center of the city was light and he cruised at a steady eighty he turned the stereo on and picked a cd from the center console without looking at what it was five notes into the first song he knew it was a japanese import from bassist ron carter it was good driving music and he turned it up the music helped bosch smooth out his thoughts he realized the case was shifting the feds at least were chasing the missing cesium instead of the killers there was a subtle difference there that bosch thought was important he knew that he needed to keep his focus on the overlook and not lose sight at any time of the fact that this was a murder investigation find the killers you find the cesium he said out loud when he got downtown he took the los angeles street exit and parked in the front lot at police headquarters at this hour nobody would care that he wasnt a vip or a member of command staff parker center was on its last legs for nearly a decade a new police headquarters had been approved for construction but because of repeated budgetary and political delays the project had only inched toward realization in the meantime little had been done to keep the current headquarters from sliding into decrepitude now the new building was under way but it was an estimated four years from completion many who worked in parker center wondered if it could last that long the rhd squad room on the third floor was deserted when bosch got there he opened his cell phone and called his partner where are you hey harry im at sid im getting what i can so i can start putting the murder book together are you in the office i just got here whered you put the wit ive got him cooking in room two you want to start with him might be good to hit him with somebody he hasnt seen before somebody older it was a delicate suggestion the potential witness was ferrass find bosch wouldnt move in on him without his partners at least tacit approval but the situation dictated that someone with boschs experience would be better conducting such an important interview have at him harry when i get back ill watch in the media room if you need me to come in just give me the signal right i made fresh coffee in the captains office if you want it good i need it but first tell me about the witness his name is jesse mitford from halifax hes kind of a drifter he told me he hitchhiked down here and has been staying in shelters and sometimes up in the hillswhen its warm enough thats about it it was pretty thin but it was a start maybe he was going to sleep up there in madonnas courtyard thats why he didnt split i didnt think about that harry you might be right ill be sure to ask him bosch ended the call got his coffee mug out of his desk drawer and headed to the rhd captains office there was an anteroom where the secretarys desk was located as well as a table with a coffeemaker the smell of freshbrewed coffee hit bosch as he entered and that alone almost gave him the caffeine charge he needed he poured a cup dropped a buck in the basket and then headed back to his desk the squad room was designed with long rows of facing desks so that partners sat across from each other the design afforded no personal or professional privacy most of the other detective bureaus in the city had gone to cubicles with sound and privacy walls but at parker center no money was spent on improvements because of the impending demolition since bosch and ferras were the newest additions to the squad their desk tandem was located at the end of a line in a windowless corner where the air circulation was bad and they would be furthest from the exit in the case of an emergency like an earthquake boschs work space was neat and clean just as he had left it he noticed a backpack and a plastic evidence bag on his partners desk across from him he reached over and grabbed the backpack first he opened it and found it contained mostly clothing and other personal items belonging to the potential witness there was a book called the stand by stephen king and a bag with toothpaste and a toothbrush in it it all amounted to the meager belongings of a meager existence he returned the backpack and reached across for the evidence bag next it contained a small amount of us currency a set of keys a thin wallet and a canadian passport it also contained a folded homes of the stars map that bosch knew was the kind sold on street corners all around hollywood he unfolded it and located the overlook off mulholland drive above lake hollywood just to the left of the location there was a black star with the number in it it had been circled with an ink pen he checked the maps index and star number said madonnas hollywood home the map had obviously not been updated with madonnas movements and bosch suspected that few of the star locations and their attendant celebrity listings were accurate this explained why jesse mitford had been stalking a house where madonna no longer lived bosch refolded the map put all the property back in the evidence bag and returned it to his partners desk he then got a legal pad and a rights waiver out of a drawer and stood up to go to interview room which was located in a hallway off the back of the squad room jesse mitford looked younger than his years he had curly dark hair and ivorywhite skin he had a stubble of chin hair that looked like it might have taken him his whole life to grow he had silver rings piercing one nostril and one eyebrow he looked alert and scared he was seated at a small table in the small interview room the room smelled of body odor mitford was sweating which of course was the object bosch had checked the thermostat in the hallway before coming in ferras had set the temperature in the interview room to eightytwo jesse how are you doing bosch asked as he took the empty seat across from him uh not so good its hot in here really are you my lawyer no jesse im your detective my names harry bosch im a homicide detective and i am working the overlook case bosch put both his legal pad and his coffee mug down on the table he noticed that mitford still had handcuffs on it was a nice touch by ferras to keep the kid confused scared and worried i told the mexican detective i didnt want to talk anymore i want a lawyer bosch nodded hes cuban american jesse he said and you dont get a lawyer lawyers are for us citizens only this was a lie but bosch was banking on the twentyyearolds not knowing this youre in trouble kid he continued its one thing to be stalking an old girlfriend or boyfriend its something else with a celebrity this is a celebrity town in a celebrity country jesse and we take care of our own i dont know what youve got up there in canada but the penalties here for what you were doing tonight are pretty stiff mitford shook his head as if he could ward off his problems that way but i was told that she doesnt even live there anymore madonna i mean so i wasnt really stalking her then it would just be trespassing now bosch shook his head its about intent jesse you thought she might be there you had a map that said she was there you even circled the spot so as far as the law goes that constitutes stalking a celebrity then why do they sell maps to stars homes and why do bars have parking lots when drunk driving is illegal were not going to play that game jesse the point is theres nothing on the map that says anything about it being okay to jump over a wall and trespass you know what i mean mitford dropped his eyes to his manacled wrists and sadly nodded tell you what though bosch said you can cheer up because things arent as bad as they seem youve got stalking and trespassing charges here but i think we can probably get this all fixed up and taken care of if you agree to cooperate with me mitford leaned forward but like i told that mexithat cuban detective i didnt see anything bosch waited a long moment before responding i dont care what you told him youre dealing with me now son and i think youre holding back on me no im not i swear to god he held his hands open and as wide as the cuffs allowed in a pleading gesture but bosch wasnt buying it the kid was too young to be a liar capable of convincing bosch he decided to go right at him let me tell you something jesse my partner is good and hes going places in the department no doubt about that but right now hes a baby hes been a detective for about as long as youve been growing that peach fuzz on your chin me ive been around and that means ive been around a lot of liars sometimes i think all i know are liars and jesse i can tell youre lying to me and nobody lies to me no i and so what youve got here is about thirty seconds to start talking to me or im just going to take you down and book you into county lockup im sure theres going to be somebody waiting in there who will have a guy like you singing o canada into the mike before sunup you see thats what i meant about there being stiff penalties for stalking mitford stared down at his hands on the table bosch waited and twenty seconds slowly went by finally bosch stood up okay jesse stand up were going wait wait wait for what i said stand up lets go this is a murder investigation and im not wasting time on all right all right ill tell you i saw the whole thing okay i saw everything bosch studied him for a moment youre talking about the overlook he asked you saw the shooting on the overlook i saw everything man bosch pulled his chair out and sat back down eight bosch stopped jesse mitford from speaking until he signed a rights waiver it didnt matter that he was now considered a witness to the murder that took place on the mulholland overlook whatever it was that he witnessed he saw because he was in the act of committing his own crimetrespassing and stalking bosch had to make sure there were no mistakes on the case no fruitofthepoisontree appeal no blowback the stakes were high the feds were classic secondguessers and he knew he had to do this right okay jesse he said when the waiver form was signed you are going to tell me what you saw and heard up on the overlook if you are truthful and helpful i am going to drop all charges and let you walk out of here a free man technically bosch was overstating his hand he had no authority to drop charges or make deals with criminal suspects but he didnt need it in this case because mitford had not yet been formally charged with anything therein lay boschs leverage it came down to semantics what bosch was really offering was to not proceed with charging mitford in exchange for the young canadians honest cooperation i understand mitford said just remember only the truth only what you saw and heard nothing else i understand hold up your hands mitford raised his wrists and bosch used his own key to remove his partners handcuffs mitford immediately began to rub them to get circulation going again it reminded bosch of seeing rachel rub alicia kents wrists earlier feel better he asked yeah good mitford replied okay then lets start from the top tell me where you came from where you were going and exactly what you saw up on the overlook mitford nodded and then took bosch through a twentyminute story that began on hollywood boulevard with the purchase of the star map from a curbside vendor and his long trek on foot up into the hills his journey took nearly three hours and probably accounted most for the odor emanating from his body he told bosch that by the time he got up to mulholland drive it was getting dark and he was tired the house where the map said madonna lived was dark inside no one appeared to be home disappointed he decided to rest from his long journey and to wait and see if the pop singer he wanted to meet would arrive home later he found a spot behind some bushes where he could lean back against the exterior of the wall that surrounded the home of his quarryhe didnt use that wordand wait mitford said he fell asleep there until something woke him up what woke you up bosch asked voices i heard voices what was said i dont know it was just what woke me up how far were you from the overlook i dont know like fifty meters i think i was pretty far away what was said after you were awake and could hear nothing they stopped all right then what did you see when you woke up i saw three cars parked by the clearing one was a porsche and the other two were bigger i dont know the kind but they were sort of the same did you see the men on the overlook no i didnt see anybody it was too dark out there but then i heard a voice again and it was coming from over there in the dark it was like a yell right at the moment i looked there were two quick flashes and shots like muffled shots i could see somebody in the clearing on his knees you know in the flash of light but it was so quick that was all i saw bosch nodded this is good jesse youre doing good lets just go over this part again so we have it right you were asleep and then voices woke you up and you looked out and saw the three cars do i have that right yes okay good then you heard a voice again and you looked toward the overlook just then the shots were fired is all of that right right bosch nodded but he knew that mitford might be simply telling bosch what he wanted to hear he had to test the kid to make sure that wasnt happening now you said that in the flash from the gun you saw the victim drop to his knees is that right no not exactly then tell me exactly what you saw i think he was on his knees already it was so fast i wouldnt have seen him drop to his knees like you said i think he was already kneeling bosch nodded mitford had passed the first test okay good point now lets talk about what you heard you said you heard somebody yell right before the shots right right okay what did that person yell the young man thought for a moment and then shook his head im not sure okay thats all right we dont want to say anything were not sure about lets try an exercise and see if that helps close your eyes what just close your eyes bosch said think about what you saw try to bring up the visual memory and the audio will follow you are looking at the three cars and then a voice pulls your attention toward the overlook what did the voice say bosch spoke calmly and soothingly mitford followed his instructions and closed his eyes bosch waited im not sure the young man finally said i cant get it all i think he was saying something about allah and then he shot the guy bosch held perfectly still for a moment before responding allah you mean the arabic word allah im not sure i think so what else did you hear nothing else the shots cut it off you know he started yelling about allah and then the shots drowned the rest out you mean like allah akbar is that what he yelled i dont know i just heard the allah part could you tell if he had an accent an accent i couldnt tell i only heard the one thing british arabic i really couldnt tell i was too far away and i only heard the one word bosch thought about this for a few moments he remembered what he had read about the cockpit recordings from the attacks the terrorists called out allah akbargod is greatestat the last moment did one of stanley kent s killers do the same again he knew he had to be careful and thorough much of the investigation could hinge on the one word mitford thought he had heard from the overlook jesse what did detective ferras tell you about this case before he put you in this room the witness shrugged he didnt tell me anything really he didnt tell you what we think were looking at here or what direction the case may be going no none of that bosch looked at him for a few moments okay jesse he finally said what happened next after the shots somebody ran from the clearing to the cars there was a streetlight out there and i saw him he got into one of the cars and he backed it up close to the porsche then he popped the trunk and got out the porsches trunk was already open where was the other man while he did this mitford looked confused i guess he was dead no i mean the second bad guy there were two bad guys and one victim jesse three cars remember bosch held up three fingers as a visual aid i only saw one bad guy mitford said the shooter somebody else stayed in the car that was behind the porsche but he never got out he just stayed in that other car the whole time thats right in fact right after the shooting that car made a uturn and drove away and the driver never got out the whole time he was at the overlook not while i was looking bosch thought about this for a moment what mitford had described indicated a real division of labor between the two suspects this mirrored the description of events that alicia kent had given earlier one man questioning her and then translating and giving orders to the second bosch assumed it was the english speaker who had remained in the car at the overlook okay he finally said go back to the story jesse you said that right after the shooting one guy drives away while the other backs up closer to the porsche and pops the trunk then what happened he got out and took something from the porsche and put it in the other cars trunk it was really heavy and he had a hard time with it it looked like it had handles on the sides because of the way he was holding it bosch knew that he was describing the pig used to transport radioactive materials then what he just got back in the car and drove off he left the trunk open on the porsche and you saw nobody else nobody else i swear describe the man you did see i cant really describe him he was wearing a sweatshirt with the hood up i never really saw his face or anything i think that under the hood he was wearing a ski mask too why do you think that mitford shrugged again i dont know it just seemed that way to me i might be wrong was he big was he small i think he was average maybe a little short what did he look like bosch had to try again it was important but mitford shook his head i couldnt see him he insisted im pretty sure he had a mask bosch didnt give up white black middle eastern i couldnt tell he had the hood and the mask and i was so far away think about the hands jesse you said there were handles on the thing he transferred from one car to the other could you see his hands what color were his hands mitford thought for a moment and his eyes brightened no he wore gloves i remember the gloves because they were those real big kind like the guys wear who work on the trains back in halifax heavyduty with the big cuffs so they dont get burned bosch nodded he had been fishing for one thing but got something else protective gloves he wondered if they were gloves specifically designed for handling radioactive material he realized that he had forgotten to ask alicia kent if the men who entered her house had worn gloves he hoped that rachel walling had covered all the details again when she was left with her bosch paused there sometimes the silences are the most uneasy moments for a witness they start to fill in the blanks but mitford said nothing after a long moment bosch continued okay we had two cars up there besides the porsche describe the car that backed up to the porsche i cant really i know what porsches look like but i couldnt tell about the other cars both were a lot bigger like with four doors lets talk about the one in front of the porsche was it a sedan i dont know the brand no a sedan is a type of car not a brand four doors trunklike a police car yes like that bosch thought about alicia kents description of her missing car do you know what a chrysler three hundred looks like no what color was the car you saw i dont know for sure but it was dark black or dark blue what about the other car the one that was behind the porsche same thing a dark sedan it was different from the one in frontmaybe a little bit smaller ehbut i dont know what kind it was sorry the boy frowned as though it was a personal failing that he didnt know the makes and models of cars its all right jesse youre doing fine bosch said youve been very helpful do you think if i showed you photos of various sedans you could pick out the cars no i didnt see them enough the lighting on the street wasnt good and i was too far away bosch nodded but was disappointed he considered things for a moment mitfords story matched up with information provided by alicia kent the two intruders to the kent house had to have had transportation to get there one would have taken the original vehicle while the other took alicia kents chrysler to transport the cesium with it seemed like the obvious thing his thoughts prompted a new question for mitford which way did the second car go when he drove off he also made a uturn and drove down the hill and that was it that was it what did you do then me nothing i just stayed where i was why i was scared i was pretty sure i had just seen some guy get murdered you didnt go check on him to see if he was alive and needed help mitford looked away from bosch and shook his head no i was afraid im sorry its okay jesse you dont have to worry about that he was already dead he was dead before he hit the ground but what im curious about is why you stayed in hiding for so long why didnt you go down the hill why didnt you call nineoneone mitford raised his hands and dropped them on the table i dont know i was afraid i guess i followed the map up the hill so that was the only way i knew back i would have had to walk right by there and i thought what if the cops come while im walking right there i could get blamed and i thought if it was like the mafia or something that did it and they found out i had seen everything then id be killed or something bosch nodded i think you watch too much american tv up there in canada you dont have to worry well take care of you how old are you jesse twenty so what were you doing at madonnas house isnt she a little old for you no it wasnt like that it was for my mother you were stalking her for your mother im not a stalker i just wanted to get my mother her autograph or see if she had a picture or something i could have i wanted to send something back to my mom and i dont have anything you know just to show her im okay i thought if i told her i had met madonna then i wouldnt feel like such a you know i grew up listening to madonna because my mom listens to her stuff i just thought it would be kind of cool to send her something her birthdays coming up and i didnt have anything whyd you come to la jesse i dont know it just seemed like the place to go i was hoping i could get in a band or something but its looking like most people come here with their band already i dont have one bosch thought mitford had adopted the pose of the wandering troubadour but there had been no guitar or other mobile instrument with his backpack in the squad room are you a musician or a singer i play the guitar but i had to pawn it a few days ago ill get it back where are you staying i dont really have a place right now i was going to sleep up in the hills last night i guess its the real answer to why i didnt leave after i saw what happened to that guy up there i really didnt have anyplace to go bosch understood jesse mitford was no different from a thousand others who got off the bus every month or thumbed it into town more dreams than plans or currency more hope than cunning skill or intelligence not all of those who fail to make it stalk those who do but the one thing they all share is that desperate edge and some never lose it even after their names are put up in lights and they buy houses on top of the hills lets take a break here jesse bosch said i need to make a few phone calls and then well probably need to go over it all again you cool with that ill also see about maybe getting you a hotel room or something mitford nodded think about the cars and the guy you saw jesse we need you to remember more details im trying but i he didnt finish and bosch left him there in the hallway bosch switched on the air conditioning in the interview room and set it at sixtyfour it would soon cool off in the room and instead of sweating mitford would start to get coldthough coming from canada maybe not after he chilled for a while bosch would take another run at him and see if anything new came out he checked his watch it was almost am and the case meeting the feds were organizing was not for another four hours there was a lot to do but he still had some time to work with mitford the first round had been productive there was no reason for him not to think there was more to be gained by a second go at it out in the squad room bosch found ignacio ferras working at his desk he was turned in his seat and was typing on his laptop on a slideout table bosch noticed that mitfords property had been replaced on the desk by other evidence bags and file folders it was everything from sid that the case had spawned so far on the two crime scenes harry sorry i didnt get back in there to watch ferras said anything new from the kid were getting there im just taking a break ferras was thirty years old and had an athletes body on his desk was the trophy awarded him for being his academy classs top achiever in physical conditioning and testing he was also handsome with mocha skin and shortcropped hair he had piercing green eyes bosch stepped over to his own desk to use the phone he was going to wake up lieutenant gandle one more time to give him another update you track the vics gun yet he asked ferras yeah i got it off the atf computer he bought a twentytwocaliber belly gun six months ago smith and wesson bosch nodded a twentytwo fits he said no exit wounds bullets check in but they dont check out ferras delivered the line like a television commercial huckster and laughed at his own joke bosch thought about what was lying beneath the humor stanley kent had been warned that his profession made him vulnerable his response was to purchase a gun for protection and now bosch was betting that the gun hed bought had been used against him had been used to kill him by a terrorist who called out the name of allah as he pulled the trigger what a world it was bosch thought when someone could draw the courage to pull the trigger on another man by calling out to his god not a good way to go ferras said bosch looked across the two desks at him let me tell you something he said you know what you find out on this job no what that there are no good ways to go nine bosch went to the captains office to refill his coffee mug when he reached into his pocket for another buck for the basket he came out with brenners card and it reminded him of brenners request to be updated on the possibility of a witness but bosch had just finished updating lieutenant gandle on what the young canadian said he had seen and heard at the overlook and together they had decided to keep mitford under wraps for the time being until at least the am meeting when it would be putup or shutup time with the feds if the federal powers that be were going to keep the lapd involved in the investigation it would become clear at that meeting then it would be quid pro quo time bosch would share the witnesss story in exchange for a share of the investigation meantime gandle said he would send another update through the departments chain of command with the latest revelation of the word allah cropping up in the investigation it was incumbent upon him to make sure the growing gravity of the case was communicated upward with his mug full he went back to his desk and started going through the evidence collected from the murder scene and the house where alicia kent had been held while her husband did the bidding of her captors he was already aware of most of what had been found at the murder scene he started removing stanley kent s personal belongings from the evidence bags and examining them at this stage they had been processed by forensics and it was okay to handle them the first item was the physicists blackberry bosch was not adept in a digital world and readily acknowledged this he had mastered his own cell phone but it was a basic model that made and received calls stored numbers in a directory and did nothing elseas far as he knew this meant that he was quite lost as he tried to manipulate the higherevolution device harry you need help with that bosch looked up and saw ferras smiling at him bosch was embarrassed by his lack of technological skill but not to the point where he wouldnt accept help that would turn his personal flaw into something worse you know how to work this sure it has email right it should bosch had to get up to hand the phone across both of their desks about six oclock yesterday kent was sent an email that was marked urgent from his wife it had the photo in it of her tied up on their bed i want you to find it and see if there is a way you can somehow print it out with the photo i want to look at the photo again but bigger than on that little screen as bosch had been speaking ferras had already been working the blackberry no problem he said what i can do is just forward the email to my own email account here then ill open it up and print it out ferras started using his thumbs to type on the phones tiny keyboard it looked like some sort of childs toy to bosch like the ones he had seen kids use on planes he didnt understand why people were always typing feverishly on their phones he was sure it was some sort of warning a sign of the decline of civilization or humanity but he couldnt put his finger on the right explanation for what he felt the digital world was always billed as a great advancement but he remained skeptical okay i found it and sent it ferras said itll probably come through in a couple minutes and i will print it what else does that show what calls he made and what calls came in ferras didnt answer he manipulated the controls on the phone how far back do you want to go he asked for now how about going back till about noon yesterday bosch replied okay im on the screen you want me to show you how to use this thing or do you want me to just give you the numbers bosch got up and came around the row of desks so he could look over his partners shoulder at the phones small screen just give me an overview for now and well run the whole picture down later he said if you tried to teach me wed be here forever ferras nodded and smiled well he said if he made or received a call to or from a number that was in his address book it is listed by the name associated with the number in the address book got it it shows a lot of calls to and from the office and various hospitals and address book namesprobably doctors he worked withall through the afternoon three calls are marked barry and i am assuming that was his partner i looked up the state corporate records online and k and k medical physicists is owned by kent and someone named barry kelber bosch nodded yeah he said that reminds me that we have to talk to the partner first thing this morning bosch leaned across ferrass desk to reach the notepad on his own desk he then wrote the name barry kelber down while ferras was continuing to scroll through the cell phones call log now here we are after six and he starts alternately calling his home and his wifes cell phone i get the feeling that these werent answered because hes got ten calls logged in three minutes he was calling and calling and these were all made after he received that urgent email from his wifes account bosch saw the picture beginning to fill in a little bit kent had a routine day on the job handled a lot of calls to and from people and places familiar to him and then got the email from his wifes account he saw the photo attached and started calling home she didnt answer which only alarmed him further finally he went out and did what the email instructed him to do but for all his efforts and following of orders they still killed him on the overlook so what went wrong he asked out loud what do you mean harry up at the overlook i still dont understand why they killed him he did what they wanted he turned over the stuff what went wrong i dont know maybe they killed him because he saw one of their faces the witness says the shooter was wearing a mask well then maybe nothing went wrong maybe the plan was to kill him all along they made that silencer remember and the way the guy yells out allah doesnt make it sound like something went wrong makes it sound like part of a plan bosch nodded then if that was the plan why kill him and not her why leave a witness i dont know harry but dont those hardcore muslims have a rule about hurting women like it keeps them out of nirvana or heaven or whatever they call it bosch didnt answer the question because he didnt know about the cultural practices his partner had crudely referred to but the question underlined for him how out of his element he was on the case he was used to chasing killers motivated by greed or lust or any one of the big seven sins religious extremism wasnt often on the list ferras put the blackberry down and turned back to his computer like many detectives he preferred to use his own laptop because the computers provided by the department were old and slow and most of them carried more viruses than a hollywood boulevard hooker he saved what he had been working on and opened up his email screen the email forwarded from kent s account was there ferras opened the email and whistled when he saw the embedded photograph of alicia kent naked and tied up on the bed yeah that would do it he said meaning that he understood why kent had turned over the cesium ferras had been married for less than a year and had a baby on the way bosch was just starting to get to know his young partner but knew already that he was deeply in love with his wife under the glass top of his desk ferras had a collage of photos of his bride under the glass on his side of the workstation bosch had photos of murder victims whose killers he was still looking for make me a printout of that bosch said blow it up if you can and go ahead and keep playing with that phone see what else you can find bosch went back to his side of the workstation and sat down ferras enlarged and printed out the email and photo on a color printer located at the back of the squad room he went over and retrieved it and then brought it to bosch bosch already had his reading glasses on but from a desk drawer he pulled a rectangular magnifying glass hed bought when he noticed that his prescription was no longer strong enough for the closeup work he never used the magnifying glass when the squad room was crowded with detectives he didnt want to give the others something to ridicule him witheither in jest or not he put the printout down on his desk and leaned over it with the magnifier he first studied the bindings that held the womans limbs behind her torso the intruders had used six snap ties placing one loop around each wrist and ankle then one to link the ankles and the last one to link the wrist loops to the loop connecting the ankles it seemed like an overly complicated way to bind the womans extremities it was not the way bosch would have done it if he were trying to quickly hogtie a perhaps struggling woman he would have used fewer bindings and made the work easier and quicker he wasnt sure what this meant or if it meant anything at all perhaps alicia kent hadnt struggled at all and in return for her cooperation her captors used the extra links in order to make the time she was left bound on the bed less difficult it seemed to bosch that the way she had been bound meant that her arms and legs were not pulled behind her as far as they could have been still remembering the bruising on alicia kents wrists he realized that no matter what the time she had spent hogtied naked on the bed had not been easy he decided that the only thing he knew for sure from studying the photo was that he needed to talk with alicia kent again and go over what had happened in more exacting detail on a fresh page of his notebook he wrote down his questions about the bindings he planned to use the rest of the page to add more questions in preparation for an eventual followup interview with her nothing else came to mind during his study of the photograph when he was finished he put the magnifier aside and started skimming through the forensics reports from the murder scene nothing grabbed his attention there either and he quickly moved on to the reports and evidence from the kent house because he and brenner had quickly left the house for saint agathas bosch had not been there when the sid techs searched for evidence left behind by the intruders he was anxious to see what if anything had been found but there was only one evidence bag and it contained the black plastic snap ties that had been used to bind alicia kents wrists and ankles and that rachel walling had cut in order to free her wait a minute bosch said holding up the clear plastic bag is this the only evidence they bagged at the kent house ferras looked up its the only bag they gave me did you check the evidence log it should be in there maybe theyre still processing some stuff bosch looked through the documents ferras had obtained until he found the forensic evidence log every item removed from a crime scene by the technicians was always entered on the log it helped track the chain of evidence he found the log and noticed that it included several items removed by technicians from the kent house most of them tiny hair and fiber specimens this was to be expected though there was no telling if any of the specimens was related to the suspects but in all his years working cases bosch had yet to come across the immaculate crime scene plain and simple it was a basic law of nature that when a crime takes place it always leaves its markno matter how smallon the environment there is always a transfer it is just a matter of finding it on the list each snap tie had been individually entered and these were followed by numerous hair and fiber specimens extracted from locations ranging from the master bedroom carpet to the sink trap in the guest bathroom the mouse pad from the office computer was on the list as well as a nikon cameras lens cap which had been found beneath the bed in the master bedroom the last entry on the list was the most interesting to bosch the evidence was simply described as a cigarette ash bosch could not think what value as evidence a cigarette ash could be is anybody still up there in sid from the kent house search he asked ferras there was a half hour ago ferras answered buzz yates and the latents woman whose name i always forget bosch picked up the phone and called the sid office scientific investigation division yates buzz just the guy i wanted to talk to whos this harry bosch on the search of the kent house tell me about this cigarette ash you collected oh yeah that was a cigarette that had burned down to just the ash the fbi agent who was there asked me to collect it where was it she found it on top of the toilet tank in the guest bedroom like somebody had put their smoke down while they took a leak and then forgot about it it burned all the way through and then out so it was just ashes when she found it right a gray caterpillar but she wanted us to collect it for her she said their lab might be able to do something with wait a minute buzz you gave her the evidence well sort of yeah she what do you mean sort of you either did or you didnt did you give agent walling the cigarette ashes you collected from my crime scene yes yates conceded but not without a lot of discussion and assurances harry she said the bureaus science lab could analyze the ashes and determine the type of tobacco which would then allow them to determine country of origin we cant do anything like that harry we cant even touch that she said it would be important to the investigation because they might be dealing with terrorists from outside the country so i went along with it she told me that once she worked an arson case where they found a single ash from the cigarette that lit the fire they were able to tell what brand and that tied it to a specific suspect and you believed her well yeah i believed her so you gave her my evidence bosch said it in a resigned tone harry its not your evidence we all work and play on the same team dont we yeah buzz we do bosch hung up the phone and cursed ferras asked him what was wrong but bosch waved the question away just typical bureau bullshit harry did you get any sleep at all before the call out bosch looked across the desks at his partner he knew exactly where ferras was headed with that question no bosch answered i was awake but lack of sleep has nothing to do with my frustration with the fbi ive been doing this for more years than youve been alive i know how to handle sleep deprivation he held his mug of coffee up cheers he said its still not good partner ferras responded your ass is going to be dragging in a while dont worry about me okay harry bosch went back to thoughts about the cigarette ash what about photos he asked ferras did you pick up photos from the kent house yeah theyre here somewhere ferras looked through the files on his desk and came up with the folder containing the photos and passed it across bosch looked through them and found three shots from the guest bathroom a full shot an angled shot of the toilet that showed the line of ash on the tank lid and a closeup of the gray caterpillar as buzz yates had called it he spread the three shots out and used his magnifier once again to study them in the closeup shot of the ash the photographer had put a sixinch ruler down on the tank lid to give the shot scale the ash was almost two inches long almost a full cigarette see anything yet sherlock ferras asked bosch looked up at him his partner was smiling bosch didnt smile back deciding that now he couldnt even use the magnifying glass in front of his own partner without getting ripped not yet watson he said he thought that might keep ferras quiet nobody wanted to be watson he studied the shot of the toilet and noted the seat had been left up the indication was that a male had used the bathroom to urinate the cigarette ash would further indicate that it had been one of the two intruders bosch looked at the wall above the toilet there was a small framed photograph of a winter scene the leafless trees and steelgray sky made bosch think of new york or somewhere else in the east the photo prompted bosch to remember a case he had closed a year ago while he was still in the openunsolved unit he picked up the phone and called sid again when yates answered bosch asked for the person who checked the kent house for latent fingerprints hold on yates said apparently still annoyed with bosch from the earlier phone call yates took his time getting the latents tech to the phone bosch ended up holding for about four minutes using his glass to go over the photos from the kent house the whole time this is wittig a voice finally said bosch knew her from prior cases andrea its harry bosch i want to ask you about the kent house what do you need did you laser the guest bathroom of course where they found the ash and the seat was up yes i did that anything no nothing it was wiped how about the wall up above the toilet yes i checked there too there was nothing thats all i wanted to know thanks andrea have a good one bosch hung up and looked at the photo of the ash something about it bugged him but he wasnt sure what harry what were you asking about the wall over the toilet bosch looked at ferras part of the reason the young detective was partnered with bosch was so that the experienced detective could mentor the inexperienced detective bosch decided to put the sherlock holmes crack aside and tell him the story about thirty years ago there was a case in wilshire this woman and her dog found drowned in her bathtub the whole place had been wiped clean but the lid was left up on the toilet that told them they were looking for a man the toilet had been wiped but on the wall up behind it they found a palm print the guy had taken a leak and leaned on the wall while doing it by measuring the height of the palm they were able to figure out the guys height they also knew he was lefthanded how because the print on the wall was a right palm they figured a guy holds his tool with his preferred hand while taking a leak ferras nodded in agreement so they matched the palm to a suspect yeah but only after thirty years we cleared it last year in openunsolved not a lot of palms in the data banks back then my partner and i came across the case and sent the palm through the box we got a hit we traced the guy to ten thousand palms in the desert and went out there to get him he pulled a gun and killed himself before we could make the arrest wow yeah i always thought it was weird you know what him killing himself no not that i thought it was kind of weird that we traced his palm to ten thousand palms oh yeah ironic so you didnt get a chance to talk to him not really but we were sure it was him and i sort of took his killing himself in front of us as an admission of guilt no yeah of course i just mean i wouldve liked to talk to the guy and ask him why he killed the dog thats all bosch stared at his partner for a moment i think if we had talked we would have been more interested in why he killed the woman yeah i know i was just wondering why the dog you know i think he thought the dog might be able to identify him like the dog knew him and would react in his presence he didnt want to risk it ferras nodded like he accepted the explanation bosch had just made it up the question about the dog had never come up during the investigation ferras went back to his work and bosch leaned back in his chair and considered things about the case at hand at the moment it was a jumble of thoughts and questions and once again most prominent in his mind was the basic question of why stanley kent was killed alicia kent said the two men who held her captive had worn ski masks jesse mitford said he thought the man he saw kill kent on the overlook was wearing a ski mask to bosch this begged the questions why shoot stanley kent if he couldnt even identify you and why wear the mask if the plan all along was to kill him he supposed that wearing the mask could have been a ploy to falsely reassure kent and to make him cooperative but that conclusion didnt feel right to him either once more he put the questions aside deciding that he didnt have enough information yet to properly go at them he drank some coffee and got ready to take another shot at jesse mitford in the interview room but first he pulled out his phone he still had rachel wallings number from the echo park case he had decided never to delete it he pushed the button and called the number preparing for it to have been disconnected by her the number was still good but when he heard her voice it was a recording telling him to leave a message after the beep its harry bosch he said i need to talk to you about things and i want my cigarette ashes back that crime scene was mine he hung up he knew the message would annoy her maybe even make her mad he knew that he was inextricably heading toward a confrontation with rachel and the bureau that probably wasnt necessary and could easily be avoided but bosch couldnt bring himself to roll over not even for rachel and the memory of what they once had not even for the hope of a future with her that he still carried like a number in a cell phones heart ten bosch and ferras stepped out the front door of the mark twain hotel and surveyed the morning the light was just beginning to enter the sky the marine layer was coming in gray and thick and was deepening the shadows in the streets it made it look like a city of ghosts and that was fine with bosch it matched his outlook you think hell stay put ferras asked bosch shrugged hes got no place else to go he said they had just checked their witness into the hotel under the alias stephen king jesse mitford had turned into a valuable asset he was boschs ace in the hole though he had not been able to provide a description of the man who shot stanley kent and took the cesium mitford had been able to give the investigators a clear understanding of what had transpired at the mulholland overlook he would also be useful if the investigation ever led to an arrest and trial his story could be used as the narrative of the crime a prosecutor could use him to connect the dots for the jury and that made him valuable whether or not he could id the shooter after bosch had consulted with lieutenant gandle it was decided that they shouldnt lose track of the young drifter gandle approved a hotel voucher that would keep mitford in the mark twain for four days by then things would be clearer in regard to which way the case was going to go bosch and ferras got into the crown victoria that ferras had earlier checked out of the car shed and headed down wilcox to sunset bosch was behind the wheel at the light he got out his cell phone he hadnt heard back from rachel walling so he called the number her partner had given him brenner answered right away and bosch proceeded cautiously just checking in he said we still on for the meeting at nine bosch wanted to make sure he was still part of the investigation before updating brenner on anything uh yes yes were still on for the meeting but its been pushed back till when i think its ten now well let you know the answer didnt make it sound like the meeting with the locals was a done deal he decided to press brenner where will it be at tactical bosch knew from working with walling before that the tactical unit was off campus in a secret location he wanted to see if brenner would slip no in the federal building downtown fourteenth floor just ask for the tiu meeting how helpful was the witness bosch decided to hold his cards close until he had a better idea of his standing he saw the shooting from a distance then he saw the transfer he said one man did it all killed stanley kent and then moved the pig from the porsche to the back of another vehicle the other guy waited in another car and just watched you get any plates from him no no plates mrs kent s car was probably the one used to make the transfer that way there would be no cesium trace in their own car what about the suspect he did see like i said he couldnt id him he was still wearing a ski mask other than that nada there was a pause before brenner responded too bad he said what did you do with him the kid we just dropped him off wheres he live halifax canada bosch you know what i mean bosch noticed the change in tone that and the use of his last name he didnt think brenner was casually asking about jesse mitfords exact location hes got no local address he replied hes a drifter we just dropped him off at the dennys on sunset thats where he wanted to go we gave him a twenty to cover breakfast bosch felt ferras staring at him as he lied can you hold a second harry brenner said ive got another call coming in here it might be washington back to first names bosch noted sure jack but i can just go no hold on bosch heard the line go to music and he looked over at ferras his partner started to speak whyd you tell him we bosch held a finger to his lips and ferras stopped just hold it a second bosch said half a minute went by while bosch waited a saxophone version of what a wonderful world started to play on the phone bosch had always loved the line about the dark sacred night the light finally changed and bosch turned onto sunset then brenner came back on the line harry sorry about that that was washington as you can imagine theyre all over this thing bosch decided to draw things out into the open whats new on your end not a lot homeland is sending a fleet of choppers with equipment that can track a radiation trail theyll start up at the overlook and try to pick up a signature specific to cesium but the reality is its got to come out of the pig before theyll pick up a signal meantime were organizing the status meeting so that we can make sure everybodys on the same page thats all the big g has accomplished well were just getting organized i told you how it would be alphabet soup right you called it pandemonium the feds are good at that no im not sure i said all of that but theres always a learning curve i think after the meeting well be hitting this thing on all cylinders bosch now knew for sure that things had changed brenners defensive response told him the conversation was either being taped or overheard by others its still a few hours till the meeting brenner said whats your next move harry bosch hesitated but not for long my next move is to go back up to the house and talk to mrs kent again i have some followup then well go over to the south tower at cedars kent s office is there and we need to see it and to talk to his partner there was no response bosch was coming up on the dennys on sunset he pulled into the lot and parked through the windows he could see that the twentyfourhour restaurant was largely deserted you still there jack uh yeah harry im here i should tell you that it probably wont be necessary you going back to the house and then by kent s office bosch shook his head i knew it he thought youve already scooped everybody up havent you wasnt my call anyway from what i hear the office was clean and we have kent s partner in here being questioned right now we brought mrs kent in as kind of a precautionary thing were still talking to her too not your call then whose call was it rachels im not going to get into that harry bosch killed the cars engine and thought about how to respond well then maybe my partner and i should head downtown to tiu he finally said this is still a homicide investigation and last i heard i was still working it there was a long thread of silence before brenner responded look detective the case is taking on larger dimensions you have been invited to the status meeting you and your partner and at that time you will be updated on what mr kelber has had to say and a few other things if mr kelber is still here with us i will do my best to get you in to speak with him and with mrs kent too but to be clear the priority here is not the homicide the priority is not finding out who killed stanley kent the priority is finding the cesium and were now almost ten hours behind bosch nodded i have a feeling that if you find the killer you find the cesium he said that may be so brenner responded but the experience is that this material is moved very quickly hand to hand it takes an investigation with a lot of velocity thats what were engaged in now building velocity we dont want to be slowed down by the local yokels you know what i mean sure ill see you at ten agent brenner bosch closed his phone and started to get out as he and ferras crossed the lot to the restaurants doors his partner barraged him with questions why did you lie to him about the wit harry whats going on what are we doing here bosch held his hands up in a calming motion hold on ignacio just hold on lets sit down and have some coffee and maybe something to eat and ill tell you what is going on they almost had their pick of the place bosch went to a booth in a corner that would allow them a clear view of the front door the waitress came over quickly she was an old battleax with her steelgray hair in a tight bun working graveyard at a dennys in hollywood had leached the life out of her eyes harry its been a long time she said hey peggy i guess its been a while since ive had to chase a case through the night well welcome back what can i get you and your much younger partner bosch ignored the dig he ordered coffee toast and eggsover medium well ferras ordered an eggwhite omelet and a latte when the waitress smirked and told him that neither could be accomplished he settled for scrambled eggs and regular coffee as soon as the waitress left them alone bosch answered ferrass questions were being cut out he said thats whats going on here are you sure how do you know because theyve already scooped up our victims wife and partner and i can guarandamntee you they are not going to let us talk to them harry did they say that did they tell you that we couldnt talk to them theres a lot at stake here and i think youre being a little paranoid youre jumping to am i well wait and see partner watch and learn were still going to the meeting at nine arent we supposedly except now its at ten and it will probably be a dog and pony show just for us theyre not going to tell us anything theyre going to sweettalk us and brush us aside thanks a lot fellas well take it from here well fuck that this is a homicide and nobody not even the fbi brushes me off a case have a little faith harry i have faith in myself thats it ive been on this road before i know where it goes on the one hand who cares let them run with the case but on the other hand i care i cant trust them to do it right they want the cesium i want the bastards who terrorized stanley kent for two hours and then forced him down on his knees and put two slugs in the back of his head this is national security harry this is different theres a greater good here you know the good of the order it sounded to bosch like ferras was quoting from an academy textbook or the code of some sort of secret society he didnt care he had his own code the good of the order starts with that guy lying dead on the overlook if we forget about him then we can forget about everything else nervous about debating his partner ferras had picked up the salt shaker and was manipulating it in his hand spilling salt on the table nobodys forgetting harry its about priorities i am sure that when things shake out during the meeting they will share any information relating to the homicide bosch grew frustrated he was trying to teach the kid something but the kid wasnt listening let me tell you something about sharing with the feds bosch said when it comes to sharing information the fbi eats like an elephant and shits like a mouse i mean dont you get it there will be no meeting they put that out there so we would stay in line until nine and now ten all the while thinking were still part of the team but then well show up there and theyll delay it again and then theyll delay it again until they finally trot out with some organizational chart thats supposed to make us feel like were part of everything when the reality is were part of nothing and theyve run out the back door ferras nodded as though he was taking the advice to heart but then he spoke from somewhere else i still dont think we should have lied to them about the witness he might be very valuable to them something he told us might fit with something they know about already whats the harm in telling them where he is maybe they take a shot at him and get something we didnt who knows bosch emphatically shook his head no fucking way not yet the wit is ours and we dont give him up we trade him for access and information or we keep him for ourselves the waitress brought their plates and looked from the salt spilled on the table to ferras and then bosch i know hes young harry but cant you teach him some manners im trying peggy but these young people dont want to learn i hear you she left the table and bosch immediately dug into his food holding a fork in one hand and a piece of toast in the other he was starved and had a feeling theyd be on the move soon when they would next have time for a meal was anybodys guess he was halfway through his eggs when he saw four men in dark suits walk in with unmistakable federal purpose in their strides wordlessly they split into twos and started walking through the restaurant there were less than a dozen diners in the place most of them strippers and their boyfriend pimps heading home from four oclock clubs hollywood night crawlers fueling the engine before putting it to sleep bosch calmly continued to eat and watched the men in suits stop at each table show credentials and ask for ids ferras was too busy splashing hot sauce on his eggs to notice what was happening bosch got his attention and nodded toward the agents most of the people scattered among the tables were too tired or buzzed to do anything but comply with the demands to show identification one young woman with a z shaved into the side of her head started giving one pair of agents some lip but she was a woman and they were looking for a man so they ignored her and waited patiently for her boyfriend with the matching z to show some id finally a pair of agents came to the table in the corner their creds identified them as fbi agents ronald lundy and john parkyn they ignored bosch because he was too old and asked ferras for his id who are you looking for bosch asked thats government business sir we just need to check some ids ferras opened his badge wallet on one side it had his photo and police id and on the other side his detectives badge it seemed to freeze the two agents its funny bosch said if youre looking at ids that means you have a name but i never gave agent brenner the witnesss name makes me wonder you guys over there in tactical intelligence dont happen to have a bug in our computer or maybe our squad room do you lundy the one obviously in charge of the pickup detail looked squarely at bosch his eyes were as gray as gravel and you are he asked you want to see my id too i havent passed for a twentyyearold in a long time but ill take it as a compliment he pulled out his badge wallet and handed it to lundy unopened the agent opened it and examined the contents very closely he took his time hieronymus bosch he said reading the name on the id wasnt there some sick creep of a painter named that or have i got it confused with one of the bottomfeeders ive read about in the overnights bosch smiled back at him some people consider the painter a master of the renaissance period he said lundy dropped the badge wallet on boschs plate bosch hadnt finished his eggs yet but luckily the yolks were overcooked i dont know what the game is here bosch wheres jesse mitford bosch picked up his badge wallet and used his napkin to clean egg debris off it he took his time put the wallet away and then he looked back up at lundy whos jesse mitford lundy leaned down and put both hands on the table you know damn well who he is and we need to take him in bosch nodded as though he understood the situation perfectly we can talk about mitford and everything else at the meeting at ten right after i interview kent s partner and his wife lundy smiled in a way that carried no friendliness or humor you know something pal youre going to need a renaissance period yourself when this is all over bosch smiled again see you at the meeting agent lundy in the meantime were eating can you go bother somebody else bosch picked up his knife and started spreading strawberry jam from a little plastic container on his last piece of toast lundy straightened up and pointed at boschs chest you better be careful bosch with that he turned and headed toward the door he signaled to the other team of agents and pointed toward the exit bosch watched them go thanks for the headsup he said eleven the sun was still below the ridgeline but dawn had a full grip on the sky in daylight the mulholland overlook showed no sign of the violence of the night before even the debris usually left behind at a crime scenerubber gloves coffee cups and yellow tapehad somehow been cleaned up or maybe had blown away it was as if stanley kent had not been shot to death his body never left on the promontory with the jetliner view of the city below bosch had investigated hundreds of murders during his time with the badge he never got over how quickly the city seemed to heal itselfat least outwardlyand move on to act as though nothing had ever happened bosch kicked at the soft orange ground and watched the dirt drop over the edge into the brush below he made a decision and headed back toward the car ferras watched him go what are you going to do ferras asked im going in if youre coming get in the car ferras hesitated and then trotted after bosch they got back in the crown vic and drove over to arrowhead drive bosch knew that the feds had alicia kent but he still had the key ring from her husbands porsche the fed car they had spotted when they had driven by ten minutes earlier was still parked in front of the kent house bosch pulled into the driveway got out and headed with purpose to the front door he ignored the car in the street even when he heard its door open he managed to find the right key and get it into the lock before they were hit with a voice from behind fbi hold it right there bosch put his hand on the knob do not open that door bosch turned and looked at the man approaching on the front walkway he knew that whoever was assigned to watch the house would be the lowest man on the tactical intelligence totem pole a screwup or an agent with baggage he knew he could use this to his advantage lapd homicide special he said were just going to finish up in here no youre not the agent said the bureau has taken over jurisdiction of this investigation and will be handling everything from here on out sorry man i didnt get the memo bosch said if youll excuse us he turned back to the door do not open that door the agent said again this is a national security investigation now you can check with your superiors bosch shook his head you may have superiors i have supervisors whatever youre not going into that house harry ferras said maybe we bosch waved a hand and cut him off he turned back to the agent let me see some id he said the agent put an exasperated look on his face and dug out his creds he flipped them open and held them out bosch was ready he grabbed the agent by the wrist and pivoted the agents body came forward and past him and bosch used a forearm to press him face first against the door he pulled his handstill clutching his credentialsbehind his back the agent started struggling and protesting but it was too late bosch leaned his shoulder into him to keep him against the door and slipped his free hand under the mans jacket he found and jerked the handcuffs off the agents belt and started cuffing him up harry what are you doing ferras yelled i told you nobodys pushing us aside once he had the agents hands cuffed behind him he grabbed the credentials out of his hand he opened them and checked the name clifford maxwell bosch turned him around and shoved the creds into the side pocket of his jacket your career is over maxwell said calmly tell me about it bosch said maxwell looked at ferras you go along with this and youre in the toilet too he said you better think about it shut up cliff bosch said the only one who is going to be in the toilet is you when you go back to tactical and tell them how you let two of the local yokels get the drop on you that shut him up bosch opened the front door and walked the agent in he roughly pushed him down into a stuffed chair in the living room have a seat he said and shut the fuck up he reached down and opened up maxwells jacket so he could see where he carried his weapon his gun was in a pancake holster under his left arm he would not be able to reach it with his wrists cuffed behind his back bosch frisked the agents lower legs to make sure he wasnt carrying a throwdown satisfied he stepped back relax now he said we wont be long bosch started down the hallway signaling his partner to follow him you start in the office and ill start in the bedroom he instructed were looking for anything and everything well know it when we see it check the computer anything unusual i want to know about it harry bosch stopped in the hallway and looked at ferras he could tell that his young partner was running scared he let him have his say even though they were still within earshot of maxwell we shouldnt be doing it this way ferras said how should we be doing it ignacio do you mean we should be going through channels have our boss talk to his boss grab a latte and wait for permission to do our job ferras pointed down the hallway toward the living room i understand the need for speed he said but do you think hes going to let this go hes going to have our badges harry and i dont mind going down in the line of duty but not for what we just did bosch admired ferras for saying we and that gave him the patience to calmly step back and put a hand on his partners shoulder he lowered his voice so maxwell would not hear him from the living room listen to me ignacio not one thing is going to happen to you because of this not one thing okay ive been around a little longer than you and i know how the bureau works hell my exwife is exbureau okay and the one thing i know better than anything is that the numberone fbi priority is not to be embarrassed that is a philosophy they teach them at quantico and it seeps into the bones of every agent in every field office in every city do not embarrass the bureau so when we are done here and we cut that guy loose hes not going to tell a single soul what we did or that we were even here why do you think they had him sitting on the house because hes fbeinstein uhuh hes working off an embarrassmenteither to himself or the bureau and hes not going to do or say a thing that brings him any more heat bosch paused to allow ferras to respond he didnt so lets just move quickly here and check out the house bosch continued when i was here this morning it was all about the widow and dealing with her and then we had to run out the door to saint aggys i want to take my time but be quick you know what i mean i want to see the place in daylight and grind the case down for a while this is how i like to work youd be surprised what you come up with sometimes the thing to remember is that theres always a transfer those two killers left their mark somewhere in this house and i think sid and everybody else missed it theres got to be a transfer lets go find it ferras nodded okay harry bosch clapped him on the shoulder good ill start in the bedroom you check the office bosch moved down the hallway and was to the threshold of the bedroom when ferras called his name again bosch turned and went back down the hallway to the office alcove his partner was standing behind the desk wheres the computer ferras asked bosch shook his head in frustration it was on the desk they took it the fbi who else it wasnt on the sid log only the mouse pad just look around go through the desk see what else you can find were not taking anything were just looking bosch went down the hall to the master bedroom it appeared to be undisturbed since he had last seen it there was still a slight odor of urine due to the soiled mattress he walked over to the night table on the left side of the bed he saw black fingerprint powder dusted across the knobs on the two drawers and its flat surfaces on top of the table were a lamp and a framed photograph of stanley and alicia kent bosch picked up the photo and studied it the couple was standing next to a rosebush in full bloom alicia had dirt smudged on her face but was smiling broadly as if she were standing proudly next to her own child bosch could tell that the rosebush was hers and in the background he could see others just like it farther up the hillside were the first three letters of the hollywood sign and he realized the photo was probably taken in the backyard of the house there would be no more pictures of the happy couple like this bosch put the photo down and slid open the tables drawers one by one they were full of personal items belonging to stanley various reading glasses books and prescription bottles the lower drawer was empty and bosch remembered that it was the place where stanley had kept his gun bosch closed the drawers and stepped into the corner of the room on the other side of the table he was looking for a new angle some sort of fresh take on the crime scene he realized that he needed the crime scene photos and he had left them in a file in the car he walked down the hallway toward the front door when he got to the living room he saw maxwell lying on the floor in front of the chair he had been placed in he had managed to move his handcuffed wrists down over his hips his knees were bent up with his wrists cuffed behind them he looked up at bosch with a red and sweating face im stuck maxwell said help me out bosch almost laughed in a minute he walked out the front door and went to the car where he retrieved the files containing the sid crime scene reports and photos he had put the copy of the emailed photo of alicia kent in there as well as he walked back into the house and headed toward the hallway to the rear rooms maxwell called out to him come on help me out man bosch ignored him he walked down the hallway and glanced into the home office as he passed ferras was going through the drawers of the desk stacking things he wanted to look at on top of it in the bedroom bosch got the email photo out and put the files down on the bed he held the photo up so he could compare it to the room he then went to the mirrored closet door and opened it at an angle that matched the photograph he noticed in the photo the white terrycloth robe draped over a lounge chair in the corner of the room he stepped into the closet and looked for the robe found it and put it in the same position on the lounge chair bosch moved to the place in the room from which he believed the email photo had been taken he scanned the room hoping something would poke through and speak to him he noticed the dead clock on the bed table and then checked it against the email photo the clock was dead in the photo too bosch walked over to the table crouched and looked behind it the clock was unplugged he reached behind the table and plugged it back in the digital screen started flashing in red numerals the clock worked it just needed to be set bosch thought about this and knew it would be something to ask alicia kent about he assumed the men who were in the house had unplugged the clock the question was why perhaps they didnt want alicia kent to know how much or how little time had gone by while she waited tied up on the bed bosch put the clock issue aside and moved to the bed where he opened one of the files and took out the crime scene photographs he studied these and noticed that the closet door was open at a slightly different angle from the one in the email photo and that the robe was gone obviously because alicia kent had put it on after her rescue he stepped over to the closet matched the doors angle to the one in the crime scene photograph and then stepped back to the door and scanned the room nothing broke through the transfer still eluded him he felt discomfort in his gut he felt as though he was missing something something that was right there in the room with him failure brings pressure bosch checked his watch and saw that the federal meetingif there was actually going to be onewas to begin in less than three hours he left the bedroom and made his way down the hall toward the kitchen stopping in each room and checking closets and drawers and finding nothing suspicious or amiss in the workout room he opened a closet door and found it lined with musty coldweather clothes on hangers the kents had obviously migrated to la from colder climes and like most people who came from somewhere else they refused to part with their winter gear nobody ever knew for sure how much of la they could take it was always good to be ready to run he left the contents of the closet untouched and closed the door before leaving the room he noticed a rectangular discoloration on the wall next to the hooks where rubber workout mats hung there were slight tape marks indicating that a poster or maybe a large calendar had been taped to the wall when he got to the living room maxwell was still on the floor redfaced and sweating from struggling he now had one leg through the loop created by his cuffed wrists but he apparently couldnt get the other through in order to bring his hands to the front of his body he was lying on the tiled floor with his wrists bound between his legs he reminded bosch of a fiveyearold holding himself in an effort to maintain bladder control were almost out of here agent maxwell bosch said maxwell didnt respond in the kitchen bosch went to the back door and stepped out onto a rear patio and garden seeing the yard in daylight changed his perspective it was on an incline and he counted four rows of rosebushes going up the embankment some were in bloom and some werent some relied on support sticks that carried markers identifying the different kinds of roses he stepped up the hillside and studied a few of these then returned to the house after locking the door behind him he walked across the kitchen and opened another door which he knew led to the adjoining twocar garage a bank of cabinets stretched along the back wall of the garage one by one he opened them and surveyed the contents there were mostly tools for gardening and household chores and several bags of fertilizer and soil nutrients for growing roses there was a wheeled trash can in the garage bosch opened it and saw one plastic trash bag in it he pulled it out loosened the pull strap and discovered it contained what appeared to be only basic kitchen trash on top was a cluster of paper towels that were stained purple it looked like someone had cleaned up a spill he held one of the towels up and smelled grape juice on it after returning the trash to the container bosch left the garage and ran into his partner in the kitchen hes trying to get loose ferras said of maxwell let him try are you finished in the office just about i was wondering where you were go finish up and well be out of here after ferras was gone bosch checked the kitchen cabinets and the walkin pantry and studied all the groceries and supplies stacked on the shelves after that he went to the guest bathroom in the hall and looked at the spot where the cigarette ash had been collected on the white porcelain tank top there was a brown discoloration about half the length of a cigarette bosch stared at the mark curious it had been seven years since he had smoked but he didnt remember ever leaving a cigarette to burn like that if he had finished it he would have thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away it was clear that this cigarette had been forgotten with his search complete he stepped back into the living room and called to his partner ignacio you ready were leaving maxwell was still on the floor but looked tired from his struggle and resigned to his predicament come on damn it he finally cried out uncuff me bosch stepped close to him wheres your key he asked coat pocket left side bosch bent over and worked his hand into the agents coat pocket he pulled out a set of keys and fingered through them until he found the cuff key he grabbed the chain between the two cuffs and pulled up so he could work the key in he wasnt gentle about it now be nice if i do this he said nice im going to kick your fucking ass bosch let go of the chain and maxwells wrists dropped to the floor what are you doing maxwell yelled undo me heres a tip cliff next time you threaten to kick my ass you might want to wait until after ive cut you loose bosch straightened up and tossed the keys onto the floor on the other side of the room uncuff yourself bosch headed to the front door ferras was already going through it as bosch was pulling it closed he looked back at maxwell sprawled on the floor the agents face was as red as a stop sign as he sputtered one last threat in boschs direction this isnt over asshole got it bosch closed the door when he got to the car he looked over the roof at his partner ferras looked as mortified as some of the suspects who had ridden in the backseat cheer up bosch said as he got in he had a vision of the fbi agent crawling in his nice suit across the living room floor to the keys bosch smiled twelve on the way back down the hill to the freeway ferras was silent and bosch knew he had to be thinking about the jeopardy his young and promising career had been placed in because of his old and reckless partners actions bosch tried to draw him out of it well that was a bust he said i got nada you find anything in the office nothing much i showed you the computer was gone there was a sullen tone in his voice what about the desk bosch asked it was mostly empty one drawer had tax returns and stuff like that another had a copy of a trust their house an investment property in laguna insurance policies everything like that is held in a trust their passports were in the desk too got it how much the guy make last year a quarter million takehome he also owns fiftyone percent of the company the wife make anything no income doesnt work bosch grew quiet as he contemplated things when they got down off the mountain he decided not to get on the freeway instead he took cahuenga to franklin and turned east ferras was looking out the passengerside window but quickly noticed the detour whats going on i thought we were going downtown were going to los feliz first whats in los feliz the donut hole on vermont we just ate an hour ago bosch checked his watch it was almost eight and he hoped he wasnt too late im not going for the doughnuts ferras cursed and shook his head youre going to talk to the man he asked are you kidding unless i missed him already if youre worried about it you can stay in the car youre jumping about five links in the chain you know lieutenant gandle is going to have our asses for this hell have my ass you stay in the car it will be like you werent even there except what one partner does the other always gets equal blame for you know that thats how it works thats why they call them partners harry look ill take care of it theres no time to go through proper channels the chief should know what is what and im going to tell him hell probably end up thanking us for the headsup yeah well lieutenant gandle wont be thanking us then ill deal with him too the partners drove the rest of the way in silence the los angeles police department was one of the most insular bureaucracies in the world it had survived for more than a century by rarely looking outward for ideas answers or leaders a few years earlier when the city council decided that after years of scandal and community upset it required leadership from outside the department it was only the second time in the lapds long history that the position of chief of police was not filled by promoting from within the ranks subsequently the outsider who was brought in to run the show was viewed with tremendous curiosity not to mention skepticism his movements and habits were documented and the data was all dumped into an informal police pipeline that connected the departments ten thousand officers like the blood vessels in a closed fist the intelligence was passed around in roll calls and locker rooms text messages to and from patrol car computers emails and phone calls at cop bars and backyard barbecues it meant street officers in south la knew what hollywood premiere the new chief had attended the night before vice officers in the valley knew where he took his dress uniforms to be pressed and the gang detail in venice knew what supermarket his wife liked to shop at it also meant that detective harry bosch and his partner ignacio ferras knew what doughnut shop the chief stopped at for coffee every morning on his way into parker center at am bosch pulled into the parking lot of the donut hole but saw no sign of the chiefs unmarked car the business was an aptly named establishment in the flats below the hillside neighborhoods of los feliz bosch killed the engine and looked over at his partner you staying ferras was looking straight ahead through the windshield he nodded without looking at bosch suit yourself bosch said listen harry no offense but this isnt working you dont want a partner you want a gofer and somebody who doesnt question anything you do i think im going to talk to the lieutenant about hooking me up with someone else bosch looked at him and composed his thoughts ignacio its our first case together dont you think you should give it some time thats all gandles going to tell you hes going to tell you that you dont want to start out in rhd with a reputation as a guy who cuts and runs on his partner im not cutting and running its just not working right ignacio youre making a mistake no i think it would be best for both of us bosch stared at him for a long moment before turning to the door like i said suit yourself bosch got out and headed toward the doughnut shop he was disappointed in ferrass reaction and decisions but knew he should cut him some slack the guy had a kid on the way and needed to play it safe bosch was not one to ever play it safe and it had lost him more than a partner in the past he would take another shot at changing the young mans mind once the case settled down inside the shop bosch waited in line behind two people and then ordered a black coffee from the asian man behind the counter no doughnut no just coffee cappuccino no black coffee disappointed with the meager sale the man turned to a brewer on the back wall and filled a cup when he turned back around bosch had his badge out has the chief been in yet the man hesitated he had no idea about the intelligence pipeline and was unsure about responding he knew he could lose a highprofile customer if he spoke out of turn its all right bosch said im supposed to meet him here im late bosch tried to smile as though he was in trouble it didnt come out right and he stopped he not here yet the counterman said relieved he hadnt missed him bosch paid for the coffee and put the change in the tip jar he went to an empty table in the corner it was mostly a takeout operation at this time of morning people grabbing fuel on their way into work for ten minutes bosch watched a cross section of the citys culture step up to the counter all united by the addiction to caffeine and sugar finally he saw the black town car pull in the chief was riding in the front passenger seat both he and the driver got out both scanned their surroundings and headed toward the doughnut shop bosch knew the driver was an officer and served as a bodyguard as well there was no line at the counter when they came in hiyou chief the counterman said good morning mr ming the chief responded ill have the usual bosch stood up and approached the bodyguard who was standing behind the chief turned and squared himself in boschs direction bosch stopped chief can i buy you a cup of coffee bosch asked the chief turned and did a double take when he recognized bosch and realized he wasnt a citizen wanting to make nice for a moment bosch saw a frown move across the mans facehe was still dealing with some of the fallout from the echo park casebut then it quickly disappeared into impassivity detective bosch he said youre not here to give me bad news are you more like a headsup sir the chief turned away to accept a cup of coffee and a small bag from ming have a seat he said i have about five minutes and ill pay for my own coffee bosch went back to the same table as the chief paid for his coffee and doughnuts he sat down and waited while the chief took his purchase to another counter and put cream and sweetener into his coffee bosch believed that the chief had been good for the department he had made a few missteps politically and some questionable choices in command staff assignments but had largely been responsible for raising the morale of the rank and file that was no easy task the chief had inherited a department operating under a federal consent decree negotiated in the wake of the fbis rampart corruption probe and myriad other scandals all aspects of operation and performance were subject to review and compliance assessment by federal monitors the result was that the department was not only answering to the feds but was awash in federal paperwork already an undersized department it was hard sometimes to see where any police work was getting done but under the new chief the rank and file had somehow pulled together to get the job done crime stats were even down which to bosch meant there was a good possibility that actual crime was down as wellhe viewed crime statistics with suspicion but all of that aside bosch liked the chief for one overarching reason two years earlier he had given bosch his job back bosch had retired and gone private it didnt take him long to realize it was a mistake and when he did the new chief welcomed him back it made bosch loyal and that was one reason he was forcing the meeting at the doughnut shop the chief sat down across from him youre lucky detective most days i would have been here and gone an hour ago but i worked late last night hitting crime watch meetings in three parts of the city rather than open his doughnut bag and reach in the chief tore it down the middle so he could spread it and eat his two doughnuts off it he had a powderedsugar and a chocolateglazed heres the most dangerous killer in the city he said as he raised the chocolateglazed doughnut and took a bite bosch nodded youre probably right bosch smiled uneasily and tried an icebreaker his old partner kiz rider had just come back to work after recovering from gunshot wounds she transferred out of robberyhomicide to the chiefs office where she had worked once before hows my old partner doing chief kiz kiz is good she does fine work for me and i think shes in the right spot bosch nodded again he did that a lot are you in the right spot detective bosch looked at the chief and wondered if he might already be questioning his jumping the chain of command before he could work up an answer the chief asked another question are you here about the mulholland overlook case bosch nodded he assumed that the word had gone up the pipe from lieutenant gandle and that the chief had been briefed in some detail about the case i work out for an hour every morning just so i can eat this stuff the chief said the overnights are faxed to me and i read them on the recumbent bike i know you caught the overlook case and its got federal interest captain hadley also called me this morning he said there is a terrorism angle bosch was surprised to learn that captain done badly and the ohs were already in the picture what is captain hadley doing he asked he hasnt called me the usual checking our own intelligence trying to open lines with the feds bosch nodded so what can you tell me detective why did you come here bosch gave him a fuller rundown on the case accenting the federal involvement and what was looking like an effort to shut the lapd out of its own investigation bosch acknowledged that the missing cesium was a priority and true cause for the feds to throw their weight around but he said the case was a homicide and that cut the lapd in he went over the evidence he had collected and laid out some of the theories he had been considering the chief had consumed both doughnuts by the time bosch was finished he wiped his mouth with a napkin and then checked his watch before responding they were well past the five minutes he had initially offered what arent you telling me he asked bosch shrugged not much i just had a little dustup with an agent at the victims house but i dont think anything will come of it why isnt your partner in here why is he waiting in the car bosch understood the chief had seen ferras when he scanned the lot upon his arrival were having a little bit of a disagreement on how to proceed hes a good kid but he wants to roll over for the feds a little too easy and of course we dont do that in the lapd not in my time chief did your partner think it was appropriate to ignore the departments chain of command by coming directly to me with this bosch dropped his eyes to the table the chiefs voice had taken on a stern tone as a matter of fact he wasnt happy about it chief bosch said it wasnt his idea it was mine i just didnt think there was enough time to doesnt matter what you thought its what you did so if i were you i would keep this meeting to yourself and i will as well dont ever do it this way again detective are we clear on that yes clear the chief glanced toward the glass display case where the doughnuts were lined up on trays and by the way how did you know that i would be here he asked bosch shrugged i dont remember i just sort of knew he then realized that the chief might be thinking that boschs source was his old partner it wasnt kiz if thats what you mean chief he said quickly its just something that gets known you know word gets around the department the police chief nodded its too bad he said i liked this place convenient good doughnuts and mr ming takes care of me what a shame bosch realized that the chief would now have to change his routine it did not serve him well if it was known where he could be found and when sorry sir bosch said but if i might make a recommendation theres a place in the farmers market called bobs coffee and doughnuts its a bit out of the way for you but the coffee and doughnuts would be worth it the chief nodded thoughtfully ill keep it in mind now what is it you want from me detective bosch bosch decided that the chief obviously wanted to get down to business i need to take the case where it goes and to do that i need access to alicia kent and her husbands partner a guy named kelber the feds have them both and i think my window of access closed about five hours ago after a pause bosch got to the point of the whole unscheduled meeting thats why im here chief i need access i figure you can get it for me the chief nodded besides my position in the department i sit on the jointterrorism task force i can make some calls raise some hell and probably open the window as i said before we have captain hadleys unit on this already and perhaps he can open up the channels of communication we have been kept out of the loop on these things in the past i can raise the flag put in a call to the director to bosch it sounded like the chief was going to go to bat for him you know what reflux is detective reflux its a condition where all the bile backs up into your throat it burns detective oh what i am telling you is that if i make these moves and i get that window open for you i dont want any reflux you understand me i understand the chief wiped his mouth again and put the napkin down on his torn bag he then crumpled it all into a ball careful not to spill any powdered sugar on his black suit ill make the calls but its going to be tough you dont see the political angle here do you bosch bosch looked at him sir the bigger picture detective you see this as a homicide investigation it is actually much more than that you have to understand that it serves the federal government extremely well with this thing on the overlook being part of a terrorism plot a bona fide domestic threat would go a long way toward deflecting public attention and easing the pressure in other areas the wars gone to shit the election was a disaster youve got the middle east the price of a gallon of gasoline and a lameduck presidents approval ratings the list goes on and on and there would be an opportunity here for redemption a chance to make up for past mistakes a chance to shift public attention and opinion bosch nodded are you saying that they might try to keep this thing going maybe even exaggerate the threat im not saying anything detective i am just trying to broaden your perspective a case like this you have to be aware of the political landscape you cant be running around like a bull in a china shopwhich in the past has been your specialty bosch nodded not only that you have local politics to consider the chief continued you have a man on the city council who lies in wait for me the chief was talking about irvin irving a longtime commander in the department whom the chief had forced out hed run for a city council seat and won he was now the departments and the chiefs harshest critic irving bosch said hes just one vote on the council he knows a lot of secrets its allowed him to start building a political base he sent me a message after the election it was just two words expect me dont turn this into something he can use detective the chief stood up ready to go think about it and be careful he said remember no reflux no blowback yes sir the chief turned and nodded to his driver the man went to the door and held it open for his charge thirteen bosch didnt speak until they were out of the parking lot he decided that by this time of day the hollywood freeway would be overrun by the morning commute and surface streets would be better he believed that sunset was the fastest way downtown ferras only made it two blocks before asking what had happened in the doughnut shop dont worry ignacio we both still have our jobs then what happened he said you were right i shouldnt have jumped command but he said he would make some calls and try to open things up with the feds then i guess well see yeah well see they drove in silence for a while until bosch brought up his partners plan to ask for a new assignment you still going to talk to the lieutenant ferras paused before answering he was uncomfortable with the question i dont know harry i still think it would be best best for both of us maybe you work best with female partners bosch almost laughed ferras didnt know kiz rider his last partner she never went along to get along with harry like ferras she objected every time bosch went alpha dog on her he was about to set ferras straight when his cell phone started buzzing and he pulled it out of his pocket it was lieutenant gandle harry where are you his voice was louder than usual and more urgent he was excited about something and bosch wondered if he had already heard about the donut hole meeting had the chief betrayed him im on sunset were heading in did you pass silver lake yet not yet good head up to silver lake go to the rec center at the bottom of the reservoir whats going on lieutenant the kent cars been located hadley and his people are already out there setting up the cp theyve requested the investigators on scene hadley whys he there why is there a command post hadleys office got the tip and checked it out before deciding to clue us in the car is parked in front of a house belonging to a person of interest they want you on the scene person of interest whats that mean the house is the residence of a person the ohs has an interest in some sort of suspected terrorist sympathizer i dont have all the details just get there harry all right were on the way call me and let me know whats happening if you need me out there just say the word of course gandle didnt really want to leave the office and go to the scene that would set him back on his daily management duties and paperwork bosch closed the phone and tried to pick up speed but the traffic was too thick for him to get anywhere he filled ferras in on what little he knew from the phone call what about the fbi ferras asked what about them do they know i didnt ask what about the meeting at ten i guess well worry about that at ten in ten minutes they finally got to silver lake boulevard and bosch turned north this part of the city took its name from the silver lake reservoir which sat in the middle of the largely middleclass neighborhood of bungalows and postworld war two homes with views of the manmade lake as they approached the recreation center bosch saw two shiny black suvs that he recognized as the signature vehicles of the ohs apparently he thought there was never much trouble getting funding for a unit that supposedly hunted terrorists there were two patrol cars and a city sanitation truck as well bosch parked behind one of the patrol cars and he and ferras got out there was a group of ten men in black fatiguesalso distinctive to the ohsgathered around the folddown rear gate of one of the suvs bosch approached them and ferras trailed a couple of steps behind their presence was immediately noticed and the crowd parted and there was captain don hadley sitting on the gate bosch had never met him but had seen him often enough on television he was a large redfaced man with sandy hair he was about forty years old and looked like he had been in the gym working out for half of them his ruddy complexion gave him the look of someone who had overexerted himself or was holding his breath bosch hadley asked ferras im bosch this is ferras fellas good to have you here i think were going to tie your case up for you in a bow in short order were just waiting on one of my guys to bring the warrant and then we go in he stood up and signaled to one of his men hadley had a definite air of confidence about him perez check on that warrant will you im tired of waiting then check the op and see whats happening up there he then turned back to bosch and ferras walk with me men hadley headed away from the group and bosch and ferras followed he led them to the back of the sanitation truck so he could talk to them away from the cluster of other men the captain adopted a command pose putting his foot up on the back end of the truck and resting his elbow on his knee bosch noticed that he carried his sidearm in a leg holster that was strapped around his thick right thigh like an old west gunslinger except he was carrying a semiautomatic he was chewing gum and not trying to hide it bosch had heard many stories about hadley he now had the feeling that he was about to become part of one i wanted you men to be here for this hadley said what exactly is this captain bosch replied hadley clapped his hands together before speaking weve located your chrysler three hundred approximately two and a half blocks from here on a street bordering the reservoir the plate matches the bolo and i eyeballed the vehicle myself its the car weve been looking for bosch nodded that part was good he thought whats the rest the vehicle is parked in front of a home owned by a man named ramin samir hadley continued hes a guy weve been keeping our eye on for a few years now a real person of interest to us you might say the name was familiar to bosch but he couldnt place it at first why is he of interest captain he asked mr samir is a known supporter of religious organizations that want to hurt americans and damage our interests whats worse than that is that he teaches our young people to hate their own country that last part jogged boschs memory and he put things together he could not recall which middle eastern country he was from but bosch remembered that ramin samir was a former visiting professor of international politics at usc who had gained widespread notice for espousing antiamerican sentiment in the classroom and in the media he was making media ripples before the domestic terrorist attacks afterward the ripples became a wave he openly postulated that the attacks were warranted because of us intrusion and aggression all around the globe he was able to parlay the attention this brought him into a position as the media goto guy for the everready antiamerican quote or sound bite he denigrated us policies toward israel objected to the military action in afghanistan and called the war in iraq nothing more than an oil grab samirs role as agent provocateur was good for a few years of guest shots on the cablenews debate programs where everybody tends to yell at one another he was a perfect foil for both the right and the left and always willing to get up at am to make the sundaymorning programs in the east meantime he used his soapbox and celebrity status to help start and fund a number of organizations on and off campus that were quickly accused by conservative interest groups and in newspaper investigations of being connected at least tangentially to terrorist organizations and antiamerican jihads some even suggested that there were links to the grand master of all terror osama bin laden but while samir was often investigated he was never charged with any crime he was however fired by usc on a technicalityhe had not stated that his opinions were his own and not those of the school when he wrote an oped piece for the los angeles times that suggested the iraq war was an americanplanned genocide of muslims samirs fifteen minutes ran their course he was eventually discounted in the media as a narcissistic provocateur who made outlandish statements in order to draw attention to himself rather than to thoughtfully comment on the issues of the day after all he had even named one of his organizations the ymcafor young muslim cause in americajust so the longestablished youth organization with the same internationally recognized initials would file an attentiongetting lawsuit samirs star waned and he dropped from public sight bosch could not remember the last time he had seen him on the box or in the paper but all the rhetoric aside the fact that samir was never charged with a crime during a period when the climate in the united states was hot with fear of the unknown and the desire for vengeance always indicated to bosch that there was nothing there if there had been fire behind the smoke then ramin samir would be in a prison cell or behind a fence at guantánamo bay but here he was living in silver lake and bosch was skeptical of captain hadleys claims i remember this guy he said he was just a talker captain there was never any solid link between samir and hadley held up a finger like a teacher demanding silence never a solid link established he corrected but that doesnt mean anything this guy raises money for the palestinian jihad and other muslim causes the palestinian jihad bosch asked what is that and what muslim causes are you saying muslim causes cant be legit look all im saying is that this is a bad dude and hes got a car that was used in a murder and zesium heist sitting right in front of his house cesium ferras said it was cesium that was stolen not used to being corrected hadley narrowed his eyes and stared at ferras for a moment before speaking whatever its not going to make much difference what you call it son if he dumps it into the reservoir across the street or is in that house putting it in a bomb while were sitting here waiting on a warrant the fbi didnt say anything about it being a waterborne threat bosch said hadley shook his head doesnt matter bottom line is that its a threat im sure the fbi said that well the bureau can talk about it were going to do something about it bosch stepped back trying to draw some fresh air into the discussion this was moving too quickly so youre going to go in he asked hadley was working his jaw in quick powerful bites of the gum he seemed not to notice the strong odor of garbage emanating from the back of the truck youre damn right were going to go in he said just as soon as that warrant gets here you got a judge to sign a warrant thats based on a stolen car being parked in front of the house bosch asked hadley signaled to one of his men bring the bags perez he called then to bosch he said no thats not all we got todays trash day detective i sent the garbage truck up the street and a couple of my men emptied the two cans that were in front of samirs house perfectly legal as you know and lookee at what we got perez hustled over with the plastic evidence bags and handed them to hadley captain i checked the op perez said still quiet up there thank you perez hadley took the bags and turned back to bosch and ferras perez went back to the suv our observation post is a guy in a tree hadley said with a smile hell let us know if anybody makes a move up there before were ready he handed bosch the bags two of them contained black woolen ski masks the third contained a slip of paper with a handdrawn map on it bosch looked closely at it it was a series of crisscrossing lines with two of them marked as arrowhead and mulholland once he registered these he could tell the map was a fairly accurate rendering of the neighborhood where stanley kent had lived and died bosch handed the bags back and shook his head captain i think you should hold up hadley looked shocked by the suggestion hold up were not holding up if this guy and his pals contaminate the reservoir with that poison do you think the people of this city are going to accept that we held up to make sure we dotted every i and crossed every t were not holding up he underlined his resolve by taking the gum out of his mouth and throwing it into the back of the sanitation truck he took his foot off the bumper and started heading back to his crew but then made a sudden uturn and came back directly to bosch as far as im concerned weve got the leader of a terrorist cell operating out of that house and were going to go in and shut it down whats your problem with that detective bosch its too easy thats my problem its not about us dotting every i because thats what the killers already did this was a carefully planned crime captain they wouldnt have just left the car in front of the house or put this stuff in the trash cans think about it bosch held there and watched hadley work it over for a few moments he then shook his head maybe the car wasnt left there he said maybe they still plan to use it as part of the delivery there are a lot of variables bosch things we dont know were still going in we laid it all out to the judge and he said we have probable cause thats good enough for me weve got a noknock warrant coming and were going to use it bosch refused to give up where did the tip come from captain how did you find the car hadleys jaw started working but then he remembered he had tossed his gum one of my sources he said weve been building an intelligence network in this city for almost four years today its paying off are you telling me you know who the source is or did it come in anonymously hadley waved his hands in a dismissive manner doesnt matter he said the info was good thats the car up there theres no doubt about that he pointed in the direction of the reservoir bosch knew by hadleys sidestepping that the tip was anonymous the hallmark of a setup captain i urge you to stand down he said there is something not right about this its too simple and this wasnt a simple plan its some sort of misdirection and we need to figure were not standing down detective lives could hang in the balance bosch shook his head he wasnt going to get through to hadley the man believed he was poised at the edge of some sort of victory that would redeem every mistake he had ever made wheres the fbi bosch asked shouldnt they be we dont need the fbi hadley said getting in boschs face again we have the training the equipment and the skills whats more we have the balls and for once were going to take care of whats in our own backyard ourselves he gestured to the ground as if the place where he stood was the last battlefield between the bureau and the lapd what about the chief bosch tried does he know i was just bosch stopped remembering the chiefs admonishment about keeping their meeting at the donut hole to themselves you were just what hadley asked i just want to know if he knows and approves the chief has given me full authority to run my unit do you call the chief every time you go out and make an arrest he turned and marched imperiously back to his men leaving bosch and ferras to watch him go uhoh ferras said yeah bosch said bosch stepped away from the back of the foulsmelling sanitation truck and pulled out his phone he scrolled through his directory to rachel wallings name he had just pressed the call button when hadley was there in his face again bosch hadnt heard him coming detective who are you calling bosch didnt hesitate my lieutenant he told me to update him after we got here no cellular or radio transmissions they could be monitoring they who give me the phone captain give me the phone or i will have it taken from you were not going to compromise this operation bosch closed the phone without ending the call if he was lucky walling would answer the call and be listening she might be able to put it together and get the warning the bureau might even be able to triangulate the cell transmission and get to silver lake before things went completely wrong he handed the phone to hadley who then turned to ferras your phone detective sir my wife is eight months pregnant and i need your phone detective you are either with us or against us hadley held his hand out and ferras reluctantly took his phone from his belt and gave it to him hadley marched over to one of the suvs opened the passenger door and put the two phones into the glove box he slammed the compartment shut with authority and looked back at bosch and ferras as if challenging them to try to retrieve their phones the captains attention was then distracted when a third black suv pulled into the lot the driver gave the captain a thumbsup hadley then pointed a finger into the air and started a twirling motion all right everybody he called out we have the warrant and you know the plan perez call air support and get us the eye in the sky the rest of you warriors mount up were going in bosch watched with growing dread as the members of the ohs chambered rounds in their weapons and put on helmets with face shields two of the men began putting on space suits as they had been designated the radiationcontainment team this is crazy ferras said in a whisper charlie dont surf bosch replied what nothing before your time fourteen the slick banked over a thirtyacre rubber plantation and put down in the lz with the usual spinecompressing final drop hari kari bosch bunk simmons ted furness and gabe finley rolled out into the mud and captain gillette was there waiting for them holding his helmet on top of his head so he wouldnt lose it in the rotor wash the chopper labored as it pulled its skids out of the mudit was the first dry day after six days of rainand took off following the line of an irrigation canal back in the direction of iii corps hq walk with me men gillette said bosch and simmons had been in country long enough to have nicknames but furness and finley were fresh and strictly ojtonthejob trainingand bosch knew they were scared shitless this was going to be their first drop and nothing they taught you back at tunnel school in san diego could prepare you for the sights sounds and smells of the real thing the captain led them to a card table set up under the command tent and outlined his plan the tunnel system under ben cat was extensive and needed to be taken out as part of a firstwave attempt to take control of the village above already the casualties from sappers and sneak attacks inside the camp perimeter were mounting the captain explained that he was getting his ass eaten out on a daily basis by iii corps command he didnt mention anything about being bothered by the dead and wounded he was losing they were replaceable but his favor with the colonel at iii corps was not the plan was a simple crimp operation the captain unrolled a map drawn with the aid of villagers who had been in the tunnels he pointed to four separate spider holes and said the four tunnel rats would go down simultaneously and force the vc in the tunnels toward a fifth hole where the warriors of tropic lightning would be on top waiting to massacre them along the way bosch and his fellow rats would set charges and the operation would finish with the implosion of the entire tunnel system the plan was simple enough until they got down there in the darkness and the labyrinth didnt match the map they had studied on the card table under the tent four went down but only one came back up alive tropic lightning got zero kills that day and that was the day that bosch knew the war was lostfor him at least that was when he knew that men of rank often fought battles with enemies that were inside bosch and ferras rode in the backseat of captain hadleys suv perez drove and hadley rode shotgun wearing a radio headset so he could command the operation the vehicles radio speaker was on loud and set to the operations backchannel frequencyone that would not be found listed in any public directories they were third in line in the entourage of black suvs half a block from the target house perez braked to let the other two vehicles move in as planned bosch leaned forward between the front seats so he could see better through the windshield each of the other suvs had four men riding on runners on either side the vehicles picked up speed and then turned sharply toward the samir house one went down the driveway of the small craftsmanstyle bungalow toward the rear yard while the other jumped the curb and crossed the front lawn one of the ohs men lost his grip when the heavy vehicle impacted the curb and he went tumbling across the lawn the others leaped from the runners and moved toward the front door bosch assumed the same thing was happening at the back door he didnt agree with the plan but admired its precision there was a loud popping sound when the front door was breached with an explosive device and almost immediately there was another from the rear all right move up hadley commanded perez as they drove up the radio came alive with reports from inside the house were inside were in the back front room clear we the voice was cut off by the sound of automatic gunfire shots fired weve got shots fired bosch heard more gunfire but not over the radio they were now close enough for him to hear it live perez jammed the suv into park at an angle crossing the street in front of the house all four doors opened at once as they jumped out leaving the doors open behind them and the radio blaring all clear all clear one suspect down we need medical for one suspect down we need medical it was all over in less than twenty seconds bosch ran across the lawn behind hadley and perez ferras was to his left side they entered through the front door with weapons out and up immediately they were met by one of hadleys men above the right pocket of his fatigue shirt was the name peck were clear were clear bosch dropped his weapon to his side but he didnt holster it he looked around it was a sparely furnished living room he smelled the exploded gunpowder and saw blue smoke hanging in the air what have we got hadley demanded one down one in custody peck said back here they followed peck down a short hallway to a room with wovengrass mats on the floor a man bosch recognized as ramin samir was on his back on the floor blood from two chest wounds flowing over a creamcolored robe onto the floor and one of the mats a young woman in a matching robe was lying facedown and whimpering her hands cuffed behind her back bosch saw a revolver on the floor by the open drawer of a small cabinet with lit votive candles on top of it the gun was about eighteen inches from where samir was lying he went for the gun and we took him down peck said bosch looked down at samir he wasnt conscious and his chest was rising and falling in a broken rhythm hes circling the drain hadley said what have we found so far no materials peck said were bringing in the equipment now all right lets get the car checked hadley ordered and get her out of here while two ohs men raised the crying woman up and carried her out of the room like a battering ram hadley headed back out of the house to the curb where the chrysler awaited bosch and ferras followed they looked into the car but didnt touch it bosch noticed that it was unlocked he bent down to look in through the passengerside windows keys are in it he said he pulled a pair of latex gloves from his coat pocket stretched them and put them on lets get a reading on it first bosch hadley said the captain signaled one of his men who was carrying a radiation monitor over the man swept the device over the car and only picked up a few low pops by the trunk we could have something right here hadley said i doubt it bosch said its not here he opened the driverside door and leaned in bosch wait bosch pushed the trunk button before hadley could finish he heard the pneumatic pop and the trunk came open he backed out of the car and walked to the rear the trunk was empty but bosch saw the same four indentations he had seen earlier in the trunk of stanley kent s porsche its gone hadley said looking into the trunk they mustve already made the transfer yeah long before the car was brought here bosch looked hadley squarely in the eyes this was a misdirection captain i told you that hadley moved toward bosch so he could speak without his whole crew hearing him but he was intercepted by peck captain what hadley barked the suspect went code seven then call off the paramedics and call the coroner yes sir the house is clear no materials and the monitors are picking up no signature hadley glanced at bosch and then quickly looked back at peck tell them to check the place again he ordered the fucker went for a gun he had to have been hiding something tear the place apart if you have to especially that roomit looks like a meeting place for terrorists its a prayer room bosch said and maybe the guy went for the gun because he was scared shitless when people came busting through the doors peck hadnt moved he was listening to bosch go hadley ordered tear the fucker apart the material was in a lead container just because you got no reading doesnt mean its not in there peck hustled back to the house and hadley turned his stare to bosch we need forensics to process the car bosch said and i dont have a phone to make the call go get your phone and make the call bosch went back to the suv he watched the woman who had been in the house being placed in the back of the suv parked on the lawn she was still crying and bosch assumed the tears wouldnt stop anytime soon for samir now herself later as he leaned through the door of hadleys suv he realized that the vehicle was still running he turned off the engine then opened the glove compartment and took out the two phones he opened and checked his to see if the call to rachel walling was still connected it wasnt and he didnt know if the call had gone through in the first place when he turned from the door hadley was standing there they were away from the others and no one would hear them bosch if you try to make trouble for this unit i will make trouble for you you understand bosch studied him for a moment before responding sure captain im glad youre thinking about the unit i have connections that go all the way up and right out of this department i can hurt you thanks for the advice bosch started to walk away from him but then stopped he wanted to say something but hesitated what hadley said say it i was just thinking about a captain i once worked for this was a long time ago and in another place he kept making all the wrong moves and his fuckups kept costing people their lives good people so eventually it had to stop that captain ended up getting fragged in the latrine by some of his own men the story was that afterward they couldnt separate his parts from the shit bosch walked away but hadley stopped him whats that supposed to mean is that a threat no its a story and youre calling that guy in there good people let me tell you a guy like that stood up and cheered when the planes hit the buildings bosch kept walking as he answered i dont know what kind of people he was captain i just know he wasnt part of this and he was set up just like you if you figure out who it was who tipped you to the car let me know it might help us bosch walked over to ferras and gave him back his phone he told his partner to remain on the scene to supervise the forensic analysis of the chrysler where are you going harry downtown what about the meeting with the bureau bosch didnt check his watch we missed it call me if sid comes up with anything bosch left him there and started walking down the street toward the recreation center where the car was parked bosch where are you going hadley called youre not done here bosch waved without looking back he kept walking when he was halfway back to the rec center the first tv truck passed him on its way to samirs house fifteen bosch was hoping to get to the federal building downtown before news of the raid on ramin samirs house did he had tried to call rachel walling but got no answer he knew that she might be at the tactical intelligence location but he didnt know where that was he only knew where the federal building was and he was banking on the idea that the growing size and importance of the investigation would dictate that it be directed from the main building and not a secret satellite office he entered the building through the law enforcement door and told the us marshal who checked his id that he was going up to the fbi he took the elevator up to the fourteenth floor and was greeted by brenner as soon as the doors came open the word that bosch was in the building had obviously been sent up from below i thought you got the message brenner said what message that the status conference was canceled i think i shouldve gotten the message as soon as you people showed up there never was going to be a status conference was there brenner ignored the question bosch what do you want i want to see agent walling im her partner anything you want to tell her you can tell me only her i want to talk to her brenner studied him for a moment come with me he finally said he didnt wait for a reply he used a clipon id card to open a door and bosch followed him through they went down a long hallway and brenner threw questions over his shoulder as he walked wheres your partner he asked hes back at the crime scene bosch said it wasnt a lie bosch just neglected to say which crime scene ferras was at besides he added i thought it would be safer for him there i dont want you people leaning on him to get to me brenner suddenly stopped pivoted sharply and was in boschs face do you know what you are doing bosch youre compromising an investigation that could have farreaching implications where is the witness bosch shrugged as if to say his response was obvious wheres alicia kent brenner shook his head but didnt answer wait in here he said ill go get agent walling brenner opened a door that had the number on it and stepped back for bosch to enter as he stepped through the door bosch saw that it was a small windowless interview room similar to the one he had spent time in that morning with jesse mitford bosch was suddenly shoved into the room from behind and he turned just in time to see brenner out in the hallway pulling the door closed hey bosch grabbed for the doorknob but it was too late the door was locked from the outside he pounded twice on it but knew that brenner was not about to open it he turned away and looked at the small space he was confined in similar to those at the lapd the interview room contained only three items of furniture a small square table and two chairs assuming there was a camera somewhere he raised his hand and shot his middle finger into the air he gave his hand a twirl to emphasize the message bosch pulled one of the chairs out and sat down on it backwards ready to wait them out he took his cell phone out and opened it he knew that if they were watching him they wouldnt want him calling out and reporting his situationit could be embarrassing for the bureau but when he looked at the screen there was no signal it was a safe room radio signals could not get out or in leave it to the feds bosch thought they think of everything a long twenty minutes went by and then the door finally opened rachel walling stepped in she closed the door took the chair opposite bosch and quietly sat down sorry harry i was over at tactical what the fuck rachel you people hold cops against their will now she looked surprised what are you talking about what are you talking about bosch repeated in a mocking voice your partner locked me in here it wasnt locked when i came in try it now bosch waved all the bullshit away forget it i dont have time to play games whats going on with the investigation she pursed her lips as if considering how to respond whats going on is that you and your department have been running around like thieves in a jewelry store smashing every goddamn case in sight you cant tell the glass from the diamonds bosch nodded so you know about ramin samir who doesnt its already on imissedit news what happened up there a classa fuckup is what happened we were set up ohs was set up sounds like somebody was bosch leaned across the table but it means something rachel the people who put the ohs onto samir knew who he was and that hed make an easy target they left the kents car right in front of his house because they knew wed end up spinning our wheels it also could have worked as a payback to samir what do you mean all those years he was on cnn fanning the flames he couldve been seen as hurting their cause because he was giving the enemy a face and heightening american anger and resolve bosch didnt get it i thought agitation was one of their tools i thought they loved this guy maybe its hard to say bosch wasnt sure what she was trying to say but when rachel leaned across the table he suddenly could see how angry she was now lets talk about you and how you have been singlehandedly fucking things up since before the car was even found what are you talking about im trying to solve a homicide thats my yes trying to solve a homicide at the possible cost of endangering the entire city with this petty selfish and selfrighteous insistence on come on rachel dont you think i have an idea about what could be at stake here she shook her head not if you are holding back a key witness from us dont you see what you are doing you have no idea where this investigation is headed because youve been busy hiding witnesses and sucker punching agents bosch leaned back clearly surprised is that what maxwell said that i sucker punched him it doesnt matter what he said we are trying to control a potentially devastating situation here and i dont understand why you are making the moves you are making bosch nodded that makes sense he said you shut somebody out of his own investigation and it stands to reason you wont know what he is up to she held her hands up as if to stop an oncoming train okay lets just stop everything right here talk to me harry what is your problem bosch looked at her and then up at the ceiling he studied the upper corners of the room and dropped his eyes back to hers you want to talk lets take a walk outside then we can talk she didnt hesitate okay fine she said lets walk and talk and then youll give me mitford walling got up and moved to the door bosch saw her quickly glance up at an airconditioning grille high on the back wall and it confirmed for him that they were on camera she opened the unlocked door and brenner and another agent were waiting in the hallway were going to take a little walk walling said alone have a great time brenner said well be in here trying to track the cesium maybe save a few lives walling and bosch didnt respond she led him down the hall just as they were at the door to the elevator hall bosch heard a voice from behind him hey buddy he turned just in time to take agent maxwells shoulder in the chest he was driven into the wall and held up against it youre a little outnumbered this time arent you bosch stop walling shouted cliff stop it bosch brought his arm up around maxwells head and was going to pull him down into a headlock but walling waded in and pulled maxwell away and then pushed him back up the hallway cliff get back get away maxwell started moving backwards up the hall he pointed a finger over wallings shoulder at bosch get out of my building motherfucker get out and stay out walling shoved him into the first open office and then closed the door on him by then several other agents had come into the hallway to see what the commotion was about its all over walling announced everybody just go back to work she came back to bosch and pushed him through the door to the elevator you okay only hurts when i breathe son of a bitch that guy is getting out of control they took the elevator down to the garage level and walked from there up an incline and out onto los angeles street she turned right and he caught up they were heading away from the noise of the freeway she checked her watch and then pointed toward an office building of modern design and construction theres decent coffee in there she said but i dont want to take a lot of time it was the new social security administration building another federal building bosch sighed agent maxwell might think thats his too can you drop that please he shrugged im just surprised maxwell even admitted we came back to the house why wouldnt he because i figured he was posted on the house because he was already in the doghouse for being a fuckup why admit that we got the drop on him and have to stay in there longer walling shook her head you dont understand she said first of all maxwell has been wound a little tight lately but no one in tactical intelligence is in the doghouse the work is too important to have any fuckups on the team secondly he didnt care what anyone would think what he did think was that it was important for everyone to know about the way youre fucking things up he tried another direction let me ask you something do they know about you and me over there our history i mean it would be hard for them not to know after echo park but harry never mind all of that that is not important today what is wrong with you weve got enough cesium out there to shut down an airport and you dont seem all that concerned you are looking at this like its a murder yes a man is dead but that isnt what this is about its a heist harry get it they wanted the cesium and now theyve got it and it would help us if maybe we could talk to the only known witness so where is he hes safe wheres alicia kent and wheres her husbands partner theyre safe the partner is being questioned here and were keeping the wife at tactical until we are sure we have everything there is to get from her shes not going to be very helpful she couldnt thats where you are wrong shes already been quite helpful bosch couldnt hold back the look of surprise in his eyes how she said she didnt even see their faces she didnt but she heard a name when they were speaking to each other she heard a name what name she didnt say this before walling nodded and that is why you should turn over your witness we have people who have one expertise getting information from witnesses we can get things that you are unable to get we got them from her we can get them from him bosch felt his face turning red what was the name this master interrogator got from her she shook her head were not trading harry this is a case involving national security youre on the outside and by the way thats not going to change no matter who you get your police chief to call bosch knew then that his meeting at the donut hole had been for nothing even the chief was on the outside looking in whatever name alicia kent gave up it must have lit up the federal scoreboard like times square all ive got is my witness he said ill trade you straight up for the name why do you want the name youre not going to get anywhere near this guy because i want to know she folded her arms across her chest and thought about things for a moment finally she looked at him you first she said bosch hesitated while he studied her eyes six months earlier he would have trusted her with his life now things had changed bosch wasnt so sure i stashed him at my place he said i think you remember where that is she pulled a phone from her blazer pocket and opened it to make a call wait a second there agent walling he said what was the name alicia kent gave you sorry harry we had a deal national security sorry she started punching in a number on her cell bosch nodded he had called it right i lied he said hes not at my place she slapped the phone closed what is with you she asked angrily her voice getting shrill were running more than fourteen hours behind the cesium do you realize it may already be in a device it may already be bosch stepped in close to her give me the name and ill give you the witness all right she pushed him away he knew she was angry with herself for being caught in the lie it was the second time in less than twelve hours she said she heard the name moby okay she didnt think anything about it at the time because she didnt realize it was actually a name she had heard okay who is moby there is a syrian terrorist named momar azim nassar he is believed to be in this country he is known by friends and associates as moby we dont know why but he does happen to resemble the performer named moby who never mind not your generation but you are sure she heard this name yes she gave us the name and i have now given it to you now where is the witness just hold on you already lied to me once bosch pulled out his phone and was about to call his partner when he remembered that ferras would still be at the silver lake crime scene and be unable to provide what he needed he opened the directory on the phone found the number for kiz rider and pushed the call button rider answered immediately boschs number had showed up on caller id hello harry youve been busy today the chief tell you that ive got a few sources whats up bosch spoke while staring at walling and watching the anger darken her eyes i need a favor from my old partner you still carry that laptop with you to work of course what favor can you get the new york times archives on that computer i can all right i have a name i want you to check to see if its been in any stories hold on i have to go online several seconds went by boschs phone started to beep because he was getting another call but he stayed with rider and soon she was ready whats the name bosch put his hand over the phone and asked walling the full name of the syrian terrorist again he then repeated it to rider and waited yeah multiple hits she said going back eight years give me a rundown bosch waited uh just a bunch of stuff from the middle east hes suspected of involvement in a number of abductions and bombings and so on hes connected to al qaeda according to federal sources whats the most recent story say uh lets see its about a bus bombing in beirut sixteen people killed this is january third two thousand four nothing after that does it give any nicknames or aliases um no i dont see anything okay thanks ill call you later wait a minute harry what i have to go listen i just want to tell you be careful out there okay this is a whole different league youre playing in with this okay i got it bosch said i gotta go bosch ended the call and looked at rachel theres nothing in the new york times about this guy being in this country because its not known that is why alicia kents information was so genuine what do you mean you take her word for it that the guys in this country just because she heard a word that might not even be a name she folded her arms she was losing her patience no harry we know hes in this country we have video of him checking out the port of los angeles last august we just didnt get there in time to grab him we believe he was with another al qaeda operative named muhammad elfayed theyve somehow slipped into this countryhell the borders a sieveand who knows what theyve got planned and you think they have the cesium we dont know that but the intelligence on elfayed is that he smokes unfiltered turkish cigarettes and the ashes on the toilet she nodded thats right theyre still being analyzed but the betting in the office is running eight to one that it was a turkish cigarette bosch nodded and suddenly felt foolish about the moves he had been making the information he had held back we put the witness in the mark twain hotel on wilcox he said room threeohthree under the name stephen king cute and rachel what he told us he heard the shooter call out to allah before he pulled the trigger she looked at him with the eyes of judgment as she opened her phone again she pushed a single button and spoke to bosch while waiting for the connection you better hope we get to these people before she cut off when her call was picked up she delivered the information without identifying herself or giving any sort of greeting hes at the mark twain on wilcox room threeohthree go pick him up she closed her phone and looked at bosch worse than judgment he saw disappointment and dismissal in her eyes now i have to go she said id stay away from airports subways and the malls until we find that cesium she turned and left him there bosch was watching her walk away when his phone started to buzz again and he answered without taking his eyes off her it was joe felton the deputy coroner harry ive been trying to reach you whats up joe we just swung by queen of angels to make a pickupsome gangbanger they pulled the plug on after a shooting yesterday in hollywood bosch remembered the case jerry edgar had mentioned yeah bosch knew that the medical examiner wouldnt have called to waste his time there was a reason so were here now and i go into the break room to grab some caffeine and i overhear a couple of paramedics talking about a pickup that they just made they said they just brought in a guy and the er evaluation was ars and it just made me wonder if it could be connected with the guy up on the overlook you know since he was wearing the radiation alert rings bosch calmed his voice joe what is ars acute radiation syndrome the medics said they didnt know what the guy had he was burned and he was puking all over the place they transported him and the er doc said it was a pretty bad exposure harry now the medics are waiting to see if theyre exposed bosch started walking toward rachel walling whered they find this guy i didnt ask but i assume it was somewhere in hollywood if they brought him in here bosch started picking up speed joe i want you to hang up and get somebody from hospital security to watch this guy im on my way bosch clapped the phone closed and began running toward rachel as fast as he could sixteen the traffic on the hollywood freeway was all flowing into downtown at a slow crawl under the laws of traffic physicsthat for every action there is an equal and opposite reactionharry bosch had clear sailing on the northbound lanes out of course this was aided by the siren and flashing lights on his car making what little traffic there was in front of him move quickly to the side and out of the way applied force was another law bosch knew well he had the old crown vic up to ninety and his hands were whiteknuckled on the wheel where are we going rachel walling yelled over the sound of the siren i told you im taking you to the cesium what does that mean it means paramedics just brought a man with acute radiation syndrome into the emergency room at queen of angels well be there in four minutes damn it why didnt you tell me the answer was that he wanted a head start but he didnt tell her this he remained silent while she opened her cell phone and punched in a number she then reached up to the cars roof and flicked off the siren toggle what are you doing bosch exclaimed i need that to i need to be able to talk bosch took his foot off the accelerator and dropped it down to seventy to be safe a moment later her call was connected and bosch listened to her bark commands he hoped it was at brenner and not maxwell divert the team from the mark twain to queen of angels scramble a contamination team and get them there too send backup units and a doe assessment team we have an exposure case that may lead us to the missing materials do it and call me back ill be onsite in three minutes she closed the phone and bosch hit the siren toggle i said four minutes he yelled impress me she yelled back he pinned the accelerator again even though he didnt need to he was confident they would be first to the hospital they were already past silver lake on the freeway and closing in on hollywood but the truth was that any time he could legitimately hit ninety on the hollywood freeway he took advantage there were not many in the city who could say they had done that during daylight hours who is the victim rachel shouted no idea they were silent for a long period bosch concentrated on the driving and his thoughts there were so many things that bothered him about the case soon he had to share them how do you think they targeted him he said what walling replied coming out of her own thoughts moby and elfayed howd they zero in on stanley kent i dont know maybe if this is one of them at the hospital well get to ask bosch let some time go by he was tired of yelling but then he called over another question doesnt it bother you that everything came out of that house what are you talking about the gun the camera the computer they used everything theres coke in liter bottles in the pantry and they tied alicia kent up with the same snap ties she uses to hold her roses up in the backyard doesnt that bother you they had nothing but a knife and ski masks when they went through that door doesnt that bother you at all about this case you have to remember these people are resourceful they teach them that in the camps elfayed was trained in an al qaeda camp in afghanistan he in turn taught nassar they make do with whats available you could say that they took down the world trade center with a couple of airliners or a couple of box cutters its all in how you look at it more important than what tools they have is their relentlessnesssomething i am sure you can appreciate bosch was about to respond but they came up on the exit and he had to concentrate on weaving around the traffic on surface streets in two minutes he finally killed the siren and pulled into the ambulance run at queen of angels felton met them in the crowded emergency room and led the way to the treatment area where there were six er bays a private security cop stood outside one of the curtained spaces and bosch moved forward showing his badge after barely acknowledging the rentacop he split the curtain and moved into the treatment bay alone in the curtained space was the patient a small darkhaired man with brown skin lying beneath a spider web of tubes and wires extending from overhead medical machinery to his limbs chest mouth and nose the hospital bed was encased in a clear plastic tent the man barely took up half the bed and somehow looked like a victim under attack by the apparatus around him his eyes were halflidded and unmoving most of his body was exposed some sort of modesty towel had been taped over his genitals but his legs and torso were visible the right side of his stomach and right hip were covered with blooms of thermal burns his right hand exhibited the same burnspainfullooking red rings surrounding purplish wet eruptions in the skin a clear gel had been spread over the burns but it didnt look like it was helping where is everybody bosch asked harry dont get close walling warned hes not conscious so lets just back out and talk to the doctor before we do anything bosch pointed to the patients burns could this be from the cesium bosch asked it can happen that fast from direct exposure in a concentrated amount yeah it depends on how long the exposure was it looks like this guy was carrying the stuff in his pocket does he look like moby or elfayed no he doesnt look like either one of them come on she stepped back through the curtain and bosch followed she ordered the security man to get the er doctor who was treating the man she flipped open her phone and pushed a single button her call was answered quickly this is legit she said we have a direct exposure we need to set up a command post and a containment protocol here she listened and then answered a question no neither one i dont have an id yet ill call it in as soon as i do she closed the phone and looked at bosch the radiation team will be here inside of ten minutes she said ill be directing the command post a woman in hospital blues walked up to them carrying a clipboard im dr garner you need to stay away from that patient until we know more about what happened to him walling and bosch showed her their credentials what can you tell us walling asked not much at this time hes in full prodromal syndromethe first symptoms of exposure the trouble is we dont know what he was exposed to or for how long that gives us no gray count and without that we dont have a specific treatment protocol were winging it what are the symptoms walling asked well you see the burns those are the least of our problems the most serious damage is internal his immune system is shutting down and hes aspirated most of the lining of his stomach his gi tract is shot we stabilized him but im not holding out a great deal of hope the stress on the body pushed him into cardiac arrest we just had the blue team in here fifteen minutes ago how long is it between exposure and the start of this produrowhatever syndrome bosch asked prodromal it can happen within an hour of first exposure bosch looked at the man beneath the plastic canopy enclosing the bed he remembered the phrase captain hadley had used when samir was dying on the floor of his prayer room hes circling the drain he knew the man on the hospital bed was circling it as well what can you tell us about who he is and where he was found bosch asked the doctor youll have to talk to the paramedics about where he was found garner answered i didnt have time to get into that and all i heard was that he was found in the street he had collapsed and as far as who he is she raised the clipboard and read from the top sheet hes listed as digoberto gonzalves age fortyone theres no address here thats all i know right now walling stepped away pulling her phone out again bosch knew she was going to call in the name have it run through the terrorism databases where are his clothes he asked the doctor wheres his wallet his clothing and all his possessions were removed from the er because of exposure concerns did anybody look through them no sir nobody was going to risk it where was it all taken youll have to get that information from the nursing staff she pointed to a nursing station in the center of the treatment area bosch headed that way the nurse at the desk told bosch that everything from the patient was placed in a medical waste container that was then taken to the hospitals incinerator it was not clear whether this was done in accordance with the hospitals protocol for dealing with contamination cases or out of utter fear of the unknown factors involved with gonzalves wheres the incinerator rather than give him directions the nurse called over the security guard and told him to take bosch to the incinerator room before bosch could go walling called to him take this she said holding out the radiationalert monitor she had taken off her belt and remember we have a radiation team coming dont risk yourself if that goes off you back away i mean it you back away got it bosch put the alert monitor in his pocket he and the guard quickly headed down a hallway and then took a stairway to the basement they then took another hallway that seemed to run at least a block in length to the far side of the building when they got to the incinerator room the space was empty and there appeared to be no active burning of medical waste occurring there was a threefoot canister on the floor its top was sealed with tape that said caution hazardous waste bosch took out his key chain which had a small penknife on it he squatted down next to the canister and cut the security tape in his peripheral vision he noticed the security guard step back maybe you should wait outside bosch said theres no need for both of us to he heard the door close behind him before he finished the sentence he looked down at the canister took a breath and removed the top digoberto gonzalvess clothes had been haphazardly dropped into the container bosch took the monitor walling had given him out of his pocket and waved it over the open canister like a magic wand the monitor remained silent he let his breath out then as smoothly as emptying a wastepaper basket at home he turned the canister upside down and dumped its contents onto the concrete floor he rolled the canister aside and once again moved the monitor in a circular pattern over the clothes there was no alarm gonzalvess clothes had been cut off his body with scissors there were a pair of dirty blue jeans a work shirt tshirt underwear and socks there was a pair of work boots with the laces cut by the scissors as well lying loose on the floor in the middle of the clothing was a small black leather wallet bosch started with the clothing in the pocket of the work shirt were a pen and a tire pressure gauge he found work gloves sticking out of one of the rear pockets of the jeans and then removed a set of keys and a cell phone from the left front pocket he thought about the burns he had seen on gonzalvess right hip and hand but when he opened the right front pocket of the jeans there was no cesium the pocket was empty bosch put the cell phone and keys down next to the wallet and studied what he had on one of the keys bosch saw a toyota insignia now he knew that a vehicle was part of the equation he opened the phone and tried to find the call directory but couldnt figure it out he put it aside and opened the wallet there wasnt much the wallet contained a mexican drivers license with the name and photo of digoberto gonzalves he was from oaxaca in one of the slots he found photos of a woman and three young childrenshots that bosch guessed were taken back in mexico there was no green card or citizenship document there were no credit cards and in the billfold section there were only six dollar bills along with several tickets from pawnshops located in the valley bosch put the wallet down next to the phone stood up and got out his own phone he scrolled the directory until he found wallings cell number she answered his call immediately i checked his clothes no cesium there was no response rachel did you yes i heard i just wish you had found it harry i just wish this could be over me too did anything come through on the name what name gonzalves you called it in right oh right yeah no nothing and i mean nothing not even a drivers license i think it must be an alias ive got a mexican drivers license here i think the guys an illegal she gave that some thought before responding well its believed that nassar and elfayed came in across the mexican border maybe thats the connection maybe this guy was working with them i dont know rachel ive got work clothes here work boots i think this guy harry ive gotta go my team is here all right im heading back up bosch pocketed his phone then gathered the clothing and boots and put them all back in the canister he put the wallet keys and cell phone on top of the clothing and took the canister with him on the long walk back down the hallway to the stairs he pulled out his phone again and called the citys communications center he asked the dispatcher to dig out the details on the paramedic call that had brought gonzalves to queen of angels and was put on hold he got all the way up the steps and back to the er before the dispatcher came back on the line the call you asked about came in at tenohfive from a phone registered to easy print at ninethirty cahuenga boulevard man down in the parking lot fire department paramedics responded from station fiftyfour response time six minutes nineteen seconds anything else whats the nearest cross at that location after a moment the dispatcher told him the cross street was lankershim boulevard bosch thanked her and disconnected the address where gonzalves collapsed was not far from the mulholland overlook bosch realized that almost every location associated with the case so farfrom the murder site to the victims house to ramin samirs house and now to the spot where gonzalves collapsedcould fit on one page of a thomas brothers map book murder cases in la usually dragged him all over the map book but this one wasnt roaming it was staying close bosch looked around the er he noticed that all the people who had been crowding the waiting room before were now gone there had been an evacuation and agents in protective gear were moving about the area with radiation monitors he spotted rachel walling by the nursing station and walked over to her he held out the canister heres the guys stuff she took the canister and put it down on the floor then called over to one of the men in protection gear she told him to take charge of the canister she then looked back at bosch theres a cell phone in there he told her they might be able to get something out of that ill tell them hows the victim doing victim whether hes involved in this or not he is still a victim if you say so hes still out of it i dont know if well ever get the chance to talk to him then im leaving what where im going with you i thought you had to run the cp i passed it off if theres no cesium here im not staying ill stick with you let me just tell some people im leaving to follow a lead bosch hesitated but deep down he knew he wanted her with him ill be out front in the car where are we going i dont know if digoberto gonzalves is a terrorist or just a victim but i do know one thing he drives a toyota and i think i know where well find it seventeen harry bosch knew that the physics of traffic would not work for him in the cahuenga pass the hollywood freeway always moved slowly in both directions through the bottleneck created by the cut in the mountain chain he decided to stay on surface streets and take highland avenue past the hollywood bowl and up into the pass he filled rachel walling in along the way the call for paramedics came from a print shop on cahuenga near lankershim gonzalves must have been in the area when he collapsed the initial call said a man was down in the parking lot im hoping that the toyota he was driving is right there im betting that if we find it we find the cesium the mystery is why he had it and why he was foolish enough to put it in his pocket unprotected walling added youre basing that on him knowing what he had maybe he didnt maybe this isnt what we think it is theres got to be a connection bosch between gonzalves and nassar and elfayed he probably brought them across the border he almost smiled he knew she had used his last name as a term of endearment he remembered how she used to do that and dont forget about ramin samir he said walling shook her head im still thinking he was a red herring she said a misdirection a good one bosch responded it took the mighty captain done badly out of the picture she laughed is that what they call him bosch nodded not to his face of course and what do they call you something tough and hardheaded im sure he glanced over at her and shrugged he thought about telling her that his vietnam nickname was hari kari but that would require further explanation and there wasnt the time right now and this wasnt the place he took the ramp up to cahuenga from highland it ran parallel to the freeway and as soon as he checked he saw that he had been right the traffic over on the freeway was frozen in both directions you know i still had your number in my cells directory he said i guess i never wanted to delete it i was wondering about that when you left me that mean message today about the cigarette ash i dont suppose you kept mine rachel she paused a long moment before answering i think youre still on my phone too harry this time he had to smile even though he was back to being harry with her theres hope after all he thought they were approaching lankershim boulevard to the right it dropped down into a tunnel that went beneath the freeway to the left it ended at a strip shopping center that included the easy print franchise from which the call to paramedics had originated boschs eyes searched the vehicles in the small parking lot looking for a toyota he glided into the leftturn lane and waited to pull into the lot he swiveled in his seat and checked the parking along both sides of cahuenga a quick glance showed no toyotas but he knew that there were many different car models and pickup trucks in the brand if they didnt find the car in the print shop lot then they would have to work the curbside parking looking for it do you have a plate or any description walling asked how about a color no no and no bosch remembered then that she had the habit of asking multiple questions at once he made the turn on yellow and pulled into the lot there were no parking spaces available but he wasnt interested in parking he cruised slowly checking each car there were no toyotas wheres a toyota when you need one he said its got to be in this area somewhere maybe we should check the street walling suggested he nodded and nosed his car into the alley at the end of the parking lot he was going to turn left to turn around and go back to the street but when he checked to see if he was clear on the right he saw an old white pickup truck with a camper shell parked half a block down the alley next to a green trash dumpster the truck was facing them and he couldnt tell what the make of it was is that a toyota he asked walling turned and looked bosch youre a genius she exclaimed bosch turned and drove toward the truck and as he got closer he could see that it was indeed a toyota so could walling she pulled out her phone but bosch reached across and put his hand on it lets just check it out first i could be wrong about this no bosch youre on a roll but she put the phone away bosch pulled slowly past the pickup giving it a onceover he then turned around at the end of the block and came back he stopped his car ten feet behind it there was no plate on the back a cardboard lost tag sign had been put in its place bosch wished he had brought the keys he had found in digoberto gonzalvess pocket they got out and approached the truck coming up on either side of it when he got close bosch noticed that the rear window hatch of the camper shell had been left open a couple of inches he reached forward and pulled it up all the way an airpressure hinge held it open bosch leaned in close to look into the interior it was dark because the truck was parked in shadow and the windows on the shell were darkly tinted harry you have that monitor he pulled her radiation monitor out of his pocket and held it up in his hand as he leaned into the darkness of the trucks cargo hold no alarm sounded he leaned back out and put the monitor on his belt he then reached in to the latch and lowered the trucks rear gate the back of the truck was piled with junk there were empty bottles and cans strewn everywhere a leather desk chair with a broken leg scrap pieces of aluminum an old water cooler and other debris and there by the raised wheel well on the right side was a lead gray container that looked like a small mop bucket on wheels there he said is that the pig i think it is walling said excitedly i think it is there was no warning sticker on it or radiationalert symbol they had been peeled off bosch leaned into the truck and grabbed one of the handles he pulled it clear of the debris around it and rolled it to the tailgate the top was latched in four places do we open it and make sure the stuff is in there he asked no walling said we back off and call in the team they have protection she pulled her phone out again while she called for the radiation team and backup units bosch moved to the front of the truck he looked through the window and into the cab he saw a halfeaten breakfast burrito sitting on a flattened brown bag on the center console and he saw more junk on the passenger side his eyes held on a camera that was sitting on an old briefcase with a broken handle on the passenger seat the camera didnt appear broken or dirty it looked brandnew bosch checked the door and found it unlocked he realized that gonzalves had forgotten about his truck and his possessions when the cesium started burning through his body he had gotten out and stumbled toward the parking lot seeking help leaving everything else behind and unlocked bosch opened the drivers door and reached in with the radiation monitor nothing happened no alert he stood back up and replaced it on his belt from his pocket he got out a pair of latex gloves and put them on while listening to walling talking to someone about finding the pig no we didnt open it she said do you want us to she listened some before responding i didnt think so just get them here as fast as you can and maybe this will all be over bosch leaned back into the truck through the driverside door and picked up the camera it was a nikon digital and he remembered that the lens cover found beneath the master bed at the kent house by the sid team had said nikon on it he believed he was holding the camera that had taken the photograph of alicia kent he turned it on and for once he knew what he was doing as he examined a piece of electronic equipment he had a digital camera that he routinely carried with him when he went to hong kong to visit his daughter hed bought it when he had taken her to disneyland china his camera wasnt a nikon but he was able to quickly determine that the camera he had just found had no photos in its memory because the chip had been removed bosch put the camera down and began looking through the things piled on the passenger seat in addition to the broken briefcase there was a childs lunch box as well as a manual for operating an apple computer and a poker from a fireplace tool set nothing connected and nothing interested him he noticed a golf putter and a rolledup poster on the floor in front of the seat he moved the brown bag and the burrito out of the way and shifted his weight to one elbow on the armrest between the seats so he could reach over and open the glove compartment and there sitting in the otherwise empty space was a handgun bosch lifted it out and turned it in his hand it was a smith amp wesson caliber revolver i think weve got the murder weapon here he called out there was no response from walling she was still at the back of the truck talking on her phone still issuing orders in an animated voice bosch returned the weapon to the glove box and closed it deciding to leave the weapon in its place for the forensics team he noticed the rolledup poster again and decided for no reason other than curiosity to take a look at it using his elbow on the center armrest for support he unrolled it across all of the junk on the passenger seat it was a chart depicting twelve yoga positions bosch immediately thought about the discolored space he had seen on the wall in the workout room at the kent house he wasnt sure but he thought the dimensions of the poster would be a close match to that space on the wall he quickly rerolled the poster and started to back out of the cab so he could show walling the discovery but as he was pulling out he noticed that the armrest between the seats was also a storage compartment he stopped and opened it he froze there was a cup holder and in it were several steel capsules resembling bullet cartridges closed flat on both ends the steel was so polished it almost looked like silver it might even have been mistaken for silver bosch moved the radiation monitor over the capsules in a circular pattern there was no alarm he turned the device over in his hand and looked at it he saw a small switch on its side with his thumb he pushed it up a blaring alarm suddenly went off the frequency of tones so fast that they sounded like one long eardrumpiercing siren bosch jumped back out of the truck and slammed the door shut the poster fell to the ground harry walling yelled what she rushed toward him closing her phone on her hip bosch pushed the switch again and turned the monitor off what is it she yelled bosch pointed toward the trucks door the guns in the glove box and the cesiums in the center compartment what the cesium is in the compartment under the armrest he took the capsules out of the pig thats why they werent in his pocket they were in the center armrest he touched his right hip the place where gonzalves was burned by radiation the same spot would have been next to the armrest compartment when he was sitting in the truck rachel didnt say anything for a long moment she just stared at his face are you okay she finally asked bosch almost laughed i dont know he said ask me in about ten years she hesitated as if she knew something but couldnt share it what bosch asked nothing you should be checked out though what are they going to be able to do look i wasnt in the truck that long its not like gonzalves who was sitting in there with it he was practically eating off of it she didnt answer bosch handed her the monitor it was never on i thought it was on when you gave it to me she took it and looked at it in her hand i thought it was too bosch thought about how he had carried the monitor in his pocket rather than clipped to his belt he had probably switched it off unknowingly when he had twice put it in and removed it he looked back at the truck and wondered if he had possibly just hurt or killed himself i need a drink of water he said ive got a bottle in the trunk bosch walked back to the rear of his car using the open trunk lid to shield wallings view of him he leaned his hands down on the bumper for support and tried to decipher the messages his body was sending to his brain he felt something happening but didnt know if it was something physiological or if the shakes he felt were just an emotional response to what had just happened he remembered what the er doctor had said about gonzalves and how the most serious damage was internal was his own immune system shutting down was he circling the drain he suddenly thought of his daughter getting a vision of her at the airport the last time he saw her he cursed out loud harry bosch looked around the trunk lid rachel was walking toward him the teams are headed this way theyll be here in five minutes how do you feel i think im okay good i talked to the head of the team he thinks the exposure was too short to be anything serious but you still should go to the er and get checked out well see he reached into the trunk and got a liter bottle of water out of his kit it was an emergency bottle he kept for surveillances that dragged on longer than expected he opened it and took two strong pulls the water wasnt cold but it felt good going down his throat was dry bosch recapped the bottle and put it back in the kit he stepped around the car to walling as he walked toward her he looked past her to the south he realized that the alley they were in extended several blocks past the back of the easy print and ran behind all the storefronts and offices on cahuenga all the way down to barham in the alley every twenty yards or so was a green dumpster positioned perpendicular to the rear of the structures bosch realized they had been pushed out of spaces between the buildings and fenced corrals just like in silver lake it was pickup day and the dumpsters were waiting for the city trucks to come suddenly it all came to him like fusion two elements coming together and creating something new the thing that bothered him about the crime scene photos the yoga poster everything the gamma rays had shot right through him but they had left him enlightened he knew he understood hes a scavenger who is digoberto gonzalves bosch said his eyes looking down the alley its collection day the dumpsters are all pushed out for the city trucks gonzalves is a scavenger a dumpster diver and he knew they would be out and this would be a good time to come here he looked at walling before completing the thought and so did somebody else he said you mean he found the cesium in a dumpster bosch nodded and pointed down the alley all the way at the end thats barham barham takes you up to lake hollywood lake hollywood takes you to the overlook this case never leaves the map page walling came over and stood in front of him blocking his view bosch could now hear sirens in the distance what are you saying that nassar and elfayed took the cesium and stashed it in a dumpster at the bottom of the hill then this scavenger comes along and finds it im saying youve got the cesium back so now were looking at this as a homicide again you come down from the overlook and you can be in this alley in five minutes so what they stole the cesium and killed kent just so they could come down here and stash it is that what youre saying or are you saying they just threw it all away why would they do that i mean does that make any sense at all i mean i dont see that scaring people in the way we know they want to scare us bosch noted that she had asked six questions at once this time possibly a new record nassar and elfayed were never near the cesium he said thats what im saying he walked over to the truck and picked the rolled poster up off the ground he handed it to rachel the sirens were getting louder she unrolled the poster in her hands and looked at it what is this what does it mean bosch took it back from her and started rolling it up gonzalves found that in the same dumpster where he found the gun and the camera and the lead pig so what does it mean harry two fed cars pulled into the alley a block away and started making their way toward them weaving around the dumpsters pushed out for pickup as they got close bosch could see that the driver of the lead car was jack brenner do you hear me harry what does it boschs knees suddenly seemed to give out and he fell into her throwing his arms around her to stop himself from hitting the ground bosch she grabbed on and held him uh im not feeling so good he mumbled i think i better can you take me to my car she helped him straighten up and then started walking him toward his car he put his arm over her shoulders car doors were slamming behind them as the agents got out where are the keys walling asked he held the key ring out to her just as brenner ran up to them what is it whats wrong he was exposed the cesium is in the center console in the truck cab be careful im going to take him to the hospital brenner stepped back as if whatever bosch had were contagious okay he said call me when you can bosch and walling kept moving toward the car come on bosch walling said stay with me hang in there and well get you taken care of she had called him by his last name again eighteen the car jerked forward as walling pulled out of the alley and into southbound traffic on cahuenga im taking you back to queen of angels so dr garner can take a look at you she said just hang in there for me bosch he knew it was likely that the lastname endearments were about to come to an end he pointed toward the leftturn lane that led onto barham boulevard never mind the hospital he said take me back to the kent house what ill get checked out later go to the kent house heres the turn go she slipped into the leftturn lane whats going on im fine im okay what are you telling me that that little fainting spell back there was i had to get you away from the crime scene and away from brenner so i could check this out and talk to you alone check what out talk about what do you realize what you just did i thought i was saving your life now brenner or one of those other guys will take the credit for the recovery of the cesium thanks a lot asshole that was my crime scene he opened his jacket and pulled out the rolledup and folded yoga poster dont worry about it he said you can get the credit for the arrests you just might not want it he opened the poster letting the top half flop over his knees he was only interested in the bottom half dhanurasana he said walling glanced over at him and then down at the poster would you start telling me whats going on alicia kent practices yoga i saw the mats in the workout room at the house i saw them too so what did you see the sun discoloration on the wall where a picture or a calendar or maybe a poster had been taken down yes i saw it bosch held up the poster im betting that we go in there and this will be a perfect fit this is a poster gonzalves found with the cesium and what will that meanif its a perfect fit it will mean that it was almost a perfect crime alicia kent conspired to kill her husband and if it hadnt been for digoberto gonzalves just happening to find the tossedout evidence she would have gotten away with it walling shook her head dismissively come on harry are you saying she conspired with international terrorists to kill her husband in exchange for the cesium i cant believe i am even doing this i need to get back to the crime scene she started checking her mirrors getting ready to make a uturn they were going up lake hollywood drive now and would be at the house in two minutes no keep going were almost there alicia kent conspired with someone but it wasnt a terrorist the cesium being dumped in the trash proves that you said it yourself there is no way that moby and elfayed would steal this stuff to just dump it so what does that tell you this wasnt a heist it actually was a murder the cesium was just a red herring just like ramin samir and moby and elfayed they were part of the misdirection as well this poster will help prove it how dhanurasana the rocking bow he held the poster up and over so she could glance at the yoga pose depicted in the bottom corner it showed a woman with her arms behind her back holding her ankles and creating a bow with the front of her body she looked like she was hogtied walling glanced back at the curving road and then took another long look at the poster and the pose we go into the house and see if this fits that space on the wall bosch said if it fits that means she and the killer took it off the wall because they didnt want to risk that we might see it and connect it with what happened to her its a stretch harry a huge one not when you put it in context which you of course can do as soon as we get to the house hope you still have a key you bet i do walling turned onto arrowhead drive and punched the accelerator but after a block she took her foot off slowed down and shook her head again this is ridiculous she gave us the name moby there is no way she could have known he was in this country and then up on the overlook your own witness said that the shooter called out to allah as he pulled the trigger how can lets just try the poster on the wall if it fits ill lay the whole thing out for you i promise if it doesnt fit then i will quitbothering you with it she relented and drove the remaining block to the kent house without another word there was no longer a bureau car sitting out front bosch guessed that it was all hands on deck at the cesium recovery scene thank god i dont have to deal with maxwell again he said walling didnt even smile bosch got out with the poster and his file containing the crime scene photos he used stanley kents keys to open the front door and they proceeded to the workout room they took positions on either side of the rectangular sundiscoloration mark and bosch unrolled the poster they each took a side and held the top corner of the poster to the top corner of the mark bosch put his other hand on the center of the poster and flattened it against the wall the poster was a perfect fit over the mark on the wall what was more was that the tape marks on the wall matched up with tape marks and old tape on the poster to bosch there was no doubt the poster found by digoberto gonzalves in a dumpster off cahuenga had definitely come from alicia kents home yoga studio rachel let go of her side of the poster and headed out of the room ill be in the living room i cant wait to hear you put this together bosch rolled the poster up and followed walling took a seat in the same chair bosch had put maxwell in a few hours earlier he remained standing in front of her the fear was that the poster could be a tipoff he said some smart agent or detective would see the rockingbow pose and start thinking this woman does yoga maybe she could handle being hogtied like that maybe it was her idea maybe she did it to help sell the misdirection so they couldnt take the chance the poster had to go it went into the dumpster with the cesium the gun and everything else they used except for the ski masks and the phony map they planted with the car at ramin samirs house shes a master criminal walling said sarcastically bosch was undeterred he knew hed convince her if you get your people out there to check that line of dumpsters youll find the restthe cokebottle silencer the gloves the first set of snap ties every the first set of snap ties thats right ill get to that walling remained unimpressed you better get to a lot of it because there are big gaps in this thing man what about the name moby what about the citing of allah by the shooter what bosch held up a hand just hold on he said i need some water my throat is raw from all of this talking he went into the kitchen remembering that he saw bottles of chilled water in the refrigerator while searching the kitchen earlier in the day you want anything he called out no she called back its not our house remember he opened the refrigerator took out a bottle of water and drank half of it while standing in front of the open door the cool air felt good too he closed the door but then immediately reopened it he had seen something on the top shelf was a plastic bottle of grape juice he took it out and looked at it remembering that when he went through the trash bag in the garage he had found paper towels with grape juice on them another piece of the puzzle fell into place he put the bottle back in the refrigerator and then returned to the living room where rachel was waiting for the story once again he remained standing okay when was it that you captured the terrorist known as moby on video at the port what does please just answer the question august twelfth last year okay august twelfth then what some sort of alert went out through the bureau and all of homeland security she nodded not for a while though she said it took almost two months of video analysis to confirm it was nassar and elfayed i wrote the bulletin it went out october ninth as a confirmed domestic sighting out of curiosity why didnt you go public with it because we haveactually i cant tell you you just did you must have someone or someplace where you think these two might show up under surveillance if you go public they might just go underground and never show up again can we go back to your story please fine so the bulletin went out october ninth that was the day the plan to kill stanley kent began walling folded her arms across her chest and just stared at him bosch thought that maybe she was beginning to see where he was going with the story and she didnt like it it works best if you start from the end and go backwards bosch said alicia kent gave you the name moby how could she have gotten that name she overheard one of them calling the other one by that name bosch shook his head no she told you she overheard it but if she was lying how would she know the name to lie about it just coincidence that she gives the nickname of a guy who less than six months ago was confirmed as being in the countryin la county no less i dont think so rachel and neither do you the odds of that probably cant be calculated okay so youre saying that somebody in the bureau or another agency that received the fbi bulletin i wrote gave her the name bosch nodded and pointed at her right he gave her the name so she could come out with it while being questioned by the fbis master interrogator that name along with the plan to dump the car in front of ramin samirs house would act in concert to send this whole thing down the wrong road with the fbi and everybody else chasing after terrorists who had nothing to do with it he im getting to that now you are right anybody who got a look at that bulletin would have been able to give her that name my guess is that would be a lot of people a lot of people just in la alone so how would we narrow it down to one you tell me bosch opened the bottle and drank the rest of the water he held the empty bottle in his hand as he continued you narrow it down by continuing to go backwards where would alicia kents life have intersected with one of those people in the agencies who knew about moby walling frowned and shook her head that could have been anywhere with those kinds of parameters in line at the supermarket or when she was buying fertilizer for her roses anywhere bosch now had her right where he wanted her to be then narrow the parameters he said where would she have intersected with someone who knew about moby but also knew that her husband had access to the sort of radioactive materials moby might be interested in now she shook her head in a dismissive way nowhere it would take a monumental coincidence to she stopped when it came to her enlightenment and shock as she fully understood where bosch was going my partner and i visited the kents to warn them early last year i guess what youre saying is that that makes me a suspect bosch shook his head i said he remember you didnt come here alone her eyes fired when she registered the implication thats ridiculous theres no way i cant believe you would she didnt finish as her mind snagged on something some memory that undermined her trust and loyalty to her partner bosch picked up on the tell and moved in closer what he asked nothing what look she insisted take my advice and tell no one this theory of yours youre lucky you told me first because this makes you sound like some kind of crackpot with a vendetta you have no evidence no motive no incriminating statements nothing you just have this thing youve spun out of out of a yoga poster there is no other explanation that fits with the facts and im talking about the facts of the case not the fact that the bureau and homeland security and the rest of the federal government would love this to be a terrorism event so they can justify their existence and deflect criticism from other failings contrary to what you want to think there is evidence and there are incriminating statements if we put alicia kent on a lie detector youll find out that everything she told me you and the master interrogator downtown is a lie the real master was alicia kent as in master manipulator walling leaned forward and looked down at the floor thank you harry that master interrogator you love deriding happens to have been me boschs mouth dropped open for a moment before he spoke oh well then sorry but it doesnt matter the point is she is a master liar she lied about everything and now that we know the story it will be easy to smoke her out walling got up from her seat and walked over to the front picture window the vertical blinds were closed but she split them with a finger and stared out into the street bosch could see her working the story over grinding it down what about the witness she asked without turning around he heard the shooter yell allah are you saying hes part of this or are you saying they just happened to know he was there and yelled allah as part of this master manipulation bosch gently tried to clear his throat it was burning and making it difficult for him to talk no on that i think its just a lesson in hearing what you want to hear i plead guilty to not being much of a master interrogator myself the kid told me that he heard the shooter yell it as he pulled the trigger he said he wasnt sure but that it sounded like allah and that of course worked with what i was thinking at the time i heard what i wanted to hear walling came away from the window sat back down and folded her arms bosch finally sat down on a chair directly across from her he continued but how would the witness know it was the shooter and not the victim who yelled he asked he was more than fifty yards away it was dark how would he know that it wasnt stanley kent yelling out his last word before execution the name of the woman he loved because he was about to die not even knowing that shed betrayed him alicia exactly alicia interrupted by a gunshot becomes allah walling relaxed her arms and leaned forward as body language went it was a good sign it told bosch he was pushing through you said the first set of snap ties before she said what were you talking about bosch nodded and handed across the file containing the crime scene photos he had saved the best for last look at the photos he said what do you see she opened the file and started looking at the crime scene photos they depicted the master bedroom in the kent house from all angles its the master bedroom she said what am i missing exactly what its what you dont see there are no clothes in the shot she told us they told her to sit on the bed and take off her clothes what are we supposed to believe that they let her put the clothes away before they hogtied her they let her put them in the hamper look at the last shot its the email photo stanley kent got walling looked through the file until she found the printout of the email photo she stared intently at it he saw recognition break in her eyes now what do you see the robe she said excitedly when we let her get dressed she went to the closet to get her robe there was no robe on that lounge chair bosch nodded and they started trading pieces of the story back and forth what does that tell us he asked that these considerate terrorists hung the robe up in the closet for her after taking the photo or that maybe mrs kent was tied up twice and the robe was moved in between and look again at the picture the clock on the bed table is unplugged why i dont know but maybe they didnt want to worry about having any sort of time stamp on the photo maybe the first photo wasnt even taken yesterday maybe it came from a dry run two days ago or even two weeks rachel nodded and bosch knew she was committed she was a believer she was tied up once for the photo and then once again for the rescue she said exactly and that left her free to help carry out the plan on the overlook she didnt kill her husband but she was up there in the other car and once stanley was dead and the cesium was dumped and the car was ditched at samirs she and her partner came back home and she was tied up all over again she wasnt passed out when we got there that was an act and part of the plan and her wetting the bed was a nice little touch to help sell it to us the smell of urine also covered up the smell of grape juice what do you mean the purple bruises on her wrists and ankles now we know she wasnt tied up for hours but she still had those bruises theres an opened bottle of grape juice in the fridge and paper towels soaked with it out in the trash can she used grape juice to create the bruises oh my god i cant believe this what when i was in the room with her at tiu that small space i thought i smelled grape in the room i thought somebody had been in there before us and had been drinking grape juice i smelled it there you go there was no doubt now bosch had her but then a shadow of concern and doubt moved across wallings face like a summer cloud what about motive she asked this is a federal agent were talking about to move on this we need everything even motive there can be nothing left open to chance bosch had been ready for the question you saw the motive alicia kent is a beautiful woman jack brenner wanted her and stanley kent was in the way of that wallings eyes widened in shock bosch pressed on with his case thats the motive rachel you but he let me just finish it goes like this you and your partner show up here that day last year to give the kents the warning about his occupation some kind of vibe is exchanged between alicia and jack he gets interested she gets interested they meet on the sly for coffee or for drinks or whatever one thing leads to another an affair begins and it lasts and then it lasts to the point that its time to start thinking about doing something leaving the husband or getting rid of him because theres insurance and half a company at stake thats enough motive right there rachel and thats what this case is about its not about cesium or terrorism or anything else its the basic equation sex plus money equals murder thats all she frowned and shook her head you dont know what you are talking about jack brenner is married and has three children hes stable boring and not interested he wasnt every man is interested it doesnt matter if theyre married or how many kids they have she spoke quietly would you listen and let me finish now you are wrong about brenner he never met alicia kent before today he wasnt my partner when i came here last year and i never told you he was bosch was jolted by the news hed assumed that her current partner had been her partner last year hed had brenners image locked and loaded in his mind as he had unfolded the story at the start of the year all partners in tiu were shuffled its the routine it promotes a better team concept ive been with jack since january who was your partner last year rachel she held his eyes for a long moment it was cliff maxwell nineteen harry bosch almost laughed but was too shocked to do anything but shake his head rachel walling was telling him that cliff maxwell was alicia kents partner in murder i cant believe this he finally said about five hours ago i had the killer handcuffed on the floor right here rachel looked mortified by the realization that the murder of stanley kent was an inside job and the theft of the cesium was nothing more than a wellplayed misdirection you see the rest now bosch asked you see how he would work it her husbands dead and he starts coming around out of sympathy and because hes on the case they start dating fall in love and nobody ever raises an eyebrow about it theyre still out there looking for moby and elfayed and what if we ever catch those guys walling said taking up the story they could deny being a part of this thing until osama bin laden dies in a cave of old age but who would believe them or care theres nothing more ingenious than framing terrorists with a crime they didnt commit they can never defend themselves bosch nodded a perfect crime he said the only reason it blew up was because digoberto gonzalves checked that dumpster without him wed still be chasing moby and elfayed probably thinking that they had used samirs place as a safe house so what do we do now bosch bosch shrugged but then answered anyway i say we set up a classic rattrap put them both in rooms ring the bell and say the first one who talks gets the deal id bet on alicia shell break and give him up probably blame him for everything say she was acting under his influence and control something tells me youre right and the truth is i dont think maxwell was smart enough to pull this off i worked with her cell phone started buzzing she took it out of her pocket and looked at the screen its jack find out where maxwell is she answered the call and first replied to a few questions about boschs status telling brenner that he was okay but was losing his voice because his throat hurt bosch got up for another bottle of water but listened from the kitchen walling casually steered the call toward maxwell hey wheres cliff by the way i wanted to talk to him about that thing with bosch in the hallway i didnt like what he she stopped and listened to the answer and bosch saw her eyes immediately become alert something was wrong when was that she asked she listened again and stood up listen jack ive got to go i think bosch is about to be discharged ill check in as soon as im clear here she closed the phone and looked at bosch i cant stand lying to him he wont forget it what did he say he said there were too many agents at the recovery scenejust about everybody came out from downtown and they were standing around waiting on the radiation team so maxwell volunteered to go pick up the witness at the mark twain nobody had gotten around to it because id pulled off the original pickup team he went alone thats what jack said how long ago a half hour hes going to kill him bosch started moving quickly toward the door twenty bosch drove this time on the way toward hollywood he told walling that jesse mitford had no phone in his room the mark twain wasnt much when it came to full service instead bosch called the watch commander at hollywood division and asked him to send a patrol car to the hotel to check on the witness he then called information and was connected to the front desk at the mark twain alvin this is detective bosch from this morning yeah yeah whats up with you detective has anyone come in asking for stephen king mmm nope in the last twenty minutes have you buzzed in anybody who looked like a cop or who wasnt a tenant there no detective whats going on listen i need you to go up to that room and tell stephen king to get out of there and then to call me on my cell i got nobody to watch the desk detective its an emergency alvin i need to get him out of there it will take you less than five minutes here write this down my number is threetwothree twofourfour fivesixthreeone you got it i got it okay go and if anybody but me comes in there looking for him say he checked out took a refund and left go alvin and thanks bosch closed the phone and looked over at rachel his face showed his lack of confidence in the deskman i think the guys a tweaker bosch increased his speed and tried to concentrate on driving they had just turned south on cahuenga off barham he was thinking that depending on traffic in hollywood they could get to the mark twain in another five minutes this conclusion made him shake his head with a halfhour lead maxwell should already be at the mark twain he wondered if he had slipped in the back way and already gotten to mitford maxwell may have already gone in through the back he told walling im going to come in from the alley you know walling said maybe hes not going to hurt him hell pick him up and talk to him judge for himself if he saw enough at the overlook that hed be a threat bosch shook his head no way maxwells got to know that once the cesium was found his plan was going down the toilet hes got to take action against all threats first the witness then alicia kent alicia kent you think hed make a move against her this whole thing is because of her doesnt matter now survival instincts take over now and shes a threat it goes with the territory you cross the big line to be with her you cross it again to save your bosch stopped talking as a sudden realization thudded in his chest he cursed out loud and pinned the accelerator as they came out of the cahuenga pass he cut across three lanes of highland avenue in front of the hollywood bowl and made a screeching uturn in front of oncoming traffic he punched it and the car fishtailed wildly as he headed toward the southbound entrance to the hollywood freeway rachel grabbed the dashboard and a door handle to hold on harry what are you doing this is the wrong way he flicked on the siren and the blue lights that flashed in the front grille and back window of the car he yelled his response to walling mitford is a misdirection this is the right way who is the greater threat to maxwell alicia you bet and nows the best shot he has of getting her out of tactical everybodys up in that alley with the cesium the freeway was moving pretty well and the siren helped open it up further bosch figured maxwell could have already gotten to downtown depending on what kind of traffic he encountered rachel opened her phone and started punching in numbers she tried number after number but no one was answering i cant get anybody she yelled wheres tiu walling didnt hesitate on broadway you know where the million dollar theater is same building entrance on third bosch flicked off the siren and opened his phone he called his partner and ferras answered right away ignacio where are you just got back to the office forensics worked the car for listen to me drop what youre doing and meet me at the third street entrance to the million dollar theater building you know where that is whats going on do you know where the million dollar theater is yeah i know where it is meet me there at the third street entrance ill explain when i get there he closed the phone and hit the siren again twentyone the next ten minutes took ten hours bosch moved in and out of traffic and finally reached the broadway exit in downtown he killed the siren as he made the turn and headed down the hill toward their destination they were three blocks away the million dollar theater was built in a time when the movie business showed itself off in magnificent theater palaces that lined broadway downtown but it had been decades since a firstrun film had been projected on a screen there its ornate façade had been covered by a lighted marquee that for a time announced religious revivals instead of movies now the theater waited unused for renovation and redemption while above it a oncegrand office building was twelve stories of midgrade office space and residential lofts good place for a secret unit to have a secret office bosch said as the building came into sight nobody wouldve guessed walling didnt respond she was trying to make another call she then slapped the phone closed in frustration i cant even get our secretary she always takes lunch after one so there will be somebody in the office when the agents go to lunch earlier where exactly is the squad and where would alicia kent be in there we have the whole seventh floor theres a lounge room with a couch and a tv they put her in there so she could watch tv how many in the squad eight agents the secretary and an office manager the office manager just went out on maternity leave and the secretary must be at lunch i hope but they wouldnt have left alicia kent alone its against policy somebody had to have stayed there with her bosch turned right on third and immediately pulled to the curb ignacio ferras was already there leaning casually against his volvo station wagon in front of it was another parked car a federal cruiser bosch and walling got out bosch approached ferras and walling went to look inside the fed car have you seen maxwell bosch asked who agent maxwell the guy we put on the floor at the kent house this morning no i havent seen anybody what its his car walling said as she joined them ignacio this is agent walling call me iggy rachel they shook hands okay then hes gotta be up there bosch said how many stairwells three walling said but hell use the one that comes out by his car she pointed to a pair of double steel doors near the corner of the building bosch headed over that way to see if they were locked ferras and walling followed what is going on ferras asked maxwell is our shooter bosch said he is up what bosch checked the exit doors there was no outside handle or knob he turned to ferras look theres not a lot of time trust me maxwell is our guy and hes in this building to take out alicia kent were what is she doing here the fbi has a location here shes here no more questions okay just listen agent walling and i are going up in the elevator i want you out here by this door if maxwell comes out you take him down you understand you take him down got it good call for backup were going up bosch reached over and tapped ferras on the cheek and stay frosty they left ferras there and headed through the buildings main entrance there was no lobby to speak of just an elevator it opened at the push of the button and walling used a key card to engage the seven button they started going up something tells me youre never going to call him iggy walling said bosch ignored the comment but thought of something to ask does this thing have a bell or a tone that sounds when it reaches the floor i cant rememi think it does yes definitely great well be sitting ducks bosch pulled his kimber out of its holster and chambered a round walling did the same with her weapon bosch pushed walling to one side of the elevator while he took the other he raised his gun the elevator finally reached seven and there was a soft bell tone from outside the door began to slide open exposing bosch first no one was there rachel pointed to the left signaling that the offices were to the left after they exited the elevator bosch lowered himself into a combat crouch and stepped out his gun up and ready again no one was there he started moving to his left rachel came out and moved with him on his right flank they came to a loftstyle office with two rows of cubiclesthe squad roomand three private rooms that had been built freestanding in the open floor plan there were large racks of electronic equipment between the cubicles and every desk had two computer screens on it it looked like the whole place could be packed up and moved at a moments notice bosch stepped farther in and through the window in one of the private offices he saw a man sitting in a chair his head back and eyes open he looked like he was wearing a red bib but bosch knew it was blood the man had been shot in the chest he pointed and rachel saw the dead man she reacted with a quick intake of breath and a lowvolume sigh the door to the office was ajar they moved toward it and bosch pushed it open while walling covered them from behind bosch stepped in and saw alicia kent sitting on the floor her back to the wall he crouched beside her her eyes were open but dead a gun was on the floor between her feet and the wall behind her was spattered with blood and brain matter bosch turned and surveyed the room he understood the play it was set up so it would look like alicia kent had grabbed the agents gun from his holster shot him and then sat down on the floor and took her own life no note or explanation but it was the best maxwell could come up with in the short amount of time and opportunity that he had bosch turned to walling she had let her guard down and was just standing there looking at the dead agent rachel he said hes gotta still be here he stood and moved toward the door so he could search the squad room as he glanced through the window he saw movement behind the electronics racks he stopped raised his weapon and tracked someone moving behind one of the racks toward a door with an exit sign on it in a moment he saw maxwell break free of the cover and dash toward the door maxwell bosch yelled stop maxwell spun and raised a weapon at the same moment that his back hit the exit door he started firing the window shattered and glass sprayed across bosch he returned fire and put six shots into the opening of the exit door but maxwell was gone rachel he called without taking his eyes off the door okay im fine her voice came from below him he knew she had hit the floor when the shooting had started which exit is that door rachel stood up bosch moved toward the door glancing at her and saw glass all over her clothes and that she had been cut on the cheek those stairs go down to his car bosch ran from the room toward the exit door he opened his phone as he went and pushed the speed dial for his partner the call was answered on half a ring bosch was already in the stairwell hes coming down bosch dropped the phone and started down the stairs he could hear maxwell running on the steel steps below and instinctively knew that he was too far ahead twentytwo bosch covered three more landings taking three steps at a time he could now hear walling coming down behind him he then heard the booming sound from below as maxwell hit the exit door at the bottom there were immediate shouts and then there were shots they came so close together it was impossible to determine which had come first or how many shots had been fired ten seconds later bosch hit the exit door he came out onto the sidewalk and saw ferras leaning against the back bumper of maxwells fed car he was holding his weapon with one hand and his elbow with the other a red rose of blood was blooming on his shoulder traffic had stopped in both directions on third and pedestrians were running down the sidewalks to safety i hit him twice ferras yelled he went that way he nodded in the direction of the third street tunnel under bunker hill bosch stepped closer to his partner and saw the wound in the ball of his shoulder it didnt look too bad did you call for backup bosch asked on the way ferras grimaced as he adjusted his hold on his injured arm you did real good iggy hang in there while i go get this guy ferras nodded bosch turned and saw rachel come through the door a smear of blood on her face this way he said hes hit they started down third in a spread formation after a few steps bosch picked up the trail maxwell was obviously hurt badly and was losing a lot of blood it would make him easy to track but when they got to the corner of third and hill they lost the trail there was no blood on the pavement bosch looked into the long third street tunnel and saw no one moving in the traffic on foot he looked up and down hill street and saw nothing until his attention was drawn to a commotion of people running out of the grand central market this way he said they moved quickly toward the huge market bosch picked up the blood trail again just outside and started in the market was a twostoryhigh conglomeration of food booths and retail and produce concessions there was a strong smell of grease and coffee in the air that had to infect every floor of the building above the market the place was crowded and noisy and that made it difficult for bosch to follow the blood and track maxwell then suddenly there were shouts from directly ahead and two quick shots were fired into the air it caused an immediate human stampede dozens of screaming shoppers and workers flooded into the aisle where bosch and walling stood and started running toward them bosch realized they were going to be run over and trampled in one motion he moved to his right grabbed walling around the waist and pulled her behind one of the wide concrete support pillars the crowd moved by and then bosch looked around the pillar the market was now empty there was no sign of maxwell but then bosch picked up movement in one of the cold cases that fronted a butcher shop at the end of the aisle he looked again closely and realized that the movement came from behind the case looking through the front and back glass panels and over the display of cuts of beef and pork bosch could see maxwells face he was on the ground leaning his back against a refrigerator in the rear of the butcher shop hes up ahead in the butcher shop he whispered to walling you go to the right and down that aisle youll be able to come up on his right what about you ill go straight on and get his attention or we could wait for backup im not waiting i didnt think so ready no switch i go headon and get his attention and you come around the side bosch knew it was the better plan because she knew maxwell and maxwell knew her but it also meant she would face the most danger you sure he asked yes its right bosch looked around the pillar one more time and saw that maxwell had not moved his face looked red and sweaty bosch looked back at walling hes still there good lets do it they separated and started moving bosch quickly moved down an aisle of concessions one over from the aisle that ended at the butcher shop when he came to the end he was at a mexican coffee shop with high walls he was able to protect himself and look around the corner at the butcher shop this gave him a side view behind the counter he saw maxwell twenty feet away he was slouched against the refrigerator door still holding his weapon in two hands his shirt was completely soaked in blood bosch leaned back into cover gathered himself and got ready to step out and approach maxwell but then he heard wallings voice cliff its me rachel let me get you some help bosch looked around the corner walling was standing out in the open five feet in front of the deli counter her gun down at her side there is no help maxwell said its too late for me bosch recognized that if maxwell wanted to take a shot at her the bullet would have to go through both the front and back glass panels of the deli case with the front plate set at an angle it would take a miracle bullet to get to her but miracles did happen bosch raised his weapon braced it against the wall and was ready to shoot if he needed to come on cliff walling said give it up dont end it like this no other way maxwells body was suddenly racked by a deep wet coughing blood came to his lips jesus that guy really got me he said before coughing again cliff walling pleaded let me come in there i want to help no you come in and im going to his words were lost when he opened fire on the deli case sweeping his gun and shooting out the glass doors all the way down rachel ducked and bosch stepped out and straightened his arms in a twohanded grip he held himself from shooting but keyed on the barrel of maxwells weapon if the muzzle zeroed in on walling he was going to shoot maxwell in the head maxwell lowered his weapon to his lap and started to laugh blood rolling down from both corners of his mouth and creating a freak clown look i think i think i just killed a porterhouse he laughed again but it made him start to cough once more and that looked painful when it subsided he spoke i just want to say that it was her she wanted him dead i just i just wanted her thats all but she wouldnt have it any other way and i did what she wanted for that i am damned bosch took a step closer he didnt think that maxwell had noticed him yet he took one more step and then maxwell spoke again im sorry he said rachel tell them im sorry cliff walling said you can tell them that yourself as bosch watched maxwell brought his gun up and put the muzzle under his chin without hesitation he pulled the trigger the impact snapped his head back and sent a spatter of blood up the refrigerator door the gun dropped onto the concrete floor between his outstretched legs in his suicide maxwell had adopted the same position as his lover the woman he had just killed walling came around the case and stood next to bosch and together they looked down at the dead agent she said nothing bosch checked his watch it was almost one he had ridden the case from beginning to end in little more than twelve hours the tally was five dead one wounded and one dying of radiation exposure and then there was himself bosch wondered if he was going to be part of the tally by the time all was said and done his throat was now blazing and there was a feeling of heaviness in his chest he looked at rachel and saw blood running down her cheek again she would need stitches to close the wound you know what he said ill take you to the hospital if you take me she looked at him and smiled sort of sadly throw in iggy and youve got yourself a deal bosch left her there with maxwell and walked back to the million dollar theater building to check on his partner while he was on his way backup units were pulling in everywhere and crowds were forming bosch decided he would leave it to the patrol officers to take charge of the crime scenes ferras was sitting in the open door of his car waiting for the paramedics he was holding his arm at an awkward angle and was clearly in pain the blood had spread on his shirt you want some water bosch asked ive got a bottle in my trunk no ill just wait i wish theyd get here the signature siren of a firerescue paramedic truck could be heard in the distance getting closer what happened harry bosch leaned against the side of the car and told him that maxwell had just killed himself as they had closed in on him hell of a way to go i guess ferras said cornered like that bosch nodded but kept silent as they waited his thoughts carried him down the streets and up the hills to the overlook where the last thing stanley kent ever saw was the city spread before him in beautiful shimmering lights maybe to stanley it looked like heaven was waiting for him at the end but bosch thought that it didnt really matter if you died cornered in a butcher shop or on an overlook glimpsing the lights of heaven you were gone and the finale wasnt the part that mattered we are all circling the drain he thought some are closer to the black hole than others some will see it coming and some will have no clue when the undertow of the whirlpool grabs them and pulls them down into darkness forever the important thing is to fight it bosch told himself always keep kicking always keep fighting the undertow the rescue unit turned the corner at broadway working its way around several stopped cars before finally braking at the mouth of the alley and killing the siren bosch helped his partner up and out of the car and they walked to the paramedics acknowledgments this
