harry turtledove tale of the fox gerin the fox the man who wouldnt be king ever since the catastrophic werenight isolated the northlands from the elabonian empire gerin the fox has hoped to settle down as the peaceful ruler of fox keep but destiny seems to have other ideas the voice of the god biton prophesies danger to the northlands gerin has already beaten off invaders both human and inhuman but this time he faces an invasion by the gradi led by their cold fierce gods gerin has to fight fire with fire by invoking all the supernatural help he can get from the capricious god mavrix the aloof but powerful biton and the more elemental gods of those who live beneath the ground and just when things cant get worsethey get worse gerins neighbor aragis the archer has made one provocative move after another and gerin reluctantly decides that war is inevitable but suddenly the elabonian empire again turns its unwelcome attention to the northlands which it regards as a subject territory gerin and aragis are now allies against a common enemy and a very formidable one with forces that outnumber both their armies put together king of the north i gerin the fox looked down his long nose at the two peasants whod brought their dispute before him now trasamir you say this hound is yours am i right aye thats right lord prince trasamir longshanks shaggy head bobbed up and down he pointed to several of the people who helped crowd the great hall of fox keep all these folks from my village theyll say its so of course they will gerin said one corner of his mouth curled up in a sardonic smile theyd better hadnt they as best i can tell youve got two uncles a cousin a nephew and a couple of nieces there havent you he turned to the other peasant and you walamund you claim the hound belongs to you that i do lord prince on account of its so walamund astulfs son had a typical elabonian name but dirty blond hair and light eyes said there were a couple of trokmoi in the family woodpile like gerin trasamir was swarthy with brown eyes and black hair and beardthough the foxs beard had gone quite gray the past few years walamund went on these here people will tell you that there dog is mine gerin gave them the same dubious look with which hed favored trasamirs supporters thats your father and your brother and two of your brothersinlaw i see one of them with your sister alongsidefor luck maybe walamund looked as unhappy as trasamir longshanks had a moment before neither man seemed to have expected their overlord to be so well versed about who was who in their village that marked them both for fools any man who did not know gerin kept close track of as many tiny details as he could wasnt keeping track of details himself hesitantly trasamir pointed to the hound in questiona roughcoated reddish brown beast with impressive fangs now tied to a table leg and given a wide berth by everybody in the hall uh lord prince youre a wizard too they say couldnt you use your magic to show whose dog swifty there really is i could gerin said i wont more trouble than its worth as far as he was concerned most magic was more trouble than it was worth his sorcerous training was more than half a lifetime old now and had always been incomplete a partially trained mage risked his own skin every time he tried a conjuration the fox had got away with it a few times over the years but picked with great care the spots where hed take the chance he turned to his eldest son who stood beside him listening to the two peasants arguments how would you decide this one duren me durens voice broke on the word he scowled in embarrassment when you had fourteen summers the world could be a mortifying place but gerin had put questions like that to him before the fox was all too aware he wouldnt last forever and wanted to leave behind a welltrained successor as trasamir had duren pointed to the hound theres the animal here are the two men who say its theirs why not let them both call it and see which one it goes to gerin plucked at his beard mm i like that well enough better than well enough in factthey should have thought of it for themselves back at their village instead of coming here and wasting my time with it he looked to trasamir and walamund whichever one of you can call the dog will keep it do you agree both peasants nodded walamund asked uh lord prince what about the one the dog doesnt go to the foxs smile grew wider but less pleasant hell have to yield up a forfeit to make sure im not swamped with this sort of foolishness do you still agree walamund and trasamir nodded again this time perhaps less enthusiastically gerin waved them out to the courtyard out they went along with their supporters his son a couple of his vassals and all the cooks and serving girls he started out himself then realized the bone of contentionor rather the bonegnawer of contentionwas still tied to the table the hound growled and bared its teeth as he undid the rope holding it had it attacked him he would have drawn his sword and solved the problem by ensuring that neither peasant took possession of it thereafter but it let him lead it out into the afternoon sunlight get back there he said and the backers of trasamir and walamund retreated from their principals he glared at them any of you who speaks or moves during the contest will be sorry for it i promise the peasants might suddenly have turned to stone gerin nodded to the two men who claimed the hound all rightgo ahead here swifty come boy come ongood dog thats my swifty walamund and trasamir both called and chirped and whistled and slapped the callused palms of their hands against their woolen trousers at first gerin thought the dog would ignore both of them it sat on its haunches and yawned displaying canines that might almost have done credit to a longtooth the fox hadnt figured out what hed do if swifty wanted no part of either peasant but then the hound got up and began to strain against the rope gerin let go hoping the beast wouldnt savage one of the men calling it it ran straight to trasamir longshanks and let him pat and hug it its fluffy tail wagged back and forth trasamirs relatives clapped their hands and shouted in delight walamunds stood dejected so did walamund himself uhwhat are you going to do to me lord prince he asked eyeing gerin with apprehension do you admit to trying to take the hound when it was not yours the fox asked and walamund reluctantly nodded you knew your claim wasnt good but you made it anyhow gerin persisted walamund nodded again even more reluctantly gerin passed sentence then you can kiss the dogs backside to remind you to keep your hands off what belongs to your neighbors grab swiftys tail somebody trasamir shouted with a whoop of glee walamund astulfs son stared from gerin to the dog and back again he looked as if somebody had hit him in the side of the head with a board but almost everyone around himincluding some of his own kinsfolknodded approval at the foxs rough justice walamund started to stoop then stopped and sent a last glance of appeal toward his overlord gerin folded his arms across his chest youd better do it he said implacably if i come up with something else youll like that even less i promise you his own gaze went to the narrow window that gave light to his bedchamber as hed hoped selatre stood there watching what was going on in the courtyard below when he caught his wifes eye she nodded vigorously that made him confident he was on the right course he sometimes doubted his own good sense but hardly ever hers one of trasamirs relatives lifted the hounds tail walamir got down on all fours did as the fox had required of him and then spat in the dirt and grass again and again wiping his lips on his sleeve all the while fetch him a jack of ale to wash his mouth gerin told one of the serving girls she hurried away the fox looked a warning to trasamir and his relatives dont hang an ekename on him on account of this he told them its over and done with if he comes back here and tells me youre all calling him walamund houndkisser or anything like that youll wish youd never done it do you understand me aye lord prince trasamir said and his kinsfolk nodded solemnly he didnt know whether they meant it he knew he did though so if they didnt theyd be sorry the girl brought out two tarredleather jacks of ale she gave one to walamund and handed the fox the other here lord prince she said with a smile thank you nania he answered that was kindly done her smile got wider and more inviting she was new to fox keep maybe she had in mind slipping into gerins bed or at least a quick tumble in a storeroom or some such in a lot of castles that would have been the quickest way to an easy job gerin chuckled to himself as he poured out a small libation to baivers the god of barley and brewing no reason for nania to know yet that shed found herself an uxorious overlord but she had he hadnt done any casual wenching since hed met selatre eleven years more or less he thought in some surprise it didnt feel that long walamund had also let a little ale slop over the rim of his drinking jack and drip onto the ground only a fool slighted the gods then he raised the jack to his mouth he spat out the first mouthful then gulped down the rest in one long draught fill him up again gerin told nania he turned back to walamund and trasamir and their companions you can sup here tonight and sleep in the great hall the morning is time enough to get back to your village the peasants bowed and thanked him even walamund by the time the man whod wrongly claimed the hound had got outside of his second jack of ale his view of the world seemed much improved duren stepped aside with gerin and said i thought hed hate you forever after that but he doesnt seem to thats because i let him down easy once the punishment was done the fox said i made sure he wouldnt be mocked i gave him ale to wash his mouth and ill feed him supper same as i will trasamir once youve done what you need to do step back and get on with things if you stand over him gloating hes liable to up and kick you in the bollocks duren thought about it thats not what lekapenos epic tells a man to do he said be the best friend your friends have and the worst foe to your foes or so the poet says gerin frowned whenever he thought of lekapenos he thought of durens mother elise had been fond of quoting the sithonian poet elise had also run off with a traveling horse doctor about the time duren was learning to stand on his feet even with so many years gone by remembering hurt the fox stuck close to the point his son had raised walamunds not a foe hes just a serf who did something wrong father dyaus willing he wont take the chance of falling foul of me again and thats what i was aiming at theres more gray in life son than youll find in an epic but the epic is grander duren said with a grin and burst into sithonian hexameters gerin grinned too he was glad to see knowledge of sithonian preserved here in the northlands cut off these past fifteen years and more from the empire of elabon few hereabouts could read even elabonian the tongue in their mouths every day gerin also smiled because selatre having first learned sithonian herself was the one whod taught duren the language the boyno not a boy any more the youthdidnt remember his birth mother selatre was the one whod raised him and he got on so well with her and with his younger half brothers and half sister that they might have been fullblooded kin duren pointed eastward theres elleb coming up over the stockade he said wont be too long till sunset gerin nodded ruddy ellebactually a washedout pink with the sun still in the skywas a couple of days before full pale nothos floated high in the southeast looking like half a coin at first quarter golden math wasnt up yet shed be full tonight gerin thought and swiftmoving tiwaz was lost in the skirts of the sun walamund had his drinking jack filled yet again the fox brewed strong ale he wondered if the peasant would fall asleep before supper well if walamund did it was his business no one elses hed hike back to his village in the morning with a thick head nothing worse from the watchtower atop the keep a sentry shouted a chariot approaches lord prince on the palisade surrounding castle fox soldiers looked to their bows and bronzeheaded spears in these troubled times you never could tell who might be coming after a short pause the sentry said its van of the strong arm with geroge and tharma the soldiers relaxed van had been gerins closest friend since before the great werenight and that had been gerin glanced up toward elleb and nothos once more those two moons and tiwaz and math had all been full together nearly sixteen years before sometimes that night of terror seemed impossibly distant sometimes as now it might have been day before yesterday chains creaked as the gate crew lowered the drawbridge to let van and his companions into fox keep the bridge thumped down onto the dirt on the far side of the ditch surrounding the palisade not for the first time gerin told himself he ought to dig a trench from the river niffet and turn that ditch to a moat when i have time he thought knowing that likely meant never horses hooves drummed on the oak planks as the chariot rattled over the drawbridge and into the courtyard ho fox van boomed the outlander was driving the twohorse team and in his fine bronze corselet and helm with tall crest could easily have been mistaken for a god visiting the world of men he was half a foot taller than gerinwho was not short himselfand broad through the shoulders in proportion his hair and beard were still almost all gold not silver though he was within a couple of years of the foxs age one way or the other but the scars seaming his face and arms and hands gave proof he was human not divine yet however impressive the figure he cut walamund and trasamir and all the peasants whod accompanied them to castle fox stared not at him but at geroge and tharma who rose behind him in the car trasamirs eyes got very big father dyaus he muttered and made an apotropaic sign with his right hand i thought we were rid of those horrible things for good van glared at him you watch your mouth he said a warning not to be taken lightly he turned back to geroge and tharma and spoke soothingly dont get angry he doesnt mean anything by it he just hasnt seen any like you for a long time its all right geroge said and tharma nodded to show she agreed he went on we know we surprise people its just the way things are howd the hunting go gerin asked hoping to distract geroge and tharma from the wide eyes of the serfs they couldnt help their looks as far as monsters went in fact they were very good people tharma bent down and slung the gutted carcass of a stag out of the chariot geroge grinned proudly i caught it he said his grin made the peasants draw back in fresh alarm for his fangs were at least as impressive as those of swifty the hound his face and tharmas sloped forward down to the massive jaws needed to contain such an imposing collection of ivory neither monster was excessively burdened with forehead but both under their hairy hides had thews as large and strong as vans which was saying a great deal they wore baggy woolen trousers in a checked pattern of ocher and woad blue a trokm style pretty soon gerin realized he was going to have to put them in tunics too for tharma would start growing breasts before too much time went by the fox didnt know how long monsters took to reach puberty he did know geroge and tharma were about eleven years old monsters like them had overrun the northlands then after a fearsome earthquake released them from the caverns under the temple of the god biton where theyd been confined for hundreds maybe thousands of years the efforts of mere mortals hadnt sufficed to drive the monsters back either gerin had had to evoke both biton who saw past and future and mavrix the sithonian god of wine fertility and beauty to rout them from the land before hed done that hed found a pair of monster cubs and had not killed them though he and his comrades had slain their mother when mavrix banished the monsters from the surface of the world biton had mocked his sloppy work implying some of the creatures still remained in the northlands gerin had wondered then if they were the pair hed spared and wondered again a year later when a shepherd whod apparently raised geroge and tharma as pets till then brought them to him he thought it likely but had no way to prove it the shepherd had been maddeningly vague he did know no other monsters had ever turned up not in all these years having two monsters around was interesting especially since they seemed bright for their kind which made them about as smart as stupid people theyd grown up side by side with his own children younger than duren but older than dagref the foxs older son by selatre they were careful with their formidable strength and never used their fearsome teeth for anything but eating but soon tharma would be a womanwell an adult female monsterand geroge mature as well the fox was anything but certain he wanted more than two monsters in the northlands and just as uncertain what if anything to do about it hed kept putting off a decision by telling himself he didnt yet need to worry that was still true but wouldnt be much longer take that in to the cooks he told geroge venison steaks tonight roast venison venison ribs geroge slung the gutted deer over his shoulder and carried it into the castle tharma followed him as she usually did although sometimes he followed her she ran her tongue across her wide thin lips at the prospect of plenty of meat i need more ale walamund muttered were supposed to eat alongside those horrible things they dont mind gerin said you shouldnt either walamund sent him a resentful glare but the memory of recent punishment remained fresh enough to keep the serf from saying anything geroge and tharma came out into the courtyard again this time accompanied by dagref and his younger sister clotild and by vans daughter maeva and his son kor behind the children strode fand you might have told me you were back she said to van a trokm lilt to her elabonian though shed lived south of the niffet since shortly after the werenight a breeze blew a couple of strands of coppery hair in front of her face she brushed them aside with her hand she was perhaps five years younger than van but beginning to go gray he stared over toward her i might have done lots of things he rumbled fand set hands on hips aye you might have but did you now no not a bit of a bit hopped in the car you did instead and went off ahunting with not a thought in your head for aught else who would have room for thoughts with your eternal din echoing round in his head van retorted they shouted at each other gerin turned to nania fetch them each the biggest jack of ale we have he said quietly the serving girl hurried away and returned with two jacks each filled so full ale slopped over the side to make its own libation gerin knew he was gambling if van and fand were still angry at each other by the time they got to the bottom of the jacks theyd quarrel harder than ever because of the ale theyd drunk a lot of the time though their fights were like rain squalls blowing up suddenly fierce while they lasted and soon gone maeva gave dagref a shove he staggered but stayed on his feet the two of them were very much of a size though he had a year on her maeva showed every promise of having much of her fathers enormous physical prowess gerin wondered if the world was ready for a woman warrior able to best almost any man ready or not the world was liable to face the prospect in a few years clotild said no kor dont put that rock in your mouth instead of putting it in his mouth he threw it at her fortunately he missed he had a temper hed surely acquired from fand fouryearolds were not the most selfcontrolled people under any circumstances a fouryearold whose mother was fand was a conflagration waiting to happen van and fand upended their drinking jacks at about the same time gerin waited to see what would happen next when what happened next was nothing he allowed himself a tiny pat on the back he glanced over at fand hard to imagine these days that he and van had once shared her favors getting to know selatre afterwards was like coming into a calm harbor after a storm at sea the fox shook his head that that image occurred to him proved only that hed done more reading than just about anyone else in the northlands which though undoubtedly true wasnt saying much hed never been on the orynian oceanwhich lapped against the shore of the northlands far to the westor any other sea shadows lengthened and began to gray toward twilight a bronze horn sounded a long hoarse sour note in the peasant village a few hundred yards from fox keep a signal for the serfs to come to their huts from out of the fields both for supper and to keep themselves safe from the ghosts that roamed and ravened through the night van looked around to gauge the hour he nodded approval the new headman keeps em at it longer than besant bigbelly did he said there were times when hed blow the horn halfway through the afternoon seemed like thats so gerin agreed the peasants mourned for days after that tree fell on him last winter not surprising is it they knew theyd have to work harder with anybody else over them lazy buggers van said the fox shrugged nobody much likes to work sometimes you have to though or you pay for it later some people never do figure that out so they need a headman who can get the most from em without making em hate him he was happy to talk about work with his friend anything to distract van from yet another squabble with fand fand however didnt feel like being distracted and some people now she said are after calling others lazy while they their ownselves do whatever it is pleases them and not a lick of aught else ill give you a lick across the side of your head van said and took a step toward her aye belike you will and one fine day youll wake up beside me all nice and dead with a fine slim dagger slid between your ribs fand said now in grim earnest van did hit her every once in a while brawling for him was a sport she hit him too and clawed and bit the outlander was generally mindful of his great strength and did not use all of it save in war and hunting when fand was in a temper she was mindful of nothing and no one save her own fury van said by all the gods in all the lands ive ever seen ill wake up beside somebody else then and i pity the poor dear whoever she is fand shot back sure and its nobbut fools luckthe only kind a fool like yous after havingyouve not brought me back a sickness what with your rutting like a stoat as if im the only one you faithless van clapped a hand to his forehead speechless despite the many languages he knew gerin turned to trasamir who happened to be standing closest to him isnt love a wonderful thing he murmured what trasamir scratched his head another one who wouldnt recognize irony if it came up and bit him on the leg the fox thought sadly he wished he had the wisdom of a god to say the perfect thing to make van and fand stop quarreling with that hed probably need other divine powers to make sure they didnt start up again the moment his back was turned selatre came out to the entrance to the great hall suppers ready she called to the people gathered in the courtyard everyone van and fand included trooped toward the castle gerin chuckled under his breath he hadnt known what to say to get van and fand to break off their fight but selatre had maybe she was divinely wise the notion wasnt altogether frivolous selatre had been bitons sibyl at ikos delivering the prophecies of the farseeing god to those who sought his wisdom until the earthquake that released the monsters tumbled the gods shrine in ruins had gerin and van not rescued her while she lay in entranced sleep the creatures from the caverns below would have made short work of her bitons sybil had to be a maiden not only that she was forbidden so much as to touch an entire man eunuchs and women attended her selatre had reckoned herself profaned by gerins touch plainly she would have preferred him to leave her in her bed for the monsters to devour so matters had stood then now eleven years three living children and one small grave later selatre tilted up her face as gerin came back into castle fox he brushed his lips against hers she smiled and took his hand they walked back toward the foxs place of honor near the hearth and near the altar to dyaus close by it the fatwrapped thighbones of the stag van geroge and tharma had killed smoked on the altar selatre pointed to them so the king of the gods gets venison tonight hed better not be the only one gerin said in a voice intended to carry back to the kitchens or therell be some cooks fleeing through the night with ghosts baying at their heels to drive them mad a serving girl set rounds of thick chewy bread on the table in front of each feaster when another servitor plopped a couple of stillsizzling ribs on gerins flatbread it sopped up the grease and juices the fox reached out to a wooden saltcellar in front of him and sprinkled some salt onto the meat i wish we had pepper he said fondly remembering the spices that had come up from the south till the empire of elabon sealed off the last mountain pass just before the werenight be thankful we still have salt selatre said were beginning to run low on that it hasnt been coming up the niffet from the coast as it used to since the gradi started raiding a couple of years ago the gradi gerin muttered under his breath as if the northlands didnt have troubles enough without them north of the niffet lay the forests in which the trokmoi dwelt or rather had dwelt for the fairhaired barbarians had swarmed south over the niffet near the time of the werenight and many still remained some like fand among elabonians others such as gerins vassal adiatunnus in place of the locals whom they had subjected driven away or slain the homeland of the gradi lay north of the trokm country before coming down into elabon van had been through the lands of both the gradi and the trokmoi gerin had seen a couple of gradi at ikos once too big paleskinned men with black hair sweltering in furs but for the most part the trokmoi had kept the elabonians from learning much about the gradi and having much to do with them so it had been for generations as selatre had said though the gradi had lately begun harrying the northlands coastal regions by sea maybe theyd got word of disorder in the northlands and decided to take advantage of it maybe too their raids had nothing to do with whatever was going on locally but had been spawned by some convulsion in their own country gerin did not know too much we dont know about the gradi he said more to himself than to anyone else though he styled himself prince of the north his power did not extend to the coast none of the barons and dukes and petty lordlets by the sea acknowledged his suzerainty if they were learning about the seaborne raiders they kept that knowledge to themselves selatre said ive been through the scrolls and codices in the library trouble is they dont say anything about the gradi except that there is such a people and they live north of the trokmoi gerin set his hand on hers thanks for looking when hed brought her back to fox keep from ikos hed taught her letters and set her in charge of the motley collection of volumes he called a library more to give her a place of her own here than in the expectation she would make much of it but make something of it she had she was as zealous now as he in finding manuscripts and adding them to the collection and even more zealous in going through the ones they had and squeezing knowledge from them if she said the books told little about the gradi she knew whereof she spoke she glanced down at the table compliments of any sort made her nervous a trait she shared with gerin and one that set them apart from most elabonians for whom bragging came natural as breathing what are we going to do about the gradi father duren asked from across the table what can we do about them watch and wait and worry gerin answered are they just raiding do you suppose or will they come to settle when they see how fragmented that part of the northlands is selatre asked the fox picked up his drinking jack and raised it in salute congratulations he told his wife youve given me something brand new to worry about here i spend half my time trying to figure out how to bundle the trokmoi back across the niffet from what ought to be a purely elabonian land and now i have to think about adding gradi to the mix he gulped ale and spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert the evil omen selatre sent him a look he could not fathom until she murmured a purely elabonian land well in a manner of speaking he said feeling his cheeks heat selatres ancestors had dwelt in the northlands for years uncounted before ros the fierce added the province to the empire of elabon theyd taken on elabonian ways readily enough and most of them spoke elabonian these days which was what had led him to make his remark still differences lingered selatres features were finer and more delicate than they would have been had she sprung of elabonian stock her narrow pointed chin was a marker for those of her blood i know what you meant she said her voice mischievous but since you pride yourself on being so often right i thought surely you would take the correction in good part gerin enjoyed being told he was wrong even by his wife no more than most other men but before he could come back with a reply sardonic enough to suit him one of walamunds relatives shouted at trasamir i know how you got that cursed dog to come when you called it you the suggestion was remarkable for both its originality and its obscenity the fox sprang to his feet he could feel a vein pulse in his forehead and was sure the old scar above one eye had gone pale a sure sign he was furious and furious he was you he snapped his voice slicing through the racket in the great hall walamunds kinsman looked over to him in surprise the fox jerked a thumb toward the doorway out you can sleep in the courtyard on the grass and wash your mouth with water not my good ale for ill waste no more of that on you on your way home tomorrow think about keeping your mind out of the midden but lord prince i only meant the fellow began i dont care what you meant i care what you said gerin told him and i told you out and out i meant one more word and it wont be out of the castle itll be out of the keep and you can take your chances with wolves and night ghosts where no torches and sacrifices hold them at bay the foulmouthed peasant gulped nodded and did not speak he hurried out into the night leaving thick clotted silence behind him now gerin said into it where were we no one seemed to remember or to feel like hazarding a guess van said i dont know where we were but i know where im going he picked up kor whod fallen asleep on the bench beside him and headed for the stairs fand and maeva followed off to the big bed they all shared the quarrel between van and fand hadnt flared again so maybe it would be forgotten till the next time tomorrow or ten days down the road once upon a time duren had been in the habit of falling asleep at feasts gerin sighed remembering things like that and comparing them to how matters stood these days was a sign he wasnt getting any younger he looked around for duren and didnt see him he wouldnt be out in the courtyard not with only a drunken swillmouthed peasant for company more likely he was back in the kitchens or in a corridor leading off from them trying to slip his hands under a serving girls tunic hed probably succeed too he was handsome reasonably affable and the son of the local lord to boot gerin remembered his own fumblings along those lines dyaus what a puppy i was he muttered selatre raised one eyebrow he didnt think shed done that when he first brought her to fox keep she must have got it from him whats that in aid of she asked not much believe me he answered with a wry chuckle shall we follow van and bring our children up to bed too their younger son named blestar after selatres father gerin having named duren and dagref for his own brother and father whom the trokmoi had slain lay snoring in her lap he had only a couple of years to him dagref and clotild were both trying to pretend they hadnt just yawned the fox gathered them up by eye upstairs we go he declared oh papa do we have to dagref said through another yawn along with belief in the gods all children seemed to share an abiding faith that they had to deny the need for sleep under any and all circumstances gerin did his best to look severe where his children were concerned his best was none too good and he knew it he said do you know what would happen to anyone else who presumed to argue with the prince of the north youd cut off his head or maybe stew him with prunes dagref said cheerfully gerin whod been taking a last swig from his drinking jack sprayed ale onto the tabletop dagref said if duren argued with you would you stew him with prunes or isnt he part of everybody else down in the city of elabon theyd had special schools to train the officials who interpreted the ancient and complex code of laws by which the empire of elabon functioned the hairsplitting in which those schools indulged had once struck gerin who reveled in minutiae himself as slightly mad who could not only make such minute distinctions but enjoy doing it watching dagref grow he regretted being unable to send the boy south for legal training when he got upstairs he opened the door to the chamber he shared with his wife and children and went inside to bring out a lamp he lighted it at one of the torches flickering in a bronze wall sconce in the hallway then used its weak glow to let selatre go into the chamber and set blestar at the edge of the big bed dagref and clotild took turns using the chamber pot that stood by the side of the bed before getting in themselves muttering sleepy goodnights the straw in the mattress rustled as they lay down dont blow out the lamp selatre said quietly i need the pot myself so do i as a matter of fact the fox answered ale he wondered if duren would disturb them coming back later in the night he didnt think so he doubted his elder son would be sleeping in this bed tonight just in case though he shut the door without barring it after he shoved the chamber pot against the wall so duren wouldnt knock it over if he did come in he blew out the lamp darkness and the heavy smell of hot fat filled the bedchamber the night was mild not so much so that he felt like getting out of tunic and trousers and sleeping in his drawers as he would when summer came but enough that he didnt drag a thick wool blanket up over his chin and put a hot stone wrapped in flannel by his feet he sighed and wriggled and twisted away from a stem of straw that was poking him in the ribs beside him selatre was making the same small adjustments blestar snored on a surprisingly musical note dagref and clotild wiggled around like their parents also trying to get comfortable stop poking me clotild complained i wasnt poking you i was just stretching out dagref answered maddeningly precise as usual if i poke you thats something i do on purpose usually he would add like this and demonstrate tonight he didnt that proved he was tired clotild didnt snap back at him either before long their breathing smoothed out gerin yawned and stretched himselfcarefully so as not to bother anyone else he yawned again trying to lure sleep by sympathetic magic sleep declined to be lured selatre was breathing very quietly which meant she too was likely to be awake when she slept she sometimes snored gerin had never said anything about it he wondered if he did the same if he did selatre hadnt mentioned it wonderful woman he thought her voice reached him a tiny thread of whisper have you fallen asleep yes quite a while ago he answered just as softly dagref hadnt poked clotild selatre did poke him now right in the ribs and found a sensitive spot he had all he could do not to writhe and kick one of his children she started to poke him again he grabbed her arm and pulled her close to him that being the fastest way he could think of to keep her questing finger from making him jerk again you cheat she said thats the only ticklish spot you have and you wont let me get to it i cheat he agreed and covered her right breast with his left hand through the thin linen of her long tunic her nipple stiffened at his touch the feel of her body pressed against his made him stiffen too he felt one eyebrow quirk upward into a question but she couldnt see that in the dark he put it into words do you think theyre sleeping soundly enough yet all we can do is find out she answered if they do wake up it would fluster you more than me i grew up in a peasants hut remember the whole of it about the size of this room i never imagined having so much space as i found first at ikos and then here at fox keep thinking of the raised eyebrow hed wasted he said well if my ears turn red itll be too dark for the children to notice he kissed her then which struck him as a better idea under the circumstancesand indeed generallythan talking about his ears his hand slid down from her breast to tug up the hem of her tunic they didnt hurry both because they didnt want to wake the children and because after a good many years together friendly familiarity had taken the edge off passion presently selatre rolled over onto her side facing away from gerin she lifted her top leg a little to let him slide in from behind a quiet way of joining in more ways than one her breath sighed out as he entered her to the hilt he reached over her to tease at her nipple again the edge might have gone from their passion but a solid core remained after theyd finished selatre said did you put the pot by the wall i think id better use it again she slid out of bed and groped her way toward it gerin meanwhile separated his clothes from hers and got back into them he suspected he had his drawers on backward but resolved not to worry about it till morning when selatre came back to bed she put her drawers and tunic back on too then leaned over and unerringly planted a kiss on the end of his nose he squeezed her if i wasnt sleepy before he said i am nowor pleasantly tired anyhow selatre laughed at him you saved yourself in the nick of time there didnt you considering the history of this place since i took the rule after my father was killed how could i do it any other way gerin replied and settled down to sleep laughing still almost without voice selatre snuggled against him his eyelids were growing heavy when the bed frame in the next chamber started to creak selatre giggled a sound different from her earlier laughter maeva must have stayed awake longer than our brood did or maybe kor woke up just to be difficult gerin answered he has his mothers temper all the way through hed better be a good swordsman when he grows up because i have the feeling hell need to be selatre listened to the noises from the far side of the wall for a moment then said his fathers quite the mighty swordsman by all ive seen thats true any way you care to have it mean gerin agreed its because of that i suppose that he and fand are able to make up their quarrels i almost wonder if they have them for the sake of making up youre joking selatre said after shed thought it over though she shook her head against his chest no youre not joking but what an appalling notion i couldnt live like that neither could i he said remembering fights hed had with fand back in the days when she was his lover as well as vans my hair and beard would be white not going gray if i tried but one of the things ive slowly come to figure out through the years is that not everybody works the same way i do some people never do figure that out selatre yawned one of the things ive slowly come to figure out over the years is that i cant do without sleep good night good night gerin said he wasnt sure his wife even heard him now her breathing was as deep and regular andhe smiled a littleraspy as that of their children sleep swallowed him moments later the peasants set out for their village early the next morning trasamir longshanks leading swifty the hound on a rope leash walamunds relative rather to the foxs disappointment seemed not much worse for wear after his night in the courtyard uncharitably gerin wondered how often hed passed out drunk between houses in his hamlet bread and ale and cheese and an apple did for gerins breakfast he was going down to see how the apples were holding out in the cellar when the lookout yelled a horseman approaching from out of the south lord prince gerin went out to the doorway of the great hall a horseman he called up not a chariot a horseman the sentry repeated one of our men without a doubt he was right about that the idea of getting up on a horses back rather than traveling in wagon or chariot or cart was new in the northlands as far as gerin could discover as far as widely traveled van could say it was new in all the world one of the foxs vassals duin the bold had come up with a trick that made staying mounted much easier wooden rings that hung down from either side of a pad strapped around the horses girth so a man could use his hands for bow or spear without the risk of going over the animals back duin though had died fighting the trokmoi just after the werenight without his driving energy the device he invented advanced more slowly than it would have otherwise if your father had ridden to war in a chariot and your grandfather and his grandfather its rihwin the fox lord prince the sentry reported when the rider came close enough to recognize him i might have known gerin muttered that was true for a couple of reasons for one rihwin had been some time away from fox keep a couple of times a year he went out to see how his numerous bastards were doing and no doubt to try to sire some more of them he had a fairsized troop of byblows scattered widely over the lands where gerins suzerainty ran so his expeditions ate up a good deal of time and for another his love for the new extended to more than women hed come north with gerin from the civilized heart of the empire of elabon bare days before the werenight for no better reason than that he craved adventure had riding horses been old and chariotry new he would no doubt have become an enthusiastic advocate for the chariot as things were he probably spent more time on horseback than any other man in the northlands the gate crew let down the drawbridge rihwin rode into the courtyard of fox keep he waved a salute to gerin saying i greet you lord prince my fellow fox valiant for your vassals protector of your peasants mild to merchants and fierce against your foes youve been in the northlands fifteen years and more now gerin said as rihwin dismounted and you still talk like a toff from the city not only did rihwin have a soft southern accent he also remained fond of the elaborate phrasing and archaic vocabulary nobles from the city of elabon used to show they had too much time on their hands a stable boy came up to lead rihwins horse to its stall thank you lad he murmured before turning back to gerin and why should i not proclaim my essence to the world at large a hand went up to the large gold hoop he wore in his left ear so far as gerin knewand he likely knew more of the northlands than anyone else aliveno other man north of the high kirs followed that style rihwin save for keeping you out of the alepot as best i can ive long since given up trying to make you over he said rihwin bowed his handsome mobile features twisting into a sly smile no small concession that lord prince and in good sooth i know it well for where else has the victorious and puissant prince of the north retreated from any venture to which he set his hand i hadnt looked at it so gerin said thoughtfully you tempt me to go back to trying to reform you rihwin made a face at him they both laughed gerin went on and how is your brood faring these days i have a new daughterthe mother says shes mine anyhow and since i lay with her at around the proper time im willing to believe herbut i lost a son rihwins face clouded casscar had only three years scarlet fever his mother said the gods be kind to his ghost his mother was crying still though it happened not long after i saw her last shell be grieving till they bury her gerin said remembering the loss he and selatre had had he shook his head you know you shouldnt risk loving a child when its very small for so many of them never do live to grow big but you cant help it its how the gods made us i suppose about half the time maybe more a remark like that would have led rihwin to make a philosophical rejoinder and he and gerin could have killed a pleasant stretch of time arguing about the nature of the gods and the reasons theyd made men and women as they had the two of them were the only men in the northlands of whom gerin knew whod had a proper education down in the city of elabon that perforce kept them friendly even when they wore on each other in an important way they spoke the same language but now rihwin said the other thing i wanted to tell you lord prince is something interesting i heard when i was out in the west out well past schild stoutstaffs holding when i went that way a few years ago i met this yellowhaired trokm wench named grainne and one thing leading to another these days i have myself a daughter in that village the gods grant she does live to grow up for shell delight many a mans eye she gerin stared down his nose at him has this tale a point beyond the charm and grace of your daughter i mean if not youll have to listen to me going on about my children in return oh i do that all the time anyhow rihwin said blithely whereas you need only put up with me a couple of times a year gerin staggered back as if hed taken a thrust mortal chuckling rihwin said as a matter of fact though lord prince the tale indeed has a point though i own to being unsure precisely what it is this village you see lies hard by the niffet and did you get word of more trokmoi planning to raid or worse settle gerin demanded ill hit them if you did and hit them hard too cursed many woodsrunners this side of the niffet already if you will let me finish the tale lord prince rather than consistently interrupting some of these queries may perhaps be answered rihwin replied gerin kicked at the grass annoyed at himself rihwin had caught him out twice running now the southerner went on grainne told me that not so long before i came to visit shed seen a new kind of boat on the river like nothing on which shed ever set eyes before well what does she know of boats gerin said she wouldnt have been down to the city of elabon now would she to watch galleys on the greater inner sea all shell have ever seen are little rowboats and rafts and those round little coracle things the trokmoi make out of hides stretched over a wicker frame youd have to be a trokm to build a boat that doesnt know its front from its backside he held up his hands no wait im not interrupting tell me how this one was different the niffet bends a trifle a few furlongs west of grainnes village rihwin said theres a grove of beeches at the bend with mushrooms growing under them she was out gathering them with a wicker basketwhich she showed me as corroborating evidence for whatever it may be worthwhen through a screening of ferns she spied this boat eventually my fellow fox youre going to tell me about it gerin said why not now rihwin gave him a hurt look before going on as you say lord prince by her description it was far larger than anything that moved on the water shed ever seen before with a mast and sail and with some large but i fear indeterminate number of rowers laboring to either side a war galley of some sort gerin said and rihwin nodded gerin continued you say she saw it through ferns lucky the rowers didnt spot her or theyd likely have grabbed her and held her down and had their fun before they cut her throat thatd be so no matter who they wereand so far as i know nobodys ever put a war galley on the niffet do you suppose the empire of elabon has decided it wants the northlands back after all under his indolent majesty hildor iii rihwins mobile features assumed a dubious expression it is lord prince improbable but then he looked thoughtful on the other hand weve had no word or next to it out of elabon proper since the werenight which is by now most of a generation past who can say with certainty whether the indolent posterior of hildor iii still warms the elabonian throne a distinct point gerin said if it is the imperials rihwin raised a forefinger as you have several times in the course of this conversation lord prince you break in before i was able to impart salient information while the ship and men grainne saw may have been elabonians two significant features make me doubt it first while her elabonian is fluentmuch on the order of fands including the spice thereofshe could not follow the sailors speech admittedly the ship was out on the river so this is not decisive but have you ever heard of an elabonian ship mounting the shields of oarsmen and warriors between rowing benches gerin thought back to his days in the city of elabon and to the galleys hed seen on the sea and tied up at the quays he shook his head no they always stow them down flat which leaves he and rihwin spoke together the gradi thats bad gerin said he kicked again at the dirt and paced back and forth thats very bad as a matter of fact having them raid the seacoast is one thing but if they start bringing ships up the niffet father dyaus a flotilla of them could beach right there a few furlongs from fox keep and land more men than we could hope to hold away from the walls and wed have scant warning of it too i need to send out messengers right away to start setting up a river watch it will not happen tomorrow lord prince rihwin said soothingly grainne watched this vessel turn around at the river bend and make its way back toward the west the gradi have not found castle fox not yet gerin answered he borrowed trouble as automatically as he breathed having seen from long experience that it came to him whether he borrowed or not and that it was better met ahead of time when that proved possible the gradi however were not the only trouble he had nor the most urgent he asked rihwin when you rode out to visit all your lady loves did you go through adiatunnus holding lord prince i had intended to rihwin answered but when i came up to the margins of the lands he rules as your vassal his guardsmen turned me away calling me nothing but a stinking southron spy hes not yet paid his feudal dues this year either gerins dark eyebrows lowered like stormclouds my guess is he doesnt intend to pay them hes spent the last ten years being sorry he ever swore me fealty and hell try breaking loose if he sees the chance i would praise your wisdom more were what you foresee less obviously true rihwin answered oh indeed gerin said all i had to do to gain his allegiance last time was work a miracle adiatunnus had made alliance with the monsters from under the temple at ikos when at gerins urging mavrix and biton routed them from the northlands the proud trokm chieftain was overawed into recognizing the fox as his overlord now gerin sighed and if i want to keep that allegiance all i have to do is work another one again you have delivered an accurate summary of the situation rihwin agreed provided you mean keeping that allegiance through peaceable means he may well prove amenable to persuasion by force however always assuming we win the war yes gerins scowl grew blacker still well need to gather together a goodly force before we try it though adiatunnus has made himself the biggest man among the trokmoi who came over the niffet in the time of the werenight a whole great host of them will fight for him i fear you have the right of it once more rihwin said he has even retained his stature among the woodsrunners while remaining your vassal no mean application of the political art as you say suppressing him can it be done will involve summoning up all your other retainers which might give grand duke aragis the excuse he needs to hit my southern frontier gerin said the archer will recognize weakness when he sees it the only reason he and i dont fight is that hes never seen it from metill now will you then let adiatunnus persist in his insolence rihwin asked that would be unlike you so it would gerin said and if i do hell be attacking me by this time next year what choice have i my fellow fox if i dont enforce my suzerainty how long will i keep it not long rihwin answered too right gerin kicked at the dirt once more ive always known id sooner have been a scholar than a baron let alone a prince with old friends gerin refused to take his title seriously there are times though when i think id sooner have run an inn like turgis son of turpin down in the city of elabon than be a princeor practiced any other honest trade and some of the dishonest ones too well why not run off and start yourself an inn then rihwin poked his tongue into his cheek to show he didnt intend to be taken seriously his hands deftly sketched the outlines of a big square building by the gods i can see it now the hostelry of gerin the fox all complaints cheerfully ignored how the dour elabonians and woaddyed trokmoi would throng to it as a haven from their journeys across the northlands to plunder one another you sirrah are a desperately deranged man gerin said rihwin bowed as if hed just received a great compliment which was not the effect gerin had wanted to create he plunged ahead and if i did start an inn whod keep the trokmoi and the elaboniansto say nothing of the gradifrom plundering me by all means let us say nothing of the gradi rihwin said i wish my lady love there had never set eyes on that ship of theirs father dyaus willing none of us will see such ships with our own eyes but gerin refused to turn aside from the inn he did not and never would have the only way to keep such a place is to have an overlord strong enough to hold bandits at bay and wise enough not to rob you himself and where is such a fellow to be found aragis the archer is strong enough rihwin said teasingly were i a bandit in his duchy id sooner leap off a cliff than let him get his hands on me gerin nodded if he were less able id worry about him less but one fine day hell die and all his sons and all his barons will squabble over his lands in a war thatll make the unending mess in bevons holding look like a childrens game by comparison well not have that here i think when im gone there i think you have reason lord prince rihwin said and so being the best of rulers needs must continue in that present post without regard for your obvious and sadly wasted talents as taverner go howl gerin said throwing his hands in the air i know too well im stuck with the bloody job it is a hardship you know on account of it i have to listen to loons like you oh i am cut to the quick rihwin staggered about as if pierced by an arrow then miraculously recovered actually i believe i shall go in and drink some ale that accomplished i shall take more pleasure in howling with a bow to gerin he hied himself off toward the great hall try not to drink so much you forget your name gerin called after him the only answer rihwin gave was a fingertwiddling wave gerin sighed short of locking up the ale jars he couldnt cut rihwin off his fellow fox didnt turn sullen or vicious when he drank he remained cheerful amiable and quite brightbut he could be bright in the most alarmingly foolish ways gerin worried about how often he got drunk but gerin by nature worried about everything that went on around him right now though worrying about rihwin went into the queue along with worrying about the gradi both were a long way behind worrying about adiatunnus the trokm chieftain was liable to have the strength to set up on his own if he chose to repudiate gerins overlordship and if he did set up on his own the first thing hed do would be to start raiding the lands of gerins vassals even more than he was already the fox muttered something unpleasant into his beard realizing he never was going to be able to drive all the trokmoi out of the northlands and back across the niffet into their gloomy forests came hard one of the bitter things life taught you was that not all your dreams came true no matter how you worked to make them real up in the watchtower atop castle fox the lookout shouted a chariot approaches lord prince just one gerin asked like any sensible ruler he made sure trees and undergrowth were trimmed well away from the keep and from the roads in his holding the better to make life difficult for bandits and robbers aye lord prince just the one the sentry answered gerin had chosen his lookouts from among the longersighted men in his holding as it had a few times before that proved valuable now after a few heartbeats the lookout said its widin simrins son lord prince the drawbridge had not gone up after rihwin arrived widins driver guided his twohorse team into the keep widin jumped out of the car before it stopped rolling he was a strong goodlooking young man in his late twenties and had held a barony southwest of fox keep for more than half his life his father had died in the chaos after the werenight whenever gerin saw him he was reminded of simrin good to see you gerin said and then because widins keep was a couple of days travel away and men seldom traveled without urgent need he added whats toward lord prince its that thieving skulking demon of an adiatunnus thats what widin burst out worrying about the trokmoi was already at the head of gerins list which was the only thing that kept it from vaulting higher widin went on hes run off cattle and sheep both and burned a peasant village for the sport of it best i can tell has he gerin asked widin who had never studied philosophy did not know a rhetorical question when he heard one and so nodded vigorously gerin was used to such from his vassals it no longer depressed him as it once had he said if adiatunnus is at war with one of my vassals hes also at war with me he will pay for what hes done to you and pay more than he ever expected his voice held such cold fury that even widin whod brought him this word in hope of raising a response drew back a pace lord prince you sound like you aim to tumble his keep down around his ears that would be a big war gerin broke in widin nodded again this time responsively gerin went on sooner or later adiatunnus and i are going to fight a big war id rather do it now on my terms than later on his the gods have decreed that we cant send all the woodsrunners back over the niffet be it so then but we cani hopekeep them under control if we cant do even that much whats left of civilization in the northlands not much widin said now gerin nodded but as he did so he reflected that even with the trokmoi beaten not much civilization was left in the northlands ii chariots and a few horsemen rolled out of fox keep over the next couple of days heading east and west and south to summon gerins vassals and their retainers to his castle for the war against adiatunnus he sent out the men heading west with more than a little apprehension they would have to pass through schild stoutstaffs holding on the way to the rest of the barons who recognized the fox as their overlord and schild sometimes was almost as balky a vassal as adiatunnus himself duren went wild with excitement when gerin decided on war now i can fight beside you father he said squeezing the fox in a tight embrace now maybe i can earn myself an ekename duren the fool perhaps gerin suggested mildly duren stared at him he sighed feeling like a piece of antiquity unaccountably left adrift in the presentday world i dont suppose theres any use telling you this isnt sport were talking about you really maim you really kill you can really get maimed you can really get killed you can prove your manhood no duren wasnt listening tumbling a serving girl is all very wellbetter than all very wellbut to fight to battle your enemy with brightedged bronzeisnt that what the poet says thats what lekapenos says all right you quoted him very well gerin looked up to the sky what was he supposed to do with a boy wild for war did justifying being wild for war by quoting from the great sithonian epic poem mean duren was properly civilized himself or did it mean he as the trokmoi sometimes did had acquired a civilized veneer with which to justify his barbaric impulses father dyaus gave no answers van came out of castle fox duren ran over to him saying itll be war isnt that wonderful oh aye its wonderful if you come through in one piece van answered duren took the half of the answer he was hoping to hear and went into the hall singing a bloodthirsty song that had nothing to do with lekapenos gerin knew the minstrel who fool that he was had translated it from the tongue of the trokmoi van turned round to look after duren he chuckled the fire burns hot in him fox i know gerin didnt try hiding that the fire didnt burn hot in him he said this is needful but and shrugged ahh whats the matter you dont want to be a hero van teased ive been a hero over and over again gerin answered and what has it brought me besides always another war not bloody much you hadnt decided to be a hero when you went to rescue selatre from the monsters you wouldnt have the wife youve got now his friend pointed out youd not have three of your children either you might still be sharing fand with me instead you know van rolled his eyes now youve given me a defense of heroism indeed gerin said both men laughed gerin went on but i dont see you rushing toward the fight the way you once did either van looked down at his toes im not so young as i used to be either he said as if the admission embarrassed him some days im forced to remember it my bones creak my sight is getting long my wind is shorter than it used to be i cant futter three times a night every night any more he shook his head if you knew how long you were going to be old youd enjoy the time when youre younger more gerin snorted if youd done any more enjoying while you were younger either you or the world wouldnt have lived through it maybe you and the world both ah well you have something there van answered but its like you said captain ive been a hero too and now what am i im the fellow who if some trokm brings me down and takes my head to nail over his doorposts i turn him into a hero so they come after me whatever fight i happen to be in and after a while it starts to wear thin there you have it gerin agreed after a while it starts to wear thin and the ones who do come after you theyre always the young hot eager ones and when youre not so young any more and not so eager any more and it has to be done anyhow then it turns into work as if we were serfs going out to weed the fields except we pull up lives instead of nettles but nettles dont uproot themselves and try pulling you up if you leave em in the fields van observed he looked thoughtful cant you magic adiatunnus to death if you dont fancy fighting him not you too the fox gave his friend a massively dubious look hearing vassals and peasants plead cases before him for years had given him a firstrate look of that description hardened warrior though van was he gave back a pace before it gerin said i could try spelling adiatunnus i suppose i would try it if i didnt think i was likelier to send myself to the five hells than the cursed trokm putting a halftrained wizard to work is like turning a halftrained cook loose in the kitchen you dont know what hell do but you have a pretty good idea itll turn out bad honh van shook his head again all this time as a prince and you still dont think youre as good as you really are all the magics youve tried that i know of theyve worked fine thats only because you dont know everything there is to know gerin retorted ask rihwin about his ear one day its not a story hes proud of but he may tell it to you and if you try working a spell with death in it youll get a death all right one way or another whats the good of having all those whatdoyoucallemsgrimoiresin your bookhoard if you wont use em i didnt say i wouldnt use them gerin snapped i do use themfor small things safe things where even if i go wrong the disaster will be small too and for things so great that having the magic fail wont be a bigger catastrophe than not trying it putting paid to adiatunnus is neither the one nor the other honh van repeated i may be turning into an old man but youre turning into an old woman youll pay for that by dyaus gerin sprang at the bigger man got a foot behind his ankle shoved and knocked van to the ground with an angry roar the outlander hooked an arm around the foxs leg and dragged him down too but gerin managed to land on top men came running from all parts of the keep to watch them wrestle as gerin tried to keep van from tearing his shoulder out of its socket he reflected that theyd been grappling with each other for too many years when theyd first begun his tricks had let him beat van as often as he lost now van knew all the tricks and he was still bigger and stronger than the fox im the prince curse it gerin panted doesnt that entitle me to win van laughed at him any ruler in the northlands who tried to make more of his rank than was due him got laughed at even aragis strength wouldnt serve the usual tricks wouldnt serve which leftwhat van tried to throw gerin away to the outlanders surprise gerin let him the fox flew through the air and landed with a thud and a groan as if hed had the wind knocked out of him blood up van leaped onto him to finish the job of pinning him to the dirt gerin stuck an elbow right into the pit of the outlanders stomach van folded up it wasnt anything he wanted to do but he couldnt help himself he had to fight to breathe and for the first moments of that fight you always seemed to yourself to be losing gerin had no trouble pinning him instead of the other way round van finally managed to suck in a couple of hissing gasps fox youcheat he wheezed his face a dusky red because he was so short of air i know gerin said cheerfully when his friend could breathe again he helped pull him to his feet most of the time they pay off on what you do not how you do it and i thought i had all your tricks down van sounded chagrined not angry it got to the point where you hadnt come up with anything new in so long i didnt think you could shows what i know shows i got tired of having that great tun you call a body squashing me flat every time we wrestled gerin answered actually i used that ploy of seeming helpless against aengus the trokmremember him the chief of the clan balamung the wizard came from i let the air out of him with my sword not my elbow felt like your sword van grumbled lifting up his tunic as if to see whether he was punctured he had a red mark where gerins elbow had got home it would probably turn into a bruise but considering the scars that furrowed his skin reminders of a lifetime of wandering and strife the mark was hardly worth noting he rubbed at himself and let the tunic fall i should have been wearing my corselet then youd have banged your elbow and not my poor middle and you talk about me cheating gerin said full of mock dudgeon so i do van said dyou care to wrestle again to see if you can befool me twice are you daft gerin answered these days its a gift from the gods when i can fool you once im going in for a jack of ale to celebrate van trailed after him undoubtedly having in mind a jack of ale with which to drown his own discomfiture before gerin got to the entrance of the great hall someone small came dashing out and kicked him in the shin dont you hurt my papa kor shouted when gerin bent down and tried to move him aside he snapped at the foxs hand easy there boy van picked up his son he didnt do me any great harm and it was a fair fight no talk of illicit elbows now van carefully gentled kor down his son took after fand in temperament and gerin supposed the patience van needed to live with herwhen he did live with hercame in handy for trying to keep the boy somewhere near calm too after his ale gerin went out to the peasant village close by the keep he had a pretty good notion of how the village stood for supplies and how much it could spare when his vassals and their retainers started arriving for the fight against adiatunnus the short answer was not much he wanted to see by how much the long answer differed from the short one the old village headman besant bigbelly would have whined and wheezed and pleaded poverty his replacement carlun vepins son was working in the fields as gerin approached the fox nodded approvingly besant hadnt been fond of work of any description since his passing yields from the village had gone up that probably meant gerin should have replaced him years before but far too late to worry about that now one of the five hells was said to have enormous water wheels in which lazy men had to tread forever emptying buckets of boiling water onto themselves for besants sake gerin hoped that wasnt so when carlun spotted gerin he came trotting over to him lord prince he called giving the fox something between a nod and a bow how may i serve you this afternoon hows your store of grain and beans and smoked meat and such holding up gerin asked hoping he sounded casual but doubting he sounded casual enough to make carlun give him a quick rash answer he didnt the headmans face was thin and clever not so well as id like lord prince he answered we had a long hard winter as you must recall and so didnt get to plant till late this spring the apples havent been all they should on account of that either and the plums are coming in slow too so weve been drawing on the stores more than i would if i had other choices cabbages have done well i will say he added as if to throw the fox a bone of consolation lets have a look at the tallies for what youve used up gerin said ill fetch them lord prince carlun trotted off toward the wattleanddaub hut he shared with his wife and their fouror was it fivechildren he came out a moment later with a couple of sheets of parchment even before the werenight gerin had begun teaching a few of the brighter peasants in his holding to read his time in the city of elabon had convinced him ignorance was an enemy as dangerous as the trokmoi when hed begun his scheme he hadnt thought of its also having thoroughly practical uses a man who could read could keep records much more accurate than those proffered by a man relying solely on his memory carlun probably inked his pen with blackberry juice but that didnt bother the fox neither did the headmans shaky scrawl here was the barley here was the wheat gerin took a look at the records took a look around the village and started to laugh lord prince did carlun sound a trifle apprehensive if he didnt he should have but he did he was clever enough to know he hadnt been clever enough with the records youll have to do better than that if youre going to cheat me gerin said not mentioning the storage pits off to the east there and hoping i wouldnt notice doesnt do the job i remember you have them even if you didnt write anything about them here ah a pestilence carlun said like the fox he kicked at the dirt in anger and frustration carlun worldbestrider for whom he was named had been the greatest emperor in elabonian history now he saw even his little headmanship in danger if gerin raised someone else to take his place hed never live it down not if he stayed in the village till he was ninety whatwhat will you do with me lord prince hush im not finished here yet gerin said and then fell silent again while he methodically went through the rest of the parchment carlun waited and squirmed the fox looked up youre right the cabbages have done well carlun jerked as if a wasp had stung him then he realized gerin hadnt ordered him cast down from his small height gerin in fact hadnt said anything about his fate at all lord prince he asked in a tiny voice as if not willing to admit hope still lived in him oh ayeabout you the matter might have slipped gerins mind he turned brisk well its simple enough you cant be headman here any more thats pikestaff plain carlun took the blow like a warrior as you wish lord prince he said tonelessly dare i ask you to give me leave to travel to some village far away in the lands you hold that way maybe my family and i will be able to hold up our heads no thats impossible gerin said and for the first time carluns shoulders slumped in dismay gerin went on cant do it im afraid no im going to move you into fox keep instead lord prince i carlun suddenly seemed to hear what the fox had said he gaped into fox keep his gaze swung toward the timbers of the palisade why with a lot of lords the question wouldnt have needed asking you brought a peasant inside a keep so you could take all the time you wanted tormenting him with all the tools you had but gerin did not operate that way and never had he took a certain somber pride that his serfs understood as much it was evidently the only thing carlun understood in an exasperation partly feigned and partly quite genuine gerin said father dyaus above man dont you see youre the first of all the peasants ive taught whos ever tried to cheat me with words and numbers im sorry lord prince carlun said miserably if only i could have another chance id serve you well ill give you another chance gerin told him and a proper one this time how would you like to keep accounts for all the lands i hold not for this one little village ive been doing it myself but each day is only so long oh ill look over your shoulder and so will selatre but ive dreamt for years of finding a man at home with numbers to whom i could give the job if youre at home enough with numbers to try cheating with them you may be the man to try if you make good youll be better off there than you ever could be here headman or no are you game for it lord prince carlun fell to his knees ill be your man forever ill never cheat again not by so much as a bean ill do whatever you ask of me learn whatever you set before me gerin believed the last part he was less sure of the rest hed been down to the city of elabon and seen how arrogant imperial treasury officialsindeed all imperial officialscould get he didnt want men acting in his name behaving like that going through histories and chronicles though warned him they were liable to behave like that no matter what he wanted them to do despite carluns fervent protestations they were also likely to see to it that silver and grain and other good things ended up in their hands rather than in the treasury get up he told carlun his voice rough youre already my man forever ill thank you to remember it in better ways than this he shook the offending parchments in carluns face the headman quailed again gerin went on the other thing to keep in mind is youre like a dog thats bitten once if you cheat again and i find out about it youll wish youd never been born i promise you that ive never crucified a man in all the years ive ruled this holding but that would tempt me to change my mind i already swore lord prince id not take even a bean that wasnt mine and i meant every word of what i said carlun gabbled out the words was he trying to convince himself as well as the fox no probably not gerin decided he meant what he saidnow but it was a rare treasurer who died poor gerin shrugged time would tell the tale i didnt mean to frighten youtoo much gerin said with a grin lacking only geroges fangs to make it truly fearsome carlun had picked a stupid way to cheat the first time as he got more familiar with the numbers he juggled he was liable to get more adept at concealing his thefts too again though time would tell go on go let your wife know what were going to do then head up to the keep tell selatre what ive sent you forand why yyes lord prince the newly promoted larcenous headman said but when he turned to go gerin held up a hand wait if youre leaving the village with whom should i replace you an evil gleam kindled in carluns eyes the one who complains most is tostrov waterdrinker id like to see how hed shape in the job if he had it tostrov gerin rubbed his chin aye he does complain a lot doesnt he but no he has no other virtues i can think of no one would pay him any mind try again and seriously this time aye lord prince carlun hesitated then said the man my sister married herris bigfoot is no fool and he works hard people respect him too you could do worse mm so i could ill think on that gerin said he slapped the parchments against his knee they made a dry rustling sound as if they were dead leaves rubbing one another now back to the business i came here for with that stored grain you didnt bother writing downhe watched in some satisfaction as carlun went pink how are you fixed for stores he thought about adding something like if you still tell me youre starving im going to open up those storage pits and see for myself in the end he didnt he wanted to see how carlun would react without the goad the headman hesitated visibly thinking through the answers he might give gerin hid a smile no carlun wasnt used to dealing with someone who was liable to be trickier than he after a pause that stretched a couple of heartbeats too long he replied lord prince werenot too badly off though i hate to say that so early in the year and you have plenty of cabbages the fox added carlun squirmed well never mind that well need some of what you have to feed the warriors wholl be gathering here for war against adiatunnus carlun licked his lips youll be drawing more than the customary dues from us then was that a hint of reproach in his voice it was the fox decided he eyed carlun with a mixture of annoyance and admiration the headman would not have dared protest to any other ruler in the northlands of that gerin was sure most overlords thought what does ruling mean but taking what i want and what im strong enough to grab but the fox so far as he could tried to substitute custom and even the beginning of law for naked theft he fixed carlun with an unpleasant stare i could say the overage is forfeit as punishment for trying to cheat me after watching the serf writhe though he said i wont its not the villages fault you cheated it had better not be anyhow he stared again oh no lord prince carlun said quickly my idea all mine no one from the village had come to complain he was cheating the fox maybe the other peasants hadnt known maybe theyd hoped hed get away with it no proof and gerin didnt feel like digging ill believe you he said no i wont simply take it for whatever we exact over the set dues ill ease your labor in the forests and on the elabon way and such thank you lord prince carlun said before gerin could find any other awkward questions with which to tax him he hurried back toward the village the fox had told him to do so after all and didnt take offense still holding the parchments gerin stood a while in thought from what he knew of herris bigfoot carluns brotherinlaw wouldnt make a bad headman the only trouble he foresaw was that he hadnt taught herris to read recordkeeping here would go downhill for a while or would it herris wasnt stupid maybe he could learn you didnt need to know much in the way of reading and writing to keep track of livestock and produce the fox shaded his eyes with one hand and peered out over the fields he was starting to have trouble reading these days having to hold manuscripts farther from his eyes because his sight was lengthening out past arms length though nothing was wrong with the way he saw there stood herris talking and laughing with a woman who gerin saw was not carluns sister he shrugged he hadnt heard anything to make him think herris was doing anything scandalous so he wouldnt worry about this he went over to herris noting as he did so that the barley was coming in well carluns brotherinlaw watched him approach herris friend quickly got back to work weeding you want something with me lord prince herris asked i saw you talking with carlun and how would you like his job the fox asked bluntly the woman busy pulling weeds let out a startled gasp herris scratched his head he didnt look or act as sharp as carlun but gerin knew that didnt necessarily mean anything after the pause for thought herris said it depends lord prince how come you dont want him there no more gerin nodded in approvalloyalty to your kin seldom went to waste he explained the new post for which he wanted carlun though not the cheating that made him think carlun might be right for it finishing and he said youd do for headman here thinking about it id say hes likely right if you want the job i do lord prince and thank you herris said idve felt different i expect if you were giving him the sack for no good reason no gerin said again not mentioning he had a good reason if he wanted to use it he smacked the rolledup parchments against his leg once more there is one other thingi know you dont have your letters so im going to want you to learn them if you can that way youll have an easier time keeping track of things here herris pointed to the accounts carlun had kept may i see those lord prince gerin handed them to him he unrolled them and to the foxs surprise began to read them out he stumbled a couple of times but did well enough on the whole i know i didnt teach you your letters gerin said where did you learn them herris looked worried am i in trouble lord prince only after the fox shook his head did the peasant say carlun taught em to me he didnt know he was doing anything wrong swear by dyaus he didnt he learned em to me and a couplethree others he did it was a way to pass the time nothin more thats for true its all right gerin said absently dont worry about it he shook his head altogether bemused so theyd been learning letters in the peasant huts had they instead of rolling dice and drinking ale no more likely alongside of rolling dice and drinking ale a lot of nobles in the northlands reckoned serfs nothing more than domestic animals that chanced to walk on two legs the fox had never been of that school but this caught him off guard if you let learning put down one root it would put out half a dozen on its ownunless of course the trokmoi yanked them all out of the ground can you write as well as read he asked herris not as good as carlun can the peasant answered but maybe good enough so you can make out the words the numbers theyre not hard no eh was he boasting gerin decided to find out take a look at the numbers on these sheets here tell me what you think is interesting about them herris scratched his head thoughtfully then went over the records his brotherinlaw had kept gerin didnt say anything but rocked from heels to toes and back again giving herris all the time he wanted he couldnt think of a better test for the prospective headmans wits and honesty both he was beginning to think herris either less honest or less bright than hed hoped when the peasant coughed and said uh lord prince is there another sheet somewheres no the fox kept his voice neutral should there be you said you were giving carlun this fancy spot at fox keep herris asked gerin nodded herris looked worried him and me weve always got on well id hate to have him think i was telling tales but weve got more grain than these here parchments show herris the woman who was weeding spoke his name reproachfully then too late she remembered with whom he was talking she bent down and started pulling plants out of the ground as fast as she could good gerin said youll do youll definitely do lord prince herris was floundering i never told carlun not to cheat me the fox explained of course that was only because it hadnt occurred to me hed try but still the fact remains so how am i to blame him in a way im glad to see learning take hold with him and with you but only in a waybear that in mind ive warned him what will happen if he tries any more cheating and i would advise you to think very hard about that too do we understand each other oh yes lord prince herris said so sincerely that he either meant it or was a better liar than gerin thought one way or the other the fox would find out chariots began rattling into fox keep by ones and twos and sometimes by fours and fives as they arrived gerins vassals hung their armor on the walls of the great hall the firelight from the hearth and torches made the shining bronze molten almost bloody that seemed fitting for bloody work lay ahead bevander bevons son said lord prince is all quiet with aragis the archer if the grand duke gets wind of what were about here hes liable to jump us while were busy ive worried about the same thing myself the fox agreed eyeing bevander with considerable respect the man was not the greatest warrior the gods ever made but he knew intrigue he and his father and brothers had fought a multicornered civil war for years any man who couldnt keep track of whod last betrayed whom soon paid the price bevander went on in meditative tones or on the other hand aragis might want to let us fight adiatunnus and then attack if we and the trokmoi were both weakened he might sweep us all into the niffet and style himself king if he wants the title hes a fool and whatever else aragis is hes no fool gerin answered i have a better claim to call myself king than he does by the gods but you dont see me doing it if any man styles himself king thatll be a signal for all the other nobles in the northlands to join together and pull him down if any man styles himself king who hasnt earned it you mean bevander said if aragis beats you and the woodsrunners both who could say he has no right to the title you should use some of your magic powers lord prince and see what aragis intends when you move against the trokmoi like so many other people in the northlands bevander was convinced gerin had strong magical powers because hed cleared the land of the monsters from under bitons shrine at ikos the fox knew only too well that had been two parts desperation to one part sorcery he hadnt advertised the fact wanting his foes to think him more fearsome than he was that created another problem as solutions have a way of doing his friends also thought him more fearsome than he was now though he paused thoughtfully i may do that he said at last scrying was not likely to be a form of magic particularly dangerous to his health he didnt know how accurate the spells would prove in peering into the future you tried to navigate through a web of possibilities expanding so rapidly that even a god had trouble following the links bevander beamed may you have good fortune with it he said he swelled with the selfimportance of a man whos had a suggestion taken gerin eyed him as he walked away strutting just a little he had wit enough to be dangerous had his ambition matched it having obtained the lions share of bevons barony for backing the fox in the last fight against adiatunnus though hed been satisfied with thatand with finally getting the upper hand on his brothersever since for his part gerin was satisfied to remain prince rather than king the only trouble was no one believed him when he said as much selatre came into the library hello she said to the fox i didnt expect to find you here ever since hed taught her to read shed taken the chamber where he stored his scrolls and codices as her private preserve im getting away from the racket of my barons he said and then because he didnt like telling her halftruths and im looking in the grimoires to see what sort of scrying spell i can cast thats least likely to turn me into a salamander i wouldnt want that selatre said seriously salamanders arent good at raising children let alone running a principality she walked over and ran a hand down his arm i suspect theyre also mm less than desirable in certain other areas i daresay youre right gerin answered the gods only know how wed manage to put a pond in the bedchamber as selatre snorted he went on warming to the theme or we could go up to the niffet and make sport there always hoping no big pike came along at the worst possible moment im leaving selatre said with more dignity than the words really needed its plain enough you wont keep your mind on what youre doing if im here to distract you the fox grinned over his shoulder then returned to the grimoires if half what they said was true seeing into the future was so easy no one should ever have needed to consult bitons sibyl down at ikos of course if half what the grimoires said was true anyone who read them would have more gold than he knew what to do with and live to be three hundred years old knowing which grimoire to trust was as important as anything else when it came to sorcery here this ought to do it the fox said at last picking a spell from a codex hed brought back from the city of elabon he closed the book tucked it under his arm and carried it out of castle fox and over to the small hut near the stables where he worked his magic every time he went in there even if it was for nothing more elaborate than trying to divine where a sheep had strayed he wondered if he would come out again he knew how much he knewjust enough to be dangerousand also how much he didnt know which gave him pause about using the knowledge he had he opened the grimoire the divining spell hed chosen unlike a lot of them required no wine wine grapes would not grow in the northlands even if they had he would have been leery of using what they yielded his previous encounters with mavrix the sithonian god of wine made him anxious never to have another oh a pestilence he muttered i should have brought fire with me after filling a lamp with perfumed linseed oil he went back to the castle got the lamp going at a torch and carried it over to the hut he felt stares at his back if his vassals hadnt noticed before what he was doing they did now whatever enthusiasm they had they hid very well he set the lamp on a wooden stand above his worktable that done he rummaged in a drawer under the table till he found and pulled out a large quartz crystal the grimoire said the crystal was supposed to be flawlessly pure he looked at it shrugged and started to chant it was what he had if he didnt use it he couldnt work the spell as with a lot of spells this one had the more difficult passes for the left hand the fox suspected that was intentional to make the spells more likely to fail it bothered him not at all since he was lefthanded his magic did not go wrong on account of clumsiness lack of training and lack of talent however were something else again reveal reveal reveal gerin shouted in tones of command holding the crystal between the elevated lamp and the table a rainbow sprang into being on the grimy tabletopgetting it spotlessly white as the grimoire suggested had struck the fox as more trouble than it was worth as the magic began to unfold he reckoned himself vindicated he had seen over the years that the men who wrote tomes on magic had a way of worrying more about form than about function the rainbow vanished a white light filled the crystal gerin almost dropped it in alarm but held on when he realized it wasnt hot surely the little smudges and chips that white light revealed would not matter to the spell he concentrated his own formidable wits on aragis the archer visualizing the grand dukes craggy arrogant features by his face aragis might have been half hawk on his fathers side the brain behind that harsh mask was alarmingly keennearly as good as gerins if focused more on the short term and the immediate vicinity so what was aragis plotting now if the fox locked himself in battle with adiatunnus what would the grand duke do as soon as gerin fully formed the question a beam of light stabbed out from the glowing crystal down onto the tabletop the fox sucked in a quick startled breath there sat aragis with what looked like a mixture of distaste and intense concentration on his face gerin looked closely trying to be sure he was reading the expression correctly his rival seemed shrouded in shadow aragis suddenly rose the perspective shifted the strings of oaths gerin let out had nothing to do with the spell maybe purity of materials and cleanliness of scrying surface mattered more than hed thought a view of aragis grunting in the smelly castle latrine was less edifying than the fox had hoped no wonder the grand dukes expression had been as it was had he obtained relief for the problem troubling him gerin would never know the light from the crystal faded evidently that was the only glimpse of aragis gerin would get he swore again half in anger half in resignation sometimes his magics worked sometimes he made an idiot of himself and wondered why he ever bothered trying at least he hadnt come close to burning down the hut as had happened before unlike most of gerins vassals bevander could guess why gerin had gone into the hut in the first place looking very full of himself he walked up to the fox and asked what news of aragis lord prince will he bedevil us if we war with adiatunnus i dont really know worse luck the fox answered the spell i tried turned out to be full of shit he wasnt often able to tell literal and symbolic truth at the same time and savored this chance the way a litterateur savored a wellturned verse all the same he would have traded the witticism for a real look into the future every time his vassals rode away from fox keep at the end of a campaign gerin forgot how much chaos they brought while they were there part of that came from packing a lot of fighting men into a compact space and then having to wait for the latecomers before everyone could go out and fight if they couldnt battle their foes a lot of the foxs troopers were willing even eager to battle one another some of those fights were goodnatured affrays that sprang from nothing more than high spirits and a couple of mugs of ale too many some had the potential for being more serious not all of gerins vassals loved one another not all of them loved him either schild stoutstaff was not the only man who would have liked nothing better than to renounce his allegiance to the foxhad he not had adiatunnus hanging over his southern border gerin did his best to keep known enemies among his vassals as far from each other as he could for years hed been doing his best to keep those vassals from going on with their own private wars and youve done well at it too van said when he complained aloud one day better nor i ever thought you could a lot of the feuds that were hot as a smiths fire when first i came here have cooled down in the years since and a lot of them havent too gerin said drungo dragos son remembers that schilds greatgreatgrandfather killed his own greatgreatgreatgrandfather in a brawl a hundred years ago and he wants to pay schild back and schild remembers too and hes proud of what his fleabitten brigand of an ancestor managed to do isnt thatwhat do you call ithistory thats the word i want van said you always say we have to know history if were going to be civilized whatever that means do you want drungo and schild to forget their blood feud i want them to forget their blood vengeance gerin answered the old quarrels get in the way because the new one we have is more importantor it ought to be more important the way some of my vassals eye some of the others youd think they came here for their own private wars as far as theyre concerned fighting mine is a nuisance only one way to deal with that van said so long as theyre more afraid of you than they are of each other theyll do as you like oh they know i can thump them like a drum if i have to and theyre too fractious to join together and cast me down for which the gods be praised the fox replied but that isnt what brings them together here the one theyre really afraid of is the cursed trokm van scratched a scar that wandered down into his beard himself afraid of nothing this side of angry gods he found fear of a foe hard to fathom at last he said theres that too i suppose anyone who thinks the woodsrunners make good neighbors has been chewing the wrong leaves and berries i give you so much vassals hastily moved aside from the doorway to the great hall gerin understood that a moment later when geroge walked outside even without armor the monster was a match for men who wore bronzescaled corselets and helms and carried spears and shields a couple of minor barons had already urged the fox to get rid of geroge and tharma both hed invited them to try it with no more additions to nature than the monsters enjoyed they hadnt urged twice geroge came up to gerin at a sort of lumbering trot something wrong the fox asked as best he could tell geroge looked troubled the monsters features were hard to read the forward stretch of the lower half of his face made his nose low and flat and heavy brow ridges shadowed his eyes had a creature halfwolf halfbear walked like a man it would have looked a lot like him he was also right on the edge of the transition from child to adult and no more easy with that than anyone else they laugh at me he said in his rough growly voice pointing with a clawed forefinger back toward the great hall they should be used to me by now but they call me names why dont you grab one of them and eat him van said he wont call you names after that by the gods oh no geroge sounded horrified as best the fox could tell he looked horrified too gerin taught tharma and me never to eat people and we couldnt eat enough of them to keep the rest from hurting us thats right gerin said firmly giving van a dirty look hed worked hard trying to humanize the monsters and didnt appreciate having his work undermined thats just right geroge he repeated and you reasoned it out very well too for their kind geroge and tharma were both clever he never failed to let them know it geroge said what do we do then i dont like it when they call us names it makes me mad he opened his mouth very wide examining the sharp ivory within gerin knew he would not have wanted the monster annoyed at him he said if they bother you again i will eat them really geroges narrow eyes widened erno the fox admitted he had to keep reminding himself that even though geroge was bigger and much more formidably equipped than he the monster was also as literalminded as a child half his age but i will make them very sorry they insulted you they have no business doing it and i wont stand for it all right geroge said like a child with its father he was convinced gerin always could and would do exactly as he promised gerin had to bear that in mind when he spoke with the monster if he didnt deliver on a promise he didnt know what would happen then or want to find out anyone who bothers you will answer to me too van rumbled that made the monster happy unlike most mere mortals van was still stronger than geroge and also unintimidated by his fearsome looks that made him a hero in the monsters eyes lets go hunting geroge said we need more meat with all these people crowding the keep we always need more meat his tongue long and red and rough like a cats flicked out to moisten his lips he didnt just need meathe needed to hunt more meat you wont hear me say no van answered he went back into the great hall emerging a moment later with a stout bow and a quiver slung over his back he affected to despise archery when fighting menhe preferred a long heavy spear that he handled as if it were a twig used for picking teethbut proved his skill as a bowman whenever he went after game geroge hurried away too returning momentarily with tharma both monsters were chattering excitedly they were about to go off and do something they loved with so many warriors in the keep the drawbridge was down flanked on either side by a monster van tromped out of the keep and headed for the woods no one would call geroge and tharma names while they were out hunting even if a warrior came upon them in the woods he would think several times before drawing their notice much less their anger gerin had hunted with them many times out among the trees they sloughed off a lot of the cloak of humanity they wore inside fox keep they were more purely predators in the woods and less inclined to put up with nonsense from people gerin much to his own regret had to put up with a lot of nonsense he sometimes thought that the hardest part of the rulers art hed never been one to suffer fools gladly in his younger days hed never been one to suffer fools at all he would either ignore them or insult them till they went away first as baron though and then as selfstyled prince hed gradually become convinced the number of fools was so high he made too many enemies by treating them all as they deserved little by little hed learned patience though hed never learned to like it rihwin the fox and carlun vepins son came out of the great hall together seeing them so sent alarm through gerin carlun had already figured out on his own how to get into trouble and if by some chance he hadnt rihwin would have taken care of that small detail for him rihwin could get anyone from himself up to and including gods into trouble to gerins relief his fellow fox said something to carlun that seemed to rub the exheadman the wrong way rihwin laughed out loud at that carlun looked angry but didnt do anything about it in his place gerin wouldnt have done anything either carlun had spent a lifetime with hoe and shovel and plow rihwin just as long with sword and bow and spear if you werent trained from childhood as a warrior you were a fool to take on a man who was laughing still rihwin gave carlun a mocking bow and went on his way carlun saw gerin and hurried over to him lord prince he cried his face red with frustrated impotent fury they scorn me lord prince he might have been geroge though he expressed himself better on the other hand the warriors could twit him with impunity he wasnt liable to tear them limb from limb if they pushed him too far what are they calling you gerin asked theyve given me an ekename carlun said indignantly one of them called me carlun inkfingers and now theyre all doing it he held out his hands to the fox sure enough the right one was stained with ink gerin held out his hands in return i have those stains too youll note he said and rather worse than you being lefthanded i drag the side of my hand through what ive written while thats still wet but they dont call you gerin inkfingers carlun said thats true ive given them reason to hang a different sobriquet on me gerin said you could do that or you could take pride in the one theyve given you instead of letting them make you angry with it most of them you know couldnt find their own name on a piece of parchment if it stood up and waved to them i dont like trying to deal with so many of your warriors carlun said sticking out his lower lip like a sulky child then its back to a village for youa village far away gerin told him you wont be headman there eitheryou know that youd just be a serf among serfs for the rest of your life if thats truly what you want ill put you and your family on the road tomorrow carlun shook his head i dont want that lord prince what i want is revenge and i cant take it theyd kill me if i tried his eyes swung in the direction rihwin had gone if you tried sticking a knife into one of them he would kill you the fox agreed there are other ways though if you think for a bit a man with armor can stand off several without and a man who knows reading and numbers if you put him in with folk who dont he watched carluns eyes catch fire that amused him clever as the exheadman was he hadnt yet learned to conceal his thoughts and a moment later the fire faded carlun said you warned me lord prince what would happen if you caught me cheating i dont like the warriors mocking me but you would do worse than mock though he did not smile the fox was pleased hed put a healthy dose of fear in carluns soul he answered i didnt say anything about cheatingcertainly not about cheating me out of my due but if a man insults you he should hardly be surprised if you reckon up what he owes his overlord with very close attention to every detail do you understand what im saying he waited for carlun to nod then went on its not as satisfying as smashing a man in the face with an axe maybe but youre not there so he can smash you in the face either carlun went down on one knee and seized gerins right hand in both of his lord prince he said now i understand why you have gone from victory to victory you see farther ahead than any man now living teach me that evening in some bemusement gerin said to selatre there i was explaining how to avenge yourself on someone whod offended you without getting killed in the process and he ate it up like a bear in a honey tree have i made him someone who will aid me better or am i turning him into a monster more dangerous than any of geroge and tharmas unlamented cousins you cant be sure one way or the other she answered sensible as usual for all you know you may be doing both at once he may end up being a useful monster if you know what i mean which is fine for me but not so good for him gerin answered maybe i should have just sent him off to another village and had done with it that would have been simplest and it wouldnt have shown poor carlun temptations the likes of which hes never seen before nonsense selatre said crisply if he hadnt known about temptations like that he wouldnt have tried cheating you in the first place now you have him working for you not against you people like carlun the only ones they work for are themselves gerin replied with a shake of the head the way you get them to do what you want is to make them see that going your way sends them along their own path better than anything else they could do selatre nodded aye i can see that youve done it for carlun plain enough by the time hes through with your vassals theyll be lucky if they have a tunic and a pot of beans apiece to call their own she laughed but the fox began to worry cant have that if he squeezes them too hard theyll blame me just what id needrebellions from men whove always been solid backers youll curb him before it comes to that selatre said confidently she had more confidence in gerin sometimes than he had in himself the gods grant youre right he said from fox keep the land sloped down to the niffet a few furlongs away gerin drilled his vassals on the expanse of grass and bushes where sheep and cattle usually grazed some of the warriors grumbled at that drungo dragos son complained this practicing is a silly notion lord prince we go off we find the cursed trokmoi and we smash em into the ground nothing to worry about in any of that he folded massive arms across a wide chest youre your father come again gerin said drungo beamed but gerin had not meant it altogether as a compliment drago the bear had been strong and brave but up to the day he clutched his chest and keeled over dead hed not been long on thought aye several men said together turn us loose on the trokmoi well take care of what happens next you practice with the bow dont you the fox asked them they nodded he tried again you practice with the spear and the sword too more nods he did his best to drive the lesson home you practice in your chariots i expect so you can do the best job of fighting from them when he got still more nods he bellowed then why in the five hells dont you want to practice with a whole swarm of chariots together he should have known better than to expect logic to have anything to do with their answer drungo said on account of we already know how to do that on account of weve all been in a bunch of fights already brawls gerin said scornfully every car for itself every man for himself the woodsrunners fight the same way if we have an idea of what were going to do before we do it well have a better chance of winning than if we make it up as we go along and besideshe pointed off to the right wing well be trying something new on this campaign yes and those fools on horses backs arent worth anything either drungo said eloquently dubious as his gaze followed the foxs finger you are your fathers son gerin told him feeling old sixteen years ago now back before the werenight drago had mocked duin the bold claiming the art of equitation was more trouble than it would ever be worth theyd almost brawled then now gerin was going to find out whether duin had known what he was talking about when his overlord pointed to him rihwin the fox waved from the stallion on whose back he perched he led a couple of dozen mounted men most of them only half his age his years were the main reason gerin halfway against his better judgment had placed him in command of the riders with luck he would have more sense than the hotheads he led but he was also living proof that experience did not necessarily bring maturity well try another practice charge gerin said to drungo maybe youll see what im driving at he had thought about giving up the chariot himself and going over to riding a horse but his long partnership with van and their driver raffo had kept him in the car he brought down his arm the chariots jounced across the meadow in a line less ragged than it had been a few days before and over on the right flank the horses moved faster than any team hauling car and warriors both they also made their way without effort over ground that would surely have made a chariot flip over rihwin even leaped his horse across a gully you would have had to be mad to urge a team to try such a stunt which might not have deterred rihwin but would have given anyone else pause there gerin said when the exercise was over do the lot of you think this business of riding horses may have something to it after all again drungo spoke for the conservative majority just as drago had in his day maybe a small something lord prince but no more than that horses for scouts and for flank attacks aye ill give you so much but its the chariots thatll finish the foe as he was still fighting from a chariot himself gerin could not very well argue with that in fact he more or less agreed having stood up against a chariot charge he knew how it turned opponents blood to water and their bones to gelatin the drum of the hooves the rattle and bang of the cars as they thundered down on you the fierce cries of the warriors standing upright in them weapons ready to hand if you could stand up against such without quailing you were a man indeed cavalry alone would not be nearly so fearsome what he said then was we will be using the cavalry on the flanks to disrupt the charge our foes try to make against us weve not done that before not in war thats why ive been bringing us out here the past few days so we could see how it would go see how the flank chariots need to stick close to the riders and how the riders cant get too far out in front of the chariotry well why didnt you say so lord prince drungo demanded the fox couldnt decided whether to throttle his literalminded vassal or merely to pound his own head against the side rail of his car by drungos selfrighteous tones the notion that they had been out there for any reason save gerins perverse obstinacy had till that moment not penetrated his thick skull and actually reached his brain after a long sigh the fox said well try it again this time charging down toward the niffet if the woodsrunners on the north side are peering across as they likely are well give them something new to think on too they pounded down toward the niffet as hed ordered and then after a pause to let the horses rest back up toward fox keep the men on the palisade there gave them a cheer gerin took that as a good omen very often looking bloodthirsty was a sign you would fight well you know something fox van said as raffo drove the chariot at a slow walk toward the drawbridge by the time durens son is the big man here most of his warriors will be on horseback and theyll listen to the minstrels old songs about chariot battles and wonder why the singers couldnt get it right dyou think so gerin said vans big head bobbed up and down that surprised gerin in matters military the outlander was for the most part as conservative as drungo well you may be right but id bet on the bards to change their tunes by then he thought about what hed just said then shook his head no i take that back youre likelier to be right than i am the minstrels have a whole great store of stock phrases and lines about chariots same as they do about keeps and love and everything else you can think of if they have to start singing about horses instead of chariots their verses wont scan and most of em being lazy as everybody else wont have the wit to come up with anything new on their own so well hear the same songs a bit longer yet aye van cocked his head to one side studying the fox not everybody would up and own he was wrong like that whats the point to defending a position you cant hold gerin asked put that way it made sense to the outlander he nodded again jumped down from the chariot and headed into castle fox afoot gerin let raffo drive him into the stables there his lungs full of the green grassy smell of horse manure he said to rihwin you did well in the practice i want to see how well your lads fare at charging home with the spear and at archery from horseback too id not care to be a man afoot trying to stand against me when i have a leafpointed spear of shining bronze aimed at his belly rihwin replied sounding a bit like a bard himself riding him down or putting the point through his vitals should be no harder than gigging trout from a stream gerin shook his head in bemusement hed been on the other end of this same conversation with van a few days before except the trout arent trying to gig you too he pointed out his voice dry and except that you mostly wont be going up against men afoot how will you do against chariotry well ride over them like rihwin paused to catch an elusive simile and caught sight of gerin drumming the fingers of one hand into the palm of the other his flight of fancy came back to earth with a thud when we fight the battle well know lord prince with luck well come at them from directions theyll not expect gerin thumped him on the shoulder good thats what im hoping you do i dont ask miracles you know just that you do what you can ah but my fellow fox miracles are so much more dramaticthe stuff of which the minstrels sing for generations yet unborn aye with formulas that should have died of old age but havent gerin said now picking up the discussion hed just been having with van as if it hadnt stopped besides the trouble with miracles is that even if you do get em youd almost rather not getting em is a sign of how bad you need em as much as anything else he did not mention the couple hed pulled off though they went a long way toward proving his point by the gleam in rihwins eye he was about to bring them up but he suddenly thought better of it if it hadnt been for him at least one and maybe both of them would have been unnecessary what he did say after a few heartbeats hesitation was for a man who has accomplished as much as you have lord prince youve left the bards surprisingly little about which to sing the converse of that was for a man whos accomplished as little as you rihwin youve given the bards all too much fodder gerin did not say that rihwin was as he was charm and flaws engagingly blended you enjoyed him admired his courage and hoped he was seldom in a position to do you much harm that hope however did not always work out lets go into the great hall gerin said also a little more slowly than he should have well drink some ale and hash over how best we can make horses and chariots work together im for that rihwin said i have several ideas weve yet to try which if they work as i hope bid fair to make that cooperation easier to effect rihwin always had several ideas out of any given batch some would work the trouble was figuring out which ones before you tried them all because those that failed had a way of failing spectacularly in the courtyard duren was patiently standing alongside dagref helping his half brother improve his form at archery under durens tutelage dagref let fly he whooped in delight when he hit the target watching them rihwin sighed there are times my fellow fox when i envy youoh not so much your children but having them all here so you can see them every moment as they grow its not like that with my brood of bastards gerin exhaled through his nose if youd wanted a wife plenty of barons had daughters or sisters theyd have pledged to you we both know thats so he didnt come any closer to mentioning that rihwin would have been betrothed to elise back before the werenight if he hadnt gone and disgraced himself as the betrothal was about to be announced instead he went on plenty of barons would pledge you a daughter or sister even now you have but to seek a bit rihwin sighed again on a different note you my fellow fox are fortunate enough to enjoy waking in the same bed each morning and to enjoy the company of the same ladyand an excellent lady she is mistake me notwhen not in that bed in my opinion the chances of finding a woman who both makes a pleasing bedmate and is interesting when vertical as well as horizontal are lamentably low were i wed i fear i should be bored you dont know till you look gerin said stubbornly if youre unhappy with your life as it is wringing your hands and moaning wont make it better unhappy perhaps takes the point too far rihwin answered say rather i recognize its imperfections but also realize it would have other imperfections likely worse ones did i change it and you the one who usually plunges ahead without the least thought of consequences gerin exclaimed youd best have a care or youll get a name for prudence father dyaus avert such a twisted fate rihwin cried both men laughed in the great hall the kitchen servants had set a big jar of ale in the middle of the floor the pointed tip stabbed through the rushes strewn there and into the dirt below gerin and rihwin got drinking jacks filled them with the dipper and joined a crowd of warriors at a table arguing over what theyd done and what still needed doing a good strong spear thrust into a man from horseback nowthatd do some damage schild stoutstaff declared he pointed to his own weapon hanging on the wall which had given him his sobriquet his thinking lived up to the ekename he nodded to gerin this time lord prince maybe well be rid of that cursed trokm for good aye maybe gerin said he suspected that if adiatunnus was beaten schild would promptly forget as many of his own feudal obligations as he could hed done that before the only time he remembered he owed service was when he needed protection well he was here now that would do gerin poured out a small libation to baivers then stuck his forefinger into the drinking jack and used ale to draw cryptic lines on the tabletop in front of him herethese are the chariots he told rihwin pointing and these are your horses what you need to he didnt get to finish explaining what rihwin needed to do the lookouts horn blew a higher clearer note than the one the village horn used to call the serfs back from the fields at close of day normally the sentry up in the watchtower just called out when he spied someone he saved the horn for times he really needed it after he sounded the warning note he shouted something through the racket and chatter in the great hall gerin couldnt hear what he said he got to his feet and started for the doorway he hadnt gone more than a few steps when a man came running in yelling lord prince lord prince theres boats in the niffetbig boatsand theyre heading this way iii oh a pestilence gerin said as men exclaimed and cried out all around him unlike his vassals he was angry at himself after rihwin had told him of the galley his leman had seen on the niffet hed intended to station riders along the river to bring word if more such came up it as sometimes happens what hed intended to do didnt match what hed actually done too late for selfreproach now he ran outside and hurried up onto the palisade one of the warriors already up there pointed out to the niffet gerin had to choke down sardonic thanks the ships out there all five of them were quite easy enough to find without help he saw at first glance that they werent elabonian war galleys instead of the bronzeclad rams those carried these ships had high prows carved into the shapes of snarling animals and painted to look more ferocious grainne might have mentioned that he thought absurdly aggrieved the woman had left out an important detail the galleys strode briskly up the niffet propelled against the current by a couple of dozen oars on either side they turned sharply toward the riverbank as they drew nearest to fox keep and grounded themselves on that muddy bank harder than gerin would have liked to endure were he aboard one of them as soon as they were aground men started spilling out of them arm yourselves gerin shouted to his vassals some of whom had followed him out into the courtyard to see what the fuss was about the gradi are attacking us that sent the nobles running back into the great hallor trying to for at the doorway they collided with others trying to get outside after much screaming and gesticulating pushing and shoving that straightened itself out meanwhile the warriors from the ships pounded toward fox keep at a steady groundeating trot as they drew nearer gerin got his first good look at them big bulky fellows with fair skins and dark hair they wore bronze helms and leather jerkins and tall boots and carried a shield on one arm and a longhafted axe in the other hand gradi sure enough van said from beside the fox gerin jumped his attention on the invaders he hadnt noticed the outlander ascending to the palisade rihwin the fox had been right behind van my leman surely saw one of those ships lord prince he said pointing out toward the niffet if i thought you were wrong i would argue with you gerin said for a moment gloom threatened to overwhelm him this is what i feared worst when i heard your womans news these cursed raiders sweeping down on us by surprise hitting us with no warning to his amazement both van and rihwin burst into raucous laughter van said mm captain dont you think its the gradi whore liable to get the surprise he half turned and waved down into the courtyard which was aboil with a great host of the most ferociousor at least the most effectivewarriors the northlands knew just so lord prince rihwin agreed had they chosen another time to come they might have done you grievous harm truth but now with so many bold and valiant men assembled here they are more apt to find themselves in the position of a man who bites down hard on a stone thinking it a piece of fruit put that wayit could be so gerin said that choking depression lifting almost as fast as it had settled on him he looked out over the wall again the gradi had got close enough for him to hear them singing he had no idea what the words meant but the song sounded fierce some of the raiders carried long ladders a corner of the foxs mouth quirked upwards aye let em try to storm the keep and see how much joy they have of it he thumped rihwin on the shoulder and you my fellow fox gather up your horseriders and prepare your mounts readying the chariots would take a long time but we can loose you against the foe at a moments notice rihwins eyes shone just as you say lord prince he hurried down off the walkway shouting for his horsemen gerins eyes went to the peasant village not far from fox keep and the fields surrounding it not since the year of the werenight most of a generation before had the serfs come under attack the older men and women though knew what to do and the younger ones didnt take long to figure it out as soon as they spied the war galleys landing they all ran for the woods not far away the fox hoped they wouldnt peep out from the edge of the forest either but would keep running to get away from the invaders some of the gradi peeled off toward the villages theyll steal the animals and burn the huts gerin said mournfully lets make em thoughtful about the keep van answered they havent got the strength to coop us up in here though they dont know that yet either well give em one set of lumps then another the gradi started shooting fire arrows at fox keep a good many of the logs of the palisade though were still painted with the gunk siglorel shelofas son had used to keep balamung the trokm from burning the keep with magic fire during the chaos after the werenight even all these years later flames would not catch on them elabonians on the walkway shot back at the gradi a couple of the big burly men out on the grass crumpled one of them thrashed about clutching at his shoulder the other lay very still the arrow must have found a vital spot ladders ladders the cry came from two sides of the palisade at once one of the ladders peeked over the top of the log fence only a few yards from where gerin stood he rushed toward it and reached it at the same moment as a gradi swarmed up and tried to scramble onto the walkway the raider bawled something at him in an unintelligible languageand swung his axe through a deadly arc but the fox ducked under the stroke and thrust the point of his sword through the gradis throat before the fellow could fully protect himself with his shield the gradi had eyes bright and blue as a lightning bolt they went wide in horror and shock the heavy axe dropped from his hand he clutched at the spurting wound as he slipped and slid down the ladder cries of dismay from below said he was fouling the men behind him gerin leaned forward and shoved at the top of the ladder with all his strength two arrows whipped past his head the fletching on one of them brushed his cheek as it flew past he ducked away fast as he could the gradi on the bottom part of the ladder shouted as it leaned away from the wall and toppled over with a crash he looked again three or four of them were writhing at the bottom of the ditch if he had any luck theyd broken bones the cry of ladders rose again and again now from all four sides of the square palisade three of the ladders went over faster and more easily than the one gerin toppledhis men had remembered the forked poles kept on the walkway against just such an emergency at the fourth one though around the far side of castle fox from gerin cries of alarm and the clash of metal against shields and metal against metal said the gradi had gained a lodgement elabonian warriors rushed toward the fighting to hold them in check down in the courtyard trying to reach the drawbridge through chaos came rihwin the fox and most of his horseriders let down the bridge gerin yelled to the gate crew he had to shout several times to gain the crews attention and several more to make them believe him with a squeal of chains the bridge fell the gradi outside fox keep roared in triumph when the drawbridge came down maybe they thought their own folk were opening it to let them into the keep if they did they discovered their mistake in short order a few of them started over the bridge rihwin leading his riders out skewered the leading gradi on his spear his followers rode down the others trampling them or knocking them into the ditch around the palisade the shouts of triumph turned to shouts of alarm rihwin and his horsemen smashed through the gradi who swarmed near the drawbridge and then galloped off toward the stragglers whod decided to plunder the peasant village some they rode down some they shot with arrows some they speared had the gradi stuck together in a tight formation they might have been able to fight back instead they scattered a running man was no match for a man aboard a speeding horse with the riders gone the gradi tried once more to rush in over the drawbridge gerins men met them at the gate slashing with swords thrusting with spears and putting their bodies between the invaders and the courtyard gerin hurried down to the yard to help drive away the gradi and step by step he and his men did exactly that forcing their bigger foes back across the drawbridge and then gaining the grass on the far side that seemed to discomfit the gradi instead of sweeping all before them here they were swept instead gerin pointed toward the niffet get torches he cried well burn the bastards boats and see if they can swim home his vassals roared in fierce approval as hed hoped some of the gradi understood elabonian they yelled in alarm some of them at first a trickle and then a great flow began streaming away from fox keep and toward the great river gerin looked southward he wished rihwin would come galloping back and hit the invaders while they were in disorder it was probably too much to ask for but no sooner had he wished for it than rihwin at the head of most of his riders charged down on the gradi every once in a while rihwin did something right and when he did it was as magnificent as any of his failures as hed predicted and as hed proved by the village foot soldiers had enormous trouble standing against onrushing horses with armored men on top of them neither he nor gerin had imagined how much alarm the horses would create in a foe the gradi were seeing mounted men for the first time and did not like what they saw neat as you please rihwin snatched a torch out of the hand of a running elabonian and urged his horse ahead until the animal seemed to be all but flying over the ground he darted past the gradi as if their rawhide boots had been nailed to the grass and flung the torch into one of the war galleys they still had men aboard their ships to protect them if something went wrong with the attack on fox keep gerin expected one of those men to douse the torch before the ship caught but rihwins spirit was rewarded with a gift of luck the torch must have landed in a bucket of pitch or something equally inflammable for a great pillar of black smoke rose from the galley the gradi howled as if they were being burned gerins men for their part howled too but with fierce joy in their voices not all the gradi gave way to despair though a big fellow turned and slashed at the fox with his axe gerin turned the blow with his shield and felt it all the way up his arm to his shoulder he knew he had to be careful the axehead if it squarely met the facing of the shield was liable to bite straight through and into his arm he thrust at the invader with his sword the gradi also got his shield up in time to block the stroke although he seemed cautious and tentative in meeting a lefthanded swordsman clank a rock the size of a mans fist bounced off the side of the gradis helmet he staggered his blue blue eyes suddenly looked distant his face blank as if he were drunk taking advantage of a stunned man was anything but sporting the fox cut him down without a qualm well done father gerin whirled around there stood duren a helm on his head a shield on his arm a sword in his handhis right hand for he hadnt taken after his father there the blade had blood on it get back to the keep gerin snapped youve no business here who says i havent his son retorted who do you think threw that rock at the gradi youd still be fighting him if i hadnt gerin started to shout at duren but closed his mouth with a snap before angry words came out if his son was big enough to do a mans job on the battlefieldand evidently he washow could the fox order him back like a boy the plain truth was he couldnt be careful he said gruffly and then come on a pig darted across the field squealing and threatening with its tushes anyone who came near gerin wondered whether some gradi had hoped to take it away as loot or whether theyd simply broken the pen confining it to let it run wild it headed off toward the woods if one of the villagers didnt track it down there pretty soon it would be a wild animal again the difference between domestic swine and wild boars wasnt great as the gradi neared their galleys they found a shield wall behind which the men not fighting pushed the surviving ships back into the niffet and began boarding them the warriors of the shield wall refused to give ground but fought in place till they were killed their stubborn resistance let most of their comrades escape the torches the elabonians flung at the galleys fell short and died hissing in the niffet a couple of archers had fire arrows ready to shoot most of those missed too but one stuck in the timbers at the stern of a ship gerins men cheered at that the fox hoped the gradi wouldnt note the little fire till it had grown into a big one a bend of the niffet carried the raiders out of sight before he could find out wearily he turned and looked back toward fox keep the meadows his chariotry had been churning into a rutted mess now had bodies scattered over them some of his men were methodically going from one gradi on the ground to the next making sure those bodies were dead ones take prisoners he shouted why drungo dragos son shouted back he was about to smash in the head of a fairskinned gradi down with an arrow through the thigh so we can squeeze answers out of them gerin told him you need to be a patient man to go around questioning corpses drungo stared at him then decided it was a joke and laughed had gerin been the gradi writhing on the ground in front of him he didnt think he would have found that laugh pleasing to the ear his own men had taken hurts too parol chickpea who was a good enough warrior to have lived through a lot of fights but not good enough to come through them unscathed was binding up a cut on his shield arm one of the northerners axes must have hacked right through the shield as had almost happened to gerin schild stoutstaff was hobbling around using his spear as a stick when gerin asked how he was he gritted his teeth and answered i expect ill heal the cut runs up and down he pointed to his calf not straight across if id got it that way the bastard would have hamstrung me go back to the keep and have them wash it out with ale gerin told him itll burn like fire but it makes the wound less likely to rot ill do that lord prince schild said youre clever about those things i cant deny he limped back toward the castle blood soaking the bandage hed ripped from his tunic and trickling down his heel onto the grass gerin headed back to fox keep at a pace no better than schilds not only was he weary past belief almost past comprehension but he also wanted a closer look at the damage his holding and his army had suffered hagop son of hovan his neighbor to the east whose holding had acknowledged his suzerainty since not long after the werenight crouched by a corpse that looked like himmaybe a younger brother maybe a son he did not look up as the fox walked by the thump of hooves on turf made gerin turn his head rihwin the fox was having a little trouble controlling his horse which might not have cared for the stink of blood so thick in the air even human nostrils could smell it the animal kept rolling its eyes and trying to sidestep almost as if it were skipping it snorted and looked for a moment as if it would rear but rihwin leaning forward and speaking to it in a coaxing voice persuaded it to keep all four feet on the ground by dyaus allfather my fellow fox you couldnt have done that better if wed done nothing but practice it for the past year gerin told him he turned and pointed back toward the war galley rihwin had fired which still crackled and burned and sent a great cloud of smoke into the sky and thatthat was better than id dared hope it did work rather well didnt it rihwin said we were here we were there with almost no time between being one place and the other and wherever we were the gradi gave way before us though they have a name for ferocity he looked back at the carnage on the field and shook his head so much happened so fast astonishing lord prince it wasnt done happening yet either not quite all the gradi had been flushed out of the village south of fox keep there was fighting on the winding lanes that ran through the huts of the village gerin watched a couple of raiders flee into the forest with elabonians pounding after them if the troopers dont get them the serfs likely will he said if they dont have ambushes set already i miss my guess and they know those woods the way they know the feel of their wives backsides in their hands or maybe the backsides of their neighbors wives rihwin said if theyre at all like you thats probably the way of it gerin agreed rihwin glared then started to laugh that barb has too much truth in it for me to deny hasnt stopped you before gerin said which got him another glare back at fox keep the men on the palisade raised a cheer when they recognized their overlord we beat the bastards back one of them shouted and in a moment they all took up the cry the ditch around the palisade was full of dead gradi a few live men were trapped down there too theyd leaped in to try to swarm up the scaling ladders only to find that those went down almost as fast as they went up gerin looked with some curiosity from them to his troopers who peered over the top of the palisade to watch them id have expected you to have finished them by now he called to his men if you want us to we will lord prince bevander bevons son called back your wife said youd be likely to want them alive for questioning and when the lady selatre says something we know its best to listen to her that might have been because the warriors respected selatres own good sense or because they still felt awe for the god who had spoken through her and wondered whether biton might still inform her thoughts gerin sometimes wondered that himself he said shes right of course however she did it she knew him almost better than he knew himself walking up to the edge of the ditch he called down to the gradi surrender and youll live for a moment the big men down in there did not respond he wondered if they knew elabonian then one of them said we live you make us slaves well of course gerin answered what else am i going to do with you give you a barony turn out my peasants so you can have a farm you make us slaves what we do the gradi asked whatever i tell you to do the fox snapped if youre a slave thats the end of the stick youre holding if i put you in the mines to grub out copper or tin you do that and if i have you walking a water wheel you walk it and thank the gods youre alive to do the walking my gods voldar and comrades they ashamed if i do these things the raider replied drawing a dagger from a sheath on his belt he muttered something in his own guttural language and plunged the knife into his chest he tried to cry out but blood pouring from his mouth and nose drowned his words slowly he crumpled as if watching him inspired them the rest of the gradi also slew themselvesexcept for two who slew each other each ramming his knife into the others throat at the same instant voldar each cried the moment before his end came father duren said gulping hed come through his first battle finebetter than gerin had at about the same agebut this ive never seen anything like it in all my life the fox said he was sickened too facing death on the field was one thing if you were a warrior that was what you did not least so you could reap the rewards of triumph but to embrace death as if it were a lover you had to be mad to do that he thought is voldar their chief god duren asked seeking as men will an explanation for the inexplicable i dont know gerin said too much about the gradi i dont know van went through their country maybe he can tell us something of what gods they have something else occurred to him he raised his voice to a great shout bind the prisoners well dont let them harm themselves from the palisade bevander said none of the warriors who made it up to the walkway by that one ladder yielded they all fell fighting that at least doesnt surprise me gerin answered their blood was up and so was ours even if they had tried to surrender we might have slain them out of hand this though he pointed down into the ditch then shook his head the most articulate man in the northlands save perhaps rihwin he was speechless in the face of the selfmurdered gradi he looked over the battlefield till he spotted van of the strong arm he waved to him but the outlander did not see the fox turned to duren go fetch van here because he went through the country of the gradi hes two ahead of anyone else around aye father duren loped off gerin looked at him with a small stir of jealousy for his sons limber youth he could feel himself stiffening up already for the next couple of days hed be hobbling around like an old man van came trotting back with the foxs son if he felt any twinges he didnt let on they killed themselves he called to gerin thats the tale the lad here tells see for yourself gerin pointed down into the ditch some of them called on voldar as they did it is he their chief god shegoddess van answered shes cold as ice any way you care to take that they love her madly the gradi do though they know she doesnt love them he shrugged if they didnt love her they say the land they live in would be bleaker yet though how that could be i tell you is past anything my poor wits can fathom but shes that kind of goddess if i were one of hers id not want to make her angry at me and thats for true surrendering after youve lost a fight would anger her the fox asked so it would to hear the gradi tell it van frowned or so i thought i heard it not knowing their tongue any too well and so i remember it not having been in the gradi country for going on twenty years now as i told duren you may not know much but whatever you do know puts you ahead of everyone else here gerin told him do you still remember any of what you learned of their speech vans frowned deepened a few words come back no moreno surprise when for so long ive used elabonian and a bit of the trokm tongue and none of the rest of the languages i once knew lets go talk to a prisoner gerin headed toward a gradi down on the ground with one of his own men squatting beside the fellow not far away lay a bronze axe the gradi tried to hitch himself toward it but the elabonian wouldnt let him the bloodsoaked bandage on the raiders thigh showed why he couldnt do more he glared up at gerin grayblue eyes blazing but the blaze slowly faded to be replaced by a puzzled look the fox had seen that before on the faces of men who would bleed to death soon he said why did you strike fox keep the gradi didnt answer maybe he didnt understand elabonian maybe he didnt understand anything not any more he nudged van the outlander spoke haltingly in a language that seemed to be pronounced farther back in the throat than elabonian something like intelligence came back into the gradis face he answered in the same tongue he says it doesnt matter what he tells us now hes died in battle voldars handmaidens will carry him off to the golden couches of the afterworld and lie with him whenever he likes and give him roast meat and beer when he doesnt feel like futtering if it doesnt matter what he tells us ask him again why he and his comrades hit fox keep gerin said van repeated what hed said before whatever that was again the gradi answered without hesitation van translated he says to kill you and take your land andsomething the outlander scowled bring it under voldar and his other goddesses and gods i think he means just what we need gerin said unhappily the trokmoi are already here in the northlands in numbers enough to let their bloodthirsty gods contend with dyaus and the other elabonian deities will we have a threecornered war among gods as well as men no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he realized the war might have more than three corners selatres biton was ancient in the northlands far more ancient than the elabonian presence here and mavrix originally from far sithonia manifested himself in this land as a fertility god even if wine grapes would not grow here the gradi spoke again dreamily as if from far away gerin caught the name voldar but had no idea what else the raider was saying van asked a question that sounded as if he were choking on a piece of meat the gradi answered van said he says voldar and the rest like this land they will make it their home and change it to suit them even better he ground up some turf with the sole of his hobnailed boot as he twisted a foot back and forth i think thats what he says its been a demon of a long time fox whatever the gradi had said they werent going to get anything more out of him he slumped forward took a last few rattling breaths and lay still the blood from the thigh wound had not only soaked the rough bandage gerins man had given him it also puddled beneath his body lets go on to another one captain van said to the fox we need to nail that down if their gods are fighting for them right out in the open like i thought from what he said weve got troubles your dyaus and the rest they let people do more unless you really shout to draw their notice i wish i could say you were wrong gerin answered the other half of the loaf is when you have drawn their notice you almost wish you hadnt i dont like dealing with gods you dont like dealing with anything stronger than you van said shrewdly youre right about that too the fox paused thoughtfully you know ive never truly evoked an elabonian god mavrix is sithonian and biton got adopted into our pantheon im not eager to start mind but i havent dont blame you van said but if the gradi do and you dont what does that leave leaves you in a bad place you ask me im already in a bad place gerin told him van looked a question his way he explained somewhere in there between being born and dying i mean oh that bad place van said the others are worse yet i hear but im in no hurry to find out over the next few days several of the wounded gradi found ways to kill themselves one threw himself down a stairway and broke his neck one hanged himself with his belt one bit through his tongue and choked to death on his own blood the determination required for that chilled gerin was he supposed to stuff rags into the mouths of all the prisoners a few of the raiders though lacked the fortitude of their fellows and seemed to resign themselves to captivity they did not ask the fox what he would do with them after they healed as if not hearing it from his lips they could pretend they did not know he didnt push the issue instead he asked them as many questions as he could using vans halting command of their speech and the smattering of elabonian some of them had acquired the picture he got from them was more detailed than the one the first dying gradi had given him but not substantially different theyd come to stay they like the northlands fine and their goddesses and gods had every intention of establishing themselves here you yield to them they let you be their slave in this world in next world too said one of the prisoners a warrior named kapich like his countrymen he took their victory and the victory of their deities for granted look around the fox suggested look where you are look who is the lord here he phrased that carefully not wanting to remind the gradi of his status so strongly that he would be inspired to kill himself the raider looked at the underground storeroom where he was confined he shrugged all will change when this is the gradihome he used elabonian but ran that together as his people seemed to do in their own language his eyes were clear and innocent and confident he believed what he was saying believed it so strongly hed never thought to question it gerin by his nature questioned everything that made him perhaps a broader and deeper man than any other in the northlands but the gradis pure and simple faith in what he said was like an armor the arrows of reason could not pierce that frightened the fox he waited unhappily for adiatunnus to take advantage of the disruption of the planned elabonian attack to launch one of his own had he been in adiatunnus boots that was what he would have done and the trokms mental processes were less alien to him than those of the gradi and when from the watchtower the lookout spied widin simrins son approaching in his chariot gerin was sure the blow had fallen the only reason widin and his men werent already at fox keep was so they could absorb adiatunnus first onslaught and keep him and his woodsrunners from penetrating too deeply into territory the fox held the drawbridge came down with a thud now although castle fox bulged with men the bridge stayed up till newcomers were identified gerin waited impatiently at the gatehouse what word he called before widin had even entered fox keep his vassal almost as urgent jumped out of the chariot and hurried over to him lord prince the trokmoi have suffered a great defeat he said thats wonderful gerin said as all the men who heard burst into cheers and swarmed round to pound widin on the back then the fox with a keener ear for detail than his comrade noticed what widin had saidand what he hadnt you didnt beat the woodsrunners yourself did you no lord prince widin answered some of them have entered my fief but as refugees and bandits not an army well who did beat them then drungo dragos son demanded bushy eyebrows pulling together in puzzlement he was brave and strong and honest and had not a dram of imagination in his head or concealed anywhere else about his person the gradi they said widin replied four boatloads came down a tributary of the niffet grounded themselves and out poured warriors grim enough by all accounts to have turned even adiatunnus stomach i wonder if those were the four boatloads who got away from us gerin said and then in thoughtful tones i wonder whether i want the answer to that to be yes or no yes i suppose if they have enough warriors to assail adiatunnus and us at the same time theyve put a lot of men into the northlands these past few years dont know the answer either way lord prince widin said from what the trokmoi who fled em told me they landed stole everything that wasnt roped down killed all the men they could kidnapped some women and sailed off with the wenches still screaming on their ships adiatunnus men couldnt very well go after them no more than we could gerin pointed toward the niffet i wish that gradi ship hadnt burned altogether we need to start learning more about how to make such ships for ourselves as may be lord prince widin said with a shrug what matters is the woodsrunners got badly hurt but then i hear the same thing happened here if i hadnt been mustering men to move against adiatunnus youd be telling your story to the gradi here gerin said that wouldnt be so good widin said the fox thought the understatement commendable his vassal went on if the gradi hadnt hit the trokmoi though i might not be around to tell you my tale so i suppose it evens out in a way i suppose it does gerin agreed his scowl was directed at the world at large and especially at the western part of it where the gradi congregated whats really happened is that the raiders have knocked me and adiatunnus both back on our heels thats bad if theyre doing the moving and were being moved that makes them the strongest power in the northlands right now youll check em lord prince widin said with the unbounded faith of a man who had watched the fox overcome every obstacle since he himself was a boy gerin sighed i wish i knew how the underground storerooms of castle fox made good places to stash prisoners as gerin had long since found he had several gradi down there now and had not lost any of them in a good many days hed counted on that one of the things hed seen over the years was that not everyone could live up to a strict code of conduct the gradi came closer to managing than most but they were human too it was dark underground dark and dank gerin carried a lamp as he headed down to a makeshift cell for another round of questioning with one of the captured raiders as the gradi was nearly vans size and not of the sort of temper given to inspiring trust gerin also brought along geroge and tharma if anything or anybody could intimidate the prisoner the monsters were the likeliest candidates he unbarred the door to the chamber where the gradi was confined and went in the raider had a lamp inside a small flickering one that filled the room with swooping shadows but didnt really illuminate it gerin half expected the gradis eyes to reflect the light he carried as a wolfs would have but his prisoner was merely human after all i greet you kapich gerin said in elabonian i greet you gerin the fox kapich returned in the same language he was more fluent in it than any other gradi at fox keep which was one reason gerin kept interrogating him he walked farther into the chamber that let geroge and tharma come in behind him their eyes did give back the lamplight redly their kind had lived in caverns subterranean for uncounted generations they needed to be able to seize on any tiny speck of light they could even gerins lamp though was not very bright kapich needed a moment to realize the fox hadnt just brought a couple of bravos with him as hed done on earlier visits the gradi sat up on his straw pallet voldar he muttered and then something unintelligible in his own language these are my friends geroge and tharma the fox said cheerfully theyre here to make sure you stay friendly and talkative kapich didnt look friendly and hed never been what anyone would have reckoned talkative staring toward the two monsters he said you have bad friends i have bad taste in all sorts of things gerin agreed cheerful still im keeping you alive for instance that brought kapichs pale glare back to him he went on now tell me more of what you gradi aim to do with the land here once you have it there is to tell not so much kapich answered we make this land into a new gradihome we live here our goddess and gods live here we all happy all you other people serve us in life voldar and others torment you forever when you die it is good im glad someone thinks so but it doesnt sound any too good to me the fox said if that bothered kapich he did an astonishingly good job of concealing it gerin said why do you think you and your jolly crew of gods and goddesses can settle down here without regard for anybody else because we are stronger the gradi said with the irksome selfassurance of his kind we beat you people at every fight what are you doing here then gerin broke in almost every fight kapich corrected himself here you were lucky we beat the trokmoi at every fight too voldar and the gods beat down their gods too drive them away your gods for a moment his selfassurance cracked if your gods let you rule over things like that he pointed to the two monsters they must have some strength im not a thing geroge said indignantly do you hear me calling you a thing you should know better than to call names had gerin been admonished to mind his manners by anyone with such an impressive set of dental work he would have seriously considered it it talks kapich said to him it is not a hound only it talks your gods will indeed be more trouble than the holy foretellers said and what did the holy foretellers foretell wholly wrong gerin asked the wordplay made kapich frown and mutter gerin resolved not to waste his wit on those who couldnt follow it after puzzling out what he meant the gradi said they said your gods were foolish and they were weak because this was not their proper home and they had no traffic with that home gerin plucked at his beard the holy foretellers had a point in a way the elabonian gods were immigrants here as were those of the gradi pantheon and indeed the northlands had been cut off from the elabonian heartland for most of a generation now but if dyaus and baivers and astis the goddess of love and the rest of the deities who had made their way north with ros the fierce were not at home here by now then they were nowhere at home theyd had centuries to grow acclimated to the northlands and have the landscape accept them the fox was sure the gradi foretellers had blundered there how to make them pay for the error had he been one of the heroes of whom the minstrels sang he would have come up with an answer on the instant and been able to use it within days if not right away as he was however an ordinary man in the real world nothing occurred to him he asked the gradi what do you mean youll make the northlands into another gradihome what does that entail hed heard the phrase before he wanted to be sure he understood its meaning kapich stared at him plainly thinking the question either foolish or having an answer so obvious it needed no explaining but explain he did in condescending tones we make this country over to suit us better it is too hot now too sunny our gods do not like this it makes them squint and sweat when they are at home here they will shield us from the nasty heat were the gradi gods strong enough to do that gerin didnt know he didnt want to find out either kapich thought they were that probably meant they thought they were too which meant theyd try what little he knew of the land from which the gradi came derived from vans accounts of his travels through it by the outlanders tales it was a country of snow and rock and stunted trees where the farmers grew oats and rye because wheat and barley wouldnt ripen in the short cool summers a place where berries took the place of tree fruit and wolves and great white bears prowled through the winters i thought you were coming here because you liked our land and our weather better than your own he said to kapich he had a hard time imagining anyone not wanting to escape from the grim conditions van had described but the gradi shook his head no voldar hates this hot country when it is ours she will make it comfortable some of our rowers in working the oars fall into a faint from the heat how do we do a mans deeds while we bake in an oven if you wanted a cold country you should have stayed in the one you had that was not gerin or even geroge that was tharma who usually held her tongue if we are strong enough to take this one our gods are strong enough to make it fit what we wantand what they want kapich answered do your gods ever want something different from what you want the fox asked probing for weaknesses kapich shook his head again how could that be they are strong we are weak we are their thralls to do as they will with us is it not the same among you here you and the trokmoi gerin thought of his own efforts some even successful to trick the gods into doing what he wanted rather than the other way round you might say that he answered and then again you might not kapich stared at him in incomprehension he left the gradi and went up to the great hall geroge and tharma following geroge asked can his gods really do that what he said they could the monster sounded like a boy asking his father for reassurance the sky couldnt really freeze and shatter and fall on his head during a cold winter gerin was as close to a father as geroge had among the world of men as far as he was concerned that meant he had a fathers obligation to be honest with the young monster he said i dont know ive never had to deal with the gods the gradi follow till now youll find a way around them tharma spoke confidently as children are convinced their fathers can do anything she was certain the fox would be able to fend off voldar and the rest of the dark deities from the dark gloomy land the gradi called their own as widin simrins son had shown most of gerins subjects felt that same confidence in him he wished he had more of it himself as far as he could see hed been lucky in his dealings with gods up to now when you were dealing with beings far more powerful than you were how long could your luck last could you make it stretch for a whole lifetime of course you can gerin thought wryly if you make a mistake while youre treating with a god you dont have any more lifetime after that van got up from the table where hed been sitting you look like a man who could use a jack of ale or maybe three he said one maybe gerin said while the outlander plied the dipper if i drink three ill drink myself gloomy honh van said how would anyone else tell the difference to the crows with you too the fox said and poured down the ale van had given him these gradi you know theyre going to be nothing but trouble no doubt van said but more as if relishing than abhorring the prospect you ask me life gets dull without trouble no one asked you gerin said pointedly his friend went on as if he hadnt spoken aye betimes life gets dull ive put down so many roots here at fox keep oftentimes i think im all covered with moss and dust life here can be a bore for true if things get too boring you can always fight with fand the fox said van tried to ignore that too but found he couldnt so i do he said shaking his head as if to shake off a wasp buzzing around it so i do but she fights with me as much as i fight with her that gerin knew from experience was also true maybe its love he murmured which drew an irate glare from van the outlanders eyes didnt quite focus and were tracked with red which made gerin wonder how many jacks of ale van had had his friend didnt test his enormous capacity as often as he once had but today looked to be an exception if it is love why do we go on sticking knives into each other year after year van demanded given fands habitsshed stabbed a trokm whod mistreated hergerin wasnt so sure his friend was using a metaphor till the outlander went on you and selatre a yearll go by between harsh words me and fand every peaceful day is a battle won and you call that love if it werent youd leave it gerin answered every time you have left though youve come back he raised a sardonic eyebrow and wouldnt you be bored if you didnt quarrel you just said you thought peace and staying in one place for years were boring ahh fox you dont fight fair hitting a man on the head with his own words like that van hiccuped most peoplefand fr instanceyou say something to em and they pay it no mind but you now you listen and you save it and you give it back just so as itll hurt worst when you do thank you gerin said that got him another dirty look from the outlander i didnt mean it for praise i know the fox answered but ill take it for such all the same if you dont listen and remember you cant do much he turned the subject do you think the gradi can do as they say they willthem and their gods i mean thats the question sure as sure van said the one weve been scratching our heads about since they tried to tear the keep down around our ears he peered down into his jack of ale as if trying to use it as a scrying tool if i had to guess captain id say they likely can unless somebody stops them that is unless i stop them you mean the fox said and van nodded his hard features unwontedly somber gerin muttered something coarse under his breath even van of the strong arm whod traveled far more widely than he himself ever would whod done things and dared things that would have left him quivering in horror looked to him for answers he was sick of having the weight of the whole world pressed down on his shoulder even a god would break under a burden like that let alone a man likely more than half through his appointed skein of days whenever he wished he could rest something new and dreadful came along to keep him hopping lord prince he looked up there stood herris bigfoot his expression nervous the new village headman often looked nervous gerin wondered whether that was because he worried about his small job as the fox did about his larger one or because he had something going on the side well he said his voice neutral lord prince the village suffered when the gradi came here herris said we had men killed as you know and fields trampled and animals run off or wantonly slain and some of our houses burned down toolucky for us it wasnt all of em not just luck headman gerin waved to the warriors sitting here and there in the great hall some repairing the leather jerkins they covered with scales of bronze to make corselets of them others fitting points to arrows still others sharpening sword blades against whetstones luck had a bit of help here if we hadnt driven the gradi away youd have had a thin time of it thats so herris bobbed his head in his eagerness to agreeor at least to be seen agreeing dyaus praise all your brave vassals who kept those robbers from hauling everything back to their big boats still and all though some bad things happened to us in spite of how brave they fought ah now i see which way the wind blows gerin said youll want me to take that into account come fall when im reckoning up your dues youll be missing people and animals youll have spent time you could have been weeding on making repairs and so forth thats it thats right herris exclaimed then he noticed gerin hadnt promised anything uh lord princewill you how in the five hells do i know the fox shouted herris sprang back a couple of paces in alarm several of the warriors looked up to see why gerin was yelling a little more quietly he went on have you noticed sirrah i have rather more to worry about than you or your village i was going to fight a war against the trokmoi now ill have to fight the gradi first and maybe aragis the archer off to the side if anything is left of this principality come fall ill worry over what to do about your dues ask me then if were both alive till then dont joggle my elbow over such things not when im trying to figure out how to fight gods do you understand herris gulped and nodded and fled his sandals thumped on the drawbridge as he hurried back to the village no doubt he was disappointed no doubt the rest of the serfs would be gerin resolved to bear up under that as hed told the headman he had more important things to worry about to his own surprise he burst out laughing whats funny fox van demanded now i understand what the gods must feel like when i ask them for something gerin said theyre really doing things that matter more to them and they dont like being nagged by some piddling little mortal whos going to up and disappear in a few years no matter what they do or dont do for him as far as theyre concerned im an annoyance nothing more ah well youre good at the job van said gerin wondered whether his friend intended that as a compliment or a sly dig after a moment he shrugged however van intended it it was true gerin drew his bow back to his ear and let fly the sinew bowstring lashed his wrist the arrow flew straight and true into the flank of a young deer that had wandered too close to the bushes behind which he sheltered the deer bounded away through the underbrush after him gerin shouted bursting from concealment he and van and geroge and tharma pounded down the trail of blood the deer left you got him good fox van panted he wont run far and well feast tonight venison and onions and ale to wash em down he smacked his lips there gerin pointed the deer had hardly been able to run even a bowshot it lay on the ground looking reproachfully back at the men who had brought it down as always when he saw a deers liquid black eyes fixed on his the fox knew a moments guilt not so geroge with a hoarse cry the monster threw himself on the fallen deer and tore out its throat with his fangs the deers hooves thrashed briefly then it lay still geroge got to his feet his mouth was bloody he ran his tongue around his lips to clean them more blood dripped from his massive jaws down onto the brownish hair that grew thick on his chest you didnt need to do that gerin said working hard to keep his voice mild it would have been dead soon anyhow but i liked killing it geroge answered by the way his deepset eyes glittered by the way the breath whistled in and out of his lungs hed more than liked it it had excited him the suddenly rampant and quite formidable bulge in his trousers suggested the same thing he didnt yet realize the excitement of the hunt could be transmuted to other excitements but he would soon and what then gerin asked himself it was another question that refused to wait for an answer especially when he saw how tharma looked at geroge everything seemed to be descending on his head at the same time the trokmoi the gradi the gods and now the awakening of the monsters it wasnt fair you could deal with troubles when they came singly but how were you supposed to deal with them when you couldnt handle one before the next upped and bit you maybe you couldnt hed learned a long time before that life wasnt fair you had to go on any way you could but having all his problems so compressed seemed inartistic somehow whatever gods were responsible for his fate should have had more consideration van drew his bronze dagger after i gut the beast what say we make a fire and roast the liver and kidneys right here meat doesnt get any fresher than that geroge and tharma agreed so readily and so enthusiastically that even had gerin been inclined to argue he would have thought twice but he wasnt inclined to argue turning to the monsters he said gather me some tinder would you while they scooped up dry leaves and tiny twigs gerin found a stout branch on the ground and a good straight stick he used the point of his own dagger to bore a hole in the branch then wound a spare bowstring around the stick and twirled it rapidly with the string van was even better with a fire bow than he was but the outlander was also busy butchering the deer and gerin had made plenty of fires on his own if you were patient he worked the string back and forth back and forth the stick went round and round round and round in the hole after a while smoke began to rise from it tinder he said softly not breaking his rhythm here geroge fed some crumpled leaves into the holenot too many or he would have snuffed out the sparks gerin had brought to life hed done that before and gerin had shouted at him for it just as if he werent physically far more formidable than the fox gerin breathed gently on the sparks blowing them out was another risk you took presently they grew to flames there ought to be a way to do that by magic van said impaling a chunk of liver on a stick and handing it to geroge i know several as a matter of fact gerin answered the easiest will leave you exhausted for half a day no thats not so the one for the flaming sword wont but that one takes ingredients that arent always easy to come by and if you do it wrong youre liable to burn yourself up sometimes the simplest way is the best one aye well summat to that i suppose the outlander admitted but still a clever fellow like you ought to be able to figure out an easy way to make the kind of magic you need i have trouble enough working magic gerin exclaimed expecting me to come up with new kinds is asking too much wizards who could do things like that wrote grimoires they didnt go from one book of spells to another picking out the simplest things to try and hoping they worked geroge toasted his chunk of liver over the fire after a moment tharma joined him the savory smell of roast meat drove the thought of magic from the foxs mind the meat wasnt well roasted both foundling monsters had accepted the notion that meat needed cooking before being eaten but theyd accepted it reluctantly and ate even roast meat bloodier than was to gerins taste they were also halfhearted about any notions of manners with their teeth they hardly needed to cut bites from a slab of meat so they could chew them they just bit down and a juicy gobbet disappeared forever every time they did van handed gerin a kidney on a stick he cooked it a good deal longer than the monsters had their pieces of liver i wish we had some herbs or even a bit of salt he said but that was almost ritualistic complaint the strong fresh flavor of the kidneyswhich went stale so quickly after you killed an animaldidnt need enhancement van roasted the deers other kidney for himself when he lifted it away from the flames he took a bite and then swore might as well be right out of your five hells fox i just burned my mouth ive done that gerin said weve all done that we ought to bring the rest of the carcass back to the keep the outlander checked the sun through the forests leafy canopy we still have some daylight left i dont feel like going back yet suppose i do the heart in four parts and we cook that too do that geroge said and tharma nodded any excuse to eat more meat was a good one for them go ahead gerin said after he too gauged the sun the cooks will jeer at us for stealing the best bits ourselves but thats all right they didnt catch the beast and we did before slicing up the heart van kicked the pile of guts away from the fire he frowned a little not so many flies on em as idve thought its been a cool spring that has something to do with it gerin said then he too frowned sometimes the most innocent remark when you took it the wrong wayor maybe the right oneled to fresh ideas and fresh worries is it a cool spring because thats how it happens to be or is it a cool spring because the gods of the gradi are getting a toehold here and want it to be cool you have a cheerful way of looking at things dont you fox van handed him a piece of the meat hed just cut here get some fresh heart in you gerin snorted you have been at fox keep a goodish while havent you when you first got here you never would have made a joke like that see how youve corrupted me the outlander said bad jokes staying in one place for years at a time having brats and knowing iti probably sired some out on the road but i never stayed in one place long enough to find out its a strange life settled folk live all what youre used to gerin said and by now youve been here long enough to be used to this he glanced over to geroge and tharma sometimes the two of themespecially gerogewould closely follow human conversation humans were all they knew and they wanted to fit in as best they could today though both of them seemed more intent on the roasting quarters of heart than on what gerin was saying he didnt let that bother him as much as he would have a few years before hed done a better job of making them into more or less human beings than hed ever expected no hed made them into more or less human children he still had no proof their true essence would stay hidden as they matured he still had no idea what to do with them as they did mature either the just thing would be to let them grow up as if they were people and to treat them as such unless and until they gave him some reason to do otherwise the safe thing would be to put them out of the way before he had to do it he took his piece of roasted heart off the fire blew on it and took a bite the meat was tough and chewy and he lacked the teeth to slice effortlessly through it as geroge and tharma had he sighed the safest thing would have been to put them out of the way as soon as they came into his hands he hadnt done that then fearing the hands of the gods not his own had true control over their fate he still feared that now hed do nothingexcept worry vans teeth were merely human but he made short work of his chunk of deer heart he licked his fingers and wiped them clean on the grass then dug around with a fingernail to rout out a piece of meat stuck somewhere in the back of his mouth that hit the spot he said enough to make my belly happy not so much that i wont be able to enjoy myself come supper the way you eat the only thing that amazes me is that youre not as wide as you are tall gerin said van looked down at himself i am thicker through the middle than i used to be i think if i get too much thicker i wont be able to fit into my corselet and then what will i do save it for kor gerin answered unless maeva takes it before he has the chance you had that thought run through your head too eh van started to laugh but quickly swallowed his mirth it could happen i suppose theres not a boy her age can match her and shes wild for weapons too whether thatll still be so once she sprouts breasts and hipsthe gods may know but i dont shell not be one of the common herd of women any which way so much ill say already no the fox agreed in musing tones he went on i wonder now is there any such thing as the common herd of women once you come to know em selatre wouldnt fit there nor fand the gods know he and van both chuckled each a little nervously nor elise either thinking back you seldom speak of her van said he scratched at his beard to a shepherd i suppose each of his sheep is special even if theyre nothing but bleating balls of wool to the likes of you or me i know thats so gerin said warming to the discussion ive seen it with my own eyes it makes you wonder doesnt it the better you know the members of a class the less typical of the class they seem does that mean there really isnt any such thing as the common herd of women dont know if id go so far van answered next thing youll be saying theres no such thing as a common grain of sand or a common stalk of wheat when any fool can see there is a lot of times the things any fool can see are the things only a fool would believe gerin said if you looked hard enough i daresay you could find differences between grains of sand or stalks of wheat oh you could maybe van allowed but why would you bother a question like that intended to dismiss a subject often started gerin thinking harder so here he said i cant tell you why you might want to know one grain of sand from another but if you could tell which stalk of wheat would yield twice as much as the others wouldnt you want to do that you have me fox his friend said if i could do that i would i cant not by looking can you no though i wish i could gerin paused i wonder if i could make a magic to see that maybe with barley not wheat baivers god of barley knows ive never scanted him and he might lend me aid that would be a sorcery worth taking risks for if i could bring it off he wondered if he knew enough or could learn enough here in the northlands even to plan such a spell or rather he started to wonder geroges formidable yawn distracted him the monster said im bored sitting around here can we go back to the keep now aye we can gerin climbed to his feet in fact wed better so were there before sunset with the deer we have enough for a decent offering for the ghosts but you dont want to use such things if you dont have to they tied the carcass to a sapling which they took turns shouldering by pairs as they carried it to the chariot waiting at the edge of the woods the car had been crowded for four and was all the more crowded for four plus a gutted deer but fox keep wasnt far when they got back a stranger waited in the courtyard no not quite a stranger after a moment gerin identified him youre authari brokentooth arent you one of ricolf the reds vassals your memory is good lord prince the newcomer said bowing i am authari when he opened his mouth to speak you could see the front tooth that gave him his sobriquet but i am not ricolf the reds vassal i came here to tell you ricolf has died iv but he cant have done that gerin exclaimed looking back on it surely one of the more foolish things hed ever said authari was polite enough not to point that out authari whatever else he was was usually polite gerin recovered his wits and went on i am in your debt for bringing me the news you will of course stay the night and sup with me i will lord prince and thank you authari said bowing again it happened four days ago now he was drinking a cup of ale when he said he had a headache the cup fell out of his hand and he slid off the bench he never woke up again and half a day later he was dead worse ways to go the fox remarked and authari nodded like most men both of them had seen a great many worse ways but that was not the point of this visit and gerin knew it the succession to his barony authari coughed just so lord prince the succession to his barony several of ricolfs vassals banded together and bade me tell you tell me what gerin said his voice deceptively mild what have you and your fellow vassals of ricolfs to tell me in law his heir is surely my son duren as he has no sons of his own living were you still wed to his daughter elise lord prince no one would contest durens right of succession authari replied the fox did not believe that for an instant but waited for the minor noble to go on after a moment authari did by her own actions though if tales be true elise severed her connection with you and duren has been raised here not in the holding of ricolf the red but for the thin tie of blood we keepholders have no reason to feel any special loyalty toward your son and would sooner see one of our own number installed in ricolfs place of course you would gerin said mildly still that way when a year and a half down the line the rest of you decide you dont care for whichever of your number youve chosen you can go to war against him with a clear conscience and make his holding as much a mess as bevons ever was you misunderstand authari said in hurt tones that is not our concern at all our fear is having foisted upon us a youth who does not know the holding gerin felt his patience leaking away like grains of sandwhether individually identifiable or notbetween his fingers your concern is if duren takes over ricolfs holding youll all have to become my vassals as well as his therenow its out in the open so it is authari sounded relievedhe hadnt had to come right out and say it himself no one denies youre a good man lord prince but we who served ricolf value our freedom as true men must you value freedom even more than law seems to me gerin replied and when you use the one to flout the other soon you have neither as may be authari drew himself up to his full height if you seek to install duren by force of arms i must tell you we shall fight at most times that threat if it could be so dignified would have made gerin laugh lands where the barons did acknowledge his suzerainty surrounded the holding of ricolf the red the main reason ricolf had never sworn fealty to him was that hed been too embarrassed to ask it of the older man after elise ran away with the horseleech he could easily have summoned up the force to quash ricolfs restive vassals were he not facing war with adiatunnus and a bigger war against the gradi he did not need distractions not now and then authari said if you seek to interfere with our freedom i must tell you we have friends to the south youd call on aragis the archer would you gerin said authari nodded defiantly i ought to let you do it the fox told him it would serve you right if you think you wouldnt fancy being my vassals you deserve to be his first time anyone stepped out of line hed crucify the fool that would make the rest of you thinkif anything could which i doubt autharis angry scowl showed the stump of his front tooth he shook a finger in gerins face now thats just the kind of thing we dont want in an overlordshowing off how much better than us he thinks he is aragis would respect us and respect our rights only goes to show how much you dont know about aragis gerin answered with a derisive snort but then he checked himself the more he antagonized authari the more the loon and his fellow fools were liable to summon aragis to their aid since the archers forces would have to pass through areas under gerins control that would touch off the longthreatened war between them at the worst possible time for the northlands as a whole we may not know about aragis by dyaus but we know about you authari said and what we know we dont trust if you know me you know my word is good the fox said has anyone ever denied that authari answer yes or no reluctantly authari shook his head when he did gerin went on then maybe youll hear out the proposal i put to you ill hear it authari said but i fear it may be another of your tricksy schemes gerin thought seriously about taking authari up onto the palisade and dropping him headfirst into the ditch around fox keep but his head was so hard the treatment probably would neither harm him nor knock in any sense and so the fox said suppose we ask the sibyl at ikos who the rightful heir to ricolf the red is if the oracle says it should be one of you people i wont fight that but if duren should succeed his grandfather you accept him without any quarrels is that just maybe it is and maybe its not authari answered the god speaks in mysterious ways were liable to get an answer that will just keep us squabbling some truth to that gerin said not wanting to yield any points to ricolfs vassal but unable to avoid it and of course people of bad will can deny the meaning of even the plainest verses will you and your fellows swear a binding oath by the gods that youll do no such thing i willand i trust bitons judgment however he sees the future authari gnawed at his underlip youre so cursed glib lord prince you always have a plan ready and you dont give a man time to think about it as far as the fox was concerned planning came as naturally as breathing if authari hadnt thought he might suggest the sibyl as a means of resolving their dispute authari hadnt looked very far ahead silently gerin sighed people seldom did at last much more slowly than he should have authari said ill take that back to my fellows its worth thinking on if nothing else dont spend too much time thinking about it gerin said in peremptory tones if i have to i can ravage your countryside and maybe take several of your keeps before aragis could hope to get far enough north to do you any good with luck authari had no idea how reluctant he was to launch such a campaign still sharply he went on youll ride out tomorrow ten days after that ill follow and meet you at ricolfs keep to hear your answer dont think to waylay me for ill have plenty of men along to start the war on the spot if thats what you people decide you want he waited authari had the look of a man whod just discovered his lady friend not only had a husband but that the fellow was twice his size and bad tempered to boot he licked his lips then said ill take your word back with me lord prince since you put it so i expect well let the sibyl and the god decide it if thats their will i hoped youd see it that way gerin said with irony that sailed past authari he sighed again sup drink stay the night i have to find my son and let him know whats happened grandfather dead durens face twisted in surprise that startlement was all the more complete because when gerin tracked him down in a corridor back of the kitchen death had been the last thing on his mind exactly what hed been about to do with a serving girl wasnt obvious but that hed been about to do something was thats what i said gerin answered and summarized what authari had told him finishing he lived a long life and a pretty good one taken all in all and he died easy as those things go a man could do worse duren nodded once over his initial surprise he starting thinking soon enough to please his father i wish id known him better he said i always thought the same gerin said but he was never one to travel much and iive had an active time most of these years and he hesitated then brought it out and the matter of your mother clouded things between us he watched durens face fall into a set still mask that happened whenever the youth had to think of elise whod given him birth and then abandoned him along with gerin he didnt remember her at allfor as long as his memory reached selatre had been his motherbut he knew of his past and it pained him then he made the mental connection he had to make with grandfather dead with my mothergonethat leaves me heir to the holding so it does gerin said what do you think about that i dont know what to think yet duren answered i hadnt thought to leave fox keep so soon after a moment he added i hadnt thought to leave fox keep at all i always knew this was one of the things that might happen his father said that it chose now to happencomplicates my life it complicates my life too duren exclaimed with justifiable indignation if i go down theredo you really think i can give orders to men so much older and stronger than i am you wont be a youth forever you wont even be a youth for long though i know it doesnt seem that way to you the fox said by the time youre eighteen at latest youll have a mans full strength and take a look at widin simrins son he wasnt any older than you when he took over his vassal barony and hes done a fine job of running it ever since but hes your vassal duren said i wouldnt be id be on my own his eyes widened as he thought that through id have as much rank as you father near enough i wouldnt call myself prince or anything like that but gerin nodded i understand what youre saying youd owe no one allegiance not unless you wanted to thats right you could go to war with me if you chose to and youd break no oaths doing it i wouldnt father duren said then proving he was indeed the foxs son he added or rather i dont see any reason to now i didnt expect you to call out the chariots the moment you become a baron gerin said chuckling id hope you wouldnt and even though you wouldnt be my vassal as ricolfs heir youre still my son and ricolfs chief vassals know that its one of the things that bother them if they dont answer to you theyll have to answer to me and not in ways they fancy that will help you for a while and by then dyaus willing theyll have the habit of obeying you i cant lean on you forever duren said sooner or later likely sooner ill have to lead on my own thats true durens being able to see it made gerin want to burst with pride when the time comesand itll come sooner than you think it always doesi expect youll be able to do it what if duren paused then went on what if the sibyl at ikos says im not to rule grandfathers holding then youre not gerin answered thats all there is to it you can try to twist a gods will you can try to trick a god but if you try to go dead against what a god says youll fail if the sibyl says ricolfs holding is not for you you know you have a place here i dont even know that i want to try to run that holding duren muttered perhaps more to himself than to his father if you dont think you want it if you dont think youre ready i wont set on you a burden you cant bear the fox assured him thats what well tell authari and hell ride south and tell it to the rest of ricolfs vassals and the holding will be lost to us duren said it didnt sound like a question as it easily might have it came out flat and harsh things arent always lost forever gerin said my guess here is that once the vassals fought among themselves for a while theyd welcome an overlord who wasnt a jumpedup equal but someone they could all follow without any jealousy duren looked at him in blank incomprehension gerin smiled and put a hand on his sons shoulder for duren half a year felt like a long time and waiting a few years to let things sort themselves out was beyond his mental reach gerin didnt blame him hed been the same himself at the same age as had everyone else who made it to and then past fourteen i do want it duren declared if biton says i have the right to rule that holding ill do the best i can there one day maybe he didnt go on he set his jaw as if to say gerin could not make him go on gerin didnt try he could make a pretty good guess as to what was in his sons mind one day he would die too and then duren would inherit his broad holdings as well as ricolfs single barony his son was right that was what would happen if the gradi got their way it was liable to happen before the year was out of course if the gradi got their way duren would be in no position to inherit anything but a grave selatre said i wish i were coming with you that wasnt serious complaint if shed made serious complaint about riding south with gerin and van and duren she would have gone wistfully she went on id like to see how biton restored his shrine after the earthquake laid it low from all weve heard its just the same as it used to be gerin said which was both true and in large measure beside the point when it took divine intervention to bring back what had been destroyed the restoration was on the face of it worth seeing and it would be so interesting to go into the underground chamber of prophecy just as a person not as a sibylto see the prophetic trance from the outside instead of being a part of it its because you were the sibyl that i want you to stay here gerin told her my vassals are more likely to listen to you because the god once spoke through you than they are to any of their own number and a good thing too if you ask me for youre more clever than any of them more clever than rihwin selatre asked mischief in her voice her gaze flicked out to the hallway beyond the library chamber where they sat quietly talking there of all places in fox keep they were least likely to be disturbed but rihwin formidably educated himself was one who might come in to look at a scroll or codex gerin glanced outside too before replying much more clever than rihwin for you have the sense to know when cleverness for its own sake isnt the answer and hes never yet figured that out for which i thank you his wife said id have been angry if you told me anything else but i do thank you for what you did tell me van would say something like honh about now gerin said so he would selatre agreed hell probably say it several times on the trip down to ikos hell probably do several other things on the way down to ikos too things where hed be better off if fand never heard of them she wont hear about them from me or from van either i hope gerin said only trouble is that wont matter whether hell tell her about them or not shell know what hes been doing and theyll have a row when we get home or maybe shell do something to keep herself amusedor to make him furiouswhile hes gone do you suppose you could keep her from trying something like that me selatre stared at him in horrified disbelief then clutched his hand as if she were drowning in the niffet and he a floating log take me with you to ikos after all oh please anything but trying to keep fand from what she sets her mind on doing she laughed and so did gerin but he knew she wasnt altogether joking she went on quite seriously if anyone can restrain fand its van and the other way around but neither has much hope of that out of the others sight too true gerin said and then again too true ive given up on it for both of them and you expect me to manage with her selatre said i like that dagref poked his head into the library manage what mama and with who what i need to manage and with the person i was talking about she said why wont you tell me dagref demanded any child would have let out that eternal complaint but he went on why shouldnt i know would i tell someone would it make that person angry he brightened his string of questions had led him to an answer ill bet it has something to do with aunt fand she gets angry faster than anyone else i know why didnt you want to tell me that i wouldnt tell your secret whatever it is it must have something to do with uncle van going away is that right gerin and selatre looked at each other it wasnt the first time dagref had done that to them his relentless pursuit of precision would take him a long wayunless he failed to notice it leading him into trouble hes nine now gerin thought uneasily what will he be like as a man grown only one answer occurred to him as he is now only more so it was a vaguelyor perhaps not so vaguelyalarming notion he said no son we were talking about one of the cows down in the village and what your mother should do if it has chickens cows dont have chickens dagref said indignantly then his face cleared oh youre making a joke he sounded like gerin letting off some serf after a minor offense and warning the wretch of how much trouble hed be in if he ever did such a thing again yes a joke the fox agreed now go on out of here and let us finish talking about whatever it was knowing secrecy was a losing battle he fought it anyhow dagref left without any more disputation that surprised gerin for a moment then he realized his son having won the argument didnt need to stay and fight it through a second time he rolled his eyes what are we going to do with that one hope experience lends him sense to go with his wits selatre answered it often does you know yes leaving rihwin out of the bargain gerin glanced warily toward the door half expecting dagref to reappear and ask out of what bargain selatres gaze had gone in the same direction and probably for the same reason when her eyes met gerins they both started to laugh but she sobered quickly if the gradi or adiatunnus attack us i cant lead the men into battle she said who commands then gerin wished he hadnt just made his joke because that question had only one answer cant be anyone but rihwin he said hes the best of all of them here especially if he has someone to check his enthusiasm thats what youll do up till the fighting starts once it does well when the fighting starts everyones plans good and foolish alike have a way of breaking down ill miss you selatre said i always worry when youre away from fox keep sometimes i have to go thats all gerin said but ill tell you this with you here i have all the reason i need and then some to want to come back again good selatre said the fox rode south with a force of twenty chariots at his back that wouldnt be as many as all of ricolfs vassals could gather but it was plenty to make him dangerous in a fight besides if ricolfs vassals didnt have factional squabbles of their own that would be a miracle about which the minstrels would sing for years to come instead of raffo duren was driving the chariot in which gerin and van rode he handled the reins with confidence but without undue arrogance unlike some a good deal older than himself hed come to understand the importance of convincing the horses to do what he wanted rather than treating them like rowboats or other brainless tools as fox keep disappeared behind trees when the road jogged van let out a long happy sigh does my nose good to get away from the castle stink he said yours is cleaner than most fox but that only goes so far especially with all the extra warriors packed in i know gerin answered my nose is happier away from the keep too but if we keep rattling along like this my kidneys are liable to fall out pity you cant keep the elabon way repaired up to the way it used to be van said but i suppose i should be grateful theres any road at all gerin shrugged i havent the masons to keep it the way it was or the artisans to build the deep strong bed that holds up to traffic and weather both cobbles and gravel keep it open in the rain and mud even if they are hard on a mans insides and a horses hooves to say nothing of the wheels van added as they jounced over a couple of particularly large particularly rough cobbles good thing we have spare axle poles and some extra spokes in case we break em this isnt even a particularly bad stretch gerin said those places farther south where balamung wrecked the roadway those are the ones that havent been the same since in spite of all the effort ive had the peasants put into them youd expect wizardry to smash a road worseor faster anywaythan ordinary wear and tear van said a glint came into his eyes as he went on i wonder if you could set it right by wizardry too maybe you could the fox refused to rise to the bait the gods know i wouldnt be madman enough to try his little army halted by a peasant village to spend the night as the sun set the serfs sacrificed several chickens letting their blood run down into a small trench theyd dug in the dirt the offering of blood the torches flickering outside their huts and the great bonfire the warriors made were enough to keep the keening of the night ghosts down to a level a man could bear up in the sky pale nothos was a fat waxing crescent gerin was surprised to realize it had almost completed one of its slow cycles since hed made his ruling on the rightful ownership of swifty the hound a lot had been crowded into that time quickmoving tiwaz also a waxing crescent hung a little to the east of nothos ruddy elleb a nailparing of a moon soon followed the sun into the west golden math would not rise till after midnight inside the borders of his own holding he posted only a couple of sentries for the night not all his men went straight to sleep anyhow some of them tried their luck with the women unattached and otherwise of the village some of that luck was good and some of it was bad one thing gerins subjects had learned during the generation he ruled them they did not have to give in for no better reason than that a warrior demanded it of them hed outlawed fighting men who forced women his men knew what he expected of them too and by and large lived up to it when duren made as if to go after a pretty girl who looked a couple of years older than he was the fox said go ahead but dont tell her who your father is why not duren asked what quicker way to get her to say yes but will she have said it because youre you or because youre my son gerin asked he wondered if duren cared so long as the answer turned out to be the one he wanted probably not he remembered how little hed cared at the same age try it he urged his son see what happens maybe i will duren said and maybe he did but the fox didnt find out one way or the other feeling no urge to chase after any of the peasant women he lay down wrapped himself in a blanket and slept till the sun woke him the next morning the ride down to ricolfs keep was more peaceful than the journey had been when hed made it in his younger days now all the barons between his own holding and ricolfs acknowledged him as their overlord and had for the most part given up squabbling among themselves even what had been bevons baronynow held by his son bevander since his other sons had backed adiatunnus against gerin in their last clashseemed to be producing more crops than brigands progress he thought because ricolf had always formally remained free of gerins suzerainty he had kept up the post between his land and bevons his border guards saluted when the fox and his fighting tail drew near pass through one of them said standing aside with a spearshaft he had held across the road authari said you would be coming after him and so we are gerin set a hand on his sons shoulder and here is duren ricolfs grandson who if biton the farseeing agrees will become your lord now that ricolfa brave man and a good one if ever such there wasno longer lives in the world of men the border guards looked curiously at duren nodding to them he said if i can rule this holding half so well as ricolf did i will be pleased i hope you will be pleased with me too and teach me what i need to learn gerin hadnt told him what to say on first meeting ricolfs men he wanted to see how his son fared on his own he would be on his own if he succeeded to the barony the guardsmen seemed happy enough with what hed said one of them asked if you take the holding will it be as vassal to the fox here he pointed at gerin duren shook his head he hasnt asked that of me why would he im his son what kind of oath could i give to bind me to him tighter than that well said one of the border guards answered he waved southward deeper into the territory ricolf had ruled ride on then and may the gods make it all turn out for the best once theyd passed beyond the border station gerin said you did fine there you can give authari and the rest of the petty barons the same answer i dont see how they can fault you on it either good duren answered over his shoulder ive been thinking about these things ever since authari came to fox keep i want to do them as best i can you will with that way of looking at them gerin told him he studied his sons back as the chariot rattled along duren was starting to do his own thinking not coming to the fox for every answer hes becoming a man gerin thought bemused but he took it for a good sign they came to the keep that had for so many years been ricolfs as the sun was sliding down the western sky elleb had grown to a plump waxing crescent while nothos at first quarter hung like half a coin a little east of south tiwaz had swelled in the past three days to halfway between quarter and full and was climbing toward the southeastern part of the sky who comes to this castle the watchman called and gerin felt a jar inside him at hearing ricolfs name omitted from the challenge approaching ricolfs keep gave him an odd feeling these days anyhow old memories twisted and stirred and muttered in his ear like the night spirits fighting to be understood once more in the world of the living here he had met elise here he had spirited her away south of the high kirs here on returning he had bedded her here after beating balamung he had returned and claimed her for his wife and she was gone now and had been gone for most of the time since then and taken a piece of his spirit with her when she went and so for all the happiness hed found since with selatre coming here was like poking at a scar that while it had healed on the surface remained sore down below it probably would be so long as he lived but change came along with memory he answered the watchman i am gerin called the fox come with my son duren who is also the grandson of ricolf the red to discuss the succession to this holding with authari brokentooth and whichever of ricolfs vassal barons he may have summoned hither you are welcome here lord gerin the sentry said he could hardly have failed to know who the fox was but the forms had to be observed with a rattle of chains the drawbridge lowered so gerin and his companions could cross over the moat and enter the keep unlike gerins ricolfs ditch had water in it making it a better ward for the castle ricolfs men stared down from the walls at gerin and the small chariot army hed brought with him in the failing light he had trouble reading their faces did they think him ally or usurper even if he could not tell now hed find out soon enough authari came out of the great hall along with several other men who wore authority like a cloak authari bowed wellmannered as usual i greet you lord prince his eyes swung to duren and you as well grandson of the lord who held my homage and fealty he conceded duren nothing gerin had expected as much duren said dyaus and the other gods grant you give me vassalage as good as my grandfather got from you gerin admired his sons selfpossession it seemed to startle authari but he quickly rallied saying that is what we have gathered here to decide he gave his attention back to gerin lord prince i present to you hilmic barrelstaves wacho fidus son and ratkis bronzecaster who with me arewerericolfs chiefest vassals hilmic barrelstaves was short and stocky with bowed legs that had probably given him his ekename a streak of white ran through his black hair almost like a horses blaze the end of a scar that must have seamed his scalp just showed on his forehead gerin had seen cases like that before where hair grew in pale along the length of a healed wound wacho by contrast could have been a trokm from his looks he was tall and blond and ruddy with pale eyes above knobby cheekbones and a long thin nose ratkis seemed an ordinary elabonian till you noticed his hands which were callused and scarred probably from the craft from which he derived his sobriquet as with authari gerin knew them but not well they greeted him as equal to equal which was technically correcttill ricolf had a successor they acknowledged they were their own menbut struck the fox as arrogant all the same he let it go power still lay with him shall we start the wrangle now or wait till after supper authari asked once the greetings were done no wrangle gerin answered two things can happen first you can accept duren as your baron straightaway we wont wacho said and hilmic nodded emphatic agreement neither authari nor ratkis backed wacho by word or gesture that disconcerted him he choked down whatever he might have been about to add and instead asked whats the other thing we wait to see what the sibyl at ikos says gerin told him if biton says duren is to rule here rule he will and nothing you try to do about it will change things a bit and if the god says hes not meant to be your baron hell go back to fox keep with me wheres the wrangle in any of that or dont you agree to the terms authari and i settled on without changing his voice in any easily describable way he let wacho know disagreeing with those terms would not be a good idea ratkis spoke for the first time the terms are fair lord prince more than fair you could have brought a real army with you not a guard and installed the lad in this keep by force but sometimes when biton speaks through the sibyl what he means isnt clear till long afterwards lifes not always simple what do we do if its complicated here gerin almost grabbed him by the hand and swore friendship with him for life for nothing more than recognizing that ambiguity could exist to most men in the northlands something was either good in which case it was perfection or bad in which case it was abomination the fox supposed that made keeping track of things simple but simplicity was not always a virtue heres what i have in mind he said if anyone thinks the sibyls verse can have more than one meaning even if interpreted with all possible goodwill then we put it to the four of you on the one hand and duren van the lady selatre and me on the other whoever has the most backers among those eight will see his view prevail and if the eight of us divide evenly authari asked the four of you against the four of us you mean gerin said that seems likeliest authari answered the fox was about to reply but duren spoke first his voice for once mandeep not cracking at all then we go to war and edged bronze will tell who has the better right i was about to say the same thing gerin said but my sonricolfs grandson i remind you once moreput it better than i could hope to do he didnt add that he wanted a war with ricolfs vassals about as much as he wanted an outbreak of pestilence in the village by fox keep if we go to war aragis the archer will wacho began no aragis the archer wont gerin interrupted oh aragis may choose to fight me over ricolfs holding here but he wont be doing it for you and he wont do you any good ill have beaten you before his men get this far north i promise you that a bear and a longtooth may quarrel over the carcass of a deer but it doesnt matter to the deer any more because its already dead hilmic barrelstaves scowled at him i knew it was going to be like this you come down here and threaten us by all the gods ive gone out of my way not to threaten you gerin shouted clapping a hand to his forehead when he lost his temper he usually did it for effect now he was perilously close to losing it in truth we could overrun this holding ratkis said as much you know it i know it any halfwitted oneeyed dog sniffing through rubbish down by the shore of the orynian ocean knows it too instead of that i proposed letting biton decide if that didnt satisfy you i proposed a way to solve the difficulty and if you wont heed the god and you wont heed men sirrah you deserve to have your thick head knocked in a silence rather like the one just after the crash of a thunderbolt filled the courtyard to ricolfs castle authari chuckled nervously well if the god is kind hell give us a response that tells us what we want to know then we wont have to worry about any of the rest of this gerin pounced on that so you do agreeall four of you do agreeto let biton speak on this matter one after another ricolfs vassals nodded authari first hilmic last looking as if he hated to be moving his head up and down ratkis bronzecaster said aye we agree well take any oath you set to bind us to it and youll take ours to do the same let it be so gerin said at once of the four of them ratkis impressed him as a man of sense hilmic and wacho spoke before they thought if they thought at all he wasnt sure what to make of authari which probably meant authari would play both ends against the middle if he thought he saw a chance let it be so authari said now and let us sup perhaps this will look better after meat and bread almost anything looks better after meat and bread gerin said agreeably ricolf had always set a good table if not a fancy one and his cooks carried on after his passing along with beef and roast fowl they set out plates of boiled crayfish fried trout and turtles baked in their shells there was plenty of good chewy bread to eat along with the meat and soak up the juices and scallions and cloves of fragrant garlic to spice up the food for the hundredth maybe the thousandth time gerin missed pepper though he could find no complaint with what was set before him his men and those who owed allegiance to ricolfor rather to his chief vassalscrowded the hall they got on well enough even after the servants had refilled their drinking jacks a good many times some of gerins retainers and some of ricolfs had fought side by side in old wars after the werenight and against the monsters and in the fourcornered struggle that had wracked bevons barony for so long if they had to battle one another it would not be with any great enthusiasm that didnt mean they wouldnt battle one another parol chickpea said if the lord prince gives the order well squash you lads underfoot like a nest of cockroaches i wont much care for that but what can you do you can get beaten back to your own land where you belong said the fellow sitting beside him one of ricolfs troopers and one who by his look and bearing a man of sense would not annoy parol was a lot of things but seldom sensible a monster had bitten off a large chunk of one of his buttocks gerin wondered if sitting lopsided for years had unbalanced his brain probably not the fox judged parol hadnt been bright before he developed a list no one in this hall wants to go to war with anyone else here gerin said loudly wishing parol would keep his mouth shut if we wanted to go to war we would have done it already i always reckoned ricolf a friend and his men allies father dyaus grant that my men and those of this holding always stay friends and allies truth there ratkis bronzecaster said and raised his drinking jack in salute gerin was pleased to drink with him a buxom young serving girl did everything she could to attract durens notice but plop herself down in his lap duren did notice her too his eyes stuck to her the way little scraps of cloth would stick to amber after you rubbed it but he did not get up and follow her despite the glances she kept throwing over her shoulder good for you gerin told him if youre going to rule this holding you dont want to get a reputation as a man who thinks with his spear first and his head later youre a likelylooking lad finding willing women shouldnt be any trouble for you but this wenchwho knows what shes after making up so soon to the fellow whos likely to be her overlord thats what i was thinking duren answered what else he was thinking though was also obvious from the way he kept watching the girl wacho fidus son breathed ale fumes into gerins face so you will be going on to ikos eh lord prince a man with a gift for the obvious gerin observed which as hed expected made wacho stare at him in beery incomprehension sighing he went on as a matter of fact what point in going on to ikos if you retainers of ricolfs try to ignore what the god tells you if its not to your liking i dont want to do it mind you but we might as well just fight the war youd have no doubt of what you were supposed to do then anyhow wacho understood that well enough and looked appalled he said no such thing lord prince we were just talking about what to do if the sibyls verse turned out to be obscobhard to make head or tail of thats all if its plain we have no quarrel by everything you and your three comrades have said and done youd do anything to show the sibyls verse was obscure regardless of whether thats really so gerin said i dont know why im wasting my time with you he knew perfectly well why he was wasting his time with them he didnt want to get into a little war down here not when two bigger ones were building in the west and aragis the archer loomed watching and waiting in the south but if he could push ricolfs vassals into forgetting that hed do it without hesitation or compunction still looking horrified wacho went off and collared authari ratkis and hilmic the four of them put their heads together then came back over to the fox see here authari said his voice full of nervous bluster i thought we had a bargain to abide by what the sibyl at ikos said so did i gerin answered but when i got down here what i found you people meaning was that you would interpret bitons words they way they suited you no matter what he said we never said any such thing hilmic barrelstaves said indignantly i didnt say you said it i said you meant it gerin told him what do we do if we dont agree what do we do if we dont agree you might as well have been crickets all chirping the same note he got up as if to stamp out of the great hall as if to stamp out of ricolfs keep altogether in spite of the ghosts that turned the night to terror give us an oath ratkis said give us an oath we can swear and we will swear it authari was talking about that with you i know and i said as much earlier myself we wanti wantfair dealing here him gerin believed he was less sure about the other three but a strong enough oath would attract the notice of even the rather lackadaisical elabonian gods if it was violated all right will you swear by father dyaus and farseeing biton to accept the words of the sibyl on their face if there is any possible way to do so will you also swear that should you violate your oath you pray you will have only sorrow and misfortune in this world and that your soul will not even wander the world by night but will rest forever in the hottest of the five hells ricolfs four vassals looked at each other then went off to put their heads together again when they came back authari brokentooth said thats a strong oath you require of us thats the idea gerin said exhaling through his nose what point to an oath you dont fear breaking will you swear the same oath wacho demanded by his tone he expected the fox to recoil in dismay from the very idea but gerin said of course i will i dont fear what biton says if duren isnt fated to rule this holding the god will make that plain and if he is so fated biton will tell us that too so i will swear that oath ill swear it now this instant join me they went off once more gerin sipped his ale and watched them argue it seemed to be authari and ratkis on one side wacho and hilmic on the other he couldnt hear them but he would have been willing to guess which men were on which side at last rather glumly the barons returned speaking for them authari said very well lord prince we will swear the oath with you if we disagree in spite of it we will settle the disagreements as you proposed in short we agree with all your proposals straight down the line no we dont agree with them hilmic barrelstaves said angrily but well go along with them its either that or fight you and our chances there dont look good to us not even if aragis comes in on our side youre right gerin said your chances wouldnt have been good shall we swear now before our men wacho and hilmic looked as if they would have delayed if they could have found any good reason for doing so but ratkis bronzecaster said it would be best so that way our retainers can have no doubt about what the agreement is exactly my thought gerin said it also makes it harder for you to go about breaking the oath later your own men will call you on it if you do when the two hesitant barons nodded at last duren said i will swear this oath also if this is to be my holding it will be mine so i should speak for myself in matters that touch on it good enough gerin said heartily and ricolfs vassals also made approving noises down deep gerin wondered how good it really was would his son if he became lord here suddenly start ignoring everything he said duren was of about the right age to do something like that and his mother from whom he drew half his blood had always been one to follow her impulses to the hilt whether it was running away with gerin or running away from him a few years later was elises blood showing itself in duren and if it was what could the fox do about it he quickly answered that one nothing forcing the issue by bringing duren here had been his idea now he would have to face the consequences whatever those turned out to be he got to his feet so did duren and so a moment later did ricolfs four leading vassals gerin looked at them hoping one of their numbermaybe authari who liked to hear himself talkwould announce to the expectantly waiting warriors his approval of what they had agreed upon that would make it look as if the oath had been in large measure their idea not his but authari and his comrades stood mute leaving it up to the fox he made the best of it he could we now seal by this oath we are about to swear to abide by the farseeing gods choice as to whether duren should rule this holding the oath setting out what we hope will happen to us in this world and the next if we go against any of its provisions i will say the terms and ricolfs vassals and my son will repeat them after me all of us committing ourselves to this course he waited for any objection from his men or from those who owed allegiance to ricolfs vassals when none came he said i begin he turned to duren and to ricolfs lordlets say each phrase of the oath after me by dyaus allfather and farseeing biton i swear by dyaus allfather and farseeing biton i swear authari and ratkis wacho and hilmic and duren all echoed him he listened carefully to make sure they did if not everyone swore the same oath people would be able to question its validity that was the last thing he wanted he made the oath as comprehensive and strict as he could so much so that wacho and hilmic and even authari looked at him sidelong as provision after stern provision rolled off his tongue duren took the oath without hesitation so did ratkis bronzecaster the fox thought ratkis honest if he wasnt he was so shameless as to be deadly dangerous at last he could think of nothing more to bind ricolfs vassals to their promises so may it be he finished and with evident relief they repeated the words after him so may it be the oath had done what it could do the rest would be up to the men who had followed ricolf so longand to the farseeing god eight chariots rattled down the narrow track through the strange and haunted wood that grew around the little valley housing the hamlet of ikos and bitons shrine nearby gerin duren and van rode in one their retainers filled three more and authari wacho ratkis and hilmic each headed one crew ive never been to see the sibyl not in all my days hilmic barrelstaves said his voice unwontedly quiet as he peered this way and that into the wood did i see a no i couldnt have he shook his head denying the idea whatever it had been even to himself gerin had been through that curious wood a good many times but he was wary there too you were never quite sure what you saw or heardor what saw and heard you sometimes you got the strong feeling you were better off not knowing even van spoke softly as if not wanting to rouse whatever powers rested in uneasy sleep i think well make it to the town before sundown he said hard to be sure when the leaves block the sunlight soand when youre in this place any which way time feelsloosehere so its hard to judge how long youve really been traveling this forest is as old as the world i think gerin answered and now its a little mm disconnected from the rest of the world it puts up with this road through it but only just barely duren drove on in silence the horses were nervous but he controlled them like hilmic he was making his first visit to ikos and he was as busy as ricolfs vassal trying to look in every direction at once and as wideeyed at the things he wasand the things he wasntseeing to gerins relief van proved right they emerged from the wood with some daylight left the idea of having to camp in among those trees chilled the fox who could say what kind of ghosts lived in this place he did not want to find out and was glad he would not have to rein in he told his son and duren obediently brought the chariot to a stop gerin stared down into the valley at the whitemarble splendor of bitons shrine and the almost equally splendid wall of marble blocks surrounding its compound will you look at that he said softly amazing van agreed nodding theyd both seen that shrine and that wall overthrown in the earthquake that had released the monsters from their agelong underground captivity and loosed them on the upper world van went on it looks the same as it always did that it does gerin said it would have been impossible for any men in the northlands to restore that temple built as it was with the full resources of the empire of elabon in its glory days and all the talented artists and artisans the empire provided but biton had rebuilt the shrine and in an instant because of that gerin had wondered if it would be even more magnificent than it had been before but noat least from a distance it merely seemed the same ikosthe town as opposed to the shrinewas different from what it had been biton had not restored the overthrown hostels and eateries as he had his own temple there were fewer of them now than there had been before the quake some then had been just hanging on for traffic to the sibyls underground chamber had shrunk since the empire of elabon cut itself off from the northlands the ones who had been suffering evidently had not rebuilt by the quiet streets that wound between the surviving shelters more would have been superfluous when the innkeepers saw eight cars bearing down on them at once they fell with glad cries on the warriors those cars carried gerin remembered the outrageous prices hed paid to rest his head in the days before the werenight he and his companions got bigger rooms with meals thrown in as part of the bargain for less than half as much any business these days was better than none to the townsfolk how do these people live when the inns are empty the way they look to be most of the time van asked in the taproom later that evening they get rich taking in one anothers laundry gerin answered deadpan van started to nod then stared sharply and let out a snort you want to watch that tongue of yours fox one fine day youll cut yourself with it gerin stuck out the member in question and stared down at it crosseyed van made as if to drench him with a jack of ale but didnt do it that relieved the fox his friend started tavern brawls for the sport of it gerin and duren shared a chamber van took the one next to theirs and didnt want any of the rest of the foxs followers in there with him even with the bargain rates they were getting gerin who made money last till it wore out fretted at the extra expense but it quickly became obvious van did not intend to sleep alone he made advances to both serving girls who were bringing food from the kitchens and soon had one of them sitting on his lap giggling at the way his beard tickled while he nuzzled her neck the fox sighed one way or another word of what van was doing would get back to fand and that would start another of their fights gerin was sick of fights how were you supposed to live your life in the middle of chaos but some people reveled in such disorder van was one of them i know what youre thinking captain he said your face gives you away and do you know what i dont care thats what rihwin said when he danced his wife away gerin answered van wasnt listening to him van wasnt listening to anything save his drinking jack and the stiff lance he had in his breeches duren looked hungrily at the serving girl but then he took a long look around the taproom a couple of other wenches were serving there true but all the men they were serving were both older and far more prominent than he he took a sip from his jack of ale and then said my chances arent good here tonight are they the fox set a hand on his shoulder youre my son sure enough he said therere men twice your agedyaus therere men four times your agewhod never make that calculation and whod sulk or rage for days because they didnt have some doeeyed girl helping em pull their breeches down duren snorted thats foolish aye so it is gerin answered doesnt stop it from happening all the timeand women arent immune to it either not even a little bit people are foolish sonhavent you noticed that yet oh maybe once or twice duren said as dryly as the fox might have gerin stared at him then started to laugh if duren did take over at what had been the holding of ricolf the red wacho hilmic and authari would never know what hit them ratkis bronzecaster might but the fox had the feeling hed be on durens side after a while gerin tipped his drinking jack over on its side and went upstairs carrying a candle duren trailing along behind him van and the serving maid had already gone up there the noises from behind the outlanders door told without any possible doubt what they were doing the amatory racket came through the wall too as gerin used the candle to light a couple of lamps duren said how are we supposed to sleep with that going on i expect well manage gerin said a moment later a moan from the other side of the wall contradicted him he thought about rapping on the timbers but forbore as any man was liable to do van grew testy if interrupted and a testy van was not something to contemplate without trepidation well manage the fox repeated this time as much to convince himself as his son when the shutters were closed they made the bedroom dark and hot and stuffy leaving them open let in fresh air but also bugs and come morning daylight which woke gerin earlier than he would have liked he sat up and rubbed his eyes with something less than enthusiasm he hadnt slept as well as he would have liked and he had had a little more ale than he should havenot enough for a true hangover but plenty to give him the edge of a headache behind his eyes and to make his mouth taste like something scraped off the dung heap to improve his mood yet further a rhythmic pounding started in the chamber next door that was enough to wake duren who stared at the wall i was asleep he said as if not quite believing it he lowered his voice is he at it still father not still the gods be thanked only again gerin raised an eyebrow if hes not down by breakfast well rap on the door of course if hes not down by breakfast the serving girl wont be either so breakfast may be late van did come down for breakfast looking mightily contented with the world after bread and honey and ale he and gerin and duren along with ricolfs four leading vassals walked down to bitons shrine a little south of the hamlet of ikos at close range as from a distance the shrine and its grounds seemed identical to the way they had been before the earthquake tumbled them and loosed the monsters on the northlands there within the marble wall was the statue of the dying trokm there not far away stood the twin goldandivory statues of ros the fierce conqueror of the northlands and oren the builder who had erected the temple to biton in halfsithonian halfelabonian style both ros and oren seemed perfect and complete gerin scratched his head at that after the temblor hed taken away the jewelencrusted golden head of oren when it rolled outside the bounds of bitons sacred precinct within which it was death to steal the precious metal and gems had helped him greatly in the years since and yet here they were restored as they had been the fox shrugged the ways and abilities of gods were beyond those of men yet not even biton it seemed had been able to bring back to life the guardsmen and eunuch priests who had served him all those here now looked young though more and more of the world looked young to gerin these days and no faces were familiar the ritual however remained the same before a suppliant went down below the temple to put a question to the sibyl money changed hands because gerin was prince of the north his offering was larger than any ordinary barons would have been that irked him but he paid you tried to constrain the gods or their priests at your peril when the plump leather sack he handed to a eunuch had been judged and found adequate the priest said enter lord bitons shrine and pray for wisdom and enlightenment remember when you used to have to queue up even to get into the temple van said to gerin not like that any more but perhaps it shall be again one day the eunuch said before gerin could reply the fame of bitons restored temple has spread widely through the northlands but times are so unsettled few make the journey despite its reputation travel is less safe than it might be i know gerin answered ive done everything i could do to make it safer in the lands whose overlord i am but its not all it could be that hurts trade and costs money too he and his companions followed the eunuch into bitons shrine as always on entering there the ancient image of the farseeing god caught and held the foxs eye more than all the architectural splendor oren had lavished on the building surrounding it given a choice oren surely would have discarded the image and replaced it with a modern piece from one of his stable of sculptors that he hadnt discarded it suggested someone whether a priest of biton the sibyl at the time or the god himself had given the elabonian emperor no choice the statue if it could be dignified by that word was a pillar of black basalt almost plain the only marks suggesting it was more than a simple stele were an erect phallus jutting from its midsection and a pair of eyes scratched into the stone a hands breadth or two below the top gerin studied those eyes just for an instant they seemed brown and alive and humanor rather divine he blinked and they were scratches on stone once more along with his son his friend and ricolfs vassals he sat in the front pews of the temple and peering down at the tiny tesserae of the floor mosaic prayed that the farseeing god would give him the guidance he sought when he raised his eyes the eunuch priest said i shall conduct you to the sibyls chamber if you will come with me a black slit in the ground led to the countless caverns below bitons shrine durens eyes were large as side by side with gerin he set foot on the stone steps that eased the suppliants way on the beginning of the journey gerins heart pounded though he had been this way several times before behind him wacho and hilmic muttered nervously he wondered whom bitons priests had found for a sibyl to replace selatre when the farseeing god restored his temple compound hed wanted to restore selatre to her place as well gerin would not haveindeed how could he have hindered that but selatre had begged biton to let her stay in the new life shed found and the god to the foxs relief and joy had done as she asked now biton spoke through someone new the air in the caverns was fresh and cool and moist with a hint of a breeze gerin with his itch to learn wished he knew how it circulated rather than merely that it did the priest carried a torch and others burned at intervals along the rock wall the flickering light did strange sometimes frightening things to the shadows the travelers along that ancient way cast yet it also picked out sparkling bits of rock crystal set into the rough walls of the passage some white some orange some red as blood and now and again the torchlight showed ways branching off from the main track some open some walled up with brick and further warded by potent cantrips gerin pointed to one of those walledoff passages do the monsters still lurk back there behind the spells that hold them at bay we believe so the priest answered his sexless voice quiet and troubled those wards are however as the lord biton made them none of us has been past them to be certainnor i might add have the monsters made any effort to return to the world of light those horrible things ratkis bronzecaster made a hand sign to avert illluck they gave us no end of trouble when they were loose and do i get any credit for tricking the gods into taking them off the surface of the world gerin thought not likely but then ratkis went on with a thought that hadnt occurred to him before i wonder if they have gods of their own down here now gerins fingers twisted in the avertevil sign some of the monstersnot allmight well be smart enough to conceive of gods or to have whatever gods who already dwelt in these caves take notice of them philosophers argued endlessly about how the link between gods and men or even between gods and notquitemen came into being the fox was certain of one thinghe didnt want to meet whatever gods might dwell down here in this endless gloom i wonder what geroge and tharma would think if we ever brought them down here duren said as he walked along the fairly smooth path uncounted generations of feet had worn in the stone thats another good question gerin agreed he started to add that he didnt want to answer it but stopped and held his peace if the monsters at fox keep did prove troublesome as they matured he might have no choices left but to slay them or send them down here with their fellows the passage wound down and down through the living rock most times that was just a semipoetic phrase to the fox down in the midst of it though the rock of the cave walls did seem alive as if it were dimly conscious not only of his presence but also of separating him from the monsters in the deeper walledoff galleries and it would have twitched and writhed like a living thing in the earthquake that had freed the monsters gerin wondered what being underground here when the quake struck would have been like he was glad he hadnt found out he and van had spoken with selatre whose name of course he had not then known less than a day before the temblor shook the whole northlands a pool of brighter light ahead marked the entrance to the sibyls chamber the priest asked would you like me to withdraw so you can put your question to bitons voice on earth in private having him withdraw would have involved paying him more when no one seemed ready to do that he shrugged and led the suppliants into the chamber torchlight shimmered from the sibyls throne which looked as if it was carved from a single impossibly immense black pearl clad in a simple white linen shift the girl on the throne was plainly of the old northlands stock whose blood still ran strong around ikos by her looks she might have been cousin to selatre what would you ask my lord biton she asked her voice a rich contralto made gerin move her age up a few years though maidslim she was probably on his side of twenty not the other one he asked the question in exactly the words upon which he and ricolfs vassals had agreed should my son duren succeed his grandfather ricolf the red as baron of the holding over which ricolf held suzerainty till he died the sibyl listened intentlyas well she might for she was listening for her divine master as well as herself the mantic fit hit her hard as it had the predecessors of hers whom gerin had seen on that blackpearl throne selatre and before her an ancient crone who had been bitons voice on earth for three generations of suppliants eyes rolled back in her head to show only white the sibyl writhed and twitched her arms jerked and flailed seemingly at random then she stiffened her lips parted she spoke not with her own voice but with the firm confident baritone biton always used the young man shall hold all the castles and all within shall be his vassals but peril lurks like dark in caves and missteps here fill many graves aye danger lurks in many shapes oershadowing you like bunchd grapes v ricolfs vassals were being difficult gerin had been sure they would be difficult from the instant the eunuch priest led him his son van and them out of the sibyls chamber now back at the hostel in the village of ikos they or at least three of them openly bickered with the fox didnt mean a thing wacho fidus son declared thumping his balled fist down onto the table not one single solitary thing the young man shall hold all the castles and all within shall be his vassals gerin quoted that means nothing to you are you deaf and blind as well as he broke off hed been about to say stupid we asked about ricolfs holdings and the god said hed rule all the castles what more do you want a good dose of brains wouldnt hurt you could take them by enema so theyd be close to what you use for thinking now the god said all the castles authari brokentooth declared the god said nothing about ricolfs castles duren here is your heir too when you die he stands to inherit your lands and the keeps on them gerin exhaled through his nose thats clever i must admit he said tightly are you sure you didnt study sithonian hairsplittingexcuse me philosophysouth of the high kirs the only problem is the question wasnt about the keeps i control it asked specifically about the holding of ricolf the red when you take the question and the answer together theres only one conclusion you can reach we seem to have found another one hilmic barrelstaves said tipping back his drinking jack and pouring the last swallows worth of ale down his throat he waved the jack around to show he wanted a refill aye youve found another one gerin answered is it one that will let you keep the oath you swore to dyaus and biton and baivers he pointed to hilmics drinking jack and all the other gods wacho hilmic and authari appeared to take no notice of that but ratkis bronzecaster whod said little looked even more thoughtful than he already had oathbreaker wasnt a name anyone wanted to get for himself it hurt you in this world and was liable to hurt you worse in the next duren said from all ive heard and read of bitons prophetic verse the god never names names straight out what do you know lad wacho said with a sneer i know insolence when i hear it duren snapped physically he was not a match for the bigger older man but his voice made wacho sit up and take notice duren went on i know my letters too so i can learn things i dont see with my own eyes and hear with my own ears can you say the same before wacho answered gerin put in ive been to the sibyl several times now over the years and the next name i hear in one of those verses will be the first van nodded agreement ratkis broke his silence that is so or it has been for me at any rate it gives me one thing more to think about youre not going to turn against us are you hilmic barrelstaves demanded youd be sorry for thatthree against one would it wouldnt be three against one for long gerin broke in hilmic glared at him he glared back partly from anger partly for effect then musingly he went on if your neighbors outside ricolfs barony hear how youd seek to go back on your sworn word they might hit you from behind while you were fighting ratkis too for fear youd treat them the same way after youd beaten him and that doesnt begin to take into account what id do he carefully avoided saying exactly what he would do absent other troubles he would have descended on ricolfs holding with everything he had to make sure it would be in durens hands before aragis the archer could so much as think of responding absent other troubles he laughed bitterly other troubles were anything but absent then ratkis said i expect i can hold my own if the trokm tide didnt swamp me i dont suppose my neighbors will he looked from hilmic to wacho to authari brokentooth they know i dont go out looking for mischief aye they know that so they do and they know that if mischief comes looking for me i mostly give it a set of lumps and send it on its way by the sour expressions on the faces of his fellow vassal barons they did know that authari said do you want to see us dragged into doing whatever gerin the fox here orders us to do not so youd notice ratkis answered but i cant say im dead keen on going against what a god says either and looks to me as if thats what the three of you have in mind wacho fidus son and hilmic shook their heads with vehemence that struck gerin as overwrought smoothly authari said not a bit of it ratkisnothing of the sort but we do have to be certain what the lord biton means dont we i think were all of us clear enough on that van rumbled and then drained his drinking jack if we werent some people wouldnt be trying so hard to get around the plain words i resent that authari said his versatile voice now hot with anger van got to his feet and stared down at authari you do eh he set a hand on the hilt of his sword how much dyou resent it care to step onto the street and show me how much you resent it what dyou supposell happen after that dyou suppose your successor whoever he is will resent it too the taproom got very quiet the warriors whod accompanied ricolfs vassals eyed those whod come to ikos with gerin and were eyed in return and everyone waited to hear and see what authari brokentooth would do gerin did not think authari a coward hed never heard nor seen anything to give him that idea but he did not blame authari for licking his lips and keeping silent while he thought van was two hands breadth taller and likely weighed half again as much as he did well the outlander demanded are you coming out i findi findi am not so angry as i was a moment before authari said sometimes a mans temper can make him say things he wishes he had kept to himself to gerins relief van accepted that and sat back down at once well youre right there and no mistake he said even the fox has done it and hes more careful with his tongue than any man ive ever known much of what van called being careful was simply knowing when to keep his mouth shut but gerin knew not to say that too what he did say was since youre not out of temper now authari can you take a calmer look at the verses the god spoke through the sibyl and admit the lines that talk about my son can have only one meaning authari looked resentful again but carefully did not claim he was gerins intellectual challenge was as hard for him to withstand as vans physical challenge had been at last very much against his will ricolfs vassal admitted there may be some truth in what you say that made hilmic and wacho let out indignant bleats youve sold us you traitor wacho shouted quickly red in the face with fury i ought to cut your heart out for this or worse if i could think of it id face you any day authari retorted id face the fox too i dont fear him in the field not when he has so many concerns besides me but biton who can fight against a god and hope to win since the farseeing one knows my heart he knows i thought to oppose his will but thought is not deed you speak truth there gerin agreed now though you will recognize duren as your rightful overlord so i will authari said sourly when he is permanently installed in ricolfs keep and not a day sooner that is fair gerin said this was all your idea and now youre running away from it wacho bellowed hilmic barrelstaves set a hand on his arm and whispered in his ear wacho calmed down or seemed to all the same gerin wouldnt have cared to be authari right then by himself authari was more powerful than either wacho or hilmic was he more powerful than both of them put together ratkis had said he could hold out against all three of ricolfs other leading vassals so presumably authari could hold out against two of them but that didnt mean hed enjoy doing it and then duren said quietly but firmly when i succeed my grandfather my vassals will not fight private wars against one another anyone who starts that kind of war will face me along with his foe gerin had imposed that rule on his own vassals for that matter ricolf had enforced it while he lived a strong overlord could all of ricolfs leading vassals had assumed duren at least apart from gerin would not be a strong overlord but duren hadnt said anything about asking help from his father nor had he sounded as if he thought hed need it by the looks on their faces authari hilmic and wacho were all having second thoughts so was gerin hed done his best to train duren up to be a leader one day he hadnt realized hed succeeded so well or so fast a boy turned into a man when he could fill a mans sandals by that reckoninghis games among the serving women at fox keep to one sideduren was a man now scratching his head gerin wondered exactly when that had happened and why he hadnt noticed ratkis bronzecaster noticed speaking to duren rather than gerin he asked when do you expect to take up the lordship of the holding that had been your grandfathers not this season duren answered at once after my father has beaten adiatunnus and the gradi and no longer needs me by his side your father is lucky to have you for a son ratkis observed with no irony gerin could hear duren shrugged what i am he made me in some ways that was true in those ways it might have been more true of duren than of a good many youths for with his mother gone gerin had had more of his raising than he would have otherwise but in other ways as the fox had just realized duren had outstripped his hopes and so he said a father can only shape whats already in a son ratkis nodded at that youre not wrong lord prince if a lad is a donkey you cant make him into a horse youd want pulling your chariot but if hes already a horse you can show him how to run he turned to duren when that time comes youll have no trouble from me not unless you show you deserve it which i dont think you will and i say that to you for your sake not on account of who your father is i will try to be a lord who deserves good vassalage duren answered ratkis nodded again saying i think you may well do that after a moment authari brokentooth nodded too hilmic and wacho sat silent and unhappy theyd been as difficult and obstructive as they could and by all the signs had nothing to show for it if only all my foes were so easy to handle the fox thought the drive back from the sibyls shrine to the elabon way showed the damage the monsters had done in their brief time above ground the peasant villages that lay beyond the old halfhaunted wood west of ikos were shadows of what they had been in a way that made the journey back to the main highway easier for the peasants who were their own masters owing no overlord allegiance had been apt to demonstrate their freedom by preying on passing travelers serves em right van said as they rode past another village where most of the huts were falling to ruin and a handful of frightened folk stared at the chariots with wide hungry eyes theyd have knocked us over the head for our weapons and armor so many goodbyes to em land needs to be farmed gerin said upset at the sight of saplings springing up in what had been wheatfields it shouldnt rest idle the state of the land was not the only worry on his mind for he very much hoped he would find that his warriors had rested idle while he was consulting the sibyl ricolfs vassals had men enough to crush his small force if they set their minds to it and to seize or kill him as he returned to their holding too he vowed to take wacho and hilmicand authari for luckdown to the underworld with him if their followers turned traitor but when he came upon those of his troopers hed left behind they and the men who had served ricolf were getting on well when they recognized him and his companions they hurried toward them loudly calling for news we dont know what were going to do wacho said still unready to resign himself to recognizing duren as his suzerain no that isnt so ratkis bronzecaster said before gerinor durencould scream at wacho sounds like the god thinks the lad should come after his grandfather but he wont take over ricolfs keep quite yet why arent we fighting the fox then one of the soldiers demanded his kin have no call taking over our holding biton thinks otherwise ratkis said having made up his mind he followed his decision to the hilt with a nod to one of his comrades he added isnt that right authari authari brokentooth looked as if he hated the other baron for putting him on the spot aye he answered more slowly than he should have he could hardly have been less enthusiastic had he been discussing his own imminent funeral obsequies but that aye however reluctant produced both acclamations for duren and loud arguments gerin glanced toward hilmic barrelstaves and wacho fidus son hilmic sensibly was keeping quiet wacho looked as if he had no intention of doing anything of the sort gerin caught his eye wacho glared truculent defiance at him hed seen it done better he shook his head a single tightly controlled movement wacho glared even more fiercely the fox didnt glare back instead he looked away a gesture of cool contempt that said wacho wasnt worth noticing and had better not make himself worth noticing had wacho shouted gerins men might have found themselves in a bloody broil with the troopers who followed ricolfs vassals but wacho didnt shout he was big and full of bluster but the fox had managed to get across a warning he could not mistake gerin said hear the words of farseeing biton as spoken through his sibyl at ikos he repeated the prophetic verse just as the sibyl had given it to him then went on can any of you doubt that in this verse the god shows duren to be the rightful successor to ricolf the red his own men clapped and cheered they were ready to believe his interpretation three out of four of ricolfs leading vassals though had disputed it what would the common soldiers from ricolfs holding do they owed gerin no allegiance but they did not stand to lose so much as authari and his colleagues either who the overlord of the holding was mattered less to men who had to take orders regardless of that overlords name and by ones and twos they began to nod accepting that the verse meant what he said it did they showed no great enthusiasm but they had no reason to show great enthusiasm duren was an untried youth but they seemed willing to give him his chance ricolfs vassal barons saw that too ratkis took it in stride whatever authari thought he kept to himself wacho and hilmic tried with indifferent success to hide dismay i thank you duren said to the soldiers doing his best to pitch his voice mandeep may we be at peace whenever we can and may we win whenever we must go to war van stuck an elbow in gerins ribs have to be careful with that one he said under his breath pointing to the foxs son whatever he wants hes liable to go out and grab it aye gerin said also looking at duren with some bemusement his own nature was to wait and look around before acting then strike hard duren was moving faster and by the way things seemed able to be gentler because of that for ricolfs troopers were nodding at his words accepting them more readily than they had gerins interpretation of the oracular response before the fox could say anything duren went on i will not take up this holding from my grandfather now for my father still has need of me but when that need has passed i will return here and accept the homage of my vassals gerin wondered how the troopers would take that it reminded them of durens link to him by their anxious expressions hilmic and wacho were wondering the same thing and hoping the reminder would turn the warriors against duren it didnt if anything it made them think better of him one comment rising above the general murmur of approval was if he looks out for his kinsfolk hell look out for us too the fox didnt know whod said that altogether without being asked he would gladly have paid good gold to get one of ricolfs men to come out with such a sentiment getting it for free and sincerely was all the better ratkis looked satisfied authari brokentooths expression could have meant anything though if it betokened delight gerin would have been very much surprised what hilmics and wachos faces showed was at best dyspepsia at worst stark dismay the fox knew theyand probably authari toowould be haranguing their retainers every day till gerin got back to ricolfs holding how much good that haranguing would do them remained to be seen then ratkis got down from his chariot and went to one knee on the stone slabs of the road close by the car duren was driving looking up at duren he said lord in token of your return i will gladly give you homage and fealty now he pressed the palms of his hands together and held them out before him at last after seeing so much maturity from his son gerin found duren at a loss he tapped the youth on the shoulder and hissed accept quick that got duren moving hed seen gerin accept new vassals often enough to know the ritual scrambling down from the chariot he hurried over to stand in front of ratkis bronzecaster and set his hands on those of the older man ratkis said i own myself to be your vassal duren son of gerin the fox grandson of ricolf the red and give you the whole of my faith against all men who might live or die i duren son of gerin the fox grandson of ricolf the red accept your homage ratkis bronzecaster duren replied solemnly and pledge in my turn always to use you justly in token of which i raise you up now he helped ratkis to his feet and kissed him on the cheek by dyaus the father of all and biton the farseeing one i swear my fealty to you lord duren ratkis said his voice loud and proud by dyaus and biton duren said i accept your oath and swear in turn to reward your loyalty with my own he looked to ricolfs other leading vassals who else will give me this sign of good faith now authari brokentooth went to one knee more smoothly than ratkis had he too gave duren homage and then fealty so far as gerin could see the ceremony was flawless in every regard with no error of form to let authari claim it was invalid he was glad authari had subordinated himself but trusted the vassal baron no more on account of that everyone looked at hilmic and wacho wachos fair face turned red im not pledging anything to a lord who isnt here to give back what he pledges to me he said loudly turning to gerin he went on i dont reject him out of hand lord prince dont take me wrong but i wont give homage and swear fealty till he comes back here to stay if i do it then ill have to see what he looks like when hes here for good hilmic barrelstaves perhaps encouraged that wacho had spoken nodded emphatic agreement again duren handled matters before gerin could speak that is your right but when i do return ill bear in mind everything youve done since the day my grandfather died neither hilmic nor wacho answered that several of ricolfs men spoke up in approval though and even wachos driver looked back over his shoulder to say something quiet to him whatever it was it made the vassal baron go redder yet and growl something pungent by way of reply gerin caught durens eye and nodded for him to get back into the chariot he didnt want to give his son orders now not when the boyno the young manhad so impressed ricolfs followers with his independence duren had impressed the fox too a great deal you never really knew whether someone could swim till he found himself in water over his head duren jumped up into the car and took the reins from van whod been holding them saying when my duties farther north are done ill come back here the gods willing well have many years together he flicked the reins the horses trotted forward the rest of gerins little army followed the fox looked back over his shoulder there in the roadway stood authari brokentooth ratkis bronzecaster wacho fidus son and hilmic barrelstaves they were arguing furiously their men crowding around them to support one or the other gerin liked that fine half a day south of fox keep gerin spied a chariot heading his way at first he thought it belonged to a messenger heading down toward ricolfs holding with news so urgent it couldnt wait for his return the only sort of news that urgent was bad news then the driver of the car held up a shield painted in white and green stripes a shield of truce those are trokmoi the fox exclaimed a few years earlier he wouldnt have been able to recognize them as such at so long a distance but his sight was lengthening as he got older that made reading hard he wondered if there was a magic to counter the flaw he had little time for such idle thoughts a moment later he recognized one of the trokmoi in the car so did van who named the fellow first thats diviciacus adiatunnus right hand his right hand aye and maybe the thumb of the left gerin agreed somethings gone wrong for him or hed not have sent diviciacus out to try to make it betterand probably to diddle me in the process if he sees a chance the trokmoi made out who gerin was at about the same time as he recognized diviciacus they waved and approached duren stopped the team the rest of gerins men halted their chariots behind him what can we be doing for you now gerin called in the trokm tongue will you just hear the sweet way hes after using our speech diviciacus said also in his language he quickly switched to elabonian though id best be using yours for the business ahead to be sure theres not misunderstandings the which wouldnt be good at all at all even in elabonian he kept a woodsrunners lilt in his voice the years havent treated you too badly gerin remarked as diviciacus got out of his chariot the trokm was thicker through the middle than he had been when he was younger and white frosted his mustache and the red hair at his temples he still looked like a dangerous man in a brawl thoughand in a duel of words ill say the same to your own self he answered and then astonished gerin by dropping to one knee in the roadway as ratkis bronzecaster had done for duren as the trokm clasped his hands together in front of him he said adiatunnus is fain to be after renewing vassalage to your honor lord prince that he is by the gods gerin muttered he stared at diviciacus it took the gods to get me his allegiance the last time he gave it i always thoughti always saidid need them again to get him to renew it before i accept it i want to know what im getting and why still on that one knee diviciacus replied himself said youd say that sure and he did his shoulders moved back and then forward as he sighed hed not do it i tell you true did he not find worse in these lands south o the niffet than youd be giving him ah the gradi gerin said a light begins to dawn he wants my help against them and reckons the only way hell get it is to pretend to be a good little boy for as long as he needs to and then to go back to his old ways diviciacus assumed a hurt expression he did it very wellbut then hed had practice thats not a kind thing to be saying not even a bit of it too bloody bad gerin told him the only debt i owe your chief is that i had my retainers gathered against him at fox keep when the gradi raided us and so i was able to throw them back without too much trouble would that we could say the same diviciacus answered gloomily they lit into us that they did i gather youre after hearing about their raid on us by boat and that they did it in the aftermath of striking you yes i heard of that gerin answered if they hadnt hit us and you adiatunnus and i would be at war now i suppose and you wouldnt have to come to me and swallow his pride for him diviciacus winced sure and youve an evil tongue in the head o you fox they say that in the olden times a bard could kill a man by no more than singing rude songs about him i never would have believed it at all till i met you he held up a hand a gold bracelet glittered on his wrist dont thank me now youve not yet heard what im about to tell you go on gerin said concealing his amusement he had been about to thank the trokm for noting the bite of his sarcasm what havent i heard that youre about to tell me that the blackhearted omadhauns struck us again ten days ago this time coming by land and that they beat us again too diviciacus bared his teeth in an agony of frustration and so for fear of worse from them adiatunnus will fight alongside you will fight under you will fight however you choose for the sake of having your men and your cars in the line with us whatever should befall after that even if its you turning into our master its bound to be better nor the gradi ruling over us he shivered in almost superstitious dread the trokmoi whod come in the chariot with him gestured to avert evil the gradi whom gerin had captured took beating the woodsrunners for granted evidently the trokmoi felt the same way about it that worried gerin what sort of allies would the trokmoi make if they broke and fled at the mere sight of their foes he asked diviciacus that very question we fight bravely enough the trokm insisted its just thatsummat always goes wrong and curse me if i know why must not be so with you southrons not if you beat the gradi the once with you along well do better tooi hope so do i gerin told him he mulled things over for a bit then went on come back to fox keep with me this is too important to decide on the spur of the moment however you like it lord prince diviciacus answered only the gods grant you dont take too long deciding else itll be too late for having the mind of you made up to matter when they started north up the elabon way toward fox keep gerin told duren to steer his chariot up alongside the one in which diviciacus rode over squeals and rattles the fox asked what will adiatunnus say if my whole army comes into the land he holds as his own belike hell say och the gods be praised them of elabonians and trokmoi both diviciacus answered more than half measures we need for true and what will he sayand what will your warriors saywhen i tell them to fight alongside my men and take orders from my barons the fox pressed order em about just as you wish diviciacus said if theres even a one of em as says aught else but aye lord gerin take the head of the stupid spalpeen and be after hanging it over your gate we dont do that gerin said absently but that wasnt the point diviciacus knew perfectly well that elabonians werent in the habit of taking heads for trophies what he meant was that adiatunnus and his men were desperate enough to obey the fox no matter what he said given adiatunnus pride in the strength hed had till the gradi struck him that was desperate indeed unless what oath will you give that this isnt a trap to lead me to a place where adiatunnus can try to take me unawares the same frickful aith i gave your lady wife when she put me the same question diviciacus said by taranis teutates and esus i swear lord gerin lord prince ive told you nobbut the truth if swearing by his three chief gods would not bind a trokm to the truth nothing would gerin smiled a little when he heard selatre had asked the same guarantee of diviciacus biton didnt speak through her these days but she saw plenty clear on her own good enough the fox said i pray it is i pray youre right diviciacus told him the priests theyve been edgy of late indeed and they have its as if with the gods o the gradi so near em and all our own gods have taken fear if you know what im saying i think perhaps i do gerin said after a moments pause the gradi prisoners had also boasted of how much stronger their gods were than those of the woodsrunners and again seemed to know whereof they spoke diviciacus sent gerin a keen look you know more of this whole business than you let on im thinking when gerin didnt answer the trokm went on well that was ever the way of you adiatunnus he swears you stand behind him and listen when hes haranguing his men with the way adiatunnus bellows i wouldnt need to be that close to overhear him gerin said diviciacus chuckled and nodded acknowledging the hit gerin was careful not to deny possible occult means of knowledge the more people thought he knew the more cautious theyd be around him the one thing he wished as the chariot clattered northward was that he really knew half as much as friends and foes credited him with knowing are we ready gerin looked back at the throng of chariots drawn up behind him on the meadow by fox keep the question was purely rhetorical they were as ready as theyd ever be he waved his arm forward tapping duren on the shoulder as he did so lets go they hadnt gone far before diviciacus chariot came up beside gerins its a fine thing you do here fox indeed and it is the trokm said then his face clouded still and all id be happier that i would were you bringing the whole of your host with you and not leaving a part of em behind at castle fox im not doing this to make you happy gerin answered im not doing it to make adiatunnus happier either im doing it to protect myself if i leave fox keep bare and the gradi come up the niffet again he waved back toward the river the keep falls i dont really want that to happen and if your men and adiatunnus together arent enough to be beating the gradi wont you feel the fool now diviciacus retorted those are the risks i weigh and thats the chance i take gerin said if i could bring my whole army and adiatunnus too down the niffet against the gradi id do that i cant though the gradi control the river because they have boats beside which ours might as well be toys and as long as thats true i have to guard against their taking advantage of what they have if you dont care for that too bad och id not like to live inside your head indeed and i wouldnt diviciacus said youre after having eyes like a crayfishon the end of stalks peering every which way at onceand a mind like a balance scale weighing this against that and that against this till youre after knowing everything or ever it has the chance to happen gerin shook his head only farseeing biton has that kind of power i wish i did but i know i dont seeing aheads not easy even for a god and how would you know that diviciacus said because i watched biton trying to pick out the thread of the future from among a host of mightbes gerin answered which made the trokm shut up with a snap diviciacus knew that gerin had made the monsters vanish from the face of the earth but not how hed done it or what had happened in the aftermath of the miracle they soon left the elabon way and rolled southwest down lesser roads serfs in the fields alongside the dirt tracks stood up from their endless labor to watch the army pass one or two of them every now and then would wave whenever that happened gerin waved back diviciacus stared at the serfs are they daft he burst out after a while are they stupid why arent they running for the woods aye and taking the livestock with em too because they know my men wont plunder them the fox answered they know they can rely on that daft diviciacus repeated ill not tell adiatunnus for himself wouldna credit it hed call me drunk or ensorceled so he would i had trouble making sense of it when i first came here too van said sympathetically it still strikes me strange but after a while you get used to it for which ringing endorsement of my ideas i thank you very much gerin said his voice dry as the dust the horses hooves and chariot wheels raised from the road think nothing of it van said dipping his head just what i do think of it and not a bit more gerin said both old friends laughed diviciacus listened and watched as if he couldnt believe what he was hearing and seeing if any of our trokmoi now bespoke adiatunnus so he said the foold be eating from a new mouth slit in his throat certain sure he would soon as the words were out of his old one killing people who tell you youre a fool isnt always the best idea in the world gerin observed every so often they turn out to be right diviciacus rolled his eyes that wasnt the way his chieftain handled matters so as far as he was concerned it had to be wrong they came to the keep of widin simrins son late the next day widin and diviciacus greeted each other like old neighbors which they were and old friends which they werent better you southrons for friends nor the gradi diviciacus told him and that seemed to suffice widin had a goodsized garrison quartered at his keep had adiatunnus begun the war against gerin rather than the other way round those troopers would have done their best to slow the trokm advance and buy the fox time to move down and deal with the woodsrunners so well really be on the same side as the trokmoi widin said to gerin who would have believed that at the start of the year not i i tell you for a fact but yes we will gerin replied the trokmoi would rather work with us than with the gradi and from what ive seen of the gradi id rather work with the trokmoi than with them too i havent seen anything of them lord prince widin said but if theyre rugged enough to make the trokmoi cozy up to us like this they must be pretty nasty customers he grinned wryly i wont be sorry to move out against the gradi myself i tell you that much you go feeding a goodsized crew of warriors for a while and you start wondering whether anythingll be left for you to eat come winter you dont sing me that song widin gerin told him i sing it to you his vassal baron grinned and nodded yielding the point the fox had been feeding a lot more warriors for a lot longer than widin the fox had also made the most thoroughgoing preparations for feeding and housing a lot of warriors of any man in the northlands save perhaps aragis the archerand he would have bet against aragis too ruefully widin said and now of course the whole army guests off me even if it is for only the one night i dont see you starving gerin observed his voice mild oh not now widin answered the apples are harvested and the pears and the plums the animals are getting fat on the good grass but come the later part of next winter well wish we had what your gluttons will gobble up tonight well i understand that gerin said the end of winter is a hard time of year for everyone and father dyaus knows im happy to see you thinking ahead instead of just living in the now the way so many do but if we dont beat the gradi how much you have in your storerooms wont matter to anyone but them oh i understand all that lord prince widin assured him but since you take so much enjoyment complaining about every little thing i wouldnt think youd begrudge me the chance to do the same since i what the fox glowered at his vassal much as if he were serious i expect to hear that from van or rihwin not from you cant trust anyone these days can you widin said now doing a wicked impression of gerin himself the fox threw his hands in the air and stalked off conceding defeat by the extravagant way widin fed the army that had descended on his castle his plea of hunger to come had been a case of averting an evil omen nothing more as if to extract some sort of revenge on the lesser baron gerin ate until he could hardly waddle off to his blanket he committed gluttony again the next morning this time because he knew what sort of country lay ahead the land between widins holding and adiatunnus territory belonged to no one even if it was formally under gerins suzerainty the fox and the trokm chieftain had been probing for advantage down there for years even after giving gerin homage and swearing fealty adiatunnus conducted himself like an independent lord caught between two strong rivals most of the peasants who had farmed that land in the days before the werenight were dead or fled now fields were going back to meadows meadows to brush and brush to saplings looking at some pines as tall as he was gerin thought this is how civilization dies when his armyor adiatunnuswasnt crossing this country on dirt roads also vanishing from disuse it belonged more to wild beasts than to men and it bordered his own holding that was a profoundly depressing thought adiatunnus had pushed his border station north and east toward the edges of gerins land more than once gerin had moved against the trokmoi with an army routing his enemys guards and overturning the prevaricating boundary stones they would set up to support their claims when he and his army came upon the trokm guards now the redmustachioed barbarians cheered and waved their long bronze swords in the air laughter rumbled from van turning to gerin he said theres something youve never seen before ill wager woodsrunners cheering me the fox shook his head the only time i ever thought the trokmoi would cheer me was after i died diviciacus rode near enough to hear that we tried to arrange it fox dear time and again we did he said and wed have cheered like madmen if wed done it but things being as they are yes things being as they are gerin agreed without the trokmoi he wouldnt have become baron of fox keep wouldnt have set forth on the path that had made him prince of the north the woodsrunners had ambushed his father and older brother putting an end to his hopes of passing his days as student and scholar and on returning from the city of elabon to take up the barony hed sworn never to stop taking revenge on the barbarians for what theyd done to him and his over the years hed taken that revenge many times and in many ways and now he found himself allied to the trokmoi against a danger he and they both recognized as worse than either was to the other did that leave him forsworn he didnt think so he hoped not he hoped the spirits of his father and brother understood why he was doing what he was doing he thought his brother would of his father he was less certain the dagref after whom hed named his first son by selatre had not been the most flexible of men the fox shrugged regardless of what his father would have thought hed chosen this course and would have to see it through what came afterwards hed sort out afterwards he knew the way to the keep adiatunnus had held as his own since the trokm invasion after the werenight hed been that way before with soldiers at his back every time hed had to fight his way through adiatunnus holding then the trokmoi welcomed him and his men now trokmoi were not the only folk still living on the land of course a good many elabonian peasants remained serfs toiling for tall fair overlords now not for barons of their own race whenever he rode past one of their villages gerin wondered how much that bothered them he suspected they cared only how much of their crops their overlords whoever those overlords were exacted from them and how much those overlords interfered in the daytoday routine of their lives he passed a couple of strongpoints hed burned out in his last serious campaign against adiatunnus more than a decade before one had been rebuilt the other was still in ruins here and there in his holding ruins remained from the werenight well before that the trokmoi were moving at a pace not too far from his own when night fell the elabonians stopped at a village dominated by a stockaded building too large and strong to be a house too small to be a castle several trokm warriors dwelt there with their wives and children plainly to lord it over the elabonian serfs who lived in the usual huts of wattle and daub had gerin extended his dominions to the forests of the trokmoi north of the river niffet he might have used a similar system save with elabonians controlling woodsrunners golden math just past first quarter floated high in the south when the sun set pale slowmoving nothos full or a day past rose in the east during evening twilight elleb approaching third quarter would not come up till nearly midnight while tiwaz was too close to the sun to be seen i wonder what the gradi call the moons gerin said staring up at math from his seat close to a fire outside the village that i cant tell you captain van answered he paused to use a thumbnail to pry at a piece of mutton stuck between two back teeth then resumed im amazed at how much of their speech has come back to me now that ive had to try using it again but i never was much interested in finding out about the moons maybe if some gradi lass had looked up at em while i was on top of herbut shed have been thinking about other things or i hope she would you are impossible gerin said or at least bloody improbable thank you fox his friend answered gerin gave up and wrapped himself in his blanket he had plenty of sentries out even in the worst of times the trokmoi werent likely to brave the ghosts for a night attack and his men and theirs were supposed to be allies nevertheless he hadnt got as old as he had by taking needless chances knowing hed taken none here he slept sound warriors gerin led hadoncereached the village around the keep adiatunnus had taken for his own theyd fought their way in among the houses there but never had managed to force their way into the keep with both trokmoimen and womenand monsters opposing them theyd lost men too fast to make the assault worthwhile even if it did succeed and now here they were more than ten years later coming up to adiatunnus fastness once more this time no monsters fought them the monsters all save geroge and tharma were back in the trackless caverns under bitons temple at ikos the trokmoimen and womenstood in the narrow rutted streets of the village shouting for the elabonians till their voices grew raw and hoarse the drawbridge to the keep was down and adiatunnus rode out from it to greet the fox the last time gerin had come this far the two of them had done their best to kill each other and theyd both nearly succeeded rein in gerin told duren the fox also held up a hand to halt the rest of his chariots his son pulled back on the reins the horses obediently came to a stop adiatunnus halted his own car perhaps twenty feet from gerins he got out of it and walked half the distance before going down on one knee in the roadway the watching trokmoi sighed gerin jumped down from his chariot and hurried over to adiatunnus the trokm chieftain clasped his hands together gerin covered them with his own and they went through the same rituals of homage and fealty in person as they had by proxy through diviciacus speaking the trokm tongue so his folk could follow adiatunnus said i want no misunderstanding now you are my lord and i own its so what youre after ordering me and mine to do against the gradi that well do and promptly too youll find us no more trouble than any of your other vassals the fox noted adiatunnus reservationhe would take orders against the gradi but hadnt said anything about other orders gerin decided not to make an issue of it maybe the alliance against the new invaders would lead to better things later maybe it wouldnt for now he wouldnt argue that it was necessary also speaking the woodsrunners language he said glad we are to have your valiant warriors with us in the fight well teach the gradi they chose the wrong foes when they decided to trifle with us the trokmoi yelled and cheered gerin doubted theyd ever given any elabonian a greeting like the one he was getting most of his own men understood the trokm speech well enough to have followed what he was saying they cheered too some of them he saw had their eyes on trokm women many of whom were strikingly pretty and who had a reputation among the elabonians for easiness gerin knew that reputation was not altogether deserved it was just that trokm women like their menfolk said and acted on what they thought more readily than most elabonians but as fand had taught him you tried going too far with them at your peril he hoped no trouble would spring from that adiatunnus waved back toward his keep whose drawbridge remained down come in fox come in and the men of you too ill feast the lot of you till youre too full to futter that i will maybe hed been watching gerins troopers eyeing the trokm women too for my men i thank you gerin said save for insults on the battlefield this was the first time hed exchanged words with adiatunnus the trokm chief was close to his own age a couple of digits taller and a good deal thicker through the shoulders and through the belly with a balding crown and long drooping fair mustaches now going gray he wore a linen tunic and baggy woolen trousers both dyed in checks of bright and to gerins eye clashing colors he was studying the fox with the same wary care gerin gave him seeing gerins eye on him he chuckled selfconsciously and said ive always been after thinking youre so high he reached up as far as he could with fangs in your mouth and covered all over with fur or a vipers scales i never could decide which and here to look at you youre nobbut a man and you likewise gerin answered youve given me enough trouble for any other ten i could name though i tell you that for which i thank you adiatunnus said preening a little his eyes were an odd shade halfway between gray and green and quite sharp looking intently at gerin he went on ah but if one o them ten you could name was aragis the archer now would you still be telling me the truth not altogether the fox admitted and adiatunnus preened again this time admiring his own cleverness gerin said if you wont let me flatter you now how am i supposed to fool you later adiatunnus stared at him then started to laugh och what a wonder yare fox ive been glad to have you for a neighbor betimes that i have for youve taught me more than a dozen duller men could have done for which i suppose i thank you gerin said at which adiatunnus laughed again the trokm was telling the truth there over the years gerin had noted adiatunnus more than any other trokm chieftain had learned from the elabonians among whom hed settled he played far more sophisticatedand far more dangerouspolitical games than his fellow woodsrunners most of whom still seemed hardly better than bandits after all these years the game he was playing now was designed to make him seem a good fellow to the fox and his warriors and to make them forget they were more likely to be his foes than his friends when he wanted to use it he had a huge voice he used it now bellowing in elabonian into the keep the lot of you the meat and bread want eating the beer wants drinking aye and maybe the lasses want pinching though youll have to find that out your own selves gerin tried to shout just as loudly any man of mine who drinks so much today that hes not fit to travel tomorrow will answer to me and ill make him sorrier than his hangover ever did that might also keep his men from getting so drunk they started fights and from being too drunk to defend themselves if the trokmoi did the same goes for my warriors adiatunnus said in his speech and in elabonian save only that they answer to me first and then the fox and theyll care for neither indeed and they wont roast meat was roast meat though the trokmoi cooked mutton with mint not garlic some of the bread the serving women set before the warriors struck gerin as odd thick and chewy and studded with berries it wasnt what he ate at home but it was good he wasnt so sure about the beer it wasnt ale nor anything like what he and other elabonians brewed coming almost black from the dipper and tasting thick and smoky in his mouth adiatunnus drank it with every sign of enjoyment so it evidently was as it was supposed to be aye we make the pale brew too the trokm chieftain said when gerin asked him about it but i thought you might be interested in summat new you having the name for that and all you roast the malted barley a good deal longer here you see so its nearly burnt before you make it into the mash ill bet the first fellow who brewed this did it by accident or because he was careless with his roasting gerin said he took another pull and smacked his lips thoughtfully after you get used to it itsinteresting isnt it a new way of doing things as you say when all this is done ill send a brewer to fox keep to show you the making of it adiatunnus promised when all this is done if youre able to send him and im able to receive him ill be glad to do that gerin drained his mug of beer getting up to fill it with another dipper of that dark brew seemed the most natural thing in the world so he did van had other ideas about what the most natural thing in the world might be if he got any friendlier with that serving womana lively redhead who gerin thought looked a lot like fandtheyd be consummating their friendship on top of the table or maybe down in the rushes on the floor gerin peered around for duren but didnt see him he wondered whether his son had found a girl for himself or was just off visiting the latrine when duren didnt come back right away the first guess seemed more likely a finelooking lad yhave there adiatunnus said which made the fox start a little he wasnt used to anyone save selatre or sometimes van thinking along with him adiatunnus went on am i after hearing the grandfather of him is a dead corp the which puts him in line for that barony thats so gerin agreed he eyed the trokm with genuine respect you have your ear to the ground to have got the news so soon the more you know the more you can do summat about adiatunnus answered a saying that might have come straight from the foxs lips gerin peered down into the black and apparently bottomless mug of beer when he looked up again duren was coming back into the great hall a smug look on his face that eased gerins mind after the boy had been kidnapped when he was small the fox wasnt easy about letting him out of his sight turning to adiatunnus gerin said it will be strange riding alongside you instead of at you it will that adiatunnus knocked back the black beer in his mug at a single gulp then sat there slowly shaking his head strange aye but you southrons now youve no fear of the gradi have you no more than i do of you gerin answered by the fight they made with us theyre brave and theyre strong but so are you trokmoiand so are we i canna tell you what it is fox adiatunnus said his features sagging in dismay but when we face em summat always goes wrong for us and when you get to the point where you expect to have a thing happen why happen it will yes ive seen that gerin said he remembered kapich his gradi prisoner sneering at the trokm gods whether that had anything to do with the woodsrunners bad luck against the gradi he couldnt have said but the notion wouldnt have surprised him adiatunnus said when we go against the gradi now how will you work it will you mix our men together like peas and beans in the soup pot or do you aim to keep em apart one group from the other ive been chewing on that very thing gerin said noting with some relief that adiatunnus really did seem to accept his command im leaning toward mixing that way its less likely your warriors or mine will think the other bunch has run off and left em in the lurch how do you feel about it he asked for more than politeness sake adiatunnus had proved himself no fool the trokm said strikes me as the better notion too if were to have an army it should be an army now if you ken what im saying i do gerin nodded my chief worry is that your men wont follow my commands as quickly as they might either because they think im trying to put them in more danger or just out of trokm cussedness as for the first i trust it wont be so else id never have bent the knee to you adiatunnus said you fight hard fox but you fight fair as for tother well there are times when i wonder you elabonians dont bore yourselves to death so dull you seem to us ive heard other trokmoi say as much gerin admitted but of course theyre wrong he brought that out deadpan to see what adiatunnus would do with it the chieftain frowned but then started to laugh try as you will lord princei should be saying that now eh being your vassal and all i meanyoull not get my goat so easy good gerin said so youre flighty to us and were dull to you what of the gradi you know them better than we do belike and how im wishing we didna this time adiatunnus frown stayed making his whole face seem longer theyrehow do i say it theyre serious about what they do that they are its not your fault youre in their way mind you but yare and so theyll rob you or kill you or whatever they like and if you have the gall to be offended mind then theyll get angry at you for trying to keep whats always been yours yes that fits in with what ive seen gerin agreed theyre very sure of themselves too they dont think we can stop them that goddess of theirs that voldar adiatunnus twisted both hands into an apotropaic sign dinna be saying that name in this place a wicked shedevil no mistake he shivered though the inside of the great hall was smoky and hot wicked aye but strongstrong and the others his fingers writhed again you fear her eh gerin started to ask that aloud but held his tongue dabbling in magic had taught him how much power lay in words saying something could make it real voldar undoubtedly knewor could find outadiatunnus feelings about her but putting words in the air made it more likely the trokm chief would draw her notice father dyaus will prosper our enterprise gerin said and hoped the chief elabonian god was paying as much attention to him as adiatunnus feared the chief gradi goddess was paying to him dyaus usually seemed content to reign over those who worshiped him without doing much to rule them gerin had always taken that for granted only in facing the gradi had he come to realize it had drawbacks as well as advantages he was distracted from such musings when a very pretty trokm girl less than half adiatunnus age sat down on the chieftains lap adiatunnus was holding a mug of black beer in one hand the other closed over her breast through her tunic the public display of what gerin would have kept private didnt disturb her indeed she seemed proud adiatunnus acknowledged shed captured his affection or at least his lust and can i be finding you summat lively in the line of women the trokm chieftain asked his hand opened and squeezed opened and squeezed id not want you to think me lacking in hospitality now i dont gerin assured him good food and good drink are plenty for me and youve given me those as for the other im happy enough with my wife not to care to look anywhere else though i thank you all the same and what a daft notion that is adiatunnus exclaimed not that youre happy the which is as may be but that your being happy back there would keep you from poking a wench here what has the one to do with tother a friendly futter is worth the having eh no matter where you find it the fox shrugged if thats how you want to live im not going to say you shouldnt its your affairand you can take that however you like and since im happy enough to let other people do as they please im even happier when they let me do the same youre happy to drive a lesson home like a man splitting logs with an axe too adiatunnus retorted but all right have it as you will since youre bound to anyhow and if youre not fain to have yourself a good time ill not be after making you do it so there gerin laughed out loud and raised his own mug in salute not many men could puncture him at arguments of that sort but adiatunnus had just done it that said something about how sharp the trokms wits were not that gerin hadnt already had a good notion of that it also said adiatunnus would make a useful allyprovided gerin kept an eye on him the trokms leman found something interesting to do with her hand too gerin wondered with abstract curiosity whether adiatunnus would suddenly need to change his trousers before that happened the woodsrunner got up and slung the girl over his shoulderno small display of strengthand carried her upstairs while she laughed gerin turned to duren and said i daresay youre learning some things here that you wouldnt see at fox keep oh i dont know his son answered sounding very much like him van and fand do things like that sometimes mm so they do the fox admitted he thumped duren on the shoulder and started to laugh then got to his feet well now youre going to see something you have seen before im going to bed also laughing his son went up with him van scratched his head then in fashion most ungentlemanly reached inside his breeches and scratched there too he squashed something between his thumbnails look at it wiped it on his trouser leg and let out a long sigh im going to have to go over myself for nits he said and dug in the pouch at his belt for a finetoothed wooden comb as he started raking it through his beard and hissing as the thick curly hairs got stuck he shook a thick forefinger at gerin and dont you twit me about these cursed lice and where i got em i know where i got em and i had fun doing it too fine gerin said you can have fun explaining to fand where you got em too but van refused to let that sally faze him theres too many ways toouch pick up lice for anybody to be sure which one i found that was true gerin for his part had fresh bedbug bites courtesy of no one more intimate than whoeverd last slept in the bed adiatunnus had given him and duren but he also knew that fand given a hundred possibilities would always choose the one likely to lead to the wildest fightand this time shed be right the fox didnt waste a lot of time brooding over it though he did spend a moment hoping he wouldnt come down with lice himself as he got grayer the vermin and their eggs got harder to spot in his hair getting the army ready to move soon made all such insectile worries seem of insectile size and importance his own men were quickly ready to ride whether on horseback or in their chariots hed never before watched the trokmoi getting ready to move out on campaignmost of the campaigns on which theyd moved in these parts had been aimed at him now that he was watching them he concluded they had to start days earlier than he would have to set out at the same time they bickered they bungled they got drunk instead of eating breakfast they went off for a fast poke with a serving girl instead of eating breakfast an elabonian captain would have killed a couple of his men on the spot before he put up with insubordination the trokm leaders ignored when the woodsrunners had finally fought theyd always done well against the foxs troopers he had to hope the same would hold now the longer he watched themand he had a good long while to watch themthe more forlorn that hope seemed adiatunnus was everywhere at once shouting blustering cursing cajoling the chieftain did get his fair measure of respect but as far as gerin could see matters moved no faster because of the racket he made gerin had to hope adiatunnus wasnt making things slower another hope that faded as the morning wore on van muttered wed have done better if the woodsrunners lined up with the gradi im thinking i wouldnt argue gerin said mournfully watching two trokmoi draw swords and scream at each other before their friends pulled them apart the closest adiatunnus came to acknowledging anything was wrong came when he said och youre ready a bit before us looks like and gave a breezy shrug to show how little that mattered to him the fox ignoring the way his stomach churned managed to nod at last with the sun a little to the west of south not even the trokmoi could delay any more their women calling last farewells they rode west from adiatunnus keep along with gerins men the fox murmured a prayer to dyaus that the campaign would end better than it had begun vi early omens were less than good the army crossed the venien river which flowed into the niffet not far from where the gradi had come down in their galleys and beaten the trokmoi though the woodsrunners had burned the bodies of their comrades who had fallen they still muttered among themselves as they passed the battlefield on the west side of the riverland that had been still in elabonian hands not under adiatunnus controlthe hair prickled up on gerins arms for no reason he could see or feel he kept quiet about it doubting his own judgment but after a while van said the air feelsuncanny thats it gerin exclaimed so vehemently that duren started and the horses snorted indignantly aye thats it feels like the air in the old haunted woods around ikos so it does van frowned weve been out this way a time or two and it never did before whats toward fox your usual elabonian gods they dont make a habit of letting folk know theyre around like this youre right they dont and they certainly never have around hereyoure right about that too gerin scowled what followed from his words did so as logically as the steps in a geometric proof from sithonia i dont think were feeling the power of elabonian gods whose then van glanced around to make sure no trokmoi could overhear him the woodsrunners gods are too busy brawling amongst themselves to pay much heed to impressing people i know gerin said folk get the gods they deserve dont they so whos left not us not the trokmoi not he let that hang in the air van had been many places in his travels but never to sithonia yet he needed to be no logician to see what gerin meant the gradi he said his voice as sour as weekold milk cant think of anyone else it could be the fox said unhappily he waved trying to put into words what he felt were heading toward high summer now but doesnt the air taste more the way it would at the start of spring when winters just loosed its grip and the sun he pointed up to it the lights watery somehow it shouldnt be not at this season of the year that it shouldnt van said ive lived here long enough to know youre right as can be captain he shook his fist toward the west toward the orynian ocean those cursed gradi gods are settling in here making themselves at home growing like toadstools after a rain my thought exactly gerin said voldar and the rest of them they must be strong to do whatever theyre doing dyaus and the elabonian pantheon they wouldnt interfere with the sun he didnt say they couldnt interfere with the sun though that was in his mind too he didnt know whether it was so or not the elabonian gods were so lax about manifesting themselves in the material world he honestly didnt know the full range of their power he didnt know the full range of voldars power either or the powers of the other gradi gods and goddesses he had the ominous feeling he was going to find out this would have been a fine mild day had it come a little before the vernal equinox drawing near the summer solstice though over his shoulder duren said i wish we could find out what the weathers like back on the east side of the venien that would tell us more about whether what were worrying about is real or were shying at shadows gerin smiled there are times when i wish i could send dagref down to the city of elabon to learn all the things he cant learn here in the northlands maybe you should go too for thats reasoned like a scholar aye so it is van rumbled but theres more going on here than scholarship or whatever you call it its not just the weather lad its what i feel in the hair on the nape of my neck and im not talking about lice he set a hand on the flared neckpiece of his helmet what do we do about it duren said yielding the point fight it van declared as usual the world looked simple to him gerin wished the world looked simple to him too here though he saw no better answer than the one his friend had proposed by the time they camped that first night west of the venien the trokmoi were all edgy looking over their shoulders and muttering to themselves over anything or nothing the presence of the more stolid elabonians seemed to steady them as gerinand adiatunnushad hoped it would they were still in land under gerins suzerainty but not land where his control was as firm as it was closer to fox keep the serfs hereabouts had not seen enough of him and his armies to have any confidence in their goodwill they probably had seen enough of trokm raiders to have no confidence in them whatever at first sight of a large force heading their way they fled into the woods the warriors tookeven gerin did not like to think of it as stealingenough chickens and sheep to sacrifice to keep the night ghosts quiet other than that they did not harm the villages or the fields around them they built great bonfires not only to hold the ghosts at bay but also to give themselves warning if the gradi were close enough to dare a night attack to reduce the risk of that as much as he could gerin set scouts out all around the campsite each small group with a fowl to offer so the ghosts would not trouble them in spite of their being away from the fires adiatunnus watched that with interest and attention the fox got the idea the trokm was storing the notion to use against him one of these years swiftmoving tiwaz had come round close to first quarter math was almost full while nothos though four days past still had only a bit of his eastern edge abraded by darkness out where the light of the bonfires grew dim men had three separate shadows each pointing in a different direction except to go out to stand sentry or to answer calls of nature though few men either elabonians or trokmoi strayed far from the fireside the warriors either rolled up in their blankets or sat around talking often with folk not of their own kin most of them understood and could speak at least some of the language of their hereditary foes and most relished the chance to swap tales with the men they usually met with weapons not words drungo dragos son turned to van and said give us a tale why dont you instantly all the elabonians began clamoring for a tale from the outlander too hed seen and done things none of them gerin included could match and he told a good story too seeing how enthusiastic the elabonians were to hear him the trokmoi started shouting too well all right van said at last i thought id sooner sleep and i thought a lot of you would sooner sleep too but who knows maybe ill put you to sleep and then get some myself youd like that hey somebody threw a hardbaked biscuit at him he caught it out of the air and went on without missing a beat well ive yarned a good deal about creatures of one kind or another ive seen and those tales havent had too many people flinging their suppers my way so maybe ill give you one of them just to stay safe how does that sound no one said no several warriors said yes loudly and enthusiastically van nodded all right then he said south and east of the city of elabon way south of the high kirs the coast of the bay of parvela runs southeast between kizzuwatna which is far away from here and hot as you please to mabalal which is even farther even hotter and muggy to boot he looked around the night like the day was cooler than it should have been feels good to think about something hot right now doesnt it his listeners nodded gerin wished he could put into a jar whatever his friend used to draw an audience into a story even if it wasnt sorcery it was magic of a sort van went on some of you now some of you may have heard i had to get out of mabalal in a kind of a hurry once upon a time he got more nods from a few of the trokmoi and a lot of the elabonians he grinned his teeth flashed white in the firelight by the gods some of you have heard a whole raft of different reasons why i had to get out of mabalal in a hurry now does that mean i get into a pack of trouble or i tell a pack of lies both most likely drungo said he wasnt a match for van in size or strength or speed but he was a large strong man and confident of his prowess even so he made sure he was grinning too the outlander busy shaping his story didnt take it for a challenge as he might have in his younger days he just said well i was there and im the only one here who was so nobodyll prove anything on me and thats a fact anyway there i was sailing away from mabalal up toward kizzuwatna getting away from whatever i was getting away from and we put in at this miserable little port called sirte theres only two reasons anybody would ever put in at sirte one is you can fill your waterskins there the water you get is harsh and it can give you a flux of the bowels if youre not used to it but the spring never fails and the other is that a ways inland theres a grove of myrrh trees in a valley that some more springs water if you can get the myrrh which is a sticky resin that grows on the trees youll sell it for a goodly price its one of the incenses they burn at ikos isnt it gerin put in that it is fox van nodded when we got to sirte maybe half of dozen of usneerdowells every one youd saywe decided to see if we couldnt get hold of some of this myrrh for our own selves and strike out inland to see what we could do with it i dont know about the others but me i was sick of being cooped up on a ship the folk at sirte spoke some of the language of mabalal and so did we when they got the drift of what we wanted to do they told us to watch out for snakes on the way to the myrrh trees wed just come out of mabalal now so we thought we knew something of snakesive told stories about the serpents there i expect i liked the yarn about the snake with the stone in its head that was supposed to make you turn invisible but didnt parol chickpea said for which i do thank you friend van said aye we thought we knew something of snakes that we did so when the folk of sirte warned us of the kinds they had out there in their desertthe chersidos and the cenchris and the seps and the prester and the dipsas and the scytale and i dont know what all other sorts they namedwe just nodded our heads and said yes yes when they told us about the different kinds of venom the serpents had we figured they were spinning tales to frighten us and make us stay away from the myrrh the outlander shook his head the firelight deepened the lines that carved his face and exaggerated his expression of rue only goes to show what we knew or rather what we didnt we bought waterskins and filled em and trudged out into the desert toward the myrrh trees which were about a day and a halfs travel inland from sirte the local folk shook their heads watching us go as if they didnt expect to see us ever again which truth to tell they probably didnt to this day if they remember us they probably think we all perished in the desert lucky we are that we didntor some of us didnt too i suppose the people of sirte went back and forth to the myrrh trees every so often gerin said if they looked for the snakes to get you wouldnt they have expected to find your bodies along whatever trail there was thats a good question captain and before i trod that trail i would have thought the same thing van said that is if id believed them about the snakes which i cant say i did like i told you my notion was that they were just trying to scare us and keep us from going after the myrrh i mean well hear me out and youll see wed been walking along for a bit when all of a sudden something reared up out of the sand and gravel and hit me a lick right here the outlander tapped his left greave not far below the knee if i hadnt been wearing it theres an awful lot of stories i wouldnt have told since and thats the truth i took a whack at the snake with my sword and off flew its head but wed stirred up more than one it turned out maybe the second was mate to the first i wont ever know that i killed it too but not till after it bit one of my friends it wasnt a very big snake and we hoped it wasnt any of the kinds the locals had warned us about but it turned out to be a seps and oh van covered his eyes with a hand how i wish it hadnt been how do you know it was if it was only a little snake you killed someone asked by the action of the venom van answered the seps bit my friendwell actually he was a robber and a thief but we were traveling togetherjust above the ankle half an hour later the gods beshrew me if i lie there was nothing left of him but a little puddle of greenish fluid what that same somebody exclaimed a snakebite doesnt do that i thought the same thing van said but i was wrong the natives at sirte had told us the seps venom made you disappear and they knew what they were talking about the fellows flesh got clear around the bite so you could see the bone through it and then it just melted away and the bone with it he shuddered dramatically i never saw a man dissolve before and if the gods are kind ill never see it again how he screamed as he watched himself vanishtill he couldnt scream any more of course the rest of us we pushed on in a hurry let me tell you and by the time we got out of there like i say he was nothing more than a little stinking puddle the hot sun was already drying up you cant blame us for not sticking around the spot where anything that horrible happened but running away so fast turned out to be a mistake too for we didnt watch where we were putting our feet as carefully as we should have and one of us stepped right on a prester the thing looked like the vipers they have here more or less but when it came writhing out of the sand it was the color of melted copper it sank its teeth into poor nasidthat was his name it comes back to me even after all these yearsthen dove back into the sandbank and disappeared before anybody could do anything to it and poor nasid instead of melting he started to swell like rising bread dough but a hundred times as fast his skin turned as fiery red as the presters he looked like there was a storm inside him puffing him out every which way at once heres how fast he blew out he was wearing trousers and a tunic with buttons almost trokmstyle and the buttons flew right off the tunic so hard that the one that hit me gave me this little scar over my eye right here the outlander pointed to a mark on his muchbattered hide gerin admired that touch if vans stories werent true they should have been for he adorned them with a wealth of circumstantial detail what happened then the fox asked what do you mean van returned to nasid he exploded and there was no more left of him than of the other poor devil to the rest of us we ran we probably should have run back to sirte but we went on toward the myrrh instead and actually got to it with nobody else dying on the way then we headed up toward the shanda country but my other three friendsfriends ha tried to kill me for my share of the myrrh and i left them as dead as anybody a snake bit and what would the moral o the tale be adiatunnus asked a fine one it is but it should have a moral you want a moral eh van said ill give you one what this story shows is some things are more trouble than theyre worth the trokm chieftain laughed and nodded it does that and a truth worth remembering it is too he glanced up at the moons and if youd gone on much longer the storyd have been more trouble nor it was worth with us having to get up in the morning and all but you didna for which i thank you he laid a blanket on the ground and wrapped himself in it gerin couldnt resist a parting shot even if you do get up in the morning will you be moving before afternoon adiatunnus made a point of ignoring him chuckling the fox also swaddled himself in a blanket and was soon asleep maybe sleeping in the open was what the trokmoi needed maybe they were starting to remember what being on campaign was all about whatever the reason they moved reasonably fast when the sun came up the next morning gerin had been looking forward to screaming at them to hurry disappointed he gnawed dry sausage and made sure he was ready to get going so they couldnt twit him the farther west they traveled the more heavily the unnatural coolth lay on the land gerin eyed the fields with curiosity and concern mixed theyll not have much of a crop this year he observed aye the wheats well behind where it ought to be van agreed they look like they had to plant late to start with and they wont make up for lost time not with weather like this they wont his shiver held only a little exaggeration for dramatic effect pity you couldnt have brought one of those prester snakes along with you from sirteis that the name of the place gerin said van nodded the fox went on sounds like just what wed need to heat up a certain goddess id be better off not naming van chuckled and nodded aye a prester would heat her up if anything would the thing of it is would anything i dont know and i dont care gerin answered if we beat the gradi and drive them away it doesnt matter anyhow without men and women to worship her that goddess wont gain a foothold here he didnt know whether not naming voldar would do any good but hed been of the opinion that adiatunnus knew more about the gradi than he did and the trokm chief had given him no reason to change his mind if adiatunnus thought saying voldars name would draw her notice the fox was willing to refrain he wished though that he could draw the notice of the local barons by speaking their names many of them seemed to have abandoned their keeps though the gradi didnt seem to be garrisoning those keeps either some of the serf villages looked deserted too again gerin saw the delicate fabric of civilization tearing he sent scouts out farther ahead and to either side than he was used to doing he also maintained a substantial rearguard the gradi with their ability to travel down rivers were liable to try to set troops behind him and pin him between two forces he would have thought about doing that had he been in their place anyhow as his army advanced through country that lay ever deeper in the frigid embrace of the gradi gods he wished he could come to grips with the gradi themselves he began to worry when he encountered none of them and started complaining shortly thereafter when he did van fixed him with a gaze that might have belonged on a battlefield itself and said well come across them soon enough and when we do youll be wishing just as loud youd never set eyes on them since that was undoubtedly true the fox maintained what he thought was a prudent silence vans snicker said it might have been less prudent than hed hoped and then a couple of days later the army did come upon a troop of gradi the invaders were happily plundering a peasant village theyd killed a couple of men and a line of them were having sport with a woman theyd caught they seemed utterly astonished to find foes so far into territory they obviously thought of as theirs as some of them were literally caught with their breeches down they put up a fight less ferocious than they might have otherwise and several made no effort to slay themselves rather than submitting to capture gerin ordered the men whod been holding down the peasant woman and the one whod been on top of her bound and handed over to the surviving serfs do as you like with them he said im sure youll think of something interesting the peasants eyes glowed lets get a fire going one of them said aye and well boil some water over it another added enthusiastically will we want sharp knivesor dull ones somebody asked both said the woman whod been raped i claim first cut and i know just where im going to make it too she stared at the crotch of one of the gradi with an interest anything but lewd gerin couldnt tell whether any of the bound gradi understood elabonian they might not know what was in store for them he shrugged if they didnt theyd find out soon enough one of the other northerners did speak the language of the land theyd invaded i not tell you anything he said when gerin started to question him fine the fox said he turned to the warriors holding the captives take him where he can watch the serfs at work if he doesnt come back talkier after that well give him to them too come on you one of the elabonians said they frogmarched the gradi away before long the fox heard hoarse screams rising up from inside the village when the guards brought the gradi back his face was paler than it had been the guards looked grim too hello again gerin said briskly he looked thoughtful a look hed had occasion to practice over the years do you suppose your goddess would be interested in keeping you around for the afterlife if you end up dead with some interesting parts missing do you suppose youd enjoy the afterlife as much if you didnt have them do you want to find out the answers to those questions right away the gradi licked his lips he didnt answer right away maybe he was taking stock of his own spirit dying in battle even slaying yourself to avoid capture seemed easy if you measured them against mutilation that would be long agony in this world and might ruin you for the next gerin smiled are you more in the mood to talk now than you were a little while ago for your sake youd better be how i know i talk then you do things to me anyway the gradi asked how do you know you can trust me you mean thats simpleyou dont nothing complicated there eh but i tell you now that i wont do all those interesting things to you if you do talk you can believe me or not as you choose the gradi sighed i talk what you want for starters tell me your name gerin said i am eistr eistr gerin found a stick and wrote the name in elabonian characters in the soft ground at his feet now that i know it and have captured it here i can work magic against itand against youif i find out you lie eistr looked appalled gerin had hoped he would nothing the fox had seen made him think the gradi knew the use of writing literacy was thin enough among elabonians and almost nonexistent among the trokmoi who when they did write used the characters of their southern neighbors ignorance added to eistrs fear and the truth was that gerin if sufficiently ired might even have been able to use name magic against him though it wasnt anything the fox really wanted to try you ask i tell the gradi said i tell true swear by voldars breasts gerin had no idea how strong an oath that was but decided not to press it he said where did your band come from how many more of you are back there eistr pointed back toward the west is keep two days walk from here is by a river we have maybe ten tens when i there is maybe more now is maybe not more too the fox thought that over it struck him as a likely way to get his army to walk into a trap without leaving eistr forsworn gerin said why dont you know how many men of yours are likely to be in this keep now we use forhow you say for middle place some go out to fight some come in to fight some stay to mind thralls eistr said is now many is now not ah that did make a certain amount of sense is your band supposed to be back at this base at any set time or do you come and go as you please as we please we are gradi we are free the goddess voldar rules us no man pride rang in eistrs voice you may be surprised the fox said dryly eistrs cold gray eyes stared at him without comprehension gerin turned to the guards take him away well find out what some of the others can tell us he got pretty much the same story from the rest of the gradi who spoke elabonian then he had to figure out what to do with them killing them out of hand would have meant having the same thing happen to any of his men the gradi captured holding them prisoner would have made him detach men from his own force to guard them which he didnt think he could afford to do in the end he decided to strip them naked and turn them loose but these thralls they catch us they kill us eistr protested he being the most articulate of the gradi he glanced nervously toward the peasant village you know maybe you should have thought about that before you started robbing and raping and killing them gerin said but they ours we do with them how we like eistr answered voldar has said so must be true the other gradi who followed elabonian nodded agreement to that voldar isnt the only goddessor godin this land and people here have more sway on their own than youre used to the fox said as if to add emphasis to his words another scream came from one of the raiders hed given over to the serfs he blinked in surprise hed thought those gradi surely dead by now the peasants had more patience and ingenuity than hed given them credit for he finished now youre going to find out what its like being rabbits instead of wolves if you live youll learn something from it and if you dont live youll learn summat from that too van added with ghoulish glee when ordered to strip bare one of the captured gradi though weaponless threw himself at elabonians and trokmoi and fought so fiercely he made them kill him the rest looked much less fearsome without jerkins and helms and heavy leather boots they ran for the woods white buttocks flashing in the sun they have no tools for making fire gerin observed nor weapons to hunt beasts for sacrifices to the night ghosts theyll have a thin time of it when the sun goes down he smiled unpleasantly good he gave the helms and shields and axes hed taken from the gradi to the men of the peasant village he didnt know how much good they would do folk untrained to war but was certain they couldnt hurt some of the villagers were still busy with the captive gradi he did his best not to look at what was left of the arrogant raiders he did say when youre done there find someplace to be rid of the bodies so the gradi never find them for that matter if you get word weve lost you probably ought to think about running for your lives you wont lose lord prince one of the serfs exclaimed you cant gerin wished he shared the fellows touching optimism the fox pushed the pace as his force of chariotry approached the keep the gradi were holding he didnt want any of the men hed released deciding to act heroic and getting there ahead of his warriors to warn the garrison taking a keep was hard enough without having the foe alerted in advance one thing the gradi seemed to have no idea he and his troopers were anywhere nearby to make sure they didnt on his approach he sent out dismounted scouts who if they were seen were likely to be taken for either gradi or for elabonian peasants the scouts came back with word that sure enough the gradi did hold the keep but that they had the drawbridge down and were keeping no watch worth mentioning why dont we just march up on foot and tramp right in then the fox said with luck they wont notice we arent who were supposed to be till its too late to raise the drawbridge against us what and leave the cars behind adiatunnus demanded we cant fight with them inside the keep anyhow can we gerin said the trokm chieftain scratched his head then shrugged plainly not having looked at it that way gerin said theyve got us here faster than we could have come on foot and were not worn out from walking either theyve served their purpose but you cant use the same tool for every job ah well adiatunnus said i told you id follow against the gradi where you led and if youll be after leading with the feet of you ill walk in your footsteps that i will his eyes though said something more like and if this goes wrong ill blame you for it that i will that was the chance you took in any battle though if you lost you got the blame assuming you lived actually you could get the blame if you died too but then you had other things to worry about the fox told off approximately equal numbers of elabonians and trokmoi to stay behind with the horses as for the rest he put those who in looks and equipment most closely resembled the gradi at the head of the column to confuse the warriors in the keep for as long as he could being dark haired himself with gear of the plainest he marched along at the fore van who with his blond hair and fancy cuirass resembled almost anything in the world more than a gradi was relegated to the rear to his loud disgust he complained so long and so bitterly gerin finally snapped im getting better obedience out of the trokmoi than i am from you oh ill do it fox the outlander said with a mournful sigh but you can drop me into the hottest of your five hells if you think youll make me like it so long as it gets done gerin said he wished hed been able to find an excuse to hold duren back at the rear if both of them fell all his hopes would fall toonot again that hed be in a position to do anything about it he led the column of warriors on a looping track to bring them up to the keep from the south figuring the gradi were less likely to take alarm if he and his men didnt come into view from straight out of the east well get as close to the keep as we can he said and then charge home if enough of us can get inside theyll be very unhappy and if not enough can somebodyhe didnt see whosaid we will since that was undoubtedly true he wasted no time arguing about it his first view of the keep confirmed the scouts reports and his own hopes the gradi had only a handful of men up on the walls several more were passing time outside a couple going at each other with axe and shield three or four more standing around watching when the gradi caught sight of the oncoming column the first thing they did was raise a loud wordless cheer yell back the fox hissed to his own men who did a shout was a shout in any language one of the gradi perfecting his axework was the first to notice that gerin and his followers were not what they appeared to be by then though they were less than a hundred yards from the drawbridge the sharpeyed gradi let out a shout that though still without words was of altogether different tone from those his countrymen had been exchanging with gerins masquerading warriors he rushed at the elabonians and trokmoi the sun glinting off the bronze head of his axe several archers shot him he fell before he got close to the attackers run gerin shouted giving up the pretense we seize the gateway we get inside and we clean them out yelling for all they were worth his men and adiatunnus dashed for the drawbridge the fox wasnt the first man onto itsome of the young bravos ran fasterbut he wasnt far behind he wondered if the gradi were going to raise it with warriors on it and inside the keep they didnt as they hadnt tried raising it before their enemies reached it when he stormed into the keep gerin realized the raiders from the north hadnt kept any sort of gate crew on the winches that would have moved the bridge up or down maybe they hadnt seen the need maybe castles in their own cold homeland had gates that worked differently whatever the reason they made his work easier for him as soon as he and his men got inside the keeps outer wall the fight was as good as won the gradi would have done better to throw down their axes and beg for mercy not all of them even had axes or helms or leather jerkins theyd been expecting no attack had they yielded they would have lived with few exceptions they would not yield instead they hurled themselves at the elabonians and trokmoi with loud cries of voldar as had a couple of their warriors back at the peasant village many of them armed with nothing more than belt knives and stools and whatever they could snatch up fought so fiercely they made their foes slay them and they slew their foes too outnumbered outmatched they still did a lot of damage one of them swinging a bench from the great hall leveled a whole row of elabonians as if he were scything down wheat a couple of the warriors who went down didnt get up again either hed managed to split their skulls his next flailing swipe with the bench almost took gerin out with it the fox had to skip back in a hurry to keep from getting his ribs stove in but a bench was an unhandy thing with which to make a backhand stroke gerin stepped forward thrust his sword into the gradis belly twisted to make sure the stroke killed and jerked the blade free the gradi toppled clutching himself and howling adiatunnus shouted in his own language into the castle now well not be letting em use it for refuge against us had the gradi thought to do that they might have given gerins army a hard fight many of them tried to get into the great hall to lay hold of their weapons and then return to the fight out in the courtyard when elabonians and trokmoi got in with them the chance of using the castle as a citadel disappeared and when the fighting raged in the great hall as well as outside the servants in the kitchenelabonians alljoined gerins warriors throwing themselves at the gradi with kitchen knives and cleavers and spits and twotined serving forks they had no armor they had no skill at fighting some of them were women but they had hatred and to spare in the tight quarters in the chaos that let them bring down more than one of the men who had oppressed them though more of their number fell making the effort after the great hall of the castle was forced the battle became a hunt for any gradi who still lived the tall pale darkhaired men would find shelter and then spring out selling their lives dear as they could before the sun went down almost all of them were dead the castle servants helped there they knew every hiding place in the keep and led gerins men to them one by one the gradi deprived of surprise wreaked a smaller toll than they might have otherwise we won adiatunnus said looking around at the carnage with dazed almost disbelieving eyes whod have thought we could lay into those omadhauns and beat em the way theyve pounded us like drums theyre only men gerin said from inside the castle screams rose the kitchen servants were having their revenge on some of the gradi who yet lived the air was thick with the smell of roasting meat gerin decided he didnt want to know what sort of meat was being roasted he went to do what he could to help the wounded sewing up gashes and setting broken bones a physician down in the city of elabon would no doubt have laughed at his efforts here in the northlands he came as close to being a physician as anyone and closer than most a skinny young woman came up to him with bread and beef ribs and ale he took some but said here you eat the rest you look as if you need it more than i do the very idea of a scrawny kitchen helper struck him as strange so did the amazed way the woman stared she started to cry the gradi theyd beat us or worse if we ate of what we made for them she didnt talk for a while after that instead cramming her mouth full of bread and beef then she asked do you want me i dont have anything else i can give you for setting us free no thats all right gerin answered the young womanyoung enough easily to be his daughterdidnt look as if it was all right she looked as if she wanted to punch him in the eye so much for gratitude he thought a thought that frequently crossed his mind when he was dealing with human beings the woman went off and approached a trokm gerin thought it likely that if she wanted to thank him that particular way hed let her he was about to send a runner to order the chariots up to spend the night with the rest of the army when they came up without orders a driver sometimes leading another team or two behind the car in which he stood figured we wouldnt break surprise now and you might be able to use us said utreiz embrons son the warrior hed left in charge of the chariotry nicely reasoned gerin said with an approving nod hed thought well of utreiz for years the man thought straight and kept his eyes on what was important all the time he was no swashbuckler but he got the job done and done well he was in fact rather like a smallscale model of the fox i expected youd have things well in hand he said now if theyd gone wrong youd have been yelling for us a long time ago thats likely so gerin agreed he went on in a thoughtful tone of voice you know utreiz this land is going to need reordering if we ever drive the gradi out of it i think youd be a good man to install as a vassal baron thank you lord prince utreiz said id be lying if i said i didnt hope youd tell me something like that gerin wondered if he ought to be annoyed utreiz had anticipated him he shook his head no not when hed thought for years that the fellows mind worked like his he looked around to make sure his men up on the wall of the captured keep were more alert than the gradi had been he didnt know how close their next large band was and didnt want to throw away the victory hed won over them the harried elabonian servitors at the keep assumed the fox would want to sleep in the room the gradi commander had used and led him up to it when he said he was tired one whiff inside convinced him he didnt want to do that even by the loose standards of the elabonian northlands the gradi were not outstandingly clean of person he wondered whether that came from living in such a cold climate no matter where it came from it made him go on down into the great hall and roll himself in a blanket there with his men the racket in the hall was still loud as warriors drank and refought the battle over and over again the fox didnt care after hed learned to fall asleep with newborn infants in the same room nothing his men could do fazed him he was not a man who dreamed much or often remembered the dreams he had when he found himself walking along a snowy path through a whitedraped forest of pines he thought at first he was awake then he realized he wasnt cold and decided it had to be a dream even though he hardly ever remembered having such a clear one when he understood he was dreaming he expected to wake up at once as often happens when a dream is seen for what it is but he stayed asleep and kept walking down the path he tried to force himself awake but discovered he couldnt fear trickled through him then once years before the trokm wizard balamung had seized his spirit and made it see what the wizard would have it see he hadnt been able to fight his way from that dream till balamung released him now now suddenly the pines gave way the path opened out into a snowcovered clearing dazzlingly white even under a leaden sky and in the middle of that clearing stood a comely naked woman with long dark hair twice as tall as the fox who held in her right hand an axe of gradi style voldar gerin whispered in the silence of his mind he thanked his own gods that the gradi goddess had chosen to meet him in a dream rather than manifesting herself in the material world he was in enough danger here in this place that was not a true place she looked at himthrough himwith eyes pale as ice eyes in which cold fire flickered and he abruptly was cold chilled in the heart chilled from the inside out her lips moved you meddle in what does not concern you she said he did not think the words were elabonian but he understood them anyhow that left him awed but unsurprised godsand he supposed goddesseshad their own ways in such matters the northlands are my land the land of my people the land of my gods he answered bold as he dared of course what happens here concerns me that divinely chilling gaze pierced him again voldar tossed her head in fine contempt her hair whipped out behind her flying back as if in a breezebut there was no breeze or none gerin could sense in face and form the gradi goddess was stunningly beautiful more perfect than any being the fox had imagined but even had she been his size he would have known no stir of desire for her whatever her purpose love had nothing to do with it she said obey me now and you may yet survive give over your vain resistance and you will be able to live out your full span most honored among all those not lucky enough to be born of the blood of my folk did that mean the people who worshiped her or the people shed invented gerin had never thought hed have the chance to ask a god that philosophical riddle and with the moment here discovered having the chance and having the nerve were two different things he said ill take my chances i may end up dead but that strikes me as better than living under your peopleand under you or i may end up alive and free till the time comes you never knowand we elabonians have gods too voldar tossed her head again are you sure if you do where are they drunk asleep dead i have hardly noticed them i tell you that the trokmoi have godsaye gods who flee before me but you folk here who would know i think you pray to emptiness gerin knew he could not afford to give full heed to anything she told him she had her own interest and fooling him and dismaying him were to her advantage but what she said about the trokm gods paralleled all too well what had happened in the material world for him to dismiss it out of hand and what she said about dyaus and the rest of the elabonian pantheon put him in mind of his own thoughts and his own worries he wondered how much of the dream he would remember when he woke ill take the chance he said the trokmoi brought their gods south of the niffet when they crossed over it some years back and those gods do live in this land now but they havent run off the gods we elabonians follow the trokmoi havent conquered us either youll notice as they surely would have if our gods were as weak as you say as i also told you its the trokm gods who are weak voldar answered but she did not sound so grimly selfassured as she had before maybe hed given her a response she hadnt expected she gathered herself before resuming in any case my people and i are not puny and foolish as are the trokmoi and their gods we do not come here to visit or to share we come to take as far as gerin was concerned the trokmoi had come for the same reason but the gradi and voldar and the rest of their gods were much more serious much more methodical about it than the woodsrunners voldar went on i tell you this if you stand against us you and your line shall surely fail and it will be as if you had never been be warned and choose accordingly for a moment gerin knew stark despair voldar had struck keenly at his deepest secret fear almost he was tempted to give in but then he remembered bitons verses promising ricolfs barony to duren had the farseeing god been lying to him he had trouble believing that he wondered if voldar had so much as sensed bitons presence in the land the sibyls shrine being far from anywhere the gradi had reached and biton himself being only superficially elabonian he did not ask the more ignorant the gradi and their gods remained of the northlands the better off their opponents would be he also wondered whether voldar had yet encountered whatever older utterly unelabonian powers dwelt under the sibyls shrine the powers controlling the monsters then he wondered if there were any such powers so much he didnt know even after a busy lifetime in the world what is your answer voldar demanded when he did not speak who can say whether what you tell me is the same as what will be he replied i guess ill take my chances fighting on fool voldar screamed she stabbed out a finger at him cold smote sharp and harsh as any spear thrust he clutched at his chest as if piercedand woke up panting his heart pounding with fear in the great hall of the keep he and his army had just seized adiatunnus was lying a few feet away no sooner had gerins eyes flown open in the gloom of guttering torches than the trokm chieftain gave a great crythe hag the horrible hag in his own language and sat bolt upright his pale eyes wide and staring several warriors muttered and stirred a couple of men woke up at adiatunnus shout and complained before rolling over and going back to sleep adiatunnus gaped wildly now this way now that as if he did not know where he was did you just visit a certain goddess in your dreams gerin called quietly he still didnt know whether mentioning voldar by name would help make her notice him but after what hed just seen he didnt want to find out either och i did that adiatunnus answered his voice shaky he needed a moment to realize why gerin was likely to be asking the question a telling measure of how shaken he was his gaze sharpened showing his wits beginning to work once more and you fox the same the same gerin agreed shewhoever she was no hed take no chances tried to frighten me out of going on with the campaign what happened to you just the look of her turned the marrow in me to ice for fair adiatunnus said shivering humliest wench im ever after seeing and thats nobbut the truth and the blood running from the jaws of her it came from some good trokm god im thinking puir fellow ugly blood thats not how she showed herself to me gerin said more intrigued than surprised gods were gods after all of course they could manifest themselves in more than one way she was beautiful but terrible fear and cold and awe all mixed together what i thought was no wonder shes chief among all the gradi gods we saw her different that we did adiatunnus said with another shudder i wonder which was her true seeming or if either one was well never ken im thinking however you saw her though what did the two of you have to say to each other as best he could gerin recounted his conversation with the gradi goddess finishing when i told her i wouldnt give up shei dont knowflung a freeze at me i thought my heart and all my blood would turn to ice but before that happened i woke up what befell you you said her nay adiatunnus asked in wondering tones you said her nay and she didnt destroy you of course she destroyed me gerin answered irritably lookhere you are talking with my blasted corpse adiatunnus stared then frowned then after a long moment started to laugh fox its many a time and oft ive wished to see the dead corp of you blasted or any way you choose the now though ill own to being glad youre still here to give me more in the line of troubles i thank you for that in the same spirit you meant it gerin said squeezing another chuckle out of adiatunnus the fox went on what did she say or do to make you wake up with such a howl why she showed me the ruin of everything id labored for all these years if i was to go on with the war against her people the trokm answered and you believed her gerin said just like that so i did adiatunnus said with yet another chuckle what i want to know is why you didna because i assumed she was lying to me to put me in fear and make me lose heart gerin said if i were a gradi god its what id do you trokmoi are a tricksy folkhave you no trickster gods aye we do that adiatunnus admitted but the goddess in my dream now shes not that sort not from all the tales of her i ken any road and the gradi theyre not that sort either they come and they take and they kill and they go with hardly even a smile to say theyre enjoying the work that last phrase drew a snort from the fox who said well from what ive seen youre right about the gradi you may even be right about that goddess maybe she wouldnt lie for the sport of it the way a woodsrunner would he relished adiatunnus glare a sign the chieftains spirit was recovering but would she lie to help her own folk of course she would this side of biton can you think of a god who wouldnt adiatunnus pondered that slowly he nodded summat to what you say lord prince he used gerins title in a tone half grudging half admiring youve got sand in you that you do you aim just to keep on after the gradi as if youd never dreamt your dream do you now weve beaten them once you and i together gerin said ive beaten them another time all by my lonesome till they show me they can beat me why should i pull back sure and you have a way to make it all sound so simple so easy adiatunnus said but theyre after beating us a whole raft o timesus trokmoi i mean when that happens he sighed the only thing you can think of is that itll happen again try as you will to stop it which is why you made common cause with us gerin observed truth there adiatunnus said then let me take the lead since you gave it to me and dont trouble your head with dreams even dreams with goddesses in them the fox said dinna fash yoursel dinna fash yoursel adiatunnus made his voice high and squeaky as if he were a mother shouting at a little boy easy to say not so easy to do not when youre in the middle o the dream there was truth in that too but gerin asked are you dreaming now no the trokm chieftain said at once but then he looked around the dimlit great hall or no is what i think the now but how can you be sure good question gerin said if i had a good answer id give it to you ill tell you this much i dont think im dreaming either he pulled his blanket up around him the rough wool scratched at his neck with any luck though i will be soon he closed his eyes he heard adiatunnus laugh softly and a little later heard his snores join those filling the hall a little later than that he stopped hearing anything when the foxs army rode west from the captured keep the next morning they rode toward dark gray clouds piled high on the horizon and scudding rapidly toward them on a startlingly nippy breeze wouldnt know we were at the summer season would you gerin said shivering a little as that wind slid under his armor and chilled his hide duren looked back over his shoulder at his father if i didnt know what season it was id guess those clouds held snow in them not rain i wish they did van said peering ahead with a frown snowd leave the road hard rain like the rain those clouds look to have in emll turn these dirt tracks into hubdeep soup he turned from duren to gerin your elabonian emperors were no fools when they made their fine highways hard on a horses hooves aye but you can move along em and bite the thumb at the worst of the weather i wont say youre wrong because i think youre right gerin studied those fastmoving clouds and shook his head ive never seen weather so ugly this late in the year even as he spoke the wind freshened further it smelled of rain of damp dust somewhere not far away a moment later the first drop hit him in the face more rain followed the wind blowing it almost horizontally through the air rain in summer should have been pleasant breaking the humidity and leaving the air mild and sweet when it was gone this rain once arrived chilled to the marrow and gave no sign it would ever leave a few of the warriors had brought rain capes with them of oiled cloth or leather for once gerin found himself imperfectly forethoughtful and getting ever more perfectly wet the horses splashed through the thickening ooze of the roadway and began to kick up muck instead of dust the chariot wheels churned up a muddy wake as the car rolled west gerins world contracted the rain brought down dim curtains that hid the middle distance and even the near he could see the couple of teams and chariots closest to him no more every gradi in the world might have been gathered a bowshot and a half off to one side of the road and he would never have known it after a while he stopped worrying had the gradi been there they wouldnt have known about him either water dripped from vans eyebrows and trickled through his beard this is no natural storm fox he boomed raising his voice to make himself heard through wailing wind and drumming drops i fear youre right gerin said it puts me in mind of the one balamung the wizard raised against us before he led the trokmoi across the niffet he remembered the gleaming sorcerous bridge over the river as if it had been yesterday though more than a third of his life had passed since then van nodded the motion shook more water from his beard and if a wizard could do what balamung did how hard a grip can gods take on the weather a good question gerin answered and then said no more for some time a lot of people had been coming up with good questions lately at last he added its such a good one i wish you hadnt asked it as if to give point to what the outlander had said a lightning bolt crashed down and smashed a tree somewhere not far away gerin saw the bluepurple glare and heard the crash but could not see the tree through the driving rain as the rain went on the army traveled more and more slowly the fox had trouble being sure they were still traveling west he had trouble being sure they were still on the road the only way to tell it from the fields through which it went was that the mud seemed deeper and more clinging in the roadway days were long at this season of the year but the clouds were so thick and black they disguised the coming of night almost till true darkness arrived the army caught away from a keep and even away from a peasant village made a hasty miserable camp the only offering they could give the ghosts was blood sausage from their rations starting fires was out of the question so was hunting gerin set his jaw against the discontented disappointed wails of the night spirits and did his best to ignore them as he would have tried to ignore the first twinges of a tooth beginning to rot in his head he squelched around the unhappy encampment there were tents enough for only about a third of his men he shouted and cajoled troopers into packing those tents as tight as serfs stuffed barley into storage jars that helped but it wasnt enough nothing would have been enough not in that rain he got the men who could not be stuffed into tents to rig what shelters they could with blankets and with the chariots theyd been riding such would have done against the usual warm summer rain against this half of us will be down with chest fever in a couple of days he said shivering i wouldnt be surprised if we got sleet id sooner fight the gradi than the weather any day van said against the gradi you can hit back glumly gerin nodded adiatunnus called fox where are you the now with the murk so thick and all im liable to fall in a puddle and drown myself or ever i find you here gerin answered through the hiss of the rain he spoke again a moment later to guide the trokm chieftain to the blanket under which he huddled adiatunnus sat down beside him with a series of soft splashes lord prince can we go on inand againstthis the woodsrunner asked i aim to try gerin answered but whats the use adiatunnus wailed if we go on well drown for fair unless youre after reckoning death from sinking in the muck a different thing nor drowning theres a question over which i suspect the philosophers have never vexed themselves gerin said thereby amusing himself but not the trokm he went on and what if we give up and the sun comes out before noon tomorrow this is a bad storm aye but not so bad as all that that hed been saying just the opposite to van a little while before fazed him not at all he wanted to keep adiatunnus spirits as high as he could that proved not to be very high with a sigh the chieftain said one way or another theyll overmaster us if they canna be doing it by force of arms that goddess and the rest will manage were better for having you here fox but is better good enough i doubt it that i do gerin fell back to the last ditch do you remember your oath och that i do adiatunnus sighed again while you go on lord prince ill go with you indeed and i will so i swore but whether i think twill do any goodtheres another story he splashed away leaving gerin without any good reply spurred largely by the foxs shouts and curses the elabonians and trokmoi did fare west again after dark gave way to a grudging halfhearted morning twilight riding straight into the teeth of the rain only made things worse so did the miserable breakfasts the troopers choked down the slow pace the mud forced and the outofseason cold of the rain toward midmorning little bits of ice began to sting the soldiers faces not so bad as all that you say adiatunnus shouted through the slush after his chariot plowed forward to come up level with gerins again the fox found none of his usual sharp comebacks a little later the army came up to a peasant village the serfs were frantic the crops will die in the fields they screamed as if gerin could do something about that well starve come winter if we dont drown firstor freeze to death ice in summer everything will be all right gerin said he wondered if even the most naive serf would believe him as he and his men slogged on he looked back enviously at the thatchroofed huts in which the peasants huddled they would undoubtedly keep drier than his army had the village been large rather than small he would have been tempted to turn the serfs out of their homes and appropriate the shelters for his men he was glad he didnt have to worry about that the farther west he and his troopers went the worse the weather got somewhere the gradi were waiting he hoped they were as wet and miserable as his own men duren said at this rate we could drive straight into the orynian ocean and wed never know it i dont see how we could get any wetter than we are now oceans taste of salt lad van said ive been on em and in em so i know past that though youre right i keep expecting to see fish swim by me havent yet so maybe this is still land whatever it was it was dreadful going some small streams had climbed out of their banks their water pouring in brown sheets across fields already sodden from the downpour as had that first lot across which the army had come serfs huddled in their villages looking out with glum astonishment on the ruin of the years crops gerin shuddered to think what winter would be like the peasants were liable to end up eating grass and bark and one another uprisings started after years like this among men who had nothing left to lose toward evening or so the fox thought by then he seemed to have been traveling forever the army did come across some gradi a double handful of the invaders were trudging or rather squelching across a field oiledleather rain capes over their heads there they are gerin shouted the men whose gods are making this campaign so horrid what do you say we pay those gods back for the grief theyve given us afterwards he didnt know whether to be glad or sorry hed put it that way the gradi spying his forces coming out of the rain at about the same time as he saw them started running clumsily toward some trees bordering the edge of the field the ground was mucky but not quite so impossible as some hed been through that meant chariots could outdistance men afoot his troopers cut the gradi off from escape then jumped down and slaughtered them one after another the water standing in the field was puddled here and there with red till the rain eventually diluted it and washed it away the fight itself wasnt what disturbed gerin but the savage glee both elabonians and trokmoi had taken in massacring the gradi gave him pause even thoughand perhaps especially becausehed encouraged them to do just that putting the best face he could on it he told adiatunnus thereyou see every time we come on them we beat them truth that adiatunnus said the warriors we can beat them sure and we can he didnt sound happy about it continuing and what good does that do us i ask you when the gods and goddesses are all after pissing out of the heavens down onto us what good does killing men do if we hadnt shown we could do that the gradi gods and goddesses wouldnt have joined the fight against us gerin said are you saying thatd be better now or worse adiatunnus asked and splashed off before the fox could reply the ghosts did not trouble the army that night not with the fallen gradi nearby to give them their boon of blood but rain and sleet kept pelting down which made the encampment as wretched as it had been the night before gerin wondered if voldar would appear to him when he slept if he slept wet and cold as he was but he remembered nothing after finally dropping off dawn was the same misnomer it had been since the storm began the fox got the army moving more by refusing to believe it would not move than any other way exhausted dripping men hitched exhausted dripping horses to chariots and did their best to keep moving west against the gradi gerin would have relished a big fight that day it would have been a focus for the anger that filled his men but how could you fight back against a gray sky that kept pouring rain and ice on your head you couldnt which was precisely the problem you wont make em go tomorrow van said as they slowly slogged on damn me to the five hells if i know how you made em go today theyre more afraid of me than of the gradi gods and goddesses right now the fox said they know what i can do and they still arent sure about them but by the next day it wasnt just streams out of their banks it was rivers and rain and sleet turned to hail and then to snow gerin shook a fist at the heavens wishing he had a bow that could reach beyond them wishing was futile as usual shivering teeth chattering he gave in we go back he said vii back on the eastern side of the venien river in territory adiatunnus controlled the weather was cool and rainy no one there seemed willing to believe the tales the returning warriors told of what they had endured trying to penetrate to the heart of the gradi power only thing i can think of gerin said standing close to the fire roaring in the hearth at adiatunnus great hall is that voldar and the rest dont hold full sway this far east not yet anyhow adiatunnus long face grew even more dolorous than it had been of late when he heard the fox name the gradi goddess gerin didnt care defiance burned like fever in him maybe it was making him delirious as fever sometimes did he didnt care about that either he wanted to hit back at the gradi any way he could and at their deities too how will you keep em from stretching their sway though adiatunnus demanded he too stood close by the fire as if he couldnt get warm enough the fox understood that for he felt the same way youre nobbut a man lord prince and a man who fights a godor even a goddesshe loses afore he begins of course he does gerin answered if hes stupid enough to make the fight straight on gods are stronger than men and they see farther than men too that doesnt mean theyre smarter than men though and how smart dyou need to be to step on a cockroach now adiatunnus returned thats what you are to the gods fox lord gerin the bug prince of cockroaches no doubt gerin said annoying adiatunnus by refusing to be annoyed himself but if i can get other gods angry at the ones the gradi follow and if i can steer them in the right direction listening to himself he could gauge how desperate he was playing with viperseven the ones van had describedwas a safer business than getting involved with the gods but if he didnt get divine aid of his own the gradi and their grim deities would swallow up the whole of the northlands he felt it in his bones and which gods will you summon now adiatunnus sounded both anxious and worried our own now they willna face the ones the gradi follow so weve seen to our sorrow is it any different with your elabonian powers i dont know gerin said that wasnt all he didnt know he was wondering if he could make father dyaus pay any real attention to the affairs of the material world at all the head of the elabonian pantheon had swallowed up the savor of any number of fatwrapped thighbones over the years could he now give value for value gerin had taken his power for granted till he saw how voldar supported the gradi ever since and especially since the storm hed wondered and worried i dont know isnt much to rest the hopes o the land on adiatunnus said if i thought you were wrong i would say so gerin answered as a matter of fact i dont intend to summon an elabonian god to deal with the goddess and the gods the gradi follow theres a foreign god with whom ive dealt before he stopped adiatunnus noticed him stopping tell me more the trokm urged what foreign spirit is it now what powers has he got mavrix is the sithonian god of wine and poetry and fertility and beauty the fox answered along with biton hes also the god who drove the monsters back underground after the earthquake a mighty god indeed adiatunnus said looking impressed i was talking with one of those monsters that i was figuring ways to smash you to powder fox when he softly and silently vanished away leaving nobbut the rank smell of him behind to show hed been no dream so diviciacus told me gerin said that was when you swore vassalage to me the first time adiatunnus nodded not a bit abashed hed been frightened into swearing submission then just as he had now because of the gradi if the danger went away he was liable to try to reclaim his freedom of action once more as he had a decade earlier what the fox didnt tell him was that he faced the prospect of summoning mavrix to his aid with the same enthusiasm he would have given the notion of having an arrowhead cut out of his shoulder both were painful necessities with the emphasis on painful mavrix and he had never got on well he hadnt persuaded the sithonian god to get rid of the monsters so much as hed tricked him into doing it mavrix would just as soon have got rid of him insteadmaybe sooner hed survived mavrix once hed tricked him once could he do it again hed said a man could be more clever than a god now he was going to have his chance to prove it if he could adiatunnus found another interesting question to ask is your sithonian god truly strong enough to beat back that goddess he wouldnt name voldar shes no mere monster monster though she seems i dont know that either gerin told him all i can do is try to find out he held up a hand and i know what your next question is going to be what will we do if mavrix turns out not to be strong enough he didnt answer the question he made a production out of not answering it finally adiatunnus prodded him well what will we do then jump off a cliff i suppose the fox said i havent got any better ideas right now have you to his surprise the trokm chieftain spoke up asking will you be taking all your southrons back to your own holding the now i hadnt thought about doing anything else with them gerin admitted i didnt think youd want them on your landthey are elabonians after alland i didnt think youd want to keep feeding them any longer than you had to why am i wrong adiatunnus hesitated but at last looking shamefaced said i wouldnt mind your leaving a couple of hundred behind for the sake of watching the line of the venien and fighting alongside us should the gradi be after trying to force it indeed i ask that fox as your vassal i do you mean it gerin said in slow wonder his expression unhappier than ever adiatunnus nodded the fox scratched his head why after spending so many years trying to kill every elabonian you could find because if its us by our lonesome and the gradi coming over the river and all well lose adiatunnus answered bleakly summatll go wrong same as it always does when the shindys twixt us and the gradi you southrons though you can stand up to em with my own eyes i saw it and so gerin slapped him on the shoulder for that ill leave men behind a lord protects his vassals or else he doesnt stay their lord longor deserve to would it suit you if i left widin simrins son to command my men were all your men now foxhowever little we like it adiatunnus said with a wry grin aye widin pleases to lead the elabonians i know his worthi should the trouble hes given me but will he follow my lead when its a matter of southrons and trokmoi together without me here gerin rubbed his chin that seems fair therell be more of your men here than mine he wondered if adiatunnus really wanted him to leave a good chunk of his army behind so the woodsrunners could fall on it he didnt believe that though not after their aborted campaign against the gradi any man who feared him more than voldar was a fool and adiatunnus didnt qualify there the trokm said i hope your foreign god knows too little of these gradi to be in fear of em mavrix was or could be a great coward the fox didnt tell that to adiatunnus there it is gerin breathed a great sigh of relief fox keep still stood the land around it hadnt been disturbed since the last gradi raid he thought he would have heard of any catastrophe as he traveled through his own holding but you could never be sure sometimes the only way you found news was by stumbling over it the lookout in the watchtower was alert gerin heard thin in the distance the horn call he blew to alert the garrison to the approach of the army armed men popped up on the palisade with commendable speed ride out ahead the fox said tapping duren on the shoulder well let them know we came through in one piece hed hoped to be coming back in triumph that hadnt happened hed feared coming back in defeat perhaps with a force of fierce gradi in pursuit that hadnt happened either had he won then or had he lost if he didnt know himself how was he supposed to tell anybody else someone up on the wall shouted its the fox the warriors cheered they didnt know what hed done any more than he knew what had gone on here as he had been after the earthquake that toppled bitons shrine he was on the outermost ripple of spreading news all well lord prince rihwin the fox called down to him all wellenough gerin answered and you and the keep and the holding how has the weather been you go off to war and you ask about the weather rihwin demanded when gerin only nodded the southern noble whod chosen to come to the northlands spread his hands in confusion at last pierced by his overlords stare he answered weathers not been bad on the cool side and more rain than i remember most summers but not bad why how was the weather farther west well lets seehow do i put it gerin mused if it werent for the sleets getting me prepared i would have liked the hail even less than i did that drew all the incredulous comments hed thought it would he waved impatiently let down the drawbridge and well tell you what went on the drawbridge lowered duren drove the chariot into the keep the rest of the force followed questions rained down on them did we beat the gradi did the gradi beat us is adiatunnus ally or traitor will we go back out on campaign again this season gerin answered abstractedly for selatre was waiting for him in the courtyard with their children seeing her and them reminded gerin he had indeed come home seeing her also reminded him shed been the intimate of a god even if biton was in many ways mavrixs opposite he wanted to talk with her before summoningor trying to summon you never could tell with godsthe sithonian deity before he could talk with his wife though he had to keep on answering questions and to deal with what seemed like everything that had happened at fox keep while he was away on campaign not for the first time he wondered how anything important ever got done when people had to wade through so many trivia first at last those whod stayed behind stopped asking questions at least of him hed settled arguments handed down judgments put off handing down others till he found out more confirmed almost everything rihwin and selatre had done in his name while he was gone and somewhere along the way acquired a couple of juicy beef ribs and a jack of ale he ate gratefully having your mouth full was a good excuse for not saying anything for a while when he finally did get the chance to speak of what he intended to do selatre nodded gravely a risky course but one i think we have to take if the danger from the gradi and their gods is as great as you say was her verdict exactly what i thought the fox said which was pleasing but not surprising over the past eleven years hed come to see that his mind and selatres worked in ways very much alikeand ways that as time went on grew more alike as they went on living and planning together rihwin the fox was all excitement a chance to work with gods he burbled a chance to match wits with the immortals to manipulate forces far stronger than we even dream of being to get killed in nasty ways or have other unpleasant things happen to us gerin finished for him or dont you remember why you cant work magic any more you were trying to manipulate mavrix then too as i recall rihwin had the integrity to look embarrassed all hed donea small thing reallywas ask mavrix to turn some wine that had soured into vinegar back into something worth drinking once more but the sithonian god already piqued at gerin for reasons of his own had not only not fixed the wine but had robbed rihwin of his sorcerous talent to keep from being bothered by him any more in the future if you went through rapids in a canoe and came out the other side alive and unhurt you hadnt manipulated them youd just survived you forgot the difference at your peril why should mavrix concern himself with voldar and the other gradi gods selatre asked what are they doing that hell particularly loathe for one thing theyre making the part of the northlands the gradi have seized as cold and bleak as the gradi homeland gerin answered glad to marshal arguments for his wife so hed have them ready when he had to give them to the god for another theyll kill or torment those who dont bow down to them sithonians and their gods are fond of freedom one of the things they dont like about us elabonians is that we give our rulers too loose a rein voldar doesnt sound as if she likes the idea of wine rihwin remarked yes i think youre right about that gerin said it would be more useful though if we could get wine in the northlands these days the winters are too hard to let the vines live even now if the gradi and their gods settle down to stay even the summers will be too cold he shivered remembering the unnatural freezing storm through which hed tried to lead his army rihwins mobile features assumed a comically exaggerated expression of longing how i miss the sweet grape he cried sighing long and deep like a minstrel with a song of unrequited love you miss finding a great deal of trouble because you miss the sweet grape selatre pointed out now rihwin looked indignant an expression perhaps not altogether assumed my lady he said with a low bow i regret to have to offer the opinion that your judgments have been clouded by overlong association with that lout there he pointed to his fellow fox heh gerin said shes right rihwin and you know it bloody well oh you can drink yourself stupid with ale as easily as you can with wine but you never got baivers dander up at you whenever you touch wine you seem to bump up against mavrix and when you bump up against the lord of the sweet grape horrible things happen they arent always horrible rihwin insisted without mavrix we might never have been rid of the monsters true gerin admitted but getting rid of them wasnt your doing and the odds were all too good wed end up getting rid of ourselves instead he paused and speaking of monsters how have geroge and tharma been except for eating as much apiece as any three people i could name theyve been fine rihwin answered and selatre nodded agreement if your vassals and your serfs gave as little trouble your holding would be easier to run back to mavrix selatre said firmly even more than gerin she had a knack for holding to the essential aye back to mavrix rihwin said how lord prince do you purpose summoning him without wine books grain seed fruitsa naked peasant girl if thats what it takes gerin replied ill aim at his aspects as patron of the arts and fertility god not the ones that pertain to wine he shrugged wine would probably be a stronger summons but we do what we can with what we have he took that for granted hed been making do improvising ever since he became baron of fox keep he knew he couldnt keep juggling forever but he hadnt dropped too many important things not yet anyhow rihwin pursed his lips and looked thoughtful mavrix hadnt robbed him of his magical knowledge merely the ability to use it you may well encounter success by this means he said it may even be that the aspect of mavrix you summon thus will be less flighty by nature than that which has to do with the grape or of course it may not the last sentence and the shrug with which he accompanied it said hed been associating with gerin for a long time too when will you summon the god selatre asked as soon as may be gerin told her the gradi and their gods are pushing hard if we dont do something to push them back soon i worry about what theyand voldarwill do to us next surely your blow against them gained something rihwin said a little no doubt gerin said a fortress and a few villages cleared of thembut we couldnt keep those and when we tried to press on the storms i have to think their deities raised stopped us coldliterally much as i wish i could i cant claim a victory there and so you shall bring to bear the power of the god rihwin declared so i shall gerin agreed the next intriguing question is whether ill bring it to bear against the gradi or against me had the world wagged exactly as the fox wanted he would have undertaken the conjuration that afternoon but more than the minutiae of running his holding made him wait for a couple of days much as he liked to deal with problems by attacking them headon he also knew that attacking them without full understanding was liable to be worse than ignoring them altogether and so he spent most of those next two days closeted in the library above the great hall reading every scrap about mavrix he had in his bookhoard he had less than he would have wanted that was true of his store on every subject where he had any scrolls or codices at all books were too rare and precious for any man even with an insatiable itch to know and the resources first of a barony and then of a principality behind him to have as many as he would have liked in her time at fox keep selatre had made the library as much her domain as it was his she had once enjoyed a knowledge of a different sort from that contained in books knowledge that came to her direct from biton since shed lost that shed made up for it in every other way she could she helped gerin in his studies finding even the most obscure mentions of mavrix and passing them to him the more he read the more he hoped the sithonian gods hatred of ugliness was one of his most salient characteristics that had been one of the hooks the fox had used to get mavrix to drive the monsters back into their dark caverns but the more he read the more he worried too mavrix was among the flightiest of gods he would do whatever he did and then go off and do something else altogether one thing voldar seemed to have was implacable purpose gerin rolled up the last scroll i dont know if this is going to work he told selatre but then i dont know what choice i have either a man will pick a bad course when all the others look worse it will be all right selatre said he shrugged by way of reply she didnt know that and had no rational basis for believing it neither did he after a moment though he admitted to himself that hearing it from her made him feel better as was his way gerin carefully assembled everything he thought he would need and everything he thought he might need before he tried to summon mavrix he sent rihwin to the peasant village to bring back a girl who would be enticing enough naked to tempt the fertility god if that proved necessary rihwins experience with the peasant women was wider than his own moreover by having his friend pick the girl he made sure he would not have selatre asking how he knew what she looked like without clothes though the woman whose name was fulda wore a long woaddyed linen tunic when rihwin led her up to the keep gerin had to admit she did look likely to shape well in the role if required by the halfamused halftart sniff selatre let out she thought the same the little shack where gerin tried magic when he got up the nerve to try magic was set well away from castle fox it was also set well away from the palisade the stables and everything else in fox keep if something went wrongand gerins conjurations like those of any halftrained mage had a way of going wronghe wanted the destruction to be as limited as possible when he rihwin selatre and fulda went out to the shack the rest of the people packing fox keep made a point of keeping their distance and of not looking at the ramshackle building either nothing had gone too hideously wrong over the years but everyone got the idea that meddling with gerin while he worked at his magicor for that matter meddling with him when he worked at anythingwas less than a good idea he began to chant from the sithonian epic of lekapenos hed had the verses literally beaten into him by his teachers and so did not need the scroll he held to be sure he had the words right he held it nonetheless to remind mavrix of another reason he was being summoned on a rickety table he set out wheat not barley mavrix had nothing but scorn for baivers ripe and candied fruit and several eggs from the castle henhouse do you want me to strip off now lord prince fulda asked reaching up to the neck of her tunic lets wait and see if we can bring the god here some other way first gerin answered to rihwins evident disappointment one of selatres eyebrows rose for a moment gerin didnt know exactly what that meant he didnt much want to find out either he used his rusty sithonian for as much of the invocation as he could wanting to make mavrix feel as much at home as he could in the northlands despite repeated beseechings though the god declined to appear gerin wondered if that wasnt just as well but went on anyhow fulda selatre said and nodded the peasant woman pulled the tunic off over her head one glance told gerin she was as lushly made as hed guessed past that one glance he didnt look at her if he made a mistake with his invocation whether her body was beautiful or not wouldnt matter rihwins eyes lit up gerin suspected he would try to see fulda naked under other circumstances as soon as he could that thought appeared in his mind but vanished a moment later mavrix still showed no sign of coming forth gerin wondered if the sithonian god now refused to have anything to do with him at all he also wondered whether he should have brought a pretty boy into the shack instead of fulda mavrixs tastes sometimes veered in that direction stubbornly he kept on working as many variants of the spell as he could imagine a man without his perseveranceor a man in less desperate straitswould have quit a long time before the fox realized he wouldnt be able to go on much longer either not without making an error that would at least invalidate everything hed already done and at most he didnt want to think about all the unpleasant things that might happen then as he was about to give up the inside of the shack seemed all at once to grow vastly larger though its exterior dimensions had not changed in any way gerin had felt that happen before the hair prickled up on the back of his neck here was mavrix so now he had what hed thought he wanted how much would he regret seeing his prayers granted you are the noisiest little man the god said his deep honeyed voice sounding somewhere in the middle of gerins head rather than in his ears the fox was not sure whether mavrix spoke sithonian or elabonian he took meaning directly at a level more basic than words gerin spoke sithonian in the hope of making mavrix better inclined toward him i thank you lord of the sweet grape lord of fertility lord of wisdom and wit for deigning to hear me deigning to hear you mavrixs eyebrows rose almost all the way to his hairline his handsome features had they been human would have been impossibly mobile but he was not human even if his rosebud mouth would have made any boylover quiver with lascivious delight his eyes were all black fathomless deep beyond deep warning of power and terror far beyond any to which a mere human could aspire deigning to hear you he repeated you were doing your best to deafen me not so i would not have troubled you were i not deep in trouble myself gerin answered which was no less than truth even as he spoke he wondered whether his proposed cure was worse than the gradi disease and why should i care a fig for your troubles lord gerin prince of the north in mavrixs mouth the foxs titles were poisonously sweet why should i not rejoice in fact because i did not make them for one gerin answered and for another because the gods who did make them now purpose turning the northlands into a cold and dreary country where next to nothing will grow and where for months at a time all will be covered by ice and snow hearing his own accidental rhyme he wished hed thought to include metre as well mavrix appreciated such artful touches that soundsdistasteful the sithonian god admitted but i ask you again why should i care these barbarous northlands are scarcely part of my normal purview you know you elabonians are quite bad enough the fringes on his fawnskin tunic fluttered as he shivered to show what he thought of elabonians and the woodsrunning savages now infesting the land worse if something dreadful befalls the lot of youso what the gradi are worse and so are their gods gerin said stubborn still you may not think much of dyaus and i have no notion what you think of taranis teutatis and esus but you have your place and they have theirs and you dont try to drive them off nor they you he didnt mention baivers some of whose aspects were close enough to those of mavrix to make them compete with rather than complementing each other he especially didnt mention biton whose quarrel with mavrix had led to banishing the monsters infesting the northlands back to their gloomy caverns if the god remembered those quarrels he would remind gerin of them if he didnt gerin wasnt going to remind him mavrix sniffed i have never impinged upon these gradi gods nor they on me for all i know you lie for your own reasons humans are like that he sniffed again in fine contempt but he wasnt so smart as he thought he was because while suspicious of gerins arguments he didnt notice the logical flaws and omissions in them if you were sly enough and quick enough and lucky enough you could guide him like a man leading a barely broken horse youd never be sure hed go in the direction you wanted him to take but if you made all the other choices look worse you had a chance mavrix though was no horse but a god with a gods abilities and strength gerin said if you doubt me look into my mind see for yourself my dealings with the gradi and with voldar with your divine wisdom you will know whether i lie or not i do not need your permission little man i can do that any time i choose mavrix said a moment later he added i do think better of youa bit betterfor the invitation and then all at once gerins world turned inside out it did not feel as if mavrix entered his mind but more as if his mind suddenly became a small fragment of the gods hed expected mavrix to grub for facts like a man opening drawers in a cabinet instead the power of the gods intellect simply poured through him as if he were air and mavrix rain the search was far quicker far more thorough and far more awesome than hed expected when mavrix spoke to him again it was almost as if he listened to almost as if he were a part of the gods thoughts which echoed all through his own mind what you say is true these gradi are indeed nasty and vicious men and their gods nasty and vicious deities that they should infest their own homeland is quite bad enough that they should seek to spread to this relatively temperate and tolerant district intolerable and being intolerable it shall not be tolerated i commence mavrix set out on a journey across the plane the gods customarily inhabited a plane that impinged on the mundane world of men and crops and weather but was not really a part of it he had not released the foxs mind from its place if that was the right word as part of his own and so gerin willynilly accompanied him on his travels afterwards gerin was never quite sure how far to trust his sensory impressions eyes and ears and skin were not made to take in the essence of the divine plane nor was he really along in the flesh but only as a sort of fleabite or at most a wart on mavrixs psyche did the god truly drink his way through an ocean of wine did he really fornicate his way through if he did why on earthor not on earthwould fulda have drawn the least part of his notice even the dim partunderstanding of what might have just happened left the foxs sensorium spinning then the going got more difficult not harder gerin thought being unable at the moment to imagine anything harder than gerin felt mavrixs surprise discomfort and displeasure as if they were his own they were in fact his own and more than his own pettishly mavrix snapped i should never have let you entice me into this predicament the sithonian god did not take well to discomfort of any sort that being a negation of everything he stood for in the little mental cyst inside mavrix mind that remained his own gerin had all he could do to keep from bursting into laughter that would surely anger the god enticing mavrix was just what hed hoped to do and mavrix would have to endure more unpleasantness if he reversed his metaphysical route wouldnt he gerin wondered about that for all he knew mavrix could break free of where he was and be somewhere else without bothering to traverse the space in between and even if he couldnt do that the combination of overwhelming wine and even more overwhelming satiety might be plenty to counteract whatever lack of pleasure the god knew now and then without warning mavrix found himself in a place or a sort of a place gerin recognized from his dreams the chilly forest to which voldar had summoned him during his dream how bleak mavrix murmured moving along a track in it this is the domain of the gradi gods gerin thought not knowing whether mavrix was paying any attention to his small separate fragment of consciousness really the god replied as he came to a snowfilled clearing and here all the while i thought i was back in my native sithonia the grapes and olives are looking particularly fine this time of year arent they had gerin been there corporeally he would have turned red having mavrix flay him with sarcasm wasnt what hed had in mind when he summoned the god of course when you did summon a god what you got wasnt always what you had in mind for gods had minds of their own he tried to pitch his thoughts so they would carry to mavrix forming them as much like speech as he could voldar summoned me to this place in a dream a nightmare it must have been the sithonian god replied maybe he shuddered maybe he didnt gerins view of this plane shook back and forth mavrix went on why any selfrespecting deity would choose to inhabitor i might better say infestsuch a place when so many better are there for the taking must remain eternally beyond me we like it here had that actually been a voice it would have been deep and rumbling like an outsized version of vans gerin didnt truly hear it it was more as if an earthquake with meanings attached had shaken the center of his mind a great form reared up out of the snow gerin sensed it as being half man half great white bear now the one predominating now the other this ugly thing cannot possibly be voldar mavrix said with a distinct sniff in his voice sniff or not gerin thought he was right the gradi god whether in human or ursine form was emphatically male mavrix directed his attention toward the god rather than the fox who or what are you ugly thing given a choice gerin would not have antagonized anything as ferocious looking as that white looming apparition he was not given a choice that was one of the risks you took in dealing with gods the halfbear halfman shape roared and bellowed out its reply i am lavtrig mighty hunter who are you little mincing puling wretch to come spreading the stink of perfume over this the home of the grand gods grand compared to what mavrix said he waved his left hand the one in which he carried his thyrsus an ivytipped wand more powerful than any spear would have been in the hands of a mere man stand aside before i rid the plane of the gods of an odious presence i have no quarrel with underlings not unless they seek to trouble their betters since in your case anything this side of a horse turd would be an improvement i suggest you leave off the business of troubling altogether lavtrig roared with rage and rushed forward he had more claws and teeth and thews than gerin cared to contemplate the fox had hoped mavrix would fight the gradi gods he hadnt intended to get stuck absolutely helpless in the middle of such a fight mavrix didnt care what he intended wand notwithstanding the sithonian gods semblance was as nothing when measured against lavtrigs fearsome aspect but as gerin should have realized appearances among gods were apt to be even more deceiving than among mankind when lavtrigs hideous jaws closed they closed on nothingness but when mavrix tapped the gradi god with his thyrsus the howl of pain he evoked might have been heard in distant mabalal by the deities there if not by the men run along now noisy thing mavrix said if you force me to become truly vexed the barbarians who worship you will have to invent something else more hideous than themselves for you will be gone for good lavtrig bellowed again this time more with rage than with pain and tried to keep fighting he scratched he clawed he snappedall to no effect sighing mavrix lashed out with a sandalshod foot lavtrig spun through the airif the gods plane had airand crashed against a pine its burden of snow fell on him he writhed once or twice feebly but did not get up to resume the struggle mavrix let him lie and strode on could you really have destroyed him gerin asked oh are you still here the sithonian god said as if hed forgotten all about the fox a god can do anything he imagines he can do the answer did not strike gerin as altogether responsive but he could hardly have been in a worse position to demand more detail from mavrix the god he had summoned to his aid strode down a path through more snowcovered trees if mavrix was cold he did not show it once as if to amuse himself he pointed his thyrsus at one of the pines clumps of bright flowers sprang into being at the base of its trunk gerin wondered if they continued to exist after mavrix stopped paying attention to them goldeneyed wolves stared out of the woods at mavrix wolves as big as bears as big as horses divine wolves the primeval savage essence of wolf concentrated in their bodies as a cook might concentrate a sauce by boiling away all excess when gerin felt their terrible eyes on him he wanted to quail and run even though he knew he was not there in body wolves like that couldwouldgulp down his very soul mavrix pulled out a set of reed pipes and blew music such as had never been heard in the grim realm of the gradi gods not in all the ages since they shaped the place to their own satisfaction it was the music of summer and joy and love the music of wine and hot nights and desire had he been able to gerin would have wept with the sorrow of knowing that try as he might he would never be fully able to remember or reproduce what he heard and the wolves all at once utterly without warning they lost their ferocity and came rushing through the snow at mavrix not to rend him but to frisk at his heels like so many friendly puppies they yipped they leaped they played foolish games with one another they paired off and mated they did everything but guard the road as the gradi gods had plainly intended them to do amusement seeped from mavrixs mind to gerins perhaps we should throw cold water on some of them the sithonian god said plenty of cold water here oh i dont know gerin replied why not let them enjoy themselves i have the feeling this is the first time theyve ever been able to that is nothing less than the truth mavrix said and then i own that i responded to your summons with resentment but now i am glad i did these gradi gods need to be dealt with they have no notion of fun he spoke as the fox did when passing sentence on some particularly vicious robber gerin wondered if the sithonian god could instill levity into whatever voldar used for a heart if he could that would be a bigger miracle than any he had yet worked but mavrix had not yet won through to confront the chief goddess of the gradi when he stepped out into a clearing gerin wondered if voldar would await him there but it was not voldar it was not anything anthropomorphic at all but a whirling column of rain and mist and ice and snow stretching up as far as the eye could see from the middle of the column a voice spoke get you gone this is not your place get you gone at mavrixs feet the wolves whined and whimpered as if realizing theyd betrayed themselves with a stranger and were going to be made to regret it by the powers that were their proper masters mavrix however spoke lightly mockingly as was his way what have we here the divine washtub for this miserable place or is it but the chamber pot i am stribog the voice declared i say you shall not pass take your jests and japes somewhere we do not yet touch then await us there for one day rest assured we shall overwhelm it and quench them ahright the second time mavrix said cheerfully perhaps to gerin perhaps to stribog it is the chamber pot he moved out into the clearing stribog did not attack as lavtrig had instead the gradi god hurled all the vile weather he had inside him straight at mavrix gerins soul felt frozen here he saw was the god who had raised the summer storms against him and his army those though had been storms of the world even if divinely raised this was the very stuff of the gods used by one to fight another and mavrix noticed this onslaught where he had been impervious to lavtrigs the chill and wet stribog raised struck at his spirit he grunted and said now seesomeones gone and spilled it well just have to set it to rights once more the wolves fled back to their gloomy haunts with mavrixs attention not on them they forgot the dimmest notion of happiness too they were soaked to their metaphysical skins stribog had indeed poured a bucket of cold water on them a bucket big as the world mavrix lashed out with his wand as he had against lavtrig it must have hurt too for stribog bellowed in pain and rage but the gradi god was a more diffuse entity than lavtrig he had no central place to strike that would do him lasting damage and his rain and ice his winds and lightnings hurt mavrix too the sithonian gods anguish washed through gerin who knew that had his spirit been there alone he would swiftly have been destroyed when mavrix tried to go forward against the storm that was stribog he found himself unable the gradi gods laughter boomed like thunder here you will perish you who try to trouble gradihome he cried here you will drown here you will rest forevermore oh be still arrogant windbag mavrix said irritably and for a moment stribog was still the storm silent even as it resumed mavrix went on not just an arrogant windbag but a stupid one too if you water a fertility god you promote growth gerins mind exclaimed there you see mavrix told him you have more wit to you than this blowhard not much of a compliment i fear but you may have it if you want it and with that he began to grow to soak up all the stormstuff stribog flung at him and make it his own instead of letting it remain a weapon belonging to the gradi god the pain he felt at stribogs attacks vanished or rather was transmuted into a satisfaction somewhere between that of a good meal and that which follows the act of love stribog realized too late that he was no longer doing mavrix any harm he boomed like thunder again but this time in alarm where before he had reached as high as the eyeor whatever sense passed for vision herecould see and mavrix seemed small beside him their relative sizes reversed with startling speed now from his place in the sithonian gods consciousness gerin peered down on a small furious futile whirlwind that churned up the snow around mavrixs ankles mavrix stooped and seized the whirlwind he flung it away whither the fox had no idea maybe mavrix didnt either for he said i hope the alepot tempest lands among the kizzuwatnan gods or some others who properly appreciate heat he was without warning the apparent size he had been before his fight with stribog began he reached up and adjusted the wreath of grape leaves around his forehead to the proper jaunty angle the landscape of gradihome seemed undisturbed by the divine tempest that had lashed it gerin wished the land of the material world recovered from rain so readily onward mavrix said and onward they went but the sithonian god despite his triumph seemed wearier and less sure of himself than he had been if defeating lavtrig was like climbing a flight of stairs besting stribog had been more like climbing a mountain if the next challenge proved correspondingly harder still gerin did his best not to think about that for fear mavrix would sense it and be moved either to anger or to despair the god came to a clearing in the snowy woods gerin waited to see what sort of gradi god would confront mavrix there but the clearing seemed empty more snowcovered pines stood at the far edge of the open space perhaps a bowshot away perhaps a bit more well mavrix said brightly variety in the landscape after all who would have thought it he brought his pipes to his lips and began to play a cheerful tune as he strolled across the rolling ground had gerin had his normal physical eyes he would have blinked something strange had happened but he wasnt sure what the god came to a clearing in the snowy woods gerin waited to see what sort of gradi god would confront mavrix there but the clearing seemed empty more snowcovered pines stood at the far edge of the open space perhaps a bowshot away perhaps a bit more well mavrix said brightly variety in the landscape after all who would have thought it he brought his pipes to his lips and began to play a cheerful tune as he strolled across the rolling ground that sensation of needing to blink repeated itself in the foxs mind there was the clearing the same clearing when gerin realized that he recovered at least a part of what he and mavrix had just been through well mavrix said brightly variety in the landscape after all who would have thought it he brought his pipes to his lips before he could begin to play gerin said wait what do you mean wait the sithonian god demanded irritably i aim to celebrate coming across something different for a change and then mavrix as gerin had before him hesitated and went back over what had gone on have idone this before he asked now sounding hesitant rather than irritable ithink so gerin answered still far from sure himself i am in your debt little man mavrix said i wonder how many times i would have done that before i twigged to it myself i wonder if i would ever have twigged to it myself if i didnt have you riding along like a flea on my bum it would have been a beastly boring way to spend eternity i can tell you that gerin wondered if the only reason he hadnt been completely caught in the trap was its being set for gods not mere men he had spoken before of mankinds occasional advantages in dealing with vastly more powerful beings but hadnt expected his littleness to become one hed slipped through the spaces in a net intended to catch bigger fish in tones more cautious than mavrix usually used he asked who is out there in the clearing nothing answered i am nothing it said voice utterly without color or emotion trust these stupid gradi to worship nothing mavrix muttered why not nothing returned soon or late all fails in the end everything fails i am what is left i deserve worship for i am most powerful of all youre not even the most powerful god in your pantheon gerin jeered trying to ruffle that uncanny calm voldar rules the gradi not you for now nothing said imperturbably stand aside nothing or know nothingness mavrix said from caution he had swung back to anger wait gerin said again if finding a way to hurt stribog had been hard how could the sithonian god harm nothing hoping he was pitching his thoughts in such a way as to let mavrix but not nothing hear them he suggested dont fightdistract youre a fertility godyou can make all sorts of interesting somethings cant you mavrixs mirth filled him as strong sweet wine might have had he been there in the flesh somethings the god said and then changing the timbre of his thoughts so he addressed not the fox but the thingor the nothingin the clearing nothing aye the gradi god said polite but perfectly indifferent mavrix held out his hands he breathed on them and a flock of brightcolored singing birds appeared one after another do you see these he asked as he waved his hands and the birds began to fly around the clearing i see them nothing replied in a little while in a littlest while they will cease to be then they will be mine thats so mavrix agreed but theyre mine now and so is this he sent a deer bounding across the open space gerin hoped the wolves of gradihome wouldnt notice it and so are these flowers sprang up in the clearing made with a purpose now instead of merely for a game and so is this an amphora of wine appeared and so are these four preternaturally beautiful women and a like number of handsome and wellendowed men sprang into being they enjoyed the wine and then began to enjoy one another they had no more inhibitions than they did clothes gerin wondered if they were figments of the sithonian gods imagination or if mavrix had plucked them from some warmer more hospitable clime he didnt ask not wanting to bump the gods metaphysical elbow theyre all mine mavrix shouted theyre all doing things right there before you for now nothing said yes for now mavrix said and the things they do now will cause other things to be done and to be born and those will cause still others and the ripples that spread from those will eventually come to nothing nothing said but withperhaps the slightest hesitation as mavrixs creations cavorted in the clearing speaking in a sort of mental whisper mavrix said to gerin if its not distracted now it never will be i am going into the clearing if i end up here again and that space before us is emptywe are apt to be here indefinitely gerins small sensorium carried pickaback on the gods vastly larger one crossed the clearing in a hurry he could even look back as mavrix regained the path that led ever deeper into gradihome all at once the sithonian gods creations vanished as if they had never been that was petty of old nothing mavrix said a chuckle in his voice as it told us they would have been its sooner or later ah wellsome deities simply have no patience then mavrix suddenly seemed less sure of himself or do you think nothing will pursue me through this frigid wilderness if i had to guess id say no gerin answered the gradi gods seem to be testing you each in his own place lavtrig and stribog stayed behind once youd bested them i think nothing will too you had better be right mavrix said and if i have to test and best every single puerile godlet the gradi ownor the other way roundi shall grow quite testy myself fox bear that in mind oh i shall gerin assured him i shall mavrix was more powerful than he he knew that full well but he had seen the progression in the actions of the gradi gods where mavrix was uncertain about it did that prove him divinely clever if it did he was clever enough to know he shouldnt let himself get carried away by the idea he did not think mavrix had stepped up the pace but the next clearing appeared very quickly mavrix went out into it with almost defiant stride as if expecting nothing to sow confusion in his mind once more but the godor rather goddessstanding in the open space had a definite physical aspect gerin the fox the elabonian voldar said you have proved more troublesome than i reckoned on and your ally stronger her smile struck the fox as imperfectly inviting whether he is strong enough remains to be seen her aspect was not quite as gerin had seen her in the dream shed induced him to have she seemed partway toward the hag image with which shed so horrified adiatunnusnow and again by starts and flickers her hair would gray her skin wrinkle her teeth grow broken and crooked her breasts lose their eternally youthful firmness and sag downward against her chest and the top of her belly sometimes her whole body seemed squat slightly misshapenand sometimes not gerin had no idea what her true seeming was or if indeed she had but one true seeming mavrix spoke with some indignation well i like that a goddess greeting a mortal before a god but im not surprised not with what ive seen of manners here in gradihome go aheadignore me nothing tried that voldar said it failed that means i must deal with youand when i have youll wish youd been ignored but i spoke to the mortal first because without him you would not be hereand would not have caused so much damage to the lesser gods around me i greeted them in the spirit with which they greeted me mavrix replied is it my fault if their spirits could not bear up under the force of my greeting yes voldar said in the deadly cold voice gerin remembered from his dream you should have been driven from gradihome wailing or been swallowed by nothing for all eternity id be delighted to leave this cold ugly place the sithonian god said and i will in an instant once you vow youll make no more of the material world into as close a copy of it as you can engender god may not lie to god in such vows so it has been so it is so shall it be i could lie to you voldar said but i shall not gradihome in the world grows so it is so shall it be no mavrix said it shall not be there is too much cold and ugliness and sterility in the material world as it is now i shall not permit you to increase their grip on it you cannot stop it voldar said you have not the power for that nor have you the roots in the land of which you speak that would let you draw upon its strength as we even now are beginning to do it is not your land either mavrix said and if i have not the strength how do i come to stand before you now you come before me as i said before on account of the guile of the mortal whose consciousness you carry with you voldar answered and i should not be surprised if his cunning helped you pass and overcome my fellows well i like that mavrix drew himself up straight the picture of affronted dignity first speak to the mortal ahead of me then count him as more clever i shall take vengeance for the slight gerin felt rather like a mouse that had the misfortune to find itself in the middle of a clearing where a bear and a longtooth clashed whichever won might not even matter to him because they were liable to crush him without so much as knowing he was there and yet the fight did not begin at once voldar was plainly given pause because mavrix had managed to reach her and mavrix in turn seemed thoughtful at facing the goddess who lorded it over the formidable foes he had already beaten suddenly his voice grew sweet persuasive tempting why do we have to quarrel at all gradi goddess you can be pleasing to the eye when it suits you i sense as much why not lie with me in love once you know what proper pleasure is youll feel less attracted toward death and doom and ice he began to play on his pipes a tune a shepherd might have used to lure a goose girl to a secluded meadow on a warm summer evening but voldar was no goose girl and gradihome knew nothing of warmth you cannot seduce me from my purpose foreign god may your lust curdle and freeze may your ardor wither i am ardor mavrix said nothing else but and i kindle it in others i would try even in you to teach you somewhat of the ways of existence about which it would seem you now know nothing i told you i am not your receptacle voldars voice grew sharp leave gradihome now and you will suffer nothing further if you stay you will learn the consequences of your folly i am folly mavrix said in the same tone of voice he had used to declare himself ardor gerin thought he meant the one as much as the other ardor to his way of thinking certainly engendered folly maybe that was what the god had had in mind you are a fool that certainly voldar spoke as gerin might have while chiding a vassal for something stupid hed done very well if you will be a fool you will pay for it raising her great axe she advanced on mavrix all the sithonian tales of the fertility god named him an arrant coward the fox had seen some of that himself he more than half expected mavrix to run away from that determined menacing advance instead though mavrix jeered are you truly a battleaxe voldar or just after my spear that part of him leaped leaving voldar in no possible doubt of his meaning she snarled something gerin didnt understand which was probably just as well then she swung the axe with a stroke any of the warriors who worshiped her would have been proud to claim as his own gerin wondered what would have happened had that blow landed as she intended his best guess was that the sithonian pantheon would have wanted a new deity but the blow did not land mavrixs phallus was not all that had leaped he used his wand to bat the axehead aside the thyrsus looked as if it would break at such usage but looks when it came to gods and their implements were apt to be deceiving voldar evidently had been deceived she shouted in fury at finding herself thwarted there there mavrix said in syrupy soothing tones and reach out to pat hernot at all consolinglyon her bare backside gerin couldnt tell whether his arm had got long to let him do that or whether hed shifted his position in some way allowed to gods but not men and then returned in an instant to where he had been however hed done it it made voldar even angrier than she had been already her next cut with that axe would have left mavrix metaphorically spearless again he used the wand to turn aside the stroke though gerin perched there on the edge of his consciousness felt the effort that had required mavrix was not a god of war where voldar seemed to exist for no other purpose than conquest and subjugation are you going to be able to hold out against her he asked the sithonian god the question had immediate practical import for him if voldar beat mavrix would his own spirit be trapped here in gradihome he was hardpressed to imagine a gloomier fate well find out wont we mavrix answered not the most reassuring reply the fox could have got he quickly became convinced mavrix was overmatched the sithonian god was indeed no killer he sought to provoke voldar to infuriate her to drive her to distraction she by contrast was grimly intent on harming himon destroying him if she could the longer they struggled the more gerin grew concerned she could do exactly as she intended this was not a struggle of the same sort as mavrix had had with the other gradi gods it put the fox more in mind of some of the desperate fights hed had on the battlefield ferocious brawls with anything past the notion of bare survival forgotten voldar and mavrix hammered and pounded and cursed each other the curses landing as heavily and painfully as kicks and buffets when mavrix squeezed her voldar would for a moment weaken and lean toward him as if intending an embrace the struggle was in some ways a spectacularly violent attempt at a seduction but voldar never really came close to yielding however much gerin wished and hoped she would she had her own purposes which were not those of mavrix and when she gained the upper hand for the time being the fox felt mavrixs nature changing into something harder and colder than seemed fitting for the sithonian god voldar he realized was trying to bend mavrix to her will no less than he her to his those stretches came more and more often as the battle progressed gerin wondered if mavrix realized as much himself and if he should warn the god suddenly mavrix gave a great crynot of pain but of rejectionand broke away from voldar the disengagement was not like that between two struggling humans one instant he was locked in the fight with the gradi goddess the next he stood at the edge of the clearing in which she had awaited him no he said hoarsely you shall not make me into something you can rule he understood the stakes then i will not allow it i do not allow it if you stay here i shall voldar said this is gradihome and gradihome is mine she strode toward the sithonian fertility god implacable purpose on her face and in every line of her body mavrix broke and fled voldars harsh mocking laughter rang in his ears as he dashed away snow flying up under his sandalclad feet be careful gerin shouted in his metaphysical ear dont fall into nothings lair again mavrix swerved aside off the path the fierce wolves of the home of the gradi gods came coursing after him but fawned like friendly pups once more when they drew near so much of his power at least he still retained and then he was on the path again and running faster than ever i thank you for reminding me of the trap he said though i do not thank you for involving me in this misadventure in the first place i was trying to save what was mine gerin answered and ive failed he thought wondering if he could keep that from mavrix that means i have to try something else and i dont know what i am not rooted in your northern land well enough to be as effective as i might have been fighting for sithonia if the gradi gods were coming there which the power above all deities prevent mavrix said you would do better seeking out the powers in and under your own soil those who have most to lose if enslaved or expelled by voldar and her vicious crew he had been vicious himself neither stribog nor lavtrig cared to try conclusions with him a second time soon he was out of the realm of the gradi gods gerin meanwhile wondered which elabonian deities mavrix meant biton perhaps but anyone else he put the question to the god who carried his spirit no not that wretched farseeing twit mavrix said scornfully hell be useless to you here i guarantee it voldar would chew him up and spit him out while he was still looking every which way he and nothing might get on well though with luck theyd bore each other out of existence he sounded very sure of himself which alarmed gerin if biton was not the answer against the gradi gods who was who in the northlands can hope to stand against them the fox persisted ive told you everything i know and more than you deserve mavrix answered petulant now this is not my country i keep saying as much this is not my land i dont keep track of every fribbling stodgy godlet infesting it nor would i want to since you were foolish enough to choose to be born here i leave all that up to you but gerin began oh be still till you have flesh to make noise with mavrix said and gerin perforce was still the god went on here we are returned to this dank chilly unpleasant hovel you inhabit if only you knew the sunshine of sithonia the wine the sea not all gray and frigid like the nasty ocean splashing your soil but blue and bright and beautiful the gleam of polished marble and sandstone yellow as butter as gold but you do not poor deprived thing and maybe for the best for you might slay yourself in despair at your lack since you are trapped here i return you now to the really quite ordinary body from which i abstracted you all at once gerin was seeing with his own eyes hearing with his own ears moving his head his hands his legs there before him stood mavrix there too stood selatre and rihwin and fulda who remained lushly nude how long were we gone the fox asked as mavrix had said in his own flesh he could speak again gone selatre and rihwin spoke the word together youve been here all along gerins wife went on where did you go what did you do she turned to mavrix lord of the sweet grape are the gradi gods vanquished no mavrix said the simple denial brought a gasp of dismay from rihwin mavrix continued i did what i could it was not enough i can do no more and so i depart this unpleasant clime like mist under the sun he began to fade gerin had been with him and knew he had been beaten selatre and rihwin recognized he meant what he said but fulda like so many people gerin knew had unquestioned and unquestioning faith in those above her hearing a god admit failure was more than she could bear she cried do you leave us with nothing then mavrix resolidified you could not tell which way his uniformly dark eyes were turned but by the direction in which his head pointed he was probably looking at her so you want me to leave you with something do you he said and laughed very well i shall fulda gasped at first gerin thought it was surprise but after a moment he realized it was something else entirely fuldas eyes closed her back arched her nipples went stiff and erect she gasped again and shuddered all over there mavrix said sounding smug and selfsatisfied or possibly just satisfied despite what hed done on the plane of the gods he hadnt disdained fulda after all on the contrary for he continued ive left you something in three fourths of a year youll find out exactly what and that i have no doubt will prove interesting for all concerned but now he faded again this time till he disappeared the shack in which gerin attempted to perpetrate magic abruptly seemed to resume its normal cramped dimensions which convinced the fox mavrix was truly gone fulda opened her eyes but she wasnt looking at the inside of the shack oh she said shivering once more then she too realized mavrix had vanished oh she repeated this time in disappointment she reached for her tunic and put it back on selatre being there gerin made a point of not watching her he looked instead to his wife and to rihwin they plainly shared his thought the god didnt rihwin said the god wouldnt selatre echoed didnt what fulda asked wouldnt what unless were all daft youre going to have a baby gerin told her quite a baby she yelped no she hadnt understood the fox sighed one more thing to worry about he said viii selatre shook her head i fear the lord of the sweet grape was right in what he told you she said to gerin biton is principally concerned with the valley that holds his shrine and the enchanted wood beyond it the chief reason he involved himself in the broader affairs of the northlands when the monsters burst out is that they sprang from his valley or from below it oh a pestilence the fox said youre supposed to tell me what i want to hear not what you think is true selatre stared at him then warily she started to laugh you are joking arent you only when he nodded did she relax a little when you start telling me things for no better reason than you think theyll please me gerin stopped i dont need to go on with that because you know better the gods be praised the phrase tasted sour in his mouth the gods who are awake and listening to me anyhow i dont know whether mavrix is listening to you but no one could doubt hes awake selatre answered i went into the village yesterday fuldas courses should have started they havent she says she hasnt lain with any of the men there since her last flowing i believe her that leaves divine ecstasy gerin suggested not quite so sardonically as he would have liked but selatres face was serious as she nodded just so we were talking about that it was i think different from the ecstasy biton gave me but then he and mavrix are very different gods and when next spring comes well have a little demigod on our hands gerin said if of course the gradi havent overrun us by then if they have theyll be the ones worrying about a little demigod it would almost be worthwhile losing just to find out what they do about that almost i say we still dont know how to keep that from happening selatre said dont remind me gerin told her for all i can tell what mavrix was really saying was to give up because none of the gods on or under the ground of the northlands whom i know are likely to have the power to stop the gradi gods or even to care about doing it no i dont think so selatre said youre letting yourself be too gloomy after all the trouble youve had with mavrix if you had no hope hed come right out and say as much hed probably gloat about it as a matter of fact gerin chewed on that and found himself nodding yes thats just what hed do he doesnt love the gradi gods or what they stand for so he was willing to go against them but he doesnt love me either ive seen that over the years and no mistake about it downstairs in the great hall a hideous commotion erupted selatre raised an eyebrow ive heard a lot of strange noises down there but hardly anything like this whos killing whom and why are they torturing them before they finally let them die that was an exaggeration of the quality of the racket but not a large one ill go down there and tell whoever it is to stuff a pair of drawers in his gob gerin said if i have to ill smash a couple of heads together that generally shuts people up down he went left hand on the hilt of his sword he didnt know what hed find when he got downstairsan argument just this side of a brawl was his best guess what he did discover was in a way more reassuring in another way more alarming van and geroge and tharma sitting around beside an enormous jar of ale that had probably been full when they started it and now was certainly almost empty what gerin and selatre and probably everyone else in fox keep had mistaken for strife was the outlander and the two monsters trying to sing the result sounded more nearly catastrophic than musical but that was not what made gerin snap what do you think youre doing at van oh hullo fox van said with a broad foolish grin trying to see if i can hold more ale than these walking fur rugs here i thought so when i started but im not so sure any more lord prince geroge rumbled he grinned too displaying his formidable teeth the fox didnt doubt the grin was meant as friendly but it raised his hackles all the same geroge was at least as strong as van he usually behaved himself very well but who could say how hed act with a bellyful of ale sloshing around inside him more to the point if he decided to behave monstrously how much damage would he do before he could be controlled or killed like everyone else at fox keep he and tharma drank ale every day with their meals and when they were thirsty but they didnt drinkor they hadnt drunkfor the sake of getting drunk not till now they hadnt it was not a habit gerin wanted to encourage in them he glared at van wishing his friend had shown better sense as usual for such wishes this one came too late with what he thought was commendable restraint he said looking into the bottom of a jack of ale is one thing looking into the bottom of a jar of ale is something else again youll be clearer on the difference come morning he added with malice aforethought likely tell youre right van scowled and likely tell ill have fand screeching at me too making me wish my poor aching head would fall off he held his poor not yet aching head in his hands if the prospect of hangovers daunted geroge and tharma they didnt show it oh i bless lord baivers yes i do for making me feel so fine geroge howled he spilled what he probably intended as a little ale on the table for a libation he wasnt moving so smoothly as he had been though and ended up emptying most of his jack of ale he didnt care about the mess he cared about the missing ale he got up went over to the jar and dug with the dipper he didnt get much back for his effort peering down into the jar he howled again this time in desolation when words came back to him he said its all gone how did that happen van laughed then morose though hed been a moment before so did tharma she laughed so hard she fell off her bench and rolled in the rushes before slowly climbing back to her feet and gerin said do you think you might have had something to do with it who me geroges narrow little eyes went as wide as they could when that idea worked its way into his fuddled wits it plainly hadnt occurred to him well maybe i did he laughed too in big snarling chuckles that would have sent any sensible watchdog running for its life tail between its legs like tharma he was turning out to be a goodnatured drunk for which gerin thanked not only baivers but every god he could think of this side of voldar a nasty sullen drunken monster was about the last thing gerin wanted to contemplate if geroge rampaged out of control how was anyone supposed to stop him without spearing him or filling him full of arrows the fox stuck two fingers in the puddle of ale geroge had spilled on the table he sucked the brew off one of them then flicked a golden drop from the other in a libation of his own i bless you baivers he said out loud and silently appended because your bounty turns monsters friendly and foolish not vicious and savage considering what they were that was no small boon from the god van with a hangover was a shuddering horror but van had had a great many hangovers in his time he drank a tiny bit more ale come morning nibbled at a heel of bread and did his best to stay away from bright sunlight and loud noises though fand didnt make that latter easy until his poor abused body had the chance to recover geroge and tharma felt every bit as bad if not worse and had no idea what to do about it some forms of virginity were more enjoyable to lose than others they moaned they were dying and flinched from the harsh din of their own voices gerin did very little to make them more comfortable the less they enjoyed the aftermath of their debauch the less likely they were to repeat it having been moderate the day before he didnt flinch from leaving the shade of the great hall for the bright sunlight that streamed down into the courtyard as soon as he went out there he began to sweat it was a fine hot summers day he wondered if that meant stribog hadnt recovered from the drubbing mavrix gave him he also wondered what the weather was like west of the venien in lands where the gradi held sway if stribog really was out of commission the peasants might bring in some kind of crop even there have to try to find out he thought the more he learned about what the gradi and their gods could do the better his own chances of figuring out what to do about them he climbed up onto the palisade everything looked normal enough as far as the eye could see the trouble was the eye couldnt see far enough but here peasants labored in the fields cattle and sheep grazed on the meadows pigs foraged for whatever they could find in the peasant village near the keep smoke came out the smoke holes in a couple of roofs as women simmered soup or stew for the evening meal what was fulda doing there cooking weaving brewing weeding whatever she was doing her courses hadnt come she was pregnant sure enough and without a human partner why had mavrix chosen to spawn a demigod in the northlands what sort of demigod would the child be time would answer those questions provided gerin remained alive to see the answers actually time would answer those questions whether he remained alive or not but he preferred not to dwell on that he didnt have to dwell on it for long the lookout in the watchtower above the castle winded his horn and cried a chariot approaching lord prince out of the west gerin peered southwest in the direction of adiatunnus lands for years that was the direction from which trouble had come out of the west then the lookout amplified his earlier words a chariot along the path by the niffet gerin whirled when he thought about the niffet these days he thought of war galleys full of gradi with axes every one of the raiders bellowing voldars name much to his relief he saw no galleys for a little while he saw no chariot either his watchtower was the tallest around precisely to afford the sentries up there the widest possible view no there it was coming out from behind a grove of plum trees the horsemen were trotting along at a pace that while not the quickest covered the most ground if you held it for a long time somebody up on the palisade next to gerin said from out of schild stoutstaffs holding maybe that would be my guess gerin agreed now we have to find out what sort of news hes bringing when the chariot came up to the keep the fellow in the car named himself aripert ariberts son one of schilds vassal barons though not a man the fox knew well since there was only the one car gerins warriors did not hesitate to lower the drawbridge and let him into the keep once in the courtyard he jumped down from the car and looked all around calling the fox where is the fox he didnt know gerin by sight either he was about thirtyfive stocky with sharp features and a quick jerky way of moving im the fox gerin had made his way down from the palisade whats gone so wrong in schilds barony that you had to rush here and tell me about it you have the right of it lord prince aripert said pacing back and forth he evidently couldnt stand to hold still more than a few breaths at a time he cracked his knuckles one after another till they all popped and hardly seemed aware he was doing it the wild men from out of the west the gradi ships full of them landed in schilds holding his keep held against them and those of his vassals too but they burned villages and killed serfs and trampled crops and stole livestock and were all going to be hungry this winter on account of it he stared at gerin as if convinced it was the foxs fault we havent been sitting idle aripert gerin said aripert gnawed dead skin at the edge of his thumbnail gerin wondered if he had a wife living with such constant fidgeting would have driven him mad but that was not what mattered at the moment he went on your own overlord has fought against the gradi at my side so what aripert said swatting at something that might have been a gnat and might have been a figment of his imagination it didnt do me any good it didnt do schilds holding any good thats not so gerin said it might have been worse for youit might have been much worseif we hadnt if you dont believe me send a messenger down to adiatunnus and ask him aripert scratched his head tugged at his ear and plucked a hair out of his beard spinning it between thumb and forefinger he answered all right maybe it would have been worse i dont know it was cursed bad i tell you he started pacing again how are you going to keep those bastards off the niffet thats what i want to know he yanked out his knife and cleaned his nails with it just watching him made gerin tired i dont know how we can keep the gradi off the niffet he said they make better ships than we do best we can hope for is to beat them once they get off their ships to fight but they can pick the spots where they do that not good enough aripert stuck one of his newly clean fingernails deep into his ear stared with interest at what he dug out and wiped his hand on his breeches not good enough not even close we have to keep them from doing that fine gerin said which surprised the newcomer into several heartbeats of immobility the fox fixed him with a sour stare how aripert opened his mouth closed it licked his lips noisily sucked in air licked his lips again and finally said youre the prince of the north im not youre supposed to tell that to me gerin laughed aripert glared gerin glared back and kept on laughing if i had a cow for everyone whos said that to me since spring he said id eat beef the rest of my life that left aripert unimpressed if the prince of the north doesnt have the answers who does he demanded maybe no one gerin said which made the vassal barons eyes open very wide as aripert was scuffing the ground with one foot the fox thought maybe voldar he wouldnt say that out loud and wished it hadnt crossed his mind what he did say was youll have to put more watchers along the river to keep an eye out for gradi galleys and give the alarm when they spot them then you can decide whether you want to show yourself in force enough to keep them from wanting to land or hole up in your keep aripert started pacing again then hopped up in the air suddenly enough to startle the fox even before his feet hit the ground again he was talking well thats something lord prince so it is if these cursed gradi come and go on the niffet as they please the way you say we will have to keep a tighter watch for em do those kinds of things if they land try to burn their boats gerin said they guard them but it would be worth doing if you could if theyre stranded in our country we can hunt them down the way we would any dangerous wild beasts aye lord princesense in your words ariperts jaws worked as if literally chewing up and swallowing gerins advice had you done any of these things before the gradi raided you gerin asked aripert shook his head he gnawed some more at the skin of his thumb looking contrite now the fox glared in good earnest why not he shouted you know what the gradi did to us here this spring by the five hells why did you think you were immune it wasnt that so much lord prince aripert said shifting from foot to foot and twisting his body back and forth as if he were dancing we didnt know what to do so we didnt do anything much if they come back well give them a better fight for your wise words how much wisdom does it take to see this gerin held a hand out in front of his face how much wisdom does it take to feel this he wanted to hit aripert over the head with a rock with luck letting in some light and fresh air but contented himself with squeezing the minor barons arm you dont need to go to the sibyls shrine at ikos for advice like what ive given you you dont need to come to me either all you need to do is sit down on your fundament and ask yourself a few simple questions are the gradi likely to come here if they do how will they come if thats what they do how can i best pour sand in their soup how will they try to stop me how can i keep them from doing that its not hard aripert any man can do it if he will he knew he sounded as if he were pleading he couldnt help it he was pleading aripert ariberts son scratched his head he sighed long and deep what am i supposed to say lord prince youre not supposed to say any one thing gerin answered quietly now youre not supposed to do any one thing youre just supposed to think for yourself aripert scratched his head again he scratched his neck he scratched his forearm and the back of his hand watching him made gerin itch he started scratching his own head aripert said when a serf asks me something i dont tell him to figure it out for himself i give him an order and i make certain sure he follows it sometimes that works fine gerin was always ready to talk about the artor maybe magic was a better wordof ruling sometimes it keeps him from getting a different idea one as good as yours or maybe better and sometimes unless youre a godmaybe even if youre a godyoure going to be flatout wrong if the serf blindly goes ahead and does what you tell him youve done him wrong of course sometimes hell know youre wrong and go ahead and do what you tell him anyhow for spite or anger or to show you up for a fool thats why i give fewer orders like that than i used to by the way you talk you want every man doing so much for himself thered be no need for baronsor for a prince aripert added pointedly if every man were as smart as every other man and if everybody got along with everyone else that would be fine gerin said but some men cant think and worse some who can wont and some people are quarrelsome and some want what their neighbors have but dont want to work the way the neighbors did i dont think lords will disappear from the landscape tomorrow nor even the day after heh aripert said he sketched a salute all right lord prince ill try not to be one of those people who can think but wont thinking about watchers along the river is a good place to start beacon fires maybe he plucked at his beard then tugged at an earlobe a string of beacon fires would be a good thing to have the fox agreed if you do set em up ill put a watcher next to schilds land to relay news here to fox keep well thats fine lord prince one thing i cant do for myself is make men out of thin air can you spare me some soldiers to come leap on the gradi if they do land again not a one gerin answered firmly but if you want to arm your serfs against them i wont say a word peasants dont usually make the best soldiersthe gods know thats sobut if they have weapons theyll do the gradi some damage anyhow but if they learn to fight theyll do us nobles damage down the road too aripert protested which has the greater weight what may happen down the road if you do arm them or whats almost sure to happen now if you dont gerin asked aripert bit his lip stamped his foot and finally nodded he was thinking even if he didnt like the answers he was getting gerin gave him credit for it the fox said here spend the night with us well feed you you can drink some ale with us if any turns out to be left in the cellar uh thank you lord prince aripert sounded a little unsure of himself as if he couldnt decide whether gerin was joking since gerin couldnt decide either no reason for aripert to be able to geroge came out of the great hall braving the vicious sunlight for a chance to breathe fresh air instead of the smoke inside the castle the foxs men knowing the monsters delicate condition prudently left him alone he might have been goodnatured most of the time but anyone feeling the aftereffects from a days binge was liable to be on the testy side if you were huge hairy and armed with teeth like a wolfs no one wanted to find out whether you were feeling testy or not father dyaus aripert yelled grabbing for his sword its one of those horrible things i thought they were all gone gerin seized ariperts arm and kept him from getting the length of edged bronze out of the scabbard geroge swung his intimidating gaze toward aripert well he said with almost as much condescension as mavrix could have loaded into the word some people dont insult strangers just for the fun of it or so the fox tells me anyhow his long narrow nostrils were ideally suited to sniffing for once aripert stood completely motionless he stared at the monster by the look on his face he would have sooner expected one of the logs on the palisade to say something to him than geroge if youll look closely youll notice he is wearing breeches gerin said were friends friends aripert repeated through frozen lips you have some unusual friends lord prince gerin set a hand on his shoulder oh i dont know youre not so unusual as all that are you geroge got the point of the gibe before aripert did the monster started to throw back his head and roar laughter one or the other or both of those must have hurt for he stopped with a grimace that showed off his formidable dental equipment aripert started to draw his sword again but checked himself before gerin had to stop him the fox introduced the monster to the vassal baron then explained for ariperts benefit he was deep in the ale pot yesterday the very first time and hes feeling it now oh aripert stuck out a finger at gerin now i understand why you were wondering if you had any ale left must take up a bit to fill up one his size not one geroge said three me tharma and van of the strong arm aripert didnt know who tharma was but he knew about van he let out an awed whistle gerin said there you see you can think after all what i think is id like to have seen that aripert said from a safe distance i mean when you see a gradi galley out on the niffet its pretty too but you dont want it getting any closer a good deal of truth there gerin said if we weather the storm well have to see about making galleys of our own but thats for later in the great byandby for now come into the hall and well start feeding you and you can watch geroge and tharma be very moderate tonight unless i miss my guess he turned to the monster how about it geroge feel like having your head pound like a drum again tomorrow morning geroge held up both hands in a gesture of genuine horror oh no lord prince doing that once was plenty for me hes not stupid aripert said hopping into the air in surprise he belied his own words speaking as if geroge wasnt there or couldnt understand even when giving a compliment but then he went on plenty of ordinary men who dont think getting drunk once is enough plenty of ordinary men who dont think getting drunk once in a day is enough come to that aye the fox agreed mournfully we both know too many like that everyone knows too many like that well come on well see if we can make you happy without having you sleep in the rushes under the table when youre done aripert ariberts son rode out of fox keep the next morning every bit as fidgety as he had been when he rode in gerin dared hope he would put some of that restless energy to work watching for the gradi and resisting them if they struck schilds holding again a few days later he got word from a trader who had come out of the forests north of the niffet with a load of fine beeswax and amber that the gradi had also raided that side of the river the trader a lean weathered balding man named cedoal the honest a sobriquet the fox would have bet hed invented himself said i didnt see the bastards my own self lord prince you got to understand that but i did see the woodsrunners who were running from em they like to swamp the village where i was at and every one of em had worse tales to tell than the next that was logically impossible but gerin didnt press the merchant about it instead he tried to figure out exactly when the raid had taken place he wished he had aripert back to nail down the exact day as best he could tell though both raids had probably been by the same band figuring out where cedoal had been in relation to schilds holding wasnt easy either the fox thought the gradi had hit schild first and then raided the trokmoi on the way west but knew he couldnt be sure and then a few days after that gradi galleys came rowing up the niffet toward fox keep fires from schilds holding warned of them so aripert had not only thought but also acted well smash them father duren cried as he drove the chariot with gerin and van out toward the river the fox had decided to meet the raiders on the bank not wanting them to ravage fields and assail the peasant village again but the gradi did not land instead sails taking advantage of the wind from the west and oars working with drilled precision they propelled their galleys past fox keep and on up the niffet gerin and a good many elabonians shot arrows at them but most of the shafts fell short the niffet was a broad stream and a ship closer to the northern bank than the southern all but immune to archery van normally disdained the bow in war seeing that the gradi were not going to stop and fight though he grabbed the strongest bow any of gerins comrades carried it belonged to drungo dragos son drungo had put a couple of arrows close to the galley he growled when van took the bow from him but stared slackjawed as the outlander bent it till the wood creaked and threatened to snap then let fly one of the gradi who werent rowingby that a captain of some sortwent down the elabonians raised a cheer drungo bowed to van i thought i put everything into that bow it would take he said i was wrong not bad for a lucky shot was it van said laughing he proceeded to empty drungos quiver at the galleys and made a couple of more hits neither was as spectacular as that first had been whatever van did he had a flair for the dramatic gerin watched in some consternation as the gradi kept sailing east up the niffet what are they doing he demanded perhaps of the elabonian godswho as usual did not answer i thought they meant to close with me and find out once for all who would rule the northlands what else could they want duren demanded till theyve beaten you they havent really accomplished anything oh i dont know lad as he often did van had a ruthlessly pragmatic way of looking at things if they plunder other people they bring home loot and slaves with less risk and cost to themselves and we wont be able to rest easy not with them farther up the river than we are for all we know they may try and hit us on their way back toward the ocean lets make life difficult for them gerin said he hadnt thought of setting up a chain of watchfires east of fox keep not imagining the gradi would go on past his holding but that didnt mean he couldnt send riders east to warn the petty barons along the banks of the niffet the raiders were coming watching the cars rattle off down the road van said i wonder if theyll get there ahead of the galleys horses tire out same as men do and the gradi have the wind working for them though they are rowing against the current and thats not easy its in the hands of the gods gerin said and then wished he hadnt the gradi gods were too greedy by half to suit him more consolingly he added ive done everything i can i wish we could move the whole army after them duren said that we cant do gerin answered if we did theyd let us stay with them for a while and then theyd turn around right in the middle of the niffet take down their sails and use oars and current to rush back here theyd swoop down on the keep before we could get here and that he added with what he thought of as praiseworthy understatement would be very bad aye youre right fox van said im all for charging straight ahead most times but not now if we run away from whats most important to us we end up losing it sure as sure well we havent lost it this time the gods be praised gerin didnt know whether that was irony in his voice or the hope that if the elabonian gods repeatedly heard themselves addressed they would pay more attention to this corner of the world he waved the army rode back from the banks of the niffet toward fox keep the men on the palisade raised a cheer so did the serfs who lived in the village near the keep some of them came out of the fields and huts to congratulate the warriors on keeping the gradi from landing gerin didnt know whether those congratulations were truly in order or whether the gradi had intended to bypass his holding from the beginning if the peasants were so eager to approve of him though he was willing to let them among the serfs came fulda her fellows regarded her with more than a little awe so did a good many of the warriors she hadnt been shy about spreading the story of what had happened inside the shack that served as gerins magical laboratory the proof of how the other peasants in the village felt was that theyd been doing a lot of her work for her since her encounter with mavrix the fox had never doubted she was pregnant by the sithonian god and if he had those doubts would have perished not only had her courses failed to come but she glowed in a way that was similar to the glow other pregnant women got but so magnified that gerin would almost have taken oath she didnt need a lamp by night that wasnt so incurably curious hed gone over to the peasant village one night to find out but he did note that the night ghosts perhaps sensing the demigod in her belly stayed far away from the village and that even those whose wails could be heard at a distance seemed less cold and fierce than was their wont lord prince fulda said now she still treated him with respect perhaps from lifelong habit perhaps because he was married to selatre who had also known intimacy with a god even if intimacy of a different sort from hers how are you feeling today he asked her he knew he sounded cautious how else could he sound when though she was still one of his serfs the god who had impregnated her might be listening im well thank you she said her smile like everything else about her was radiant one of the advantages of having a god for the father of her child it seemed was immunity to morning sickness good gerin said thats good no he hadnt figured out how to react to fulda she was a goodlooking young woman certainly but not very bright and yet mavrix had chosen to sire a child on her the fox shrugged a fertility god no doubt cared for beauty more than wit after all that had been the point in having her there in the first place rihwin the fox mounted on a horse came up to fulda gerin suspected rihwin would sooner have mounted her she smiled up at him in a way that suggested she might have been interested in the same thing rihwin are you trying to make mavrix angry at you again gerin asked who me his fellow fox asked looking innocent so convincingly as to be altogether unconvincing why should mavrix be angry at me for conversing with this charming lady when i in a manner of speaking introduced the two of them and why furthermore should he be angry with me if i do rather more than converse with her he could never doubt the paternity of the child to be born and i would raise it as one of my own he might even be grateful to me rihwin as far as gerin could see was thinking with his lance not his head gerin sighed rihwin would do whatever he would do and would probably end up paying the penalty for it he did pay those penalties without complaint gerin gave him that much as far as gerin was concerned not putting yourself in a position where you would have to pay them would have been wiser yet but hed learned rihwin like a lot of people didnt think that way be careful he said to rihwin rihwin nodded almost as if he would heed gerin sighed again lord prince carlun vepins son still spoke hesitantly whenever he needed to address gerin the fox might have made him steward but he had the ingrained habits of a serfand knowing he thrived by gerins sufferance couldnt have made matters any easier but hesitantly or not he went on lord prince i do need to speak to you for a moment here i am gerin said agreeably enough whats troubling you carlun looked around the great hall several warriors sat here and there along the benches some drinking ale one gnawing the roasted leg of a fowl three or four more rolling dice lowering his voice carlun said lord prince may i speak with you in private i suppose so gerin said shall we walk down toward the village then that should do the job carlun agreed at once whenever he got out of fox keep these days he seemed a flower spreading itself in the bright sunshine and the sunshine remained bright and hot the drubbing mavrix had given stribog did keep the gradi god from meddling with the weather here we are gerin said i asked you once so ill ask you twice whats troubling you lord prince how long will fox keep be full of warriors carlun asked how much longer will they stay here how long the fox frowned till weve beaten the gradi or till theyve beaten us whichever happens first why because lord prince they are eating useating youout of house and home carlun answered if you hadnt been so prudent about storing up food your larder would long since have been bare as things are this will be a hungry thirsty winter even without your vassals here what do you suggest i do then gerin asked shall i send everyone home with the gradi still on the niffet east of here shall i surrender to the gradi is that better than letting them make me poor instead of prosperous carlun licked his lips thats not uh what i had in mind lord prince but you do need to know that even the supplies you have stored up wont last forever oh i know that all too well gerin said every time i go down into the cellars and see another storage jar opened or another jar gone it gives me something new to worry about and i have plenty of things already thanks every time you go down into the cellars carlun repeated he stared at the fox lord prince i didnt know you did that as far as i could see lords know only about taking not about saving and watching thats because youve looked at things with the eyes of a serf gerin answered its also because i look further ahead than most lords he thought but he didnt say that out loud what he did say was i have to manage this entire holding the way you ran first your house and then the village here ill tell you what i have left down there he started reeling off jars of ale of wheat of barley of rye of beans of peas of salted beef and mutton of smoked pork so many hams so many sausages so many hung joints of beef and on and on till carluns eyes all but popped from his head lord prince the peasantturnedsteward whispered when the fox was finally through i couldnt have done that without checking the latest records nor come close to it but i think from what i do remember of those records your memory is as near perfect as makes no difference i would have made a splendid scholar gerin said since i have a jackdaws memory for useless bits of this and that every now and again it comes in handy in the world where i find myself lord prince if you remember all these things why did you put me in the place where you put me carlun asked not that im not grateful mind when i think what you could have done but you dont need me you could do the job yourself of course i could gerin said with confidence so automatic he didnt notice it himself but with you doing it i dont have to and so i dont not really if we do run low youre the one whos going to make sure we lay in more supplies from somewhere and if you do a bad job at it ill throw you out on your ear oh ive known that all along lord prince carlun said both men smiled although they both knew gerin hadnt been joking he expected no less from those around him than he did from himself carluns smile faded first he asked how am i to pay for whatever i have to bring in you have my leave to spend my gold and silver gerin answered i wouldnt have brought you here if i didnt intend to let you do that i do expect you to spend as little of it as you can carlun bowed his head i wouldnt think of doing anything else he grinned wryly i wouldnt dare do anything else no eh gerin hadnt said one word about checking on carlun he didnt intend to say one word about checking on carlun he did however intend to check on him if carlun couldnt figure that out for himself the fox had made a mistake in promoting him rather than sending him off to some other village and if carlun tried cheating hed find hed made a mistake himself they were almost out to the village where he had been headman not long before abruptly he spun on his heel and started walking back toward fox keep again much faster than hed left it i dont want to go back to the hut that used to be mine he said i dont even want to see it not up close do you understand that lord prince maybe i do the fox said is it that you dont want to be reminded of how you started outand of how you could end up carlun jerked as if gerin had stuck him with the pin from a fibula did you work magic to see that lord prince no gerin answered and immediately wished hed said yesif carlun thought his magic better than it was he might be more tempted to walk the straight and narrow but having answered honestly he went on seeing that one wasnt hard when you were headman you had to know what the rest of the people in the village were thinking didnt you when carlun nodded the fox finished ive had to do that for my holding and for much longer than you needed to do it ive seen a lot ive remembered a lot and i can put all that together do you follow me a lot of mensome of them his vassal baronswouldnt have they remembered little and learned less going through life or so it seemed to gerin more than halfblind but carlun whether honest and reliable or not was anything but stupid you may not be casting a spell he said but that doesnt mean it isnt magic since gerin had had the same thought about the craft of ruling men as recently as ariperts arrival at fox keep he glanced toward carlun with considerable respect as they came back to the keep he said i have your gracious permission to keep the garrison here a while longer eh of course lord prince carlun said sounding on the lordly side himself when gerin gave him a sharp look his burst of bravado collapsed and he added not that you need it mind you there is that gerin agreed happy carlun knew his place after all dagref clotild and blestar were playing with maeva and kor gerin watched the game with faint bemusement dagref was not only oldest but sharpest witted a lot of the time he couldnt be bothered playing with his sibs his mind though not his body or spirit was nearly that of an adult when he did join them and vans children the role he saw for himself was halfway between overseer and god he invented not just rules but a whole imaginary world and put himself and them through their paces in it no maeva he shouted i told you dont you remember the bark of that tree a stick is poisonous no its not maeva said to prove her point she picked up the stick and whacked dagref with it there you see but for the high pitch of her voice that selfsatisfied directness might have come straight from van didnt hurt me a bit youre not playing right dagref said angrily by his tone he could imagine no felony more heinous be careful son gerin muttered under his breath dagref was older but maeva girl or no girl was both stronger and more agile if dagref forced a confrontation hed lose if he wanted to get his way here hed have to figure out how to do it without getting into a fight just then geroge and tharma came out of the great hall all the children greeted them with glad cries the brewing quarrel between dagref and maeva was forgotten the two monsters though now approaching adulthood had always been part of the childrens games at fox keep they were bigger and stronger than any of the others which more than balanced their also being duller had they been badtempered their strength would have made them terrors since they werent they became companions all the more desirable what game are you playing tharma asked dagref well he said importantly clotild here is a wizard and shes turned kor into a longtooth a role well suited for one of kors fierce blustery temper and were all seeking ways to get him back his own shape maeva seems to be immune to poisons and so he went on laying out the framework of the world that existed only inside his own head gerin noted hed incorporated maevas recalcitrance into the structure of the game geroge laughed loud and boisterouslyso loud and boisterously gerins ears quivered in suspicion geroge sounded as if hed been dipping deep into the ale jar again in spite of earlier promises he said thats a good game his voice quivered with enthusiasm lets make the longtooth fly and see what happens then he picked up kor and threw him high in the airso high he had time to circle under the little boy before he came down the circling was wobblyyes hed been drinking more than he should have gerin started toward him on the dead run but geroge plucked kor out of the air neat as you please tharma grabbed blestar and threw him even higher even more than it had when kor soared gerins heart leaped into his mouth he breathed out a harsh sigh of relief as his little son came down safe he and kor both squealed with glee at their flights the fox was less amused this game is over he said in a voice filled with as much doom as he could manage that evidently wasnt enough barons and trokm chieftains quailed before him his own children along with vans and with geroge and tharma protested loudly and bitterly he held his ground we were fine clotild said stamping her foot i wanted to go next no one got hurt no not this time but you were lucky because someone might have gerin answered hed long since found out that arguments based on might have were for all practical purposes useless with children so it proved here but when he got a whiff of geroges breath he had another better argument baivers and barley he exclaimed wrinkling his nose you didnt just dive into the ale jar you went swimming around in there geroge looked as shamefaced as a tiddly monster could the result would have made anyone who didnt know him flee in terror but gerin recognized the display of fangs as placatory not hostile im sorry geroge said with a growl that also sounded more fearsome than it was i dont know what came over me but i feel so good with the ale inside he punctuated that with an enormous belch gerins children and vans dissolved in gales of laughter the fox felt like laughing too but didnt let his face show it he rounded on tharma i thought you had better sense than he did he said accusingly im sorry she answered hanging her homely head but he started drinking the ale and i if he decided to jump off the palisade and break his fool neck would you do it too just because he did it gerin had trotted that one out so many times for his own children it sprang forth of its own accord now hed used it on geroge and tharma a few times too generally to good effect today though tharma looked back at him it wasnt like that she protested it was like like something was pushing at us to drink the ale probably the same sort of thing that pushes at me when i feel like getting into the candied fruit or the honey cakes dagref said sounding far more dubious than someone his age had any business doing what will he be like when he grows up gerin thought uneasily his eldest by selatre would be a man to reckon with if nobody murdered him young it wasnt like that tharma said it really was i could almost feel something pushing me toward the jar geroges big head jerked up and down up and down as he nodded agreement gerin started to shout at both of them for being not just liars but stubborn liars to boot he stopped though before the words passed his lips mavrix had used rihwin as an instrument in a way much like this prodding him to get drunk on wine and afford the sithonian god an easy conduit into the northlands but this wasnt mavrix who had nothing to do with ale it was baivers gerins mouth shaped the name of the god in silent astonishment baivers was as elabonian a deity as any and up till now the elabonian gods had been uniformly quiet even when voldar and her gradi cohorts added their weight to the invaders power up till now gerin wondered if he was a drowning man grabbing at straws as he tried to stay afloat the affection geroge and tharma suddenly felt for ale might have nothing whatever to do with baivers might in fact have nothing to do with anything save an increasingly welldeveloped thirst of the sort that turned ordinary men into drunks with no divine intervention whatever well the fox said more to himself than to the monsters much more to himself than to the stilldisappointed children if youre going to grab at straws by dyausand by baiversgrab at them dont let them slip through your hands what are you talking about father dagref as usual sounded highly insulted when gerin said something he didnt follow never mind gerin said absently which insulted his son all the more to compound his crime he took no notice of dagrefs annoyance instead he seized geroges arm in one hand and tharmas in the other come back to the great hall with me you two youre going to drink some more ale geroge greeted that pronouncement with a roar of delight tharma said youre not going to make us drink till we hurt the next day are you that made geroge thoughtful the memory of his first hangover was after all still painfully vivid in him too had gerin been able to get away with not answering that he would have done it he didnt think he could and the prospect of enraging two monsters each bigger and stronger than he was disquieting at best he said i dont know i want to find out why you like ale so much lately i want to see if a god is meddling with your fate he wished baivers meddling werent so subtle he had trouble telling if it was even there till the gradi came he had enjoyed being free from interference at the hands of the elabonian gods now just when he really would have relished interference he wasnt sure whether he had any or not in the great hall carlun vepins son sat at a corner table well away from the four or five warriors in the chamber the steward was quietly nursing a mug of ale when gerin called for another jar to be brought up from the cellar carluns face expressed ostentatious disapproval gerin was just as ostentatious about ignoring him geroge smacked his lips as he guzzled ale the fox studied him in the same way he might have studied some curious new beast that had wandered in from the forest how do i find out why youve got so fond of ale he murmured because it tastes good because it makes me feel good geroge suggested but youve been drinking it since you were tiny the fox said imagining geroge as tiny wasnt easy now gerin persisted nonetheless it made you feel good then too didnt it not as good as i feel now the monster said enthusiastically beside him tharma nodded also with great vigor she drained her jack of ale then filled it again carlun tried to catch gerins eye gerin didnt let him does it feel better because youre drinking more now gerin asked or is there something over and above that too both monsters gave the question serious consideration gerin admired them for that the more so considering how much ale theyd already drunk a lot of ordinary people he knew wouldnt have looked so hard for an answer at last tharma said i think its made us feel better than we did since the time we drank and drank with van didnt feel so good afterwards though geroge said making a horrible face at the memory as if to help himself forget he drank deep gerin meanwhile called down curses on his friends head but that wasnt fair either a god might have been nudging van into getting the monsters drunk that day for that matter gerin thought he was acting as a free agent now but he was honest enough to admit he didnt know for certain whether he really was one how much did being prince of fleas mean when a dog started scratching that thought led nowhere though whether he was truly his own man or nothing more than a tool of the gods he had to act as if he were free and independent not even a god could restore to you an opportunity youd missed yesterday he studied geroge and tharma they werent paying much attention to him or to anything but their ale when he was down below bitons shrine at ikos hed wondered whether the monsters had gods of their own now that thought came back to him if they had gods what did those gods think of two of their numbers being left aboveground when biton and mavrix had returned all the others to their gloomy haunts even more to the point what did they think about the gradi he shook his head here he was building castles in the airor rather castles under the ground he didnt know for a fact that the monsters had any gods at all geroge and tharma gave the elabonian deities the same absentminded reverence he did himself why not that was what theyd learned from him how was he supposed to find out if they had gods of their own asking them didnt seem likely to give him his answer whom to ask then biton would probably know but even if he did hed cloak whatever reply he gave to the fox in such ambiguity it wouldnt come clear till it was too late to do him any good who else might know he thought of mavrix and wished he hadnt disaster felt very close whenever he dealt with the sithonian fertility godand mavrix had already shown he despised the monsters which meant he was certain to despise their gods too then he realized baivers might know the god of barley and brewing was intimately connected to the earth and so were the monsters if gerin invoked him baivers would be a logical deity to ask if gerin invoked himif he could invoke himthe elabonian gods seemed so uninterested in the world though that it might not be possible the fox had resolved to try when the lookout in the watchtower winded his horn and cried the gradi the gradi are coming down the river baivers forgotten gerin rushed out of the great hall men on the palisade were pointing east the sentry had got it right then these were the gradi who had gone up the niffet to see what damage they could do beyond gerins holding not a new band coming to join them that was something if not much well greet them as we did before on the riverbank the fox ordered if they want to try to land here in the face of that let them and may they have joy of it ahead of the rest he sent out rihwin the fox and the other adventurous sorts who rode horses they had their animals ready for action faster than teams could be hitched to chariots he also sent out a fair number of men on foot the more resistance the gradi faced at the waters edge the less likely they were to try to land by the time van duren and he were rattling across the meadow toward the niffet the raiders war galleys were already passing fox keep the gradi shouted unintelligible insults across the water but stayed near the trokm bank of the river and showed no desire to clash with foes so obviously ready to receive them cowards gerins men yelled spineless dogs eunuchs whitelivered wretches the gradi probably could make no more sense of their pleasantries than they could of those coming from the raiders duren said the gods be praised we frightened them away here for now yes gerin said but what did they do farther upstream whatever it is theyve come faster than the news of it when he was younger fits of gloom had threatened to overwhelm him they came on him less often these days but he felt the edge of one now they can do as they like and we have to respond to it with them controlling the river they can pick and choose where to make their fights where we seem strong they leave us alone where were weak they strike and when we try to hit back over land their gods make even moving against them the next thing to impossible have to light our beacons to warn aripert and the rest of schilds vassals still in his holding van said right gerin answered with a grateful glance at his friend the outlander had shown him something simple and practical he could do that would help his cause he shouted orders a couple of rihwins riders went galloping back to the keep for torches with which to light the watchfires before long the first fire was blazing glowing red and sending a great pillar of smoke into the sky gerin peered west his own watchers quickly spotted the warning fire and started another to pass the word into schilds holding and soon enough another column of smoke rose this one small and thin in the distance the fox nodded somber approval either aripert ariberts son or another of schilds vassalsbut someone at any ratewas alert the gradi might land again in schilds holding but he did not think they would be delighted with their reception weve done something worthwhile there he said and both van and duren nodded hagop son of hovan was a man who put gerin in mind of widin simrins son a baron whod taken over his holding as a youngster but who had matured into a good enough overlord for it he acknowledged the fox his suzerain paid him his feudal dues and sent men to fight on his behalf had all gerins vassals been so tractable he would have had an easier time of it by far now though he was a man in despair lord prince he cried as he got down from his chariot the gradi dealt me a heavy blow and it fell on me all the harder because so many came here to fight the raiders along with you i never dreamed they could sail up the niffet and strike my holding his swarthy bignosed face was still haggard with shock i didnt dream of it either gerin answered thats the only excuse i can make for not setting up watchfires running east from here using oars and sails both the gradi outran the news of their coming i did send out riders to try to warn you and the others upstream im sorry they didnt get there in time so am i hagop said bitterly they got there half a day after the gradi did i give them credit they fought at my side and a couple of them were wounded theyre still back at my keep but the damage is done lord prince and well be a long time getting over it what he meant was you are my lord and your duty is to keep such things from happening to me you failed me that he was too polite to come out and scream what he meant as so many of gerins vassals would have done made the fox feel worse not better gerin said theyre bad enemies worse than the trokmoi and he looked around to make sure geroge and tharma were out of earshot worse than the monsters too i have a couple of things i intend to try to see if i cant get the upper hand on them but it hasnt happened yet im sorry hagops dour countenance immediately became more confident if you think you can overcome them lord prince i am sure it will be so in the end i wish i were gerin thought explaining exactly how worried he was though struck him as less than wise the more you seemed to believe in yourself the more your vassals would believe in you till you let them down hagop luckily didnt seem to think hed been let down for goodnot yet anyhow hagop asked how long do you intend keeping my vassals under your direct command lord prince i tell you true i would not be sorry to see them back in my holding to stand off the gradi should the raiders come again i aim to hold them here through the summer while we can move against the gradi gerin answered to his great relief hagop accepted that with no more than another frown if gerins leading vassals started pulling their vassals out from under him he wouldnt be able to accomplish anything against the invaders in short order he realized he wouldnt be prince of the north any more either hed be one petty baron among many with no more power and no more reach than any of the rest and the gradi would eat up the northlands a barony or two at a time and after a while a new cold dismal gradihome would arise here voldar would be very happy no doubt so would the gradi the elabonians even the trokmoi would have less reason to rejoice not that i want to jog your elbow hagop began an opening almost invariably a lie so it proved here for he continued but whatever youre going to set in motion against the gradi the gods grant you start it soon the busier they are answering us the less chance theyll have to make us answer them that was inarguably true it also marched with gerins own thoughts he said i intend to start as soon as i can i still have some more sorcerous research to undertake before i can begin though as hed hoped mentioning magic impressed hagop his vassal said lord prince if you know a spell for turning the lot of those buggers into toads that would be a great thing so it would gerin agreed he didnt say anything past that if hagop wanted to conclude he did have such a spell that was hagops concern by the awestruck look on hagops face he wanted to conclude just that i hope your spell succeeds he breathed so do i the fox replied he still hadnt said that the spell was one for the batrachifaction of the gradi he always hoped his spells succeeded and knew such hope was always urgently necessary repeatedly finding himself in deep trouble had made him try spells a halftrained lightly talented wizard had no business undertaking here he was in deep trouble again and about to go into sorcery over his head once more too how soon can you do thewhat did you call it the research that was the word you used hagop asked i have to go through the volumes in my library it will be a couple of days gerin told him i dont care for much companionship when i incant but if youd like to stay and see the results of the magic youre more than welcome most of his vassals would have accepted at once hagop shook his head i thank you lord prince but no i shall go back to my holding after tonight my people need me there they need more than me but i am willing to believefor nowyou need my vassals more i trust you will use them wisely i hope so gerin bowed to hagop im lucky to have you for a vassal your serfs are lucky to have you for a lord they do not think so right now hagop answered if your research and your spell go as you would have them go that may yet prove so though the gods grant you do it well and that you do it soon he plainly meant what are you waiting for gerin went up to the library he had the feeling hagop was rightevery moment he delayed invited disaster but if he was going to summon baivers to dicker with the god to aid him against the gradi and voldar he wanted to learn everything he could about him before he started when youd worshiped a god all your life you took him for granted gerin poured baivers a libation whenever he drank ale as did every other elabonian in the northlands and down in whatever was left of the empire of elabon south of the high kirs in return baivers made the barley flourish and made it ferment into ale he was very reliable about that beyond it he wasnt often a pushy god of the sort who frequently stuck his nose into human affairs what the fox wanted to find out from his scrolls and codices was how to make baivers pushy how to make him want to intervene in the northlands as he began working the handles of a scroll he shook his head what he really wanted to find was whether there was any way to make baivers pushy if baivers was resolutely confined to his one power what point in summoning him baivers was the son of father dyaus and a daughter of the earth goddess gerin knew that of course as he knew most of the other bits and pieces of lore he dug out about the god of barley but they werent things he commonly thought about reading of them was a quicker way to call them to mind than rummaging through his memory good though that was selatre came in saw what he was doing and pulled out another two scrolls and a codex for him these talk about the god too she said and then cautiously have you found anything that will help you not as much as id like he said his voice edgy with discontent by most of this and by most of everything ive seen once barley turns to ale baivers is content he paced back and forth i dont want him content i want him angry i want him furious hes a power of the earth and mavrix half told me a power of the earth was my best hope against voldar and the gradi gods is he the right one selatre asked many powers rest in the earth i know but mavrix wouldnt have been shy about naming most of them he despises baivers he wouldnt come out and say i failed but this god i detest might succeed he wouldnt say it but i think its what he meant after considering that selatre gravely nodded yes that rings true mavrix reminds me of a child who cant admit he isnt always the best at something and even when its plain he isnt wont give the one who really is his due the trouble is you cant take a god turn him over your knee and spank that kind of foolishness out of him gerin let out a long weary sigh but oh father dyaus how i wish you could ix geroge and tharma stared fearfully at the interior of the shack where gerin workedor tried to workmagic as he had with his own children and vans the fox had warned them of the dire consequences they would suffer if they ever so much as set a toe inside the monsters had taken him more seriously than the children had hed never had to punish either of them its all right he said now for about the fourth time youre here with me so thats different constant repetition eventually eased the monsters worries gerin wondered if it should have the mischief they might have raised coming in by themselves was as nothing next to the disaster of a spell gone awry what do we need to do geroge asked well for starters you get to drink some ale gerin answered that made both monsters visibly cheerier gerin used a knife to cut the pitch sealing the stopper of a fresh jar he dipped out large jacks for geroge and tharma and half a jacks worth for himself normally he would no sooner have tried magic after drinking ale than he would have tried leaping off the palisade headfirst but when the god whose aid he sought was also the deity who turned malted barley to ale what he would normally do took second place to that special concern he filled the monsters jacks after they emptied them thanking all the godsbaivers in particularthey didnt grow rowdy or fierce as they took on ale he sipped at his own jack too he wanted to feel the ale ever so slightly but not so much that it interfered with the passes and chants he would have to make selatre spread seed barley and unthreshed ears of the grain on the worktable in the shack she stayed sober if the conjuration went very wrong she would try to set it right gerin did not think that would be the problem getting baivers to respond at all would be the hard part we begin the fox said selatre stood quiet watchfully waiting geroge and tharma watched too their deepset eyes wide with wonder as gerin began to chant begging the boon of baivers presence he praised the god for barley not just transformed as ale but also as porridge and even as bread though barley flour refused to rise as high as that ground from wheat a little hypocrisy in a good cause never hurt anyone he thought when he began his song in praise of ale he made sure he set it to the tune of a drinking song he knew van had taught to geroge and tharma he gestured and the monsters quick on the uptake for their kind began to sing their voices were unlovely but he hoped that would not matter unlike mavrix baivers was not a snob in such matters once started the monsters didnt stop singing that suited gerin fine if they didnt attract the gods attention nothing would that nothing would however remained dismayingly possible as he generally did when dismayed the fox carried on as if success were assured he discovered that changing from the chant in the tune of the drinking song to a new one was harder than hed expected because having geroge and tharma braying out the one tune made him struggle to keep the other some of the ancillary spells he was using required quick and difficult passes from the right hand too for most wizards that would have made matters simpler the lefthanded fox found it a nuisance come forth he cried at last come forth great baivers lord of barley lord of ale come forth come forth come forth nothing happened he turned away from the barley on the worktable convinced he had failed what was the point to trying to summon the elabonian gods they might have all gone off on holiday leaving their portion of the world to look after itself but now other gods were lookinghungrilyat that portion of the world did they know did they care evidently not and then as he was about to tellto shout atgeroge and tharma to cease their wretched din the inside of the shack seemed to enlarge the monsters fell silent quite of their own accord it is the god selatre said quietly she of all people recognized the presence of the divine when she felt it gerin bowed very low lord baivers he said you honor me by hearing my summons you have summoned others before me not least that winebibbing mountebank from sithonia baivers answered as with mavrix gerin heard the gods voice in his mind not with his ears the rustic accent came through anyhow lord baivers who comes first is less important than who comes last for that says where help was truly found gerin said aye likely tell baivers said like a sour old farmer who hadnt believed anyones tales about anything since his wife told him she was going out to gather herbs in the woods and he found her in bed with the village headman grudgingly though he nodded to the fox well im here say your say thank you gerin knew he sounded more sincere than most people giving thanks most people though didnt get the chance to thank gods not in person baivers nodded again if a god could look like an old farmer he did his hair wasnt hair but ears of ripe barley a pale yellow his craggy face was tired and weathered as if like the crop whose lord he was he spent his whole lifetime in the sun and open air only when you looked in his eyes which were the color of fresh new green barley shoots poking up out of the ground after the first rains of spring did you get the sense of divine vitality still strong under that unprepossessing semblance what he looked like gerin thought was a part of the land that raised hope in the fox not only did it hold echoes of what mavrix had said to him but it also made him think baivers truly belonged in the northlands that the long elabonian presence here had made him as much a god of this terrain as he was around the city of elabon as much a god here as one longer established like biton with that in mind gerin asked do you want the gradi and their gods seizing this land that has been elabonian for so long that has given you so much barley and so many libationsso much reverence not to put too fine a point on it do i want that baivers spoke in mild surprise as if the question had not occurred to him in such a form do i want it no i dont want it the gradi and their gods feed on blood and oats he spoke with somber scorn their land is too poor too cold their souls too meager too cold for my grain geroge and tharma had stopped singing their hymn when baivers appeared theyd stared in awe at the god now geroge burst out if you dont want these nasty gradi around why havent you done anything about them and their gods why havent i done anything again the question seemed to startle baivers with some bitterness gerin found that unsurprising the idea of actually doing anything appeared to be one that was alien to the entire elabonian pantheon baivers turned his green green gaze on geroge a voice from below the roots he murmured more to himself than to any of the mortals with him there are powers below the roots what are you talking about geroge demanded i dont understand what youre saying gerin had often heard that complaint from dagref when he and selatre would talk about adult matters the oldest child theyd had together would listen following as far as his own experience let him and would keep on trying to follow past that point trying to make his parents slow down and let him know what they meant baivers murmurs perplexed the fox too but he thought he had some notion of what was in the gods mind groping for words he asked lord baivers are the powers below the roots connected to those who make a habit of living down there to show what he meant he pointed to geroge and tharma of course baivers answered once more sounding surprised where there are no folk there are no powers ah gerin said that answered one question hed long had at least in the eyes of the god the monsters were people from the day theyd emerged from the caverns below bitons shrine gerin had wondered hed phrased his question carefully to avoid both saying they were and saying they werent he found another question will that power those powers baivers corrected sounding finicky and precise those powers then will they fight for us against the gradi still finicky the god replied they will fight it is why they exist to fight against the gradi who can say for certain for us those sproutgreen eyes swung to gerin why do you think you and i are we why gerin said in some alarm you just said you didnt like the gradi or their gods if they take the northlands you get no more libations here no more worship im only a mortal lord baivers i know that but as mortals go im strong if you can help me fend off the gradi gods i think i can beat the gradi themselves could be so baivers said could be nonsense too but what i think and what i do theyre not the same my power is over growing and brewingyou know that im not a god of blood a god of war but you can fighti know you can gerin came up with one of the bits of lore hed culled from the scrolls up in his library when that demon sent the barley blight you didnt just fight him and beat him you made him swallow his own tail and eat himself up selatre silently clapped her hands well of course i did baivers said he was causing my crop all kinds of trouble he had it coming he did and i gave it to him for a moment he seemed a formidable deity indeed the gradi are the same gerin insisted if they win here there wont be any barley because theyll make the northlands too cold for it to grow do you want that to happen do i want it to happen of course i dont want it to happen it would sadden me baivers answered but if the grain wont grow then it wont and thats all there is to it its not the same its not close to the same as murdering it in the shoot the way that demon did hell never find his way back to this world never once the distinction baivers drew was so fine it meant nothing to the fox but it plainly did to the god gerin kicked at the dirt floor of the shack hed feared that even if baivers did appear for him the god would keep on doing what the gods of the elabonian pantheon did most of the time nothing hed needed an angry baivers a furious baivers and what he found was a regretful but resigned baivers which did him no good how to find a furious baivers even as the question formed in his mind so did an answer he tried to find another because he didnt like that one but nothing else occurred to him and when he was about to enrage a god he didnt think prayer would do him any good his laugh was loud and scornful george and tharma stared at him so did selatre in dismay she knew more about gods or about gods more directly than gerin and so did baivers dont like your tone young fellow he said sharply why should i care gerin retorted ive spilled a lot of ale to you over the years and what has it got me not bloody much thats plain i should have paid more heed to mavrix he has a long memory for foes but he has a long memory for friends too and thats more than i can say about you he was right about what he told mehe certainly was the sithonian baivers snorted the next time hes rightll be the first oh no jeering at a god was something of which gerin would never have dreamt were his need less great if he overdid it he was liable to be destroyed by a deity he might have brought to his side but if he didnt do it he was all too sure he would be destroyed by the gradi and their gods and so jeer he did mavrix said you were useless said youd always been useless said youd always be useless too and hes right looks as if to me useless mavrix talks about useless baivers threw back his head and laughed his barley hair rustled the sithonian who cant play the pipes who manures himself whenever hes in trouble that wasnt fair or true but gerin had long since noted gods were no more fair and probably less truthful than human beings who buggers pretty boys and calls himself a fertility god he thinks im useless ill show him as the fox knew buggering pretty boys was not all mavrix did to amuse himself he feared baivers tirade would draw the notice of the sithonian god hed wanted biton and mavrix together theyd spurred each other on against the monsters he didnt want baivers and mavrix together lest they go after each other instead of the gradi but he had to keep baivers roused and so he kept on jeering you might as well be from the law courts of the city of elabon not the fields where the barley grows all you care about is the detail of the law he was being unfair himself that charge applied more justly to his son dagref than to baivers if youd fight that demon but not the gradi gods the barley is gone whether killed in the shoot or never planted yes mavrix was rightuseless is the word for a moment he glanced over to selatre her face was white as milk she knew probably better than he all the different risks he was running if i get through this ill never traffic with gods again he told himself though he knew that was a lie if he got through this hed have to try to find some way to enlist whatever gods the monsters had against the gradi that was likely to make dealing with baivers seem a stroll on the meadow by comparison then tharma spoke to the god of barley and brewing please dont let the barley go away from here we like your ale call me useless baivers said to gerin mavrix said it and so you believe it ill show you useless i will powers of the earth powers under the earth were stronger than you think little man loose us against the invaders and the fox had hoped hed prophesy victory he didnt instead finishing and well give em all the fight in us gerin wished he knew how much that was relieved he hadnt been turned into an insect pest or something else small and obnoxious he dared one more question no longer mocking lord baivers can you bring father dyaus into the fight too baivers looked astonished then sad i wish i could he said wed win certain sure then but dyaus hesgone round to the far side of the hill you might say and i dont know what itd take to call him back you know lord baiversor maybe you dont know if i dont say itwe elabonians have the feeling sometimes that all our gods have gone round to the far side of the hill gerin said were pleased enough with the way things are here or we have been anyhow baivers answered when a thing is to your liking you dont need to meddle with it and you dont want to either for fear youll make it worse gerin nodded at that for he thought the same way himself baivers suddenly grunted a most ungodlike sound could be thats why elabonians latch onto sithonian gods sometimes i suppose theyre born meddlers every one of them and mavrix worse than the others he added with a growl he was angry all right now gerin could but hope he would stay angry till the monsters gods joined the causeif they joined it the fox asked once i go down under ikos how will i summon you back to the world you found a way once baivers said likely tell you can find a way twice and with that he vanished as abruptly as mavrix had but withoutgerin devoutly hopedleaving any progeny behind as they did whenever a god departed the walls of the shack seemed to close in around gerin he sighed long and deep then turned to geroge and tharma i thank you both you did very well there youre going down to ikos selatre said statement not question gerin nodded to her in the same sort of agreement hed given baivers not long before his wife went on and youre going to take geroge and tharma with you after a good many years together with selatre the fox knew how well she thought along with him aye i am he said i see no other choice if im going to treat with the powers under the ground i cant think of better intermediaries than the two of them can you no selatre answered and youre going to take someone else along too duren do you mean gerin said thats a good notion well pass through the holding that was ricolfs and will be his might as well let the barons there have another look at him take duren if you like but i didnt mean him selatre said i meant me dagref and clotild had at last given up their nightly struggle against sleep blestar had drifted off some time before he fought sleep too but had fewer resources than his older sister and brother gerin and selatre generally relished the time when their children were asleep for it gave them their best chance to make love now it gave them the chance to argue without having to explain everything to dagref as they went along gerins argument was simple i need you here he said youll need me more there selatre said almost as if she were still the sibyl at ikos how will you manage to get down to the underground passage that leads to the monsters caves you wont be going down there to ask farseeing biton any question which is the only reason for those who arent priestsor the sibylto enter that passage carlun hasnt told me the whole treasury is empty gerin answered so i expect i can bribe my way down there if i cant talk the priests into letting me go eunuchs love gold why shouldnt they its all they can love yes i suppose you may be able to talk your way or pay your way down thereif you go by yourself selatre said but youre going with geroge and tharma do you think the priests and temple guards will be glad to see monsters after it took a miracle from the god to restore his shrine all right the bribe will have to be bigger gerin said he had seldom been wrong in counting on the greed of his fellow man but selatre shook her head that wont work she said positively oh you may be able to spread enough gold around to let you take the monsters down under the temple if anyone else were trying id say no but youve shown you have a gift for such things she set a hand on his arm to let him know she didnt disapprove but then she went on all right now you have geroge and tharma under the temple you want to meet the rest of the monsters and their gods what do you do then what i have to do the fox replied i break through the wall you break through the charms and spells that keep the monsters from breaking through in the other direction selatre interrupted well yes i would have to because gerins voice trailed away he saw all too clearly the point selatre was making she drove it home anyhow there isnt enough gold in all the northlandsthere isnt enough gold in all the worldto pay the bribes youd need for the priests to let you do that you know it as well as i do her voice brooked no denial she understood him too well to believe for an instant that he didnt know it as well as she did he used the only weapon he had left why would your being there make the priests see things any different because biton spoke through me she said im sibyl no more and by my own choice and glad of it she shifted in the bed getting up on one elbow so she could look at their sleeping children but the god has spoken through me and the priests cannot help but know it if i tell them this must be done they are far more likely to listen to me than they are to you gerin mulled that over youre very annoying when you make good sense he said at last oh why is that selatre asked because it means youre right and im wrong and im going to have to change my plans he told her i dont usually have to do that but i will this time a lot of people wont change their plans even when theyre wrong selatre said im glad youre not one of them a lot of people are fools gerin said if they werent how do you think id have done as well as i have for as long as i have of course he took selatre in his arms it doesnt hurt to find other people who arent fools who me she said just before he kissed her gerin looked back over his shoulder as fox keep disappeared when the road jogged behind a stand of trees i havent felt so nervous about leaving the place behind since i went south to the city of elabon he said thats a long time ago now beside him on the seat in the wagon selatre nodded i didnt think then that i would be the one to replace bitons sibyl when at last the god called her to himself and i certainly never imagined everything that would happen afterward for a moment fondly she let the palm of her hand rest on his leg a little above the knee the wagon was not the only unusual part of the procession of chariots making the journey south along the elabon way in the chariot duren drove stood geroge and tharma exclaiming at every new thing they saw their travels hadnt taken them far from fox keep till now they would be going a good ways nowfarther from home than most serfs traveled in all their lives but for them this was in a way a return to the very root of their race with gerin driving the wagon and duren sharing a chariot with the monsters who had been his friends since childhood van rode with raffo redblade as his driver and drungo dragos son his companion in the car the three of them probably made a fighting team more to be feared than van gerin and duren raffo was in the prime of life and drungo the only warrior among the foxs followers who came close to van for strength another dozen chariots rode with those two that gave gerin enough of a fighting tail to overawe bandits and make petty barons think twice about trying to end his career prematurely if ricolfs former vassals joined together and fell on him his force would not be enough to withstand them but he thought ratkis bronzecaster would be an ally there in any case he had to go through the holding that had belonged to ricolf for the path to ikos branched off the elabon way not far south of it selatre enjoyed the unwinding countryside as much as did geroge and tharma and for the same reason shed not traveled far from fox keep since gerin and van saved her from the monsters and brought her there more than a decade earlier before then her only journey had been from the village where she grew up to ikos to become bitons voice on earth everything she saw seemed fresh and new to her you have no idea how lucky you are being a man she told gerin if you want to go somewhere you up and go and you dont have to worry about it how long has it been since ive been farther from the keep than the village close by i dont know the fox answered but the reason i leave the keep most often is that unfriendly strangersor unfriendly neighborsare trying to take whats mine and so i have the great privilege of giving them the chance to ventilate my carcass in ways the gods didnt intend that may be luck but im not nearly sure its good luck had he said that to elise she would have got angry at him had van said it to fand she not only would have got angry she might have tried ventilating the outlanders carcass in ways the gods didnt intend selatre said i hadnt thought of it that way a little later she added the balance may be more nearly fair than it seemed when ive stayed behind not that it is mind youbut more nearly i love you gerin said which left her looking puzzled but pleased when they camped that night the ghosts were quieter than the fox was used to although the offering he and his men had given themthe blood of a couple of chickens bought from a roadside villagewasnt much for as many men as they had it was like this when we were bringing your lady from ikos up to castle fox too van said to gerin i remember she calms the night spirits that she does thats true gerin said it was like this then he scratched his head on the earlier journey selatre was still a maiden and barely removed from serving as bitons voice on earth her only debarment being that the fox had had to touch her to save her from the monsters unleashed in the earthquake that was a long time ago now and four children ago too though only three still lived if selatre still had the effect on the ghosts that shed had then it meant what that biton still spoke through her if he did hed given no sign of it not in all those years that he still paid attention to her when gerin wondered about that out loud selatre shook her head if the farseeing one still watched over me i would know she said but then her face cloudedor perhaps it was just a trick of the light the fires blending with golden maths nearly round disk a couple of days from full pale nothos smaller gibbous fragment of a circle east of it and ellebs slim young crescent i think i would know it when you were sibyl could you feel the gods presence gerin asked i took it so much for granted i never needed to feel it she answered and then looked thoughtful am i taking his absence so much for granted now im not feeling it either she laughed youve started me wondering well find out the fox said and selatre nodded she had come along because of how useful she might be at ikos and she could be more useful than shed dreamt if biton did still pay attention to her and to what she did gerin hoped the god was paying attention as hed said hed find out before long the guards at the border between bevanders holding and the one that had been ricolfs looked to their weapons when gerin and his companions bore down on them not so long before they would have had those weapons ready to hand for years of civil war among bevander his three brothers and his father had wracked the holding north of them bevander had won with the foxs help and brought quiet to a stretch of land that had known only turmoil for too long who seeks to enter this holding the chief guard called which kept him from having to worry about whether to name it the former holding of ricolf the red or the holding of duren gerins son or to give it some other name altogether gerin approved of playing safe when you had the chance he named himself and duren that made the guards stir before they could say anything he went on we make no claims on this holding now all we are doing here today is passing through on the way to ikos but lord prince the leader of the guards said no one at the castle ofonce ofricolf the red will be ready to receive you we had no word you were planning to come south that had not been accidental its all right the fox answered easily as i said were only passing through no need for anyone to go to any special pains over us he knew that would fluster the guards more than anything else he could say but no help for it one of the troopers spotted geroge and tharma those things he exclaimed i thought we were rid of those things for good the monsters had drawn horrified looks ever since they left the vicinity of fox keep where people were used to them gerin had warned them that would happen in case the reactions of strangers coming to the keep hadnt been warning enough now geroge said i am not a thing are you a thing the guard stared at him the last thing hed expect was for geroge to talk gerin didnt feel like discussing the monstersor anything elsewith the guards looking down his nose at their leader he said do we have your generous permission to pass through they would pass through with or without the border guards generous permission and his face said he knew it ignoring gerins sardonic tone he replied aye pass through in peace and may you learn what you need at ikos duren spoke up thank you give me your name for i value good vassalage that pulled the guard up straighter young lord im orbrin darvans son and pleased to make your acquaintance now he waved the chariots and wagon through with a flourish at vans order raffo steered his chariot up near gerins wagon van said i like that the vassal barons will have a hard time raising any strife against your son if their men feel the way those guards do youre right the fox replied and duren handled him just right too i dont think well have any trouble on the way south as a matter of factnot least because authari and the other leading vassals wont find out weve been here till were already gone what worries me is the trip back from ikos theyll have had time by then to ready whatever they aim to try aye likely so the outlander said well we deal with that when we come to it cant do anything else gerin could only nod hed been thinking the same thing himself seeing the keep of ricolf the red as he did late that afternoon always made him feel strange what with all the memories it brought to the surface seeing that keep with selatre by his side felt stranger still when hed brought her up from ikos ricolf had seen more between them than he had hed put the older mans remarks down to the short temper of a former fatherinlaw but now selatre was his wife of many years and ricolf gone from men things changed he found out how much they had changed when a lookout called the challenge who comes to the castle to be duren gerins sons gerin had been going to answer that challenge when he heard how it was framed he waved to his son instead duren said duren gerins son comes to his own castle not yet to live in it but for a nights shelter that brought the drawbridge down in a hurry the warriors whod lowered it looked much less happy when they saw geroge and tharma in the chariot with duren but by then it was too late between them duren and gerin managed to convince the soldiers the monsters were if not harmless at least unlikely to run wild unless provoked a good look at their teeth gave an incentive against provoking them a lame old fellow name ricrod gondals son was serving as steward for the castle in the absence of a lord in residence he settled gerin and his comrades in the great hall and fed them barley porridge roast duck and ale when gerin poured a libation he wondered if baivers would manifest himself in the hall the god did nothing though as elabonian gods were all too wont to do ghosts crowded the hall for gerinnot the night spirits pacified by blood and held at a distance by fire but ghosts from his own past rihwin drunk and dancing obscenely wolfar of the axe an elabonian as savage as any gradi ricolf the red himself solid steady reliable and elise of whom he still could not think without pangs of regret he glanced over to selatre she had no ghosts here and could not sense his she was the present the reality and better than hed known in days gone by he understood that understanding it though did not make his ghosts vanish they would be with him till he died lord ricrod said what brings you back to this keep your business in the north being unfinished gerin started to answer but realized ricrod had not directed the question at him the steward had not said lord prince and the fox was not lord here duren was he replied im bound for ikos with my father and my companions if the gods are kind it will help end the business in the north the gods gerin sought under the sibyls shrine were unlikely to be kind the less kind they were in fact the more likely they were to be useful to his cause ricrod though nodded and said i hope farseeing biton gives you an answer you can unriddle fast enough for it to do you some good i hope we can use what we learn too duren said he had not said a word about biton hed let ricrod draw his own conclusions then encouraged him to believe they were right all without telling a lie as he did it gerin was impressed he couldnt have handled it any more neatly himself selatre had seen the same thing that night in the chamber the steward had given them she said to gerin hell do well here he handles himself like a man more so here away from fox keep where hes your son first hes ready to rule yes i think so too gerin answered and so do some of the vassal barons here if we win if duren comes down here to take up his grandfathers barony it will feel very strange at fox keep not having him around ill have to start training up dagref see how he shapes selatre laughed quietly it wont be a matter of his not knowing enough to lead men the question will be whether they want to follow him or to wring his neck that is one of the questions the fox agreed laughing then he fell into a thoughtful silence if dagref did shape as a leader of men was gerin to leave his title to his son by selatre and have duren as baron of one small holding overshadowed by his younger half brother or was he to name duren his heir in all matters and leave dagref frustrated and resentful either path could lead to war between them best way to solve the problem gerin thought is not to die the gray spreading in his beard warned him that solution however desirable wasnt practicaland that didnt consider unfriendly weapons at all plenty of trouble around already the fox reminded himself no need to borrow more no telling how dagref would shape if he couldnt lead and duren could nothing gerin did for him would matter after the fox was gone selatre stirred on the rather lumpy bed shed always cared for duren as if he were one of her own and shed never yet pushed for her children at his expense but she couldnt be blind to the ties of blood either one of these days she and gerin would have to hash it out this was not going to be the day though like gerin she recognized that waiting sometimes solved problems better than arguing about them well see selatre said at last and then as if fearing even that might have been too much she added its not that we dont have plenty of other things to see about first oh is that why were here and on our way to ikos gerin said and all the time i thought we were traveling for the fun of it selatre snorted and poked him in the ribs before long lumpy mattress or no they both fell asleep gerin almost missed the standing stone carved with the winged eye that marked the track leading from the elabon way east to the town of ikos and the shrine of biton it served he cursed under his breath every time he wanted to go to the shrine he had to worry about getting lost along the way as before the country between the highway and the forest surrounding the valley of ikos left him dismayed people would be a long time making up for the devastation first from the earthquake and then the monsters the survivors who still struggled to make a go of farming were sadly overworked he would have had more sympathy yet for them had they not been in the habit of sometimes robbing travelers before misfortune had smote when they saw geroge and tharma they fled for the shelter of the woods by their fields they knew all they cared to of monsters one of the things gerin had not thought about was how the enchanted forest around ikos would react to the presence of the monsters the fox rarely missed important details which made his discomfiture when he did all the more acute geroge and tharma stared about with interest when along with gerin and selatre and their companions they plunged into the cool greenness of the track through that forest and under the leafy canopies of its trees the forest seemed to stare too and then to exclaim in outrage ten years before the monsters must have worked outrages untold under those trees and the trees seemed to remember as did all the other strange creatures living in the forest creatures a traveler who stayed on the path never saw but whose presence he often sensed like a prickling at the back of his neck gerin felt more than a prickling now he felt as if the whole forest full of all of those mysterious creatures whatever they were were about to fall on him and his companionsand that when they were done nothing whatever would be left to show hed been rash enough to come this way beside him selatre quivered he wondered what she was feeling before he could asksaying anything here and now took a distinct effort of willshe spoke and loudly by farseeing biton i swear we all she stressed the last word come in peace meaning no harm to this wood or to any in it her words were not swallowed among the thick graybrown boles of the trees as others had been before them instead they seemed to echo and reecho somehow spreading farther from the path than they had any natural business doing after that the feeling of menace vanished far more suddenly than it had grown thank you for winning the argument about whether you should come gerin said selatre seemed as pleased and surprised as he was that workedvery well didnt it she said in a small voice unlike the words of her oath the reply did not ripple outward from the wagon when the fox and his companions emerged from the strange and ancient wood geroge and tharma both sighed with relief i didnt like that place geroge said not after the first little bit it made me feel all funny inside that place makes everyone feel funny inside gerin said then he glanced over to selatre almost everyone and you wonder why dagref has a way of pitching a fit if everything isnt exactly right she said the fox maintained a dignified silence knowing any other response would only leave him vulnerable to more truths from his wife but selatre was looking down into the valley of ikos from the high ground on which they had paused the shrine i see looks as it always didthe god promised it would so of course it mustbut how sad and shrunken the town seems i thought that when i came here to ask you what had become of duren all these years ago gerin answered ikos started to wither when it couldnt draw questioners from south of the high kirs the earthquake and the fires it started made things worse though i wouldnt argue with that as they had earlier in the year the innkeepers of ikos greeted gerin and his comrades with joy pure and unalloyed save perhaps by greed when it seemed as if that greed were about to keep their rates altogether extortionate van scowled at them and said we could just camp out in the open weve got hard bread and smoked sausage and in the gods valley fires should be enough to hold the ghosts at bay reason suddenly reentered the conversation and gerin got his men settled and horses stabled for about what hed expected to pay or perhaps even a bit less so strange selatre said over and over when you come back to a place you knew well you expect it to be as it was when you left it seeing ikos like this she shook her head a temple guardsman a grizzled veteran sat drinking ale in the taproom of the inn gerin had chosen for himself and selatre and for duren and van geroge and tharma when the fellow saw the monsters he coughed and choked and grabbed for his sword gerin had just managed to calm him down when he took a longer look at selatre instead of choking again he went white lady he blurted youre dead farseeing biton has a new voice now farseeing biton has a new voice selatre agreed as for the other clell i thought you were dead too and glad i am to be wrong some few of us did live clell answered when we saw how many monsters came boiling up out from under the shrine we went up into the woods and skulked there like bandits you might say till the day all the monsters disappeared almost all the monsters he amended casting a dubious eye toward geroge and tharma you went up into those woods gerin pointed back at the haunted forest through which hed just passed he leaned forward intense curiosity on his face you couldnt have stayed onyou couldnt have stayed nearthe road that runs through them what is it like in there away from the road its not like anything the temple guard shivered his eyes went wide and faraway i never would have done itnone of us would have done itif it hadnt been a choice between that and the monsters we lived most of us so i guess we did right but his voice trailed off gerin would have probed harder at him but selatre had another question did you chance to see the temple restored when biton worked his miracle and undid the damage from the earthquake lady i did clell replied and his eyes went wider yet i was at the edge of the wood hunting awell one of the creatures that dwells in it a bird you might say for lack of a better word as i drew my bow to shoot at it it fluttered away i glanced down sadly toward the ruins of the great shrine i never saw that for which i thank the farseeing god selatre broke in when the earthquake hit i was in a faint after the last oracle he gave me i remember lady clell paused to drink ale but anyhow there i was figuring id go hungry a while longer and all of a sudden the air started to quiver i was afraid it was another earthquake or the start of one even though the ground wasnt shaking and i looked down at the wreck of what had been the temple and it was quivering too it was like it was coming alive and then in the blink of an eye it was back exactly the way it had been before the monsters were gone too though we needed longer to be sure of that but i havent seen one since till now id have paid golda lot of goldto see that with my own eyes gerin said but since hed caused biton to help mavrix get rid of the monsters and the god had rebuilt the temple in that same sequence of events he supposed he was entitled to some small part of the credit for it clell said most amazing thing ive seen in all my born days except maybe some of the creatures and trees in the woods i wondered if i dared try killing them but when your belly drives you you take the chance and some were good eating and some werent but i managed not to starve to death till farseeing biton stretched out his hand good gerin said im as surprisedand as gladas my wife to learn any of the old guards lived after the monsters came up from under the shrine as yourwife lord prince clell stared first at gerin then at selatre we had heard somewhat of thisat ikos we hear a deal of news though not so much as in the old daysbut hearing and crediting are two different things when you think what the god requires of his sibyls i am sibyl no more as you must know selatre told him and i am now mother of three living children all begot in the regular way and it is by my choice biton would have taken me back when he restored the shrine but i asked him if i might stay where i was and he allowed it not all this news ever reached ikos clell said and gerin believed him for selatre seldom spoke of what had passed between her and biton after the monsters were banished back to their gloomy underground haunts the guardsman took another pull at his ale then said if my asking does not offend what question will you put to the farseeing god when you go below the shrine to meet his sibyl the sibyl he has now i should say were not here to ask farseeing biton anything gerin replied clell was no priest but was a servant of bitons all the same gauging his reactions would give the fox an idea of how the priests would respond were here to treat with whatever gods or powers the monsters reverence the monsters arent gone you knowtheyre just back where they were before the earthquake youre joking clell said gerin and selatre both shook their heads the guardsman delivered another snap judgment youre mad we dont think so selatre said she who had been the sibyl at ikos spoke with a certainty close to that which she had used when biton spoke through her gerin had noted that several times since hed decided to come here and to bring her with him he did not know what it meant he did not know for certain it meant anything he did not even know whether to be awed or frightened or both at once selatres tone inspired respect in clell but no agreement theyll never let you do that he said sounding very certain himself they have the monsters walled and warded off so they can never break free again and if you think im sorry about that youre bloody daft the wards are to keep the monsters from getting out gerin countered they arent intended to stop anyone from going in to them of course they arent clell said nobody in his right mind would want to do such an idiot thing why dyou want to do such an idiot thing anyhow because baivers lord of barley has told me their gods with him offer the northlands the best hope against the gradi and their gods the fox answered i dont know whether that best hope is a good one but i have to find out he wondered whether clell had even heard of the gradi incursion as the guard had said ikos wasnt the center for news it had been in years gone by clell did turn out to know he said if thats true lord prince it may change things but i wouldnt bet anything i didnt care to lose on it im betting everything i have on it gerin answered my holding my family my life the way things are now i dont think i have any other choice do you clell didnt answer not directly what he did say was you poor bastard after a moments reflection gerin decided that fit the situation well enough van rode with gerin and selatre in the wagon as they approached bitons shrine beside them came duren geroge and tharma in the chariot gerins son drove the rest of the warriors stayed back in the town of ikos gerin had not brought enough men to fight his way into the temple precinct if biton opposed him he did not think he could have brought enough men to fight his way into the temple precinct it all looks just as i remember it selatre said but then it would wouldnt it i thank the farseeing god for not letting me see it all tumbled into ruin no one else waited ahead of them to hear what the sibyl would say selatre was used to that her term as bitons voice having begun after the empire of elabon blocked the last remaining pass through the high kirs into the northlands to gerin it still felt strange unnatural he remembered ikos full to bursting with folk from all over the empireand from beyond it as wellcoming to consult the oracle the temple guardsmen stared in horror and what looked like a good deal of fear at the two monsters who rode with duren but the guards did not attack gerins guess was that word of geroge and tharma had already reached them most likely from clell but also perhaps from the innkeeper who ran the hostel where theyd stayed or from anyone who worked with or for him we do come in peace the fox called holding up his right hand to show it was empty the two monsters imitated the gesture you had better said a soldier whose gilded helmet proclaimed him a captain youll be sorry if you dont if we dont take care of that the farseeing god will gerin didnt mention that he hadnt come down to the shrine to talk to biton but to the powers that dwelt below it he did say id like to speak with one of bitons priests to talk over what we need to do on our visit all right the guard captain said he pointed to geroge and tharma you want to take them underground youre going to have to see one of the priests first unless you do it wont happen and thats flat he hadnt called the monsters things though which gerin took for a better sign than most hed had lately one of the guards in a helmet not only ungilded but also unpolished hurried off to find a priest he returned a little later with one of bitons eunuch servants the plump beardless priest bowed and said you may call me lamissio how may i serving biton also serve you the fox nodded at that lamissio made his priorities plain gerin also approved of his taking no outward notice of geroge and tharma who by his bearing might have been a couple of troopers rather than a couple of monsters thus encouraged gerin explained to the priest exactly what he had in mind lamissio heard him out which raised his hopes further but then the eunuch shook his head the soft flabby flesh of his jowls wobbling as he did so this cannot be he said item those not affiliated with the temple are not allowed below it save only to consult with the sibyl in her subterranean chamber but gerin began i heard you out in full lord prince lamissio said have the courtesy to extend me the same privilege challenged so gerin had no choice but to bow his head in acquiescence the eunuch ticked off successive points on his stubby fingers item creatures of the kind of these two he pointed to geroge and tharma are not permitted within the holy precinct for any reason whatsoever were no more creatures than you are tharma said if her speaking surprised lamissio he did not show it that is true he said gravely but you are no less creatures than i am either while tharma pondered that lamissio went on item any meddling with the wards restraining creatures of the kind of these two is forbidden on pain of death even were the other two difficulties abated by that gerin concluded he meant he might have been bribed into letting the monsters into the temple precinct and even into the underground passages below the shrine but that he would not let the fox try to meet with their kin no matter what are you sure you wont be reasonable he asked the temple would benefit from this the temple would be endangered lamissio countered that is unacceptable we were lucky enough when farseeing biton restored the shrine with one miracle we may not rely on his giving us two he had a point but gerin had a point of his own if we dont treat with the powers that may dwell with the monsters down below bitons shrine all the northlands will need a miracle to restore them this grieves me the eunuch said what happens beyond the shrine though and especially what happens beyond this valley is not my concern i have to look to my own first look to your own long enough and youll soon be looking at gradi swarming out of the woods gerin said i doubt that lamissio replied with great confidence confidence that considering those woods might well have been justified gerin corrected himself swarming down the path i should say and before too long swarming up from the south where the woods dont protect you i do not think this likely lamissio said did he sound smug yes he did the fox decided why not van demanded did they take your brains along with your balls you will speak to the servant of farseeing biton with the respect his position deserves lamissio said his voice cold as a winter night in gradihome im not speaking to your position van retorted im speaking to you if you talk like an idiot im going to let you know it lamissio gestured to the temple guards they hefted their weapons and made as if to surround gerin and his comrades stop that the command came not from the fox not from the outlander but from selatre it was not loud but most authoritative and the temple guards stopped what is the meaning of this lamissio demanded who are you woman to he checked himself looking cautious wait you are she who was once the voice of biton on earth thats right selatre said and added with a certain relish i trust you will treat me with the respect my position deserves that was probably a mistake gerin knew he wouldnt have said it at any rate flicking a priest on his dignity was only likely to make him angry and angrily lamissio said and what position is that you who have polluted yourself by contact with a whole man be careful with your mouth priest gerin warned but selatre held up her hand i will tell you what my position is when biton remade this shrine after the earthquake cast it down he purposed restoring me to the sibyls throne that is simple truth if you like you may inquire of the sibyl that is through her the farseeing god will tell you the same if biton was satisfied enough to want to retain me as his instrument though i was then no longer untouched no longer even maiden who are you priest to question me lamissio licked his lips but you are not sibyl now he said more a question than a contradiction for it was obvious selatre intended to permit no contradiction no i am not sibyl now she agreed but by my choice i am not sibyl not by bitons though the farseeing god was generous enough not to force me back into a place i had outgrown if you are not sibyl and it is by your own choice why should we pay you any heed the priest asked because even though i am sibyl no more the god spoke truth through me selatre answered has the god spoken through you lamissio the eunuch priest did not answer the temple guardsmen muttered among themselves they made no further move to surround the chariot and wagon a couple of them in fact stepped back toward where they had been gerin said can we talk about this like a couple of reasonable men only after the words left his mouth did he realize the answer could be something other than yes of course himself reasonable to the core he had come to see over the years how unreasonable so many people were though their lack of reason struck him as being unreasonable in and of itself and priests by the very nature of their calling were more apt to incline toward what they saw as following their gods dictates than toward thinking out what was best for them to do and how am i different he asked himself while waiting for lamissios reply why am i here if not at the advice of a god to recruit other gods to oppose still other gods but there was a difference lamissio not only accepted that biton was more powerful than he but made that fact the cornerstone of his being gerin accepted the gods superior strengthhe could scarcely have done otherwisebut did everything he could to exploit their rivalries and blind spots to build as much freedom for himself as he could slowly lamissio said i shall do this lord prince not for your sakefor you are a mere manbut for the sake of the lady to whom you are wed through whose lips the words of the god once sounded thank you the fox answered and said no more the priests reasons were his own so long as they gave gerin what he wanted or a chance to get what he wanted he would not make an issue of them selatre accepted lamissios acquiescence as no more than her due she also accepted it without the slightest hint of itoldyouso aimed at gerin the fox took that for granted till van whispered behind his hand if fand ever got me out of a scrape like that dyou think shed let me forget it not bloody likely no doubt the outlander was right fand came first with fand first last and always selatre put the good of the principality ahead of her own selfimportance without a second thought im lucky gerin thought not for the first time hoping to benefit his own cause he asked lamissio shall we move the discussion to the forecourt of the temple he pointed to the opening in the marble wall surrounding the temple precinct but the eunuch priest shook his head as i told you it is not permitted that creatures of their kind he pointed once more to geroge and tharma enter the holy grounds thats foolish geroge said if what weve heard is true there are lots of creatures like tharma and me right under your silly temple how are you keeping them out and if you cant keep them out why fuss over us lamissio opened his mouth then shut it again without saying anything geroge might not have been reasonable but a lifetime lived with gerin had shown him how to reason for a monster he was clever even for a human being he wouldnt have been stupid and he had a childs directness to him i had not thought of it like that the priest admitted winning gerins respect as he did so we do not thinkwe do not like to thinkof the monsters still under bitons shrine we have walled them away with bricks and with magic charms and we have walled them away with forgetfulness too letting these two come onto the temple grounds would be a way of remembering then gerin said and if it displeases biton the god has ways of making that known without going through priests or guards the fox knew that was true biton smote with a loathsome and fatal curse those who tried to steal his treasures from within the sacred precinct asking geroge and tharma to pass inside that marble wall put them in some danger but gerin could not believe biton would reckon them a worse threat to the northlands than the gradi and their gods you would have made a formidable priest lord prince lamissio said maybe gerin said though he aimed to profit himself first and the gods only afterwards and as he had to he also contemplated with something less than eager enthusiasm the mutilation lamissio had suffered so he could serve biton and the sibyl selatre said will you let uswill you let all of usenter the temple precinct lamissio no one will seek to harm or steal anything inside very well the priest said which made several of the guardsmen give him surprised stares he went on as you say and as i find impossible to deny biton has the power to punish these monsters should that prove his will of course he does gerin said reassuringly he banished them underground didnt he what he said was true what he didnt say was that banishing the monsters back to haunts in which theyd dwelt for ages was different from destroying a couple of them if lamissio couldnt figure that out for himself that was his lookout a couple of temple guards came up to take charge of the wagon and the chariot in which gerin and his companions had approached the shrine of the farseeing god lamissio led gerin and selatre van and duren and geroge and tharma inside the gleaming white wall delimiting the temple precinct no hideous blight fell on the two monsters gerin breathed a silent sigh of relief at that selatre breathed something too all the same its all the same unlike gerin and van she had no memory of its ever being different like them and like duren too she had seen the treasures displayed outside the temple past a glance to make sure they were the same too she concentrated on the business at hand to geroge and tharma though the statues of painted marble and of gold and ivory the bronze pots on golden tripods the stacked ingots of gold were all new and marvelous pretty tharma said in a voice halfway between a growl and a croon for the first time a couple of the temple guards smiled at her having talked lamissio into letting the monsters into the temple precinct gerin hoped for further success the sooner we can go down under the shrine the sooner well be able to start driving the gradi and their gods out of the northlands he said a sentence with enough unexamined assumptions in it to give a sithonian logician a bad case of dyspepsia it made lamissio dyspeptic too this cannot be he declared i said as much before were you not listening we do not allow visitors below the shrine save on their journey to the sibyl and we most of all do not allow the wards holding the monsters at bay to be tampered with lest those monsters flood out into the world at large as they did a decade ago aye thats a risk van rumbled but the cursed gradi are already loose in the world at large they may not have sharp teeth like geroge and tharma here but i dont want em for neighbors i know nothing of the gradi and care to learn nothing the priest replied i know the monsters required bitons personal intervention to be bundled back into their caves once more and i know the destruction they worked here and in the town and all through this valley and i will not see its like repeated as far as he was concerned the temple the town of ikos and the valley in which they lay might have been the whole world if they stayed safe he cared nothing for what happened in the rest of the northlands duren saw that as plainly as gerin think past the valley he told lamissio a glance at the eunuchs face told gerin the plea was in vain lamissios mental horizon had no stretch in it what to do then the fox couldnt take lamissio aside and try to bribe him into cooperation though he had planned to do just that the temple guardsmen were obviously as leery as the priest about loosing the monsters once more and for all gerin knew their fear was liable to be justified he was far from sure of his own course despite baivers urging all he knew for certain was that so long as he could find a blow to strike against the gradi and voldar he would try with everything in him to strike it and would worry later about what came afterwards but he could not storm the temple not if biton did not care to permit it if lamissio remained inflexible he was thwarted and lamissio could have been no more inflexible had he been carved from basalt like bitons ancient image in the temple dejected the fox turned to go to try to figure out what other ploys he could find against the gradi wait selatre said suddenly in a voice not quite her own gerin turned toward her her eyes were wide and staring and looked straight through him when she spoke again it was in the powerful baritone gerin had heard before the voice biton used in speaking through his sibyls let the travelers go below that they may learn what powers show the land is wide the powers deep shall they now a bargain keep through sibyl past i speak out now to say to learn this i allow x when the god abandoned possession of selatre she staggered as if stunned gerin put an arm around her steadying her and keeping her from falling she looked around in surprise did i say something she asked what did i say that was the farseeing god one of the temple guardsmen said his voice clotted with awe no one elsethe lord biton biton selatres eyes opened very wide did the lord biton speak through me she seemed to be taking mental stock it might be so i feel the way i did whenafter she stopped in confusion but he couldnt have he did gerin said he let his hand tighten for a moment we all heard it his companions and the guards nodded he repeated the verses that had come from her mouth adding not much doubt about what they mean either he was looking straight at lamissio of all those present when the mantic fit hit selatre only bitons priest doubted it was genuine how could the farseeing god speak through a vessel he himself discarded lamissio said how could he speak through a woman not a maiden but the guard who had first acknowledged that biton was speaking through selatre answered gods make rules and gods break rules too thats what makes them gods and the prince of the north has the right of it here too no way to mistake the meaning of the oracular response not all the response was clear gerin saw that even if no one else did biton had given him leave to go down under the shrine and bargain with whatever powers were associated with the monsters he had not said those powers would keep any bargain once made van took a step toward lamissio plainly intending to force his cooperation if he could get it no other way gerin started to step away from selatre to block the outlander before he could duren did their eyes met for a moment the fox knew he and his son were seeing the same thing that if even the guardsmen recognized that biton had rules or no rules filled selatre for a moment the priest could not help but give way and so it proved muttering something ungracious under his breath lamissio said very well it shall be as you sayand pray the farseeing god will permit no disasters to spring from it then his dour front tottered and collapsed as the temple behind him had during the earthquake a decade before the god has expanded my notion of the possible he murmured which struck gerin as far from the worst way to phrase it van had let duren hold him away from lamissio but he hadnt been happy about it now he growled you expand my notion of time wasting take us down there and quit dawdling about it it shall be as you say lamissio answered in the face of the words of the god i serve how could it be otherwise but there shall be one more brief delay van growled again this time dangerously lamissio held up a plump hand the sibyl has already taken her place in the chamber below the shrine i shall send one of my colleagues down there to bring her forth should the worst befall and the monsters break loose once more would you have her trapped in that chamber with them between her and safety that left van with nothing to say his gesture might have meant get on with it the priest went into the shrine gerin meanwhile turned to the temple guardsmen youd better be ready at the mouth of the underground opening if we dont come up and the monsters do your best bet is to try to hold them below ground if they spread over the land again he didnt go on he didnt need to go on time seemed to crawl by very slowly how long did a priest need to go down to the sibyl and come back with her at last after what seemed much too long a time a eunuch came out with the maid who had given gerin and duren the oracular response earlier in the year she and selatre stared at each other gerin saw the shock of recognition run through both of them as each knew the other for what she was the sibyl nodded to selatre then let the eunuch lead her away lamissio came out of bitons shrine and beckoned the fox and his companions forward as she walked up to the temple selatre said more to herself than to anyone else i never dreamt i would come here and oh i never dreamt the god would speak to me speak through me again amazing her face glowed as if a lamp had been lighted inside her walking along with her gerin quietly worried she had forsaken the god for him but now that biton had returned to her would she still care about the merely human the only way to find out was to wait and see that would not be easy any other choice though looked worse geroge and tharma exclaimed in wonder at the magnificent ornamentation within bitons shrine lamissio stood waiting near the black basalt cult statue with the jutting phallus and near the rift in the ground through which supplicants descended to the sibyls caveor as now to a journey and a fate apt to be blacker than any found there i think our usual rituals no longer apply the eunuch priest said we are not going into the depths of the earth to see the sibyl nor even to treat with the farseeing god in any way all we can pray for now is our own safety you dont have to come with us lamissio gerin said youre liable to be safer if you dont in fact but the priest shook his head i am in my place the god has permitted this i leave my fate with him gerin bowed honoring his courage come then he said as he strode toward the rift in the ground opening onto the hidden ways that ran deep underground he glanced at the cult statue of biton for a moment the eyes scratched into the living rock came alive the god he thought was looking out at him then as they had before on other visits to the shrine bitons eyes faded back into the hard black stone or they faced into the stone for him at any rate selatre murmured thank you farseeing one as she drew near the image and seemed to speak more intimately than she would have to basalt alone lamissio picked up a torch and lighted it at one of those near the entrance to the caves then long robe flapping about his ankles he walked down the stone steps that led into the cavern gerin took a deep breath and followed sunlight vanished quickly at the first turn of the path after that the torch lamissio carried and those stuck in sconces set into the wall gave the only light geroge and tharma whooped with glee at the way their shadows swooped and fluttered in the moving flickering light keep an eye on them van muttered to gerin i am the fox answered also under his breath caves and the underground were the monsters native haunts or at least the haunts of their kind if their blood called to them this was where they were liable to revert to the bloodthirsty ways of which the aboveground world had seen all too much eleven years before for now they showed no sign of any such reversion only fascination with a place whose like theyd never seen some passages in the tunnel that led to the sibyls cave were walled off because they held more treasures than bitons priests displayed outside the shrine some were walled off because they held the monsters at bay magical wards set before them reinforced brick and mortar one of those walls was made of bricks in the shape of loaves of bread a marker of very ancient brickwork indeed actually the fox reminded himself the wall was no older than any other part of the shrine and underground caverns having been restored by biton after the earthquake but so far as he could tell the farseeing gods restoration had been as perfect here as elsewhere so the wall might as well have beenin effect wasas ancient as it looked wait he called to lamissio who had gone a few steps down toward the sibyls chamber his voice echoed oddly along the winding corridor the priest came back the torch he carried gave the only light as those in the brackets ahead of the wall and beyond it had burned out with a deep breath like the one he had drawn when he entered the caverns gerin said i think this is the place very well this is the place lamissio said his round pale face was far and away the brightest thing visible what now i dont quite know gerin answered some of the magical wards lay on the stone floor in front of the wall others hung from cords or lengths of sinew set into the rock above it methodically the fox kicked away the ones on the floor and knocked down those hanging in front of the wall the wall itself remained solid and strong despite the oddly shaped bricks what now van asked as lamissio had he hefted his spear the bronzeshod butt would make a fair prybar but was not really the right tool with which to go knocking down a wall shall we shout up to the guardsmen for some picks i dont know gerin said again i dont think well need to do that selatre said in a small strained voice lamissio gasped the torchlight showed his face even paler than it had been all at once gerin realized they would not have to break down the wall what waited on the other side knew the wards were down and was coming to see what had happened and what it could make of what had happened the torch lamissio held flared and then went out plunging the corridor into perfect darkness because he was effectively blinded gerin was never sure afterwards how much of what followed took place down below bitons shrine and how much in the peculiar space the gods could travel but mortals most often could not wherever the place was it didnt strike him as pleasant he felt himself weighed measured tested in the silent black after what might have been a moment and might have been some much longer time the monsters powershe got the idea more than one of them was communicating with himinserted a question into his mind it was a simple question one he himself might have asked under the same circumstances what are you doing here seeking aid against the gods of the gradi he answered another pause followed what are the gradi who are their gods marshaling his thoughts in the midst of this blackness was hard it was as if he had trouble remembering what vision meant how it was used as best he could though he pictured everything he knew not only about the gradi but also about voldar and the rest of their gods they are only another band of you dirtwalking things some of the powers that dwelt in darkness said scornfully but now the fox heard other voices too these saying for dirtwalkers they seem strong and fierce they are warlike gerin said they will even kill themselves to keep from being captured captured what is captured the monsters powers did not understand that the monsters did not fight for booty or for slaves what they were after was prey when the fox mentally explained as best he could they seemed partly amused partly horrified the voices in the dark spoke all together now these gradi are right you kill or you are killed otherwise you do not fight not everyone up on the surface would agree with you gerin said like everything else enmity has degrees no the voices of the unseen powers dinned in his head shrieking out their denial they must have dinned in everyone elses head too for with his ears rather than his mind he heard lamissio whimpering in fright frightened as he was himself he could hardly blame bitons servant but he kept up a bold front saying i speak the truth if i did not speak the truth i would have slain geroge and tharma here when they came into my hands for their kind was and had been the enemy of my people that made the voices divide again some of them said you should have slain them while others said good you left them alive after that division the voices snarled at one another gerin could not understand all or even much of that he got the idea they were disagreeing among themselves he hoped they were getting help from even some of them would be better than nothing some of the voices seemed to fall silent after a while others said in ragged chorus this he and she you have with you they are a strangeness not all of our kind not all of yours yes a strangeness proving we dont have to be foes your kind and mine gerin said he didnt know if it proved any such thing raising geroge and tharma hed had every possible advantage on his side hed got them as infants they were clever as monsters went which let them perform more like human beings than many of their fellows could have done and there had been no other monsters around to distract them and perhaps lead them away from mankind why should we join you and your god of dirtplants against the gradi things the voices demanded the answer gerin had braced himself to giveto keep yourselves from being overrundid not seem good enough to offer here he stood silent for a dangerously long time trying to come up with a response that might satisfy these ferocious powers he felt them gathering around him ready to snuff out his life as they had snuffed out lamissios torch and then van said why ill tell you why you bloodthirsty things the gradi and their gods are just about as nasty as you are thats why thats what the fox has been telling you all along if only youd listen where else are you going to find such good fighting a spell of silence followed gerin wondered whether van should have kept quiet if the monsters powers joined forces with the gradi gods they could easily wrest control of the northlands from the elabonians and trokmoi and their deities hed never thought he would reckon the trokmoi as standing on the side of civilization but he had new standards of comparison these days at last the voices spoke again this is so foes worth fighting are a boon worth having we will bargain for the chance to measure ourselves against them for the chance to meet them with teeth and claws a bargain duren murmured gerin was pleased too but less than he might have been it was a bargain aye but one biton had not promised these subterranean powers would keep the monsters loosed on the northlands once more would be a problem as bad as the gradi but the gradi were a certaintythey were loose in the northlands now the monsters were only a possibility gerin said very well here are the terms of the bargain i propose we will leave this breach in the wards open until i return to fox keep and summon baivers once more then you and he will fight the gradi gods doing your best to defeat them he waited for the monsters powers to demand access to the surface in exchange for their help with the breach in the wards down they could hardly be deprived of itnot by him at any rate although biton might have something to say in that regard if the powers dwelling down here were on good terms with him though he dared hope the monsters might not prove so vicious as they had on their first eruption from the caves none of those sometimes agreeing sometimes arguing voices said anything about that instead speaking all together they rumbled it is a bargain gerin stared though in complete darkness that had no point maybe van had had the right of it after all and the powers here wanted nothing more than a good brawl still with bitons verses fresh in his memory he asked how shall we seal this bargain so we know both sides can be sure it is good that brought on more silence the silence gerin judged of surprise when the monsters gods answered it was again in chorus bargains have only one seal the seal of blood and bone now wait a minute gerin said in some alarm if he agreed to that without defining its limits the underground powers were free to seize and rend him or any and all of his companions but he was too late somewhere in the darkness close by a harsh hoarse scream rang out the seal of blood and bone the powers repeated what we agreed we will do it is sealed my tooth someone groaned geroge the fox realized after a moment they tore out my tooth blood and bone the subterranean gods said yet again that one is blood of our blood but he is bone of your bone for you raised him and his sister that we take from him is fitting and while we take we also give something was pressed into gerins hand which closed around it all at once lamissios torch began to burn once more the fox looked down he discovered he was holding the last two joints of a hairy clawed finger the blood from which stained his own hand he almost threw the severed digit away with a cry of disgust but in the end tucked it into a pouch on his belt instead as security that the underground gods would live up to the bargain they had made that done he went to see geroge who had both hands clutched to his muzzle the monsters blood ran between his fingers and dripped to the floor let me look at you gerin told him and gently separated geroges hands come on open your mouth moaning geroge obeyed sure enough only a bloody socket showed where his right top fang had been it hurts he saidalmost unintelligibly because he kept his mouth wide open all the time so the fox could see im sure it does gerin said patting him on the shoulder when we get back to the inn you can have all the ale you like that will help dull the pain and after we get back to fox keep and youre healed ill get you a new fang all of gold and have it fixed with wires to the teeth on either side it wont be as good as the one you gave to the gods here but it should be better than nothing a gold tooth tharma said plainly trying to picture that in her mind she nodded approval youll look fine with a gold tooth geroge youll look splendid do you think so he asked he was trying to adjust to the idea too suddenly absurdly he began to preen well maybe i will gerin turned to lamissio take us up now were done here he pointed to the magical wards hed disturbed and leave those down you may be able to trap the monsters gods down below if you restore them but i know the northlands will have bad luck if you do and i dont think the shrine and the valley would long be better for it either lord prince there i think you have nothing but reason the eunuch priest answered it shall be as you say i promise and now again as you say let us return to the realm of light he propelled his bulky frame up the path at a better pace than the fox had thought he had in him temple guards crowded bitons shrine they peered down anxiously into the rift in the earth leading down into the caves when lamissio called to them their exclamations of relief were loud and voluble no monsters at your heels the captain in the gilded helm asked only the two who accompanied us the priest replied the underground gods tore a tooth from one which he bore bravely it was so far as gerin could remember the first good thing hed had to say about geroge and tharma let us by if you please gerin said and the guards did step aside though they kept watching the caves mouth as if fearing surprise attack the fox did not suppose he could blame them for that more guardsand a bewildered suppliantcrowded the precinct outside the shrine itself lamissio asked lord prince with the wards down do you think it safe for the sibyl to return to her chamber and deliver the words of the god to those who come seeking them gerin shrugged ask biton if he doesnt know what point in worshipping him a point lamissio said a distinct point he stopped at the entranceway set into the white marble fence around the temple precinct one of the more unusual mornings in my years of service to the god unusual thats a word as good as any and better than most i do thank you for your help there gerin said politely failing to mention that lamissio had needed to have his god order him to help before he got moving and did it on the way back to the village selatre said biton spoke through me againhe spoke through me she said it several times as if trying to convince herself gerin kept quiet if biton had spoken through her once now would he do it again and again if he did would selatre decide she preferred him to the fox and if she did that what could he do about it nothing as he knew perfectly well if you fought a god straight out you lost why are you worrying he asked himself but here for once he knew the answer when a woman youve loved runs off with a horseleech youre less inclined to take the world on trust than you used to be alongside having biton speak through her selatre had a gift for fathoming gerins silences after a while she said you dont need to fear for me on account of biton i know where i want to be and why and set a hand on his arm he set his own hand on hers for a moment then walked on when he and his companions got back into the town of ikos the warriors hed brought with him crowded round wanting to know every detail of their visit to the sibyls shrine they made much of geroge and the courage with which he bore the loss of his fang wouldnt want one of my teeth yanked out like that drungo dragos son declared and they arent near as big as yours as gerin had promised he let the monster have all the ale he could drink geroge grew boisterous in a friendly sort of way made hideous attempts at singing and eventually fell asleep at the table van and drungo who had also both had a good deal of ale carried him upstairs to bed when gerin and selatre went up to their own chambers a little later she barred the door something he usually did then quickly and with obvious determination she got out of her clothes come to bed she said and come to bed he did most times making love solved nothing it just meant you didnt think about things for a while drifting toward sleep afterwards gerin was glad to have found an exception to the rule the fox and his comrades entered with imperfect enthusiasm the holding that had belonged to ricolf gerin would have been happiest scooting through that holding seeing no one and getting back to lands where he was suzerain as he had discovered a good many times in lifeselatre being the splendid exceptionwhat made him happiest was not commonly what he got a goodsized force of chariotry quite a bit larger than his own waited for him not far south of ricolfs keep at its head was authari brokentooth gerin nodded unsurprised we have no quarrel with you and yours authari he called when he recognized the baron who had been ricolfs leading vassal get out of our way and let us pass i think not authari answered dont be foolish the fox told him remember the oath you and your fellow barons swore like chicken or fish oaths go stale quickly authari said what with the indolence of the elabonian gods authari had a point however much gerin wished he didnt but the elabonian gods werent the only ones loose in the land these days gerin pointed to the west where thick gray clouds nothing like those usually seen in summer were building up he feared stribog had at last recovered from what mavrix had done to him if you get rid of me the only ones who will thank you are the gradi and their gods ill take that chance too authari said easily with you out of the way i can afford to worry about them next no duren said not to that last comment but to everything authari had said one comprehensive word of rejection even if your men win a fight here you will not follow my grandfather as baron to this holding oh why is that pup authari asked still with mild amusement because all the men here will make straight for your car authari duren answered your men may win as i say but you will not live to enjoy it the mild smile slipped from autharis face he did not have enough warriors with him to make it certain that gerins men could not live up to the threat he could not hang back from the fighting either not unless he wanted his own soldiers to turn on him as soon as it was over stand aside and let us go gerin told him at the same time he sent his son an admiring glance he couldnt have come up withand hadnt come up witha better way to throw authari offbalance offbalance the baron certainly was had he ordered a hard charge the moment he spotted gerins little force he could have crushed them before theyd hit on that way of fighting back but hed hesitated as he had the earlier time when the fox and duren entered his territory now he licked his lips trying to make a choice that would have come naturally to a more ruthless man van pointed to the west too but not to the building clouds whose friends are those i wonder he said chariots were heading crosscountry toward the elabon way and toward the brewing trouble on it wacho has his holding in that direction gerin said so does ratkis bronzecaster i think he smiled over at authari isnt that interesting authari didnt answer he didnt smile either he set his jaw and looked grimbut again not grim enough to order combat before the newcomers whoever they were arrived if they were wachos men hed roll over gerins small band all the more easily if they werent they werent heading up enough chariots to counterbalance autharis force ratkis approached the standoff he waved to gerin i didnt hear from ricrod youd passed through till day before yesterday he said i thought it would be good to see you on your way back i think its good to see you gerin said he smiled again at authari dont you think its good to see him too i can think of people id rather have seen authari growled he clapped his driver on the shoulder the fellow flicked the reins the horses strode a couple of paces forward gerin grabbed for his bow then the driver swung the team into a turn they started rolling away authari shouted angrily to his men they followed hello there gerin said to ratkis if youd turned out to be wacho id have been very embarrassed ratkis shook his head i doubt it lord prince hard to embarrass a dead man a point a distinct point gerin said as lamissio had earlier he looked westward wondering if he would see wacho and his warriors riding uplike wacho to be late he thought no new army was coming but the clouds piled there were getting thicker and darker and spreading over more of the sky that probably did mean stribog was feeling chipper again and probably also meant the gradi and their gods were ready for another push against the trokmoi and the elabonians ratkis said an oath is an oath once youve sworn it you cant go forgetting it he held up a hand no i take that back you can but youd better not the gods dont like it he had more faith in the gods than gerin did which probably meant he had less knowledge about their present condition the more fervent believers the elabonian gods had the likelier they were to take a more active part in the world a year earlier gerin would have thought that a disaster at the moment it looked distinctly attractive ratkis said shall we ride with you a little ways i wouldnt mind that gerin allowed together the two groups passed by the keep that had been ricolfs without stopping not fully trusting ricrod any more gerin preferred to shelter in a peasant village for the night the sun was sinking into that thick bank of building clouds when the fox spotted a fairsized force of chariotry approaching the elabon way from the east whoever was leading that forcehildic was a good bet he thoughtsaw the size of his contingent too and turned around and rode back in the direction from which hed come another scavenger out to see what dead meat he could find ratkis remarked and leaned out over the rail of his chariot to spit down onto the paving stone of the elabon way youre probably right gerin said no youre certainly right weve gone past wachos keep and he doesnt live east of the road anyhow besides i didnt get the idea that wacho picked up news in a hurry or was likely to figure out what to do about it if he did hear something right on both counts lord prince ratkis said with a chuckle he rode on in silence for a little while then asked why are you watching me out of the corner of your eye gerins cheeks heated you werent supposed to notice he muttered that wasnt answer enough though and he knew it he sighed you have more men here than i do ratkis i want to make sure youre not going to try to get me all cozy and then jump on me like a starving longtooth i thought that was it ratkis answered but like i said i swore an oath to your son so youve got nothing to worry about there duren will be lucky to have you for a vassal gerin said he did not tell ricolfs former vassal that he always worried whether he seemed to need to or not if ratkis got to know him better hed find that out for himself here though for once he did not need to worry by the time they made camp he was close to lands that recognized his suzerainty and all ratkis men did that night was drink ale along with his and leer at the goodlooking young women of the peasant village where they lay over after fear going down below the shrine at ikos to call on the underground powers after more fear on the road earlier in the day with still more fear ahead the fox treasured that small stretch of peace of mind he wondered whenor ifhe would find another cold rain drummed down on the canvas cover of the wagon and soaked gerin as he drove up to fox keep the wind out of the west had a bite it wasnt the blizzard stribog and the other gradi gods had blown up against the army he and adiatunnus led against them but it didnt feel like an ordinary summer storm either he scowled some rain now was fine normal too much rain and hed have a disaster on his hands even if the gradi stayed at home he and his comrades had to come close to the keep and shout up to the men on the walls so those warriors could recognize their voices before the drawbridge came down with a wet squelching slap welcome back lord prince rihwin the fox called as gerin came in sorry we were so slow but we couldnt be sure you werent gradi trying a sneak in the rain im not angry gerin said the opposite in fact any small bits of caution rihwin showed were to be encouraged nurtured praised in the hope they would grow the longer gerin knew rihwin the less likely that was he knew as much but had never been a man to give up easily what luck had you lord prince rihwin asked geroge and tharmas kind have gods gerin answered which produced startled exclamations from several men who heard him they say theyll fight alongside baivers and us well know more tomorrow why tomorrow rihwin said because thats when i intend to get magicking again gerin said rihwin gaped at him he ignored that continuing id do it today but after we get the horses stabled im going to have to spend the rest of the day readying what ill need and studying the spells i intend to try rihwin was still gaping gerin condescended to notice him aye rihwin for once im as headlong as you this storm tells me we have no time to waste its too much like what we saw west of the venien the gradi are all too likely to use it as a cloak to hide whatever they intend to do till theyre set to do it whatever you say lord prince rihwin assured him though his fellow fox still looked somewhat dazed gerin had no time to worry about that either he jumped down from the wagon then had to grab at it when he slipped in the mud once his own footing was secure he handed selatre down their children came running out of the keep to greet them gerin hugged dagref clotild and blestar in turn so did selatre but then she said now get back indoors this instant before you catch cold that led to noisy protests from all three children and what looked suspiciously like deliberate falls in the mud by dagref and blestar dagref declared his innocence before the world when selatre shouted at him blestar as yet unpracticed in deceit merely got up and ran dripping into the castle shaking his head gerin went into the castle too hed been wet for a good long while already and enjoyed changing into a dry tunic and trousers he knew the spell that had brought baivers to him but reviewed it in the library all the same a mistake might mean the gods failure to appear which might mean the northlands going under selatre poked her head into the library saw him busy and slipped away when she came back she set sausage bread and a jack of ale at his elbow hed eaten the food and almost emptied the jack before he noticed they were there and thought back on how theyd arrived when he studied he studied hard as far as baivers was concerned he was ready bringing forth the monsters gods was a different business altogether he had no invocation specifically intended to do that whatever dealings with those powers mankind had had till now were designed to keep them under control and far away not to bring them forth considering his meeting with them he understood that down to the groundand down under it too desperation though drove him to turn the usual way of doing things on its head he got parchment and quill and ink and began adapting the spells of repulsion into ones that would draw the monsters the spells he was crafting had not been refined by trial and errorothers error corrected by mages who had observed and survived their colleagues failure that increased his risk in another way and he knew it if his own creations had flaws the only way he would find out about it was the hardest way possible he looked up at the timbers of the ceiling if i had a choice i wouldnt be doing this he told them they didnt answer he suspected that was because they already knew along with selatre and duren van and geroge and tharma gerin squelched through the mud of the courtyard toward the shack that doubled as his sorcerous laboratory cold rain still fell stubbornly steadily out of a leaden sky as if it had looked around decided it liked the country and settled in to stay gerin patted his chest he was carrying inside his undertunic the spells hed written to make sureor as sure as he couldthe rain didnt land on them and soak them into illegibility the roof of the shack leaked normally he didnt worry about such things today they were liable to matter hed been out there before getting everything ready for the conjurations he would attempt barley ale and porridge for summoning baivers and other things for summoning the monsters gods one of the other things a billy goat bleated as he and his comrades came in hed tied it to a post with a rope so short it couldnt chew itself free its gaze was fixed on the barley on the worktable which it could see and smell but could not reach sorry old fellow he told the goat it bleated again indignantly he ignored it pouring ale for himself and for geroge and tharma after theyd drunk it he got to work summoning baivers come forth he called when the spell was done come forth lord baivers come forth come forth come forth for a moment he wondered if he would have the same difficulty making the god notice him as hed known the time before but then the shack seemed to get bigger inside without enlarging on the outside the sure mark of a gods presence i am here baivers said and the stalks of barley that did duty for his hair rustled softly his green green eyes took in the interior of the shack they rested on the billy goat none too kindly gerin thought for a goat could wreak havoc in the fields you have all in readiness to summon the other powers the powers from under the ground lord baivers i hope i do gerin answered a statement true on several different levels begin then baivers said we have little time to lose the gradi gods are reaching out greedy as grasshoppers can you feel them yes gerin said he reached under his tunic and drew out the spells he had hastily devised he started to shield the parchment from drips from the roof with his hand then realized it hadnt leaked since baivers came forth an unexpected advantage of the gods presence now he wished hed drunk no ale a slip in the spells summoning baivers might well not have been fatal a slip in the spells he was trying now surely would be geroge and tharma watched him their deepset eyes wide as he incanted what were they thinking theyd said little on the way up from ikos by which he could judge how theyd taken their first meeting with the gods who ruled their own kind he shook his head though the motion had nothing to do with the magic he was working even the monsters gods had said geroge and tharma were neither fully of their kind nor of mankind he wondered how those gods would have responded to his overtures had he slain the two monsters as cubs as hed been sorely tempted to do he was glad he didnt have to find out maybe that relief helped steady him whatever the reason he managed to get through the chants and intricate passes of the spells unscathed nothing in those hastily adapted chants had either loosed the monsters gods on the northlands or provoked them to eat them up he reckoned that a triumph the powers though still remained unsummoned let the blood bring them hither he said at the same time thinking now we find out what sort of fool i am meddling with things beyond my power he knelt beside the billy goat up till his last trip out to the shack hed intended to slit its throat with a bronze knife since then hed had what he hoped was a better idea from a pouch on his belt he drew the severed finger of the monster the powers had given him in exchange for taking geroges fang the finger had not decayed to any discernible extent which made him think some power still lingered in it he used the claw to tear the goats flesh though it did not feel unusually sharp to him it might have been the keenest dagger hed ever handled blood fountained from the goats throat and drowned the animals terrified anguished bleat let the blood bring them hither gerin cried again as it made a great red steaming pool that slowly began to sink into the ground the interior of the shack seemed to expand again for a moment it seemed to go dark too gerin wondered if the monsters gods could stand the light of day but then that light returned and for the first time he saw the gods he had summoned as mankinds gods mostly partook of and modified the manlike shape so the monsters powers resembled the mortal creatures whose patrons they were they too modified the basic pattern one of them glowed one had eyes bigger and rounder than an owls another great batlike ears one seemed nothing but muscle and fur and fangs and talons if he didnt do duty as a war god the fox would have been mightily surprised blood brings us they said all together their voices dinning in his mind we have kept the bargain now it is for you to keep it as well show us the way to battle and slaughter ill do that gerin told them fighting was all they wanted he realized had he set them against biton or against the elabonian gods they would have entered that fray with as much ferocity as this one he shivered if this fight should be won hed do what he could either to restore those wards under bitons shrine or to form some arrangement between the monsters gods and those who lived on the surface of the earth this is the way to the gradi gods he cast his thought toward baivers as mavrix had the elabonian god picked up his mind and carried it along with his own over a plane of being no mortal could reach without divine aid from his place as a small cyst on baivers vaster consciousness the fox sensed the underground powers following where the god of ale and barley led the route felt different this time no sea of wine no equally turbulent sea of sensuality gerin wondered if he was perceiving the same places through a different gods sensorium or if baivers had simply chosen a different path amber waves of grain were certainly more sedate than wine and polymorphous fornication whatever the truth whatever the route in the end they reached the snowcovered forest of conifers to which mavrix had brought him too bleak for barley baivers said in a tone of condemnation and abhorrence this is what they want to make my land into is it the monsters gods said nothing at all they stared hungrily every which way at once as if looking for rivals to massacre a path led through the woods as it had before baivers started down it the underground powers at his heels the wolves of the divine gradihome stared out from the trees at the strange gods who dared walk it a couple of monsters sprang at the wolves maybe that was blood on the snow when they were done maybe ichor it looked like blood to gerin who comes to gradihome as he had during gerins visit with mavrix the fierce god named lavtrig stood in a clearing as voldars first sentinel against attack baivers pointed a finger through the snow under lavtrigs feet burst shoots of green the gradi god stared at them in something like horror mavrix had joked by setting flowers blooming in this grim land baivers used fertility as a weapon lavtrig thundered toward him stamping the shoots flat as he came he raised a great club plainly intending to smash the elabonian god out of existence baivers pointed at the club it turned into leaves and blew away on a sudden warm breeze lavtrig roared with rage he drew from a sheath a bronze sword with a gleaming edge over metal baivers had no power the monsters god that was all thews and claws and teeth sprang out from the pack and onto lavtrig lavtrig smote him he smote back good battle he shouted joyously gerin sent a thought toward baivers shall the rest of us go on he seems to have found what he wanted go on they did lavtrig though not defeated was far too busy to block their path more wolves stared out at baivers and the underground powers as they pushed along the path the wolves though no longer stayed to fight but fled through the pine woods wailing the alarm in all directions they summon the rest of the gradi gods baivers said he sounded worried to gerin if the monsters gods shared his concern they gave no sign of it we want those gods they said in ragged chorus we will chew their flesh we will gnaw their bones when they reached the next clearing there stood stribog the father of all storms he shouted in what might have been wrath and might have been fear at having his place in gradihome assailed once more giving his foes no chance to enter the clearing he flung a blast of chilly rain into their faces baivers spread his arms wide i thank you for your gift of water he told the gradi god and shall turn it into blessed barley stribog shouted again this time in obvious fury go back he roared wetly you and your band are doomed flee while you may the rain changed to sleet then to hail that pounded the unwelcome visitors like bullets from a sling the monsters god who glowed stepped forward from among his fellows that glow had been pale and wan gerin had associated it with the pallid gleam of fireflies and molds and certain mushrooms all at once though its nature changed it grew red as fire red as the vents through which lava spilled out of some mountains and over the land the glow grew hot as fire too light the other underground powers crooned precious light to them gerin realized any source of illumination whether from decay or an underground vent for molten rock was precious and potent their lightbearing god sent a blast of fiery heat back at stribog melting hail sizzling sleet into steam sending the snow under the weather gods liquid feet boiling up as steam stribog roared in anger and pain and fought back with whips of winter he rushed forward to bluster at the monsters god making steam rise up from his shining skin as snow and ice threatened to douse his flame the underground power in turn redoubled his own effort again gerin said the rest of us can push on i think and again baivers and the monsters gods did push ahead through the clearing like lavtrig before him stribog was far too busy to prevent their passage as they found the next path the fox warned up ahead is the clearing where nothing dwells watch out for himhes dangerous baivers sensibly stopped at the edge of the next clearing gerin let out a tiny mental sigh he didnt know if he would be able to tell whether nothing had been playing his tricks this time hed managed when mavrix came this way but who could guess whether the gradi god was able to learn new tricks his old ones were quite bad enough a couple of the underground powers maybe filled with contempt for baivers cowardice maybe just looking for a fight wherever they could find one sprang out into the clearing with ferocious roars staring all about them in search of a foe they sprang out they roared and they were gone it was not merely that they vanished it was as if they had never been gerin needed a distinct mental effort to recall that they had been part of the ravening pack of gods accompanying baivers here as for baivers he said you were right mortal this power is not to be despised mavrix didnt beat him gerin answered he managed to distract him and that proved enough to get him by mavrix is full of distractions baivers answered distraction is all hes good for sometimes i think distraction is all he is behind the elabonian deity the monsters gods were milling around and muttering among themselves after a moment one of them in the shape of a monster but perfectly lightdrinkingly black stepped past baivers and out to the very edge of the clearing nothing he called in a voice that sounded as if it was echoing and reechoing down the corridors of a cave i am here nothing answered his own voice quiet and flat i am everywhere but i am here most of all give me back my comrades the monsters god said it cannot be nothing said give them back or you shall not be the monsters god warned it cannot be nothing repeated it can the underground power answered for i am darkness he raised his hands and the clearing was plunged into blackness as absolute as that gerin had known when the monsters gods met his summons below bitons shrine darkness went on no one will know whether you are here or not nothing no one will care when you cannot be found no one will miss you or you nothing returned and for a moment black shifted to gray or rather to the shade of complete and utter neutrality for which gray is the closest earthly approximation i think wed best move on while theyre busy figuring out which of them is less than the other gerin said thats the right way sure enough baivers said and the rough chorus of the monsters gods muttered agreement they advanced into the clearing in which their comrades had ceased to beinto it and through it as best gerin could tell with his limited senses baivers did not need light to know where he was going on the far side of the clearing light returned baivers seemed to glance through gerins mind only this voldar to go eh the god of barley asked i think so the fox answered after mavrix got past nothing she was the last deity he met she beat him but we have more strength with us now we will devour her and gnaw her bones the monsters gods chorused gerin remembered some of the things the monsters had done while they roamed above ground if their gods did things like that here he would he supposed be glad and then he would worry about how to make sure the monsters didnt come boiling up onto the surface of the world once more if i can make sure of that he thought whatever the answer was he could worry about it later the fight with voldar was the immediate concern immediate indeed for the path opened out just then into the clearing where the queen of the gradi gods stood waiting that clearing gerin thought was larger than it had been when voldar summoned him in the dream larger than when he had come here with mavrix that jolted him far less than it would have back in the merely material world the stuff of the gods had change as part of its very nature and it needed to be changeable for voldar did not stand alone here the clearing had grown to accommodate what looked to be the rest of the gradi pantheon most of the gods looked not surprisingly like graditall fair grayeyed with dark hair and grim expressions voldar led them taller than any grimmer than any beauty and terror and rage all commingled she started to shout something to the divinities she headed before she could though baivers outshouted her you frosters you freezemakers you bloodspillers you blighters in the little encysted space in baivers mind where gerin sheltered he had all he could do not to giggle down in the city of elabon a few languid affected young men had used blighters as a name for those of whom they did not approve imagining baivers in their company was deliciously absurd the god of barley though meant his insult literally voldar did shout then a belling contralto that sent shivers up and down the spine from which the fox was divorced at that moment its the local grass god all puffed up with himself and hes brought the kennel with him we whip them back home and then we go on about our business blighters baivers bellowed again and rushed forward voldar loped toward him as deadly graceful as a longtooth he picked her up she let out a most ungodlike squawk of startlement as he slammed her down to the snowy ground inside baivers gerin was cheering wildly hed wanted the god of barley angry and now hed got what he wanted not at his finest had mavrix given voldar such an overthrow but she was on her feet in an instantfeet around which little shoots of barley began to show pushing their way up through the eternal snow of the divine gradihome voldar hewed at those shoots with her axe each one she cut bled real blood and at each stroke baivers groaned as if she were cutting him down forward voldar shouted to her divine companions lets get them and get them now well she got no further than that her cropping the growing barley had hurt baivers but had not quenched his determinationvery much the reverse he grabbed the axe handle voldar screeched in rage gerin felt a harsh tingling run up baivers arms as if hed grabbed hold of a lightning bolt baivers wrestled the axe from voldar and threw it farmaybe infinitely faraway gerin had hoped a good part of voldars power dwelt in that axe and that without it she would be diminished if she was she gave no outward sign of it she dealt baivers a buffet that would have caved in the skull of an ordinary mortal the only ordinary mortal in that clearing though was gerin and he wasnt there in the flesh a lot of flesh was flying and fur and divine ichor from both the underground powers and the gradi gods the fox couldnt help thinking sithonian deities would have handled the battle with more elegance and panache any elegance or panache would have been more than was on display at the moment neither the monsters gods nor those of the gradi had much in the way of subtlety they found the nearest foe and went at him much as monsters and gradi would have done had they collided in the northlands one of the gradi gods burst into flame the underground power he was fighting screeched another of the monsters gods though tackled the gradi god and rolled with him in the snow after which his fire was extinguished for a while and the subterranean god who had been burned healed with supernatural speed an underground power sprang on voldar claw raking cuts along her haunch she screamed in mingled pain and fury and kicked out behind her like an angry horse the monsters god flew through the air and smashed headfirst into the trunk of a fir he did not get up right away he did not get up at all gerin wondered if he would ever get up again a gradi god to whom the fox had not been introduced tried to freeze baivers where he stood blowing an icy blast at him as if from the side of some snowcovered northern mountain however hostile his intent his power did not measure up to it in response baivers pointed a finger at him all the hair on his arms on his face on his head turned to growing barley he wailed and clawed at himself but remained green and growing how dare you interfere with our plans voldar demanded of baivers whos interfering in whose part of the world the god of barley retorted you leave my earth alone maybe ill think of leaving you alone and maybe not too you deserve what youre getting all the trouble youve caused there twixt the niffet and the kirs not half so much as we will cause voldar snarled well take revenge for eons see if we dont she broke off then with a howl of outrage for one of the monsters gods one who beside her was like a small dog beside a man bit her in the ankle gerin admired the courage of the underground power and wished hed had the chance to meet more of the monsters gods in anything but the most perfunctory way before leading them into this fight the monsters god was small but held power not to be despised voldars leg did not work as it should have after he sank his teeth into her she beat on him with all her strength but he would not let go his hold what are you you savage worm she cried speaking mind to mind the underground power did not have to leave off biting her to reply i am death excitement rippled through gerin when he caught that answer even voldar might have trouble against such a foe were gods truly immortal would he find out now something that might have been alarm in her voice voldar shrilly cried smerts to me seeing smerts the fox realized heno she for the emaciated frame carried shrunken breastswas deaths gradi equivalent where voldar had been unable to free herself from the underground powers onslaught smerts tore the fierce little god away from the queen of the gradi pantheon you are mine smerts crooned in a fierce hungry whisper no the monsters death said just as hungrily you are mine and he bit the hand that held him smerts squeezed him with her other hand gerin wondered what would happen if they slew each other would that bring immortality into the world whether or not voldar was immortal she was imbued with enormous vitality as soon as smerts had plucked death from her she regained full use of that leg and used it to smash in the ribs of an underground power who had torn a gradi god almost in two the kicked power stumbled backward groaning and knocked death out of smerts hands smerts seized the new underground power while death clamped his teeth into the first gradi god he could reach gerin wished he had a body with which to groan mortalitys power in the world would continue to hold sway he risked a question of baivers are we winning dont know the elabonian god replied he looked around the field which meant gerin perforce looked around the field too what he saw was what hed seen since the brawl began chaos loosed in the divine gradihome dont know if were winning baivers repeated but i dont reckon were losing neither that was as much as gerin had hoped for when he led the underground powers here it seemed to be plenty to satisfy the monsters gods too some of the gradi gods knocked down or uprooted trees with their bare hands and swung them like enormous spearshafts at their foes that distressed the monsters gods who were unused to trees in all ways and especially as weapons but baivers knew about trees some of the power he used to make barley spring to life also worked on them their branches and roots turned unnaturally lively grappling with the gradi gods who tried to wield the trunks and while the trees discommoded the gradi gods the underground powers sprang on them rending and tearing before the monsters gods reached the divine gradihome their grim and savage intensity their bloodthirsty devotion to slaughter had alarmed the fox who wondered whether they werent apt to be a worse bargain for the northlands than voldar and her companions he had thought the underground powers would only have grown more ferocious once they joined battle with the gradi gods so far as he could tell that wasnt happening the clearing was filled not just with quasiphysical screams and shouts and groans but also with the thoughts and feelings of the battling gods sometimes as weapons sometimes merely there gerin did not catch the same rage now from the monsters gods as hed felt when they were coming toward this fight what he did get from them was so surprising he had to pause and consider before he was willing to admit even to himself that he fully grasped it theyre enjoying themselves he told baivers almost indignantly theyre like a serf village on a holiday when theyve got a couple of pigs roasting over the fire and plenty of your good ale and no work to do theyre having the time of their lives they wanted battle baivers answered youve given em what they wanted and then some bet theyll like you real well when this here is done gerin didnt know whether that prospect was more appealingif the underground powers felt well disposed toward him they might be inclined to control the monsters depredationsor appalling what he did know was that the gradi gods were not enjoying themselves he had the feeling from previous encounters with them that they seldom enjoyed themselves at least by any standards with which he was familiar what they felt now was anger of a peculiar sort the anger of those who see plans they had reckoned certain of success suddenly falling to pieces all around them in his little space inside baivers sensorium the fox exulted the gradi and their gods had reckoned the northlands ripe for conquest and transformation now they were finding it wasnt so and not caring for the discovery here came smerts looking more deathly than ever she seized baivers as she had seized the death god among the underground powers as she had with him she crooned you are mine baivers groaned dwelling inside himdwelling in effect as part of himgerin felt vitality flowing out of him and into smerts it was like watching ale leak out of a cracked jarthe level went down down down steadily inexorably that gave the fox an idea feed smerts more life than she can hold all at once he thought at baivers youre a god of growing thingsmake her grow lively if you can if i can baivers said doubtfully he seemed to quiver gathering himself thenit was as if a lightning bolt passed from him to smerts the gradi goddess gasped her eyes opened very wide the stringy white stood out straight on her skull was it the foxs imagination or did she all at once look less skeletal than she had you cant do that she gasped at baivers you cant but her voice was not the harsh croak it had been a moment before it was smoother richer almost the voice of a being concerned with something other than extinction gerin still wondered if he was more hopeful than he should have been if he was letting that hope color what his senses always unreliable on this plane anyhow told him no baivers sensed smerts weakness too yes i can he said fresh confidence in his own voice watching smerts gerin watched years peel away and emaciation flesh out contemplating his own middleaged carcass back in the merely material world he wished baivers would put him through a similar course it soon proved too much for the gradi goddess she broke free of baivers and fled at each stride she seemed to age a few years and was soon back to what she had been but she did not challenge the god of barley again i thank you baivers said to gerin that was right sly worst thing for a lot of folks is too much of what they tell you they want he strode toward voldar shouting to her you there we werent done the two of us she whirled to face him no we werent she said gerin wondered about the wisdom of confronting the queen of the gradi pantheon so directly before he could more than begin to frame that thought though voldars pale gaze pierced the encystment within baivers where his own small spirit sheltered you she cried and she was not speaking to the elabonian god yes me gerin answered as steadfastly as he could i told you that you werent welcome in the northlands and that id do everything i could to stop you voldars eyes flashed pale fire i never dreamt one mortal could cause so much trouble her wave encompassed the chaos all around chaos with no resolution anywhere near at hand then she stabbed out a finger at the fox and i say you may not come to the gradihome of the gods her voice rose to a shrill shriek begone darkness gerin opened his eyes he was in the shack again did we win van asked xi gerin cast a wary eye up to the sky the day was hot and fair the sun blazed down like a ball of molten bronze in the middle of a blue enamel bowl the cold nasty rain that had plagued the last part of the ride up from ikos was gone vanished more suddenly than a natural storm had any business disappearing wiping his forehead with a sleeve he said unless i miss my guess stribog is either still fighting one of the monsters gods or else laid up from having fought him been four days now since you and baivers and all the underground powers went to fight voldar and her chums van said still no notion of how the fight turned out not even the slightest gerin answered every day since ive tried to summon baivers ive tried to summon the monsters gods but i get no answer maybe theyve been destroyed but i dont think so if they had been the gradi would be swarming up the niffet in their war galleys and we havent seen a single fire beacon the weathers too fine to make me think the gradi gods won too what then van asked my best guess is that theyre still fighting up there out there on that plane where the gods can go and we mostly cant the fox said neither side looked to have any sort of edge when voldar booted me off my perch on baivers shoulder you might say a fight that doesnt stop van sighed wistfully must be a fine thing to be a god to never need to eat or sleep to heal up as fast as youre hurt to war for as long as you like for years on end maybe he let out a snort of laughter but then i know a bit about warring for years on end i ought to married to fand like i am he looked indignant when gerin didnt chuckle at that warring for years on end gerin said he nodded more to himself than to van it could be so he hoped it was so if the gradi were locked in battle with the underground powers and with baivers for years theyd have neither the time nor the ability to help their human followers he smacked one fist into the other palm we have to hit the gradi while their gods are busycant waste a moment the more we drive those cursed raiders back the harder the time theyll have recovering even if their gods do end up beating the ones i turned loose on them van stared at him you sound like youre heading out on campaign this very day tomorrow will have to do i think the fox said reluctantly but im going to send out a messenger this instant to let adiatunnus know were on our way were going across the venien again and this time were not coming back till weve beaten the gradi youve said that before van answered it didnt work out i wish you hadnt reminded me gerin said which made the outlander chuckle and bow as if hed just been thanked for doing a favor slowly gerin went on if we cant beat them on the land theyve stolen while their gods are busy though i dont think well be able to beat them at all what well have to do in that case is not go after them any more but hunker down in our keeps fight them as hard as we can for as long as we can when they come to us and probably end by going down fighting there are worse ways to end van said i dont think id want to get old and creaky and have a fit so one side of my body doesnt want to work and spend my last days gumming gruel on account of i cant chew and i can hardly swallow next to that an axe that splits my skull is kind i wasnt thinking so much of my end gerin said i dont want to watch everything ive spent my life building fall to pieces though and see my children made into serfs for the gradi if the gradi win you wont see any of that for theyll surely kill you van said and the fox could hardly disagree still and all i follow what youre saying the outlander continued i tell you true there are times im glad i dont try to look so far ahead as you do were all different gerin said with a shrug and were all still free now well find out how long we get to stay that way in times gone by the guards at the eastern border of adiatunnus holding would have fled at the approach of the elabonian army gerin ledeither fled or with mad trokm courage tried to sell their lives dear now instead they let out whoops of delight their voices broke as they cried out they had hardly more than durens years with only light down on their faces what word from the venien gerin called to them in their own language twas said the gradi were after moving men up toward that stream one of the youths replied how any man could be sure though with the bad weather weve been having and all is past me indeed and it is whats the weather like on the other side of the river these days the fox asked remembering the summer blizzard that had done more to defeat him than the axes of the gradi both the young sentries shrugged been warmer here o late said the one who hadnt spoken before and youre only a day and a little bit behind the chariot you sent out the which ive no doubt our chief will be right glad to see and even gladder to see the whole lot of you the other youngster added adiatunnus is after gathering all the men he may to hold the gradi back that being the reason the two of us get to do a soldiers job so soon do well do as well as you can gerin told them but we dont aim to hold back the gradi we aim to go after em and beat em the trokm sentries cheered again so did his own men on into adiatunnus holding rode the elabonian army the elabonian serfs in the fields seeing soldiers mostly fled into the woods regardless of whether they spoke the same language soldiers were soldiers and all too liable to be dangerous we might as well be gradi or trokmoi ourselves as far as theyre concerned duren said watching them run remember that gerin told him my serfs dont think of my warriors that way and yours shouldnt either once youve taken over at the holding your grandfather ruled mischief in his voice van said but these are your serfs too fox for isnt adiatunnus your vassal when he feels like it gerin answered dryly which made his son and his friend laugh gerin drummed his fingers on the chariot rail if we win against the gradi he may have to decide whether hes my vassal or my foei may make him decide that i should say till then im just glad he hasnt sided with them instead of with me they passed that night camped by a keep that had held an elabonian petty baron in the days before the trokmoi swarmed south over the niffet and was now home to woodsrunners who lorded it over the serfs at a nearby village a lot of the men were gone from the keep summoned by adiatunnus to protect his western border the trokm women bolder in their habits than elabonians would have been wasted little time in getting friendlyor more than friendlywith the newcomers the night was made for such games being unusually dark in its early states all four moons were past full the first of them nothos not rising till almost halfway between sunset and midnight gerin was anything but surprised to see van heading upstairs with a brash trokm woman who put him in mind of fand he had no doubt fand would guess one of these days before too long what the outlander was up to his ears rang in anticipation he sighed he couldnt do anything about that he wasnt vans nursemaid if the outlander didnt get so drunk as to make himself too hung over to stay in the chariot come tomorrow the fox had no call to upbraid him but itsuntidy thats what it is he said to no one in particular finding exactly the right phrase satisfied him in a way even shouting at van couldnt have done he wrapped himself in a blanket and went to sleep outriding the news of its coming the elabonian army descended on adiatunnus keep and the villagealmost the townclose by it if id done as well as this when i was the trokms enemy hed have feared me more gerin said as hed been doing all along he looked up into the sky the weather remained hot and dry he and his men were close to the venien now if stribog interfered with the normal run of things they would know it sooner and more surely than back at fox keep he saw no sign of any such thing and was relieved adiatunnus rode out from his castle to greet gerin and the men with him the fellow you sent ahead he said youre after thinking of fighting the gradi on their own ground again he said sounding anything but delighted at the prospect its not their ground the fox answered some of it in point of fact is mine i intend to take it back and to drive them off it you intended the same earlier in the year and had nobbut bad cess adiatunnus said why dyou think your luckll be better on a second go ill tell you why gerin said and did he finished i dont know whether baivers and the monsters gods have beaten voldar and the gradi crew but id say they havent lost if they had the weather would be worse adiatunnus tugged at one side of his drooping mustaches it could be so he said at last after some thought not long ago the cold storms came rolling over the venien one after tother you might say and the gradi looked to be gathering for a push right at us he scowled shamed as i am to own it wed have broken and run without your widin on our own we canna stand against the gradi but he said hed fight em with us or without us and so i called up all the men to give him what help we could making himself stand against a foe who had trounced his folk time after time had taken courage and courage of an unusual sort widins not the only man here with spirit the fox said acknowledging that what happened then i havent heard of the gradi crossing the venien they didna adiatunnus said not so many days ago the storms stopped and it was summer again as fine a summer as any ive seen and the gradi drew back a ways from the venien we slipped a few o widins men and mine over the river to see if they could find out what was toward and they tell me the reivers seem all in an uproar like as if summat theyd expected hadna happened after all maybe just maybe i kept it from happening gerin replied and if i did the best thing we can do now is hit them as hard a blow as we can give them something else they arent expecting can we do it adiatunnus asked of course we can gerin said heartily though he did not think the trokm chieftain had in fact aimed the question at him adiatunnus sounded more as if he were putting it to his own gods the gods whom voldar and the gradi had beaten and terrified what sort of answer would he find whether from them or in his own heart after a long pause adiatunnus said well wed best have a go if we dinna go to them theyll come to us sure as sure and no good will spring from that the endorsement while anything but ringing was an endorsement well move against them tomorrow your men and mine together gerin said adiatunnus stared at him now the fox glared playing to the hilt the role of outraged feudal overlord tomorrow i said and tomorrow i meant and i mean in the morning too even if i have to boot every one of you lazy sleepy woodsrunners in the arse to make it happen lazy adiatunnus clapped a hand to his forehead sleepy well show you you blackhearted spalpeen i hope you do gerin said but if you dont he waved back at his army ive brought enough elabonians along to get you moving elabonians foosh adiatunnus said we make no special shivers for elabonians its not as if you were so many gradi now to the crows with you gerin exclaimed both men laughed theyd tried to kill each other before they might well try to kill each other again one day meanwhile though they saw they had more urgent things to worry about than their old animosity that in itself eased gerins mind he had been far from sure adiatunnus would be able to look to what might lie ahead rather than remembering the past for that matter hed been far from sure hed be able to do that himself if youre right fox and we beat the gradi the trokm chieftains voice trailed away as if he had trouble believing such a thing possible after a moment he started up again if we do that twill be a braw thing youve managed aye a braw thing indeed well see what happens thats all the fox said ive always tried to take the fight to the other fellow when i stood any chance of doing it that i ken adiatunnus said for youve done it to me more times nor i care to recall may we have the same luck against the gradi sounds like a toast to me van said and only a fool would make a toast without washing it down it was not a subtle hint but van was not a subtle man in that he matched the trokmoi more closely than the elabonians among whom he lived as adiatunnus had taken on more elabonian ways than most of the woodsrunners south of the niffet he might have found vans approach imperfectly polished if he did he was too polished himself to show it smiling he waved gerin van and the rest of the elabonian warriors toward his keep gerin looked back at the venien river it wasnt a great stream like the niffet into which it flowed it seemed hardly enough to serve as the boundary between not just two peoples but almost between two worlds but back there on the eastern side gerin had been prince of the north overlord of all he surveyed if he claimed to rule here he would have to make that claim good against the gradi as he had even in his own holding he kept a weather eye on the sky storm clouds building in the west might give warning the gradi gods had won their war he saw none the day remained fine what he did see was adiatunnus also nervously eyeing the western horizon catching his glance the trokm looked briefly shamefaced its only that im after remembering the last time we tried coming this way he said another summer blizzard like that he broke off plainly not wanting to think of it gerin didnt want to either but couldnt help himself a car holding widin simrins son rolled up alongside gerins widin pointed ahead gradi up that way lord prince based at what was a peasant village he spoke with authority the scouts elabonian and trokm both who had been slipping off over the venien to spy out the raiders doings reported to him when they returnedif they returned the fox waved half the chariots off to the left and the other half to the right wanting to hit the gradi from two directions at once he led the lefthand column himself at his fathers order duren urged the horses up into a gallop speed and surprise will get us more here than stealth gerin judged surprised the gradi certainly were when they spied the chariots rushing toward them they let out loud bellows of alarm some of them dashed back into the peasant huts theyd appropriated and then came back out with axes and a few bows and a handful did something gerin had never before seen gradi do they turned tail and ran for their lives even as he nocked his first arrow the fox pointed to them and called i want some of those men taken alive we may be able to learn a lot from them a handful of chariots peeled off after the fleeing gradi the fight with the ones who hadnt fled was as fierce as usual but did not last long between them the elabonians and trokmoi had their foes badly outnumbered and the arrival of the second column moments after the first threw the gradi into confusion for a good many of them could not decide which group of opponents to resist when they saw they had no hope of winning the fight the gradi began slaying one another to keep from being taken prisoner rather more of them than usual though did let themselves be captured that piqued gerins curiosity in the same way as the earlier spectacle of running gradi had done after helping see to his own men he went to question the warriors whod fled or been captured they sat glumly on the ground hands bound behind them with leather thongs who speaks elabonian gerin demanded several gradi stirred i speak it somely one of them said proving his own point gerin wasted no time with ancillary questions why did some of you run why did some of you give up the gradi looked at one another then down at the ground the fox knew shame when he saw it the prisoner who had spoken before answered it is not what the chiefs tell us it is not what the gods tell us a couple of others who understood elabonian exclaimed trying to silence him but he went on it is so we were to strike not to be striked the gods do not do what they say they do they trickfool us why we do for them how did your gods fool you gerin did his best to make the question sound casual he had to work not to lean forward and throw it out like a man casting a baited line into a pond and that gradi seized the bait they say they help us he answered they say you not can backfight they say they chase your pisspot gods eat them throw dead of them on dunghill they trickfool us his gray eyes were full of angry indignation for a little while gerin had trouble understanding that then he realized he was used to living in a part of the world where the gods seldom played an active role that was not true of voldar and the rest of the gradi pantheon now the raiders were having to do things for themselves without their gods to help them if this first taste of how they performed under such circumstances meant anything they were going to have some trouble adjusting gerin hoped they had a lot of trouble adjusting turning to adiatunnus he said you see were fighting just them now not their goddess here across the venien he didnt feel like naming her even if she was otherwise occupied adiatunnus noticed that he said you started well before fox and then it all went sour finish well now and youll show yourself right fair enough the fox spoke to the warriors guarding the gradi prisoners send them back over the venien the work we get out of them as slaves will pay back a little of what theyve done to us he watched the prisoners closely as he spoke some of them admitted to understanding elabonian he saw no tries for escape no tries for suicide among those men or any others the likeliest explanation was that they were cast into confusion because their gods were less with them than those gods usually were he very much wanted the likeliest explanation to be true because he so much wanted it to be true he distrusted it all the more only one way to find out he said adiatunnus gave him a curious look he pretended not to see it whether or not the gradi had been readying themselves to cross the venien a few days before they were not ready to defend against a strike from the eastern side of the river each group of them gathered in villages or encamped in the woods fought gerins army with an effort individually often heroic but invariably futile those groups were crushed one after another why dont they come together father duren asked as the army made camp after one such little battle theyd be tougher meat if they did im still not sure gerin answered wiping sweat from his forehead with his sleeve hed earned that sweat fighting the gradi but it had come easy the day was a muggy scorcher but im beginning to think theyre so used to talking with their gods and to listening to them that they have trouble figuring out what to do when theyre on their own enjoy it while it lasts van said my guess is that wont be long sooner or later theyll come out of their fog and remember theyre men not gods toys life gets harder after that im the one whos supposed to come up with cheery thoughts like that gerin said your job is to say no no fox everything will be fine well whip these gradi right out of their furs he deepened his voice and gave it a slight guttural rasp doing his best to imitate the outlander his friend grunted laughter nobody can always see what hes going to do himself let alone what the fool standing next to him is liable to come up with when you threw baivers and the underground powers at the gradi gods you surprised even them i think as long as they keep on being surprised gerin looked at the sky so often these days he hardly noticed himself doing it so long as the clouds stayed away so long as the hot weather held he would assume the monsters gods and baivers still kept voldar and the other gradi gods too busy to make trouble down on the merely mortal plane of being he knew how rough a gauge that was voldar and her crew might overcome the invaders before stribog recovered from the supernatural wounds hed received in his fight if that happened the first the fox would know of it was running headlong into the angry gradi gods he did not look forward to that sort of confrontation best way to keep it from happening he told himself is to beat the gradi so badly their gods wont have much of a place to roost in the northlands hed known all along what needed doing knowing how to do it was another matter worse luck an elabonian spy brought him news the next day that the gradi had regarrisoned the tumbledown keep in which hed defeated them in his earlier foray into the country they held they dont have much in the way of imagination do they the fox said when he sent scouts out to approach the place he discovered how little imagination the gradi were showing their sentries seemed no more alert to attack than on his previous incursion it was as if the idea that their enemies could bring the war to them rather than the other way round had never occurred to them gerin aimed both to exploit their navet and having exploited it to fill the gap in their education shall we dismount again and trick them duren asked theyd never fall for the same trick twice van protested gerin got the feeling the protest sprang more from his inability to look like a gradi than from any consideration of grand strategy the outlander felt cheated out of a good fight no wonder hed been able to fathom the minds of the monsters godshis own worked the same way could he have been projected up into the plane of the gods he would have had a splendid time battling voldar and her companions in the end the fox decided to try the same plan again taking advantage of the confusion the gradi seemed to feel without their gods leading them by the noses these were after all not the same men in the keep as the ones his force had overwhelmed before he led the band of foot soldiers who approached the keep many of them were wearing captured gradi helmets and carrying captured gradi axes in place of their own weapons doing their best to make the ruse convincing when the band of men on foot approached the drawbridge to the keep was up he cursed on seeing that a gradi up on the wall shouted something at him and his men a couple of the trokmoi spoke a little of the gradi tongue one of them shouted back presumably saying something like its all rightlet us in and the drawbridge came down we are lucky duren breathed we certainly are gerin said were lucky enough to run in there and see how many of us are going to get killed arent you glad to have luck like that duren nodded eagerly gerin cursedthat wasnt the answer his son would give when he had a little more sense but then if hed been sensible himself he wouldnt have attacked this keep in the first place he yanked his sword out of the scabbard and ran for the drawbridge his men followed their shouts making the morning hideous the drawbridge started to rise but it could come down faster than it went up gerin got over the bridge and into the courtyard he ran into the gatehouse with half a dozen men at his heels they quickly slew the pair of gradi who had been working the big capstan around which the drawbridge chain was wound with another shout the fox let the capstan spin in the opposite direction the drawbridge thumped all the way down again and this time stayed down in swarmed the warriors who had approached on foot gerin knew the rest of his army would soon join them a runner would report initial success to the chariotry hanging back just out of sight meanwhile how many gradi were in the keep and how ferociously would they fight a good many of them fought as ferociously as they ever had one snarling knot of men near the entrance to the great hall of the castle did not come undone till the last gradi fighting there had fallen but fewer gradi manned the keep than had been here before and not all of them chose to fight to the death when elabonians and trokmoi began leaping out of chariots and running to join the fight a startling number of the raiders still on their feet threw down their axes and gave up where is great voldar where is lavtrig where is smerts one of the prisoners said in fair elabonian how can we beat you thralls without our gods it is not fair gerin found the gradis notion of fairness curious but did not try to persuade him it needed changing instead he allowed himself the luxury of a sigh of relief that the gradi gods were still preoccupied and the even greater luxury of hope that they would keep on being preoccupied after hed pressed west from the keep on his earlier incursion into territory the gradi held the weather had gone bad on him when he woke now to find the sun rising in a cloudless sky he smiled and murmured thank you lord baivers every day the god of barley and the underground powers bought for him was another day in which to strike the gradi the wind did blow out of the west but it was a natural wind a warm wind and toward the end of the day it brought a fresh scent with it a tang he had known before but couldnt name at once duren noticed it too and asked whats that smell for him it was unfamiliar van identified it before the fox could thats the smell of the ocean lad were closer to it now than back at fox keep and no rain washing it out of the air before your nose can find it youre right gerin snapped his fingers in annoyance at himself when the wind swung round and blew out of the east off the greater inner sea the air in the city of elabon would smell like this and when the wind didnt swing round the air in the city of elabon would smell like all the privies and stables in the world same as it does in every other city van said thats so gerin said when i lived thereback before you were born dureni didnt notice the city stink but by the gods i did when i first came into it after a while you get used to things later that day the army he led came upon a group of gradi in a peasant village who behaved more in the manner the raiders had done before their gods made the acquaintance of baivers and the subterranean powers they went down to defeat but the large majority of them fought until killed and several of those who didnt also did not surrender but broke away into the woods to the west gerin sent men into those woods after them but they got away i dont care for that he said when his warriors brought back the news of their failure they didnt look like men running for their lives they looked more like men who wanted to take warning to their friends why do you say that father duren asked because they all went off in the same direction gerin replied if theyd been panicked theyd have run every which waywoods just as near these huts to the north and south as to the west but thats the direction they went adiatunnus walked up in time to hear that last youre after thinking itll be harder now fox i wish i could say no but i have to say yes gerin told him he tried to keep the trokms spirits up adding have you noticed how well your warriors have fought against the gradi this time out i certainly have that i have and i thank you for seeing it too adiatunnus said its as if a great burthen o fears fallen off our backs for the which i suppose youre the man i should be thanking ive taken the gradi gods out of play gerin said now its you trokmoi against them not you against them and their gods who had already put your gods in fear as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished he had them back he did not want to insult adiatunnus by calling esus teutates taranis and the rest of the trokm gods cowards but the woodsrunners chieftain only nodded truth thative owned it myself we do the best we can is allwho can do more he stopped and thought about what hed just said then clapped a hand to his forehead the gods forfend fox im after starting to sound like you weve lived next to each other too long gerin answered this wouldnt be happening if one of us had managed to kill the other somewhere back down the line and thats truth too adiatunnus said were both after having worse neighbors the now though the which makes me think i may be glad after all i didna overfall you you never know till the end how these things turn out sometimes do you no you dont gerin said shortly if you like adiatunnus and if we come out the other side of these hard times ill teach you your letters theyll make your world seem wider and youll profit for that ill think on it indeed and i will adiatunnus said gerin scratched his head for years hed tried to preserve civilization in the northlands not least by driving the trokmoi over the niffet for the first time he wondered if having failed to do that he might civilize them instead the idea made him laugh if they invade my country thats what they get he thought before he thought about civilizing the trokmoi and before he had time to do more than briefly wonder whether a literate adiatunnus might prove a more dangerous adiatunnus he had to worry about the gradi the farther west he got the bigger a worry they became they fought harder and more cleverly than they had he was no longer taking them by surprise either they knew he and his men were coming after them the weather worried him too the breeze that smelled of the orynian ocean was cool and moist which made him wonder whether stribog was no longer busy battling the underground power who had taken him on only when local peasants assured him summers close by the sea were generally of that sort did the worry recedea little he kept scouting parties close by the niffet to make sure the gradi could not use their war galleys to land a large band of soldiers behind him by surprise that precaution paid for itself a couple of days later when his men spotted two galleys full of gradi going up the river when some of the scouts brought that news back he reversed the course of his army two galleys worth of warriors was not a force large enough to do much in the way of raiding upriver and seemed likelier to be aimed at him had he guessed wrong there he might have lost the momentum that had kept his troopers surging forward but he guessed right his men swept down on the gradi close by the riverside and apparently not long after they had left their ships the fight that followed on flat open ground with the niffet against which to pin the raiders was more nearly slaughter than anything deserving the name of battle foot soldiers armed mostly with axes the gradi here found themselves at the mercy of gerins chariotriding archers the gradi could neither close with them nor escape and had no weapons able to strike their foes from a distance one by one they fell until seeing the end rapidly approaching they began killing one another to keep from being captured after the fight was over the fox sent a party east along the niffet to find the galleys from which the gradi had come two pillars of smoke rising into the sky said theyd not only found but fired them i wish they hadnt done that gerin said pointing back toward the smoke and why ever not adiatunnus demanded with the boats found and all they should be getting rid of them eh most times id say yes gerin answered but people will see that smoke a long way im afraid the gradi army in the west just beyond our farthest advance yet will spot it and know weve smashed their friends what army are you talking about adiatunnus said and then its daft yare im thinking when all weve seen is dribs and drabs of gradi no proper armies to em at all not that im sorry for it mind you now think it through the fox told him why would the gradi have landed a force of that size behind us those men couldnt have caught us not on foot and they couldnt fight all of us by themselves if they did catch us am i right so far aye belike the trokm chieftain said what of it and what has it got to do with a whole great whacking gradi army up ahead gerin too seldom got the chance to play games with logic when he did he used it to the hilt think it through he repeated these gradi couldnt have caught us or fought us not alone what does that leave for them to do the only thing i can think of is that they were meant to be a blocking force to slow us down while were retreating and let whoever were retreating from catch up with us we wouldnt be retreating from dribs and drabs of gradi the only thing that could make us retreat is an army and so does that make sense to you adiatunnus long bony face was intent as he followed the foxs reasoning at last he said you may be after having the right of it what a tricksy wight yare to see that army or ever you set eyes on it have you been watching me the same way all these years as best i could gerin told him i hold myself lucky then for still being here for you to keep an eye on adiatunnus said though youll likely tell me youd be as pleased if i werent more pleased the fox said deadpan adiatunnus gave him a glare as heartfelt as he could have desired then both men started to laugh gerin went on now lets go see what we can do to flush that army my minds eye seesor find out that im full of eyewash indeed and ill be surprised if it turns out yare adiatunnus told him the way you laid out your thoughts so neat and all there i was following along behind like you were lighting up a dark path with a torch you do need to learn to read gerin told him ill make a philosopher out of you yet see if i dont och adiatunnus exclaimed maybe i should let the gradi kill me instead the fox glared at him only to realize the trokm had just taken his revenge every so often gerins instinct and his logic let him down with a splat as he led his army westward he began to wonder if this was going to be one of those times he had scouts out well ahead of the main body of his force they and then he passed a couple of spots where he would have judged the gradi likely to stand and fight then a scout came back from the southwest with a frightenedlooking peasant clinging to the rail of his chariot this fellow says he knows where the gradi are he called good gerin waved bringing his army to a halt the scout came on at a slightly less intrepid pace which made the elderly peasant seem happier or at least less unhappy who are you and what do you know gerin asked him lord my name is osar pozels son he answered though gerin wondered if hed heard the name aright he might have felt happier speaking to osar through an interpreter for the serf had a western accent that would have made him hard to understand at best and also spoke mushily because he was missing most of his teeth well osar what do you know gerin repeated the peasant pointed back in the direction from which the scout had brought him lord theres gradi back there lots of gradi over by bidgosh pond they are wish somebody could do something about em why do you think im here the fox said for my amusement for the scenery maybe who knows what lords do or why osar returned anyone whos smart he stays outen the way of lords that saddened gerin but did not surprise him where is this bidgosh pond he asked where is it what do you mean where is it how can you not know where bidgosh pond is osar had no doubt lived in his village all his life everything in the neighborhoodthis pond wherever it was a hill a forestwould be as familiar to him as his own fingers and would no more need locating than those fingers at the far end of his hand hed have trouble imagining someone whod never seen bidgosh pond as hed also have trouble imagining the terrain more than a days walk from his village terrain hed probably never seen never mind gerin said sighing here come up into my chariot you tell me which way i have to go to get to the pond if a fight starts ill let you jump out beforehand does that suit you what choice have i got osar asked the peasants ageold bitter question he got up into the foxs chariot and said all right back the way i came from back toward the fields i know think what a hero youll be to the other people in your village gerin said now youve ridden in a chariottwo chariots in factand youre going to help get rid of the gradi so they dont trouble you any more im going to have all these fancy chariot things churning up the fields so we all go hungry osar pozels son said he shook his head wouldntve had much crops anyways not with the weather so bad till just lately as soon as he found ground he recognized he went from being nearly useless to being altogether authoritative telling gerin much more than he wanted to know about every crop every herd that had been on that ground for as far back as he remembered which was about as long as gerin had been alive in his little corner of the world he remembered everything chuckling he said had my first girl back o those trees not that they was so tall in them days pretty little thing she was too and a pair on her thatd make you cry after a while gerin cut off the flow of amatory reminiscences by asking how much farther to this pond osar gave him a dirty look the fox had trouble blaming him remembered lovemaking was surely more enjoyable than thinking about battle after a moment though the peasant pointed just past that stand o trees there sure enough through the trees came the glint of sun off water also through the trees came shadowy glimpses of moving figures rein in gerin told duren when his son obeyed the fox told osar youd better get out here those arent the people from your village are they not likely the peasant answered and jumped down he scurried away from the chariots behind the foxs surprisingly spry given the fight that loomed ahead gerin would have been spry in his shoes too not that osar was wearing shoes pointing ahead van said theres a whole great whacking lot of gradi in amongst those trees there certainly are gerin said the next interesting question is how in the names of all the elabonian gods are we going to get them to come out into the fields and fight us on our own ground van grunted thoughtfully in response to that but made no more definite answer gerin pondered the problem out on open land his men in their chariots could ride rings around the gradi and fill them full of arrows without exposing themselves to much danger under the trees everything changed the horses would have to pick their way and the men in the cars would be hideously vulnerable to enemies leaping out of the bushes or from behind tree trunks and not seen till too late gerin touched his son on the shoulder ride up close to the woods he said theres something i want to try duren did as he asked raising his voice to a great shout the fox called if the lot of you arent sniveling cowards come out and fight us against trokmoi the ploy probably would have worked the woodsrunners made a point of proving how brave they were it might have worked against elabonians his own people gerin thought were by no means free of brave blockheads but from out of the forest came an answering shout in pretty good elabonian if you are such a great fighter you come make us it was exactly the reply gerin would have given getting it thrown in his face didnt make him any happier neither did the cheers that rose from the throats of the gradi who had understood their leaders answer only a man with a strong hold over the warriors he led could have so forcefully rejected the most openly courageous course of action the fox turned to van you were right worse luck i think theyve found a captain and what do we do about that the outlander asked what id like to do is set the forest afire and flush them out that way gerin bit his lip the only trouble being i dont think it would work not with no wind and not with the trees all wet and full of sap from the rains that have poured down on this place van nodded aye a fired be slow going they might head out away from us toward the pond instead of at us too but what does that leave gerin looked back at the chariots full of trokmoi and elabonians he looked ahead to the woods full of gradi the gradi captain had rejected the obvious choice gerin offered him he in turn had offered gerin a choice just as obviousand just as fraught with peril sighing the fox said if they dont come to us we could go in after them he had hoped van would try to talk him out of it instead the outlander whooped and grinned and slapped him on the back almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot every now and then fox i like the way you think he said i dont gerin said when the fox shouted orders for his men to dismount from their cars and fight the gradi on foot adiatunnus had his driver bring his chariot alongside and said are you daft to go fighting them under the trees tis the very thing they want you to do well see how much they want it once they have it the fox replied i am not wild to do this i plainly own as much but this is our land by rights if we cant beat the gradi with their gods out of the picture we might as well leave and hand them the whole countryside but theyre gradi adiatunnus exclaimeda fearfilled sentence freighted with the memories of long years of losses fighting em in chariots aye or in the keep but here if you wont then go back across the venien gerin said harshly if adiatunnus and the trokmoi did go back across the venien the fight was doomed his heart felt packed with jagged ice doomed or not he would go after the gradi a sentiment the raiders might well have understood to adiatunnus he added if i win this battle with you well and good if i win it after you turn oathbreaker your turn comes next he meant it adiatunnus could see he meant it the trokm chieftain bit his lip gerin coldly stared his way trying to make adiatunnus more afraid of him than of the gradi after a long moment adiatunnus said i am no oathbreaker we fight beside you prove it gerin said and jumped down out of his chariot van thudded to the ground beside him a moment later so did duren who tethered the horses to a bush that wouldnt hold them more than a moment if they seriously decided to try breaking free to the crows with you lord prince adiatunnus said and jumped down too seeing their foes descend to the ground the gradi began shouting voldar voldar the goddess name rang in gerins ears but however loud the gradi yelled the fox felt no hum of power in the air no sign that voldar was near he would not have to fight against an angry goddess merely against her angry followers who were apt to be quite bad enough he turned to his own men our cry is baivers he didnt think the elabonian god any more likely to take part in the fighting than voldar but for one thing he might have been wrong and for another maybe those cries would reach and aid baivers up in the divine gradihome after a moment he went on if we win this fight i think we win the war weve pushed them a long way back now we can make sure what weve done doesnt slip out of our hands what do you say lads baivers the war cry drowned out the shouts of the gradi and also seemed to startle the raiders who might still have been unused to the idea that anyone or any god could presume to stand against them or their pantheon too bad for them gerin though life is full of surprises he waved his arm elabonians and trokmoi trotted toward the trees when the gradi saw their foes on foot some of them came out into the field to fight there several elabonians and trokmoi snatched bows from their chariots and started shooting at their enemies after two or three gradi went down the rest retreated back into the woods two or three we wont have to fight in there gerin thought he tried to stay in front of duren this whatever else it turned out to be was going to be an ugly fight his son had a mans courage without a mans full strength or a mans full caution if the fox could shield him from danger in the forest he would rationally he knew worrying about two persons safety at the same time made it less likely either one of them would stay safe to the crows with being rational he thought a gradi sprang out from behind the trunk of an oak shouting voldars name he swung his axe in a deadly arc gerin batted it aside with his shield he had to be careful not to let the axehead hit the shield square lest it bite through thin bronze facing through leather through wood and perhaps into his arm he cut at the gradi the fellow parried with his axe beating gerins blade to one side he backed up a pace his eyes intent wary he wasnt used to facing a lefthanded swordsman while gerin had had a lifetime of struggle against righthanded foes the gradi chopped again this time gerin used his sword to turn the axe he rushed in close pushing at the gradi with his shield till the big man from the north tripped over a root and went down gerin used his sword as if it were a dagger stabbing the gradi in the throat the man let out a bubbling scream that quickly cut off as he choked on his own blood gerin scrambled to his feet he looked around he couldnt see duren and cursed foully the one plan hed had in this fight was to watch over the youth and it hadnt lasted past his own first encounter with the gradi the only thing left to do then was sweep through the woods till there were no more gradi left to encounter hed never been in a battle like this he had scant control over it he couldnt see more than a few feet in any direction nor could any of the other warriors on his side or among the gradi he ran from one nasty little fight to the next helping elabonians and trokmoi and doing his best to stretch gradi dead on the ground he was used to maneuvering scores even hundreds of chariots as if they were war galleys out on the sea all of them moving in accordance with his will not now this was two gradi leaping out from behind trees set close together and hacking down an elabonian or three elabonians and a trokm slashing and stabbing at two gradi fighting back to back till one of them fell and then swarming over the other the woods were full of shouts and screams full of the outhouse stink of pierced guts and the metallic odor of freshspilled blood whenever he saw his men he sent them toward the last band of gradi he had spotted whenever he saw gradi he shouted for his men to come and fight them he soon noted that he saw very few wounded men down on the ground he didnt need long to realize each side was finishing off the others injured men it found he bit his lips fights among elabonians even fights between elabonians and trokmoi werent commonly so savage his heart jumped there up ahead strode duren sword in one hand shield on the other arm prowling forward his head going back and forth as he picked his way west through the woods when the youth heard gerin coming up behind him he whirled around ready to fight im not the enemy gerin said although to a boy first sprouting his beard any older relative and especially his father was liable to look like a foe a lot of the time here though duren understood him as hed intended he asked the same question as had been in gerins mind are we winning drop me into the hottest of the five hells if i know the fox answered quietly so as not to draw the attention of the gradi that might have been excess caution for the woods rang with cries of every description still caution did no harm if exercised when not needed while needing it and not exercising it often led straight to disaster i dont know he repeated but were well into the woods and they havent thrown us back so id say were not losing when the words were spoken he remembered baivers telling him much the same thing in the middle of the fight against voldar and the gradi gods no he though it probably wasnt the middle of the fight but only the beginningby all the signs that fight was still going on it might go on for days more or for all gerin knew for years more gods didnt need to eat or sleep in any ordinary senses of the words and they were a lot harder to kill than mere men he reached out and tapped durens shield with his sword come on he said lets see what sort of lovely company we have waiting for us they hadnt gone far before they came to a screen of bushes around the edge of a small clearing again the scene eerily reminded gerin of the clearings in the divine gradihome the battle going on in the clearing was hardly less confused and no less savage than the one from which voldar had expelled him baivers duren shouted and ran for the fighting gerin had he had his way would have gone into the fight without shouting first and might have cut down a gradi or two before the enemy knew he was there well no help for it now baivers he cried and sprinted after his son one gradi who turned to meet durens onslaught died a moment later the victim of the trokm from whom hed been distracted maybe outrageous openness was as good at inducing surprise as stealth gerin reminded himself to think that one over if he ever found a moment when no one was trying to slaughter him if he did find such a moment it wouldnt be any time soon here in the clearing his men and the gradi could find and fight one another that was just what they were doing with sword and spear and knife and axe with stones grubbed from the ground with their hands and with those brokennailed hands themselves voldar the gradi cried over and over again gerin had heard that shout more often than hed ever wanted and had gauged the different ways the gradi used it what he heard now gave him hope the gradi sounded imploring as if they hadnt heard from their goddess for a long time and desperately wished they would voldar is dead he yelled at the raiders some of them understood enough elabonian to recoil in horror from that claim the fox knew perfectly well it was a lie he didnt care if the gradi couldnt prove him wrongand their reaction suggested they couldnthe might as well have been right voldar too preoccupied with her battle on the gods plane to come to the aid of the men she had intended to rule the northlands might as well have been voldar dead but the gradi remained fierce opponents even without voldar tilting the natural order of things in their favor one of them shouting incomprehensible things that gerin did not think were compliments swung his axe at the fox his shield turned the stroke so that the flat of the axehead rather than the edge slammed against his helmet but that was plenty to send him staggering the gradi rushed after him he raised his sword to block the next vicious stroke but it sent the blade flying from his hand bellowing in triumph the raider brought back the axe to finish him off gerin seized the fellows wrist and twisted the gradi bellowed again this time in pain and alarm gerin gave him another twist spinning his foe over his hip and slamming him down to the ground the fox was still one of the best wrestlers in the northlands and the gradi as far as he could tell knew nothing whatever of the art the fall knocked the axe loose the gradi scrambled after it gerin kicked him in the ribs then in the face he grabbed the axe himselfit was closer than his sword he swung it up then down blood sprayed out from the wound it made the gradis limbs convulsed gerin hit him again he let out a snoring cough and died baivers shouted someone from behind the fox the shout was so fierce he glanced back over his shoulderand leaped aside just in time as drungo dragos son swung a sword at him drungo you idiot im your overlord gerin screamed drungo stared oh it is you lord prince he said in what sounded like sincere apology i saw the axe and i figured you were a gradi i didnt think one of us might have taken it off one of them gerin sighed drungo wasnt much good at thinking drago the bear his father hadnt been either both of them though were handy men to have in a brawl more elabonians and trokmoi stormed into the clearing more gradi came in too but not so many more after a while no more gradi were left on their feet in the open space the ground was strewn with gradi down and moaning and with gradi down and forever silent a good many of their enemies lay there with them gerins followers who were still upright stalked across the redsplashed grass finishing off the wounded gradi who still lived come on gerin said when that grim task was done he pointed into the woods weve still got plenty of the whoresons to deal with in there some of his men even those who had fought bravely in the clearing hesitated before leaving it for the forest he couldnt blame them fighting in the open was what they knew sneaking among the trees was more like hunting except that here the quarry was also hunting them somewhere west in the woods a gradi was shouting to his comrades gerin couldnt understand a word he was saying but he recognized the voice that was the captain whod spoken elabonian marshaling his troops the fox stopped and cocked his head and listened to the fighting it got fiercer off to his left he sent men of his own in that direction unlike the gradi he didnt roar and bellow while he was doing it then he started moving toward that great voice van was right all along he remarked to duren theyve found themselves a leader whos trying to whip them into shape voldar or no voldar if we kill him my bet is they start falling to pieces with their chieftain alive the gradi showed no signs of falling to pieces gerin had to fight several times as he approached the roaring gradi leader he was getting close when a big man emerged from behind a tree that didnt look to have been wide enough to conceal his bulk as drungo had he started to attack the fox unlike drungo he checked himself without gerins having to scream at him gerin halted what would have been his own attack he nodded to van hardly more surprised than if hed met him walking out of the great hall back at fox keep good to see they havent let the air out of you and you the outlander answered you heading over to put paid to that fellow giving orders at the top of his lungs just what im doing gerin agreed killing one man and breaking their backbone is a cheaper way of beating them than having to make the fight on his terms i thought the same van said thats why i was going for him too well all go for him duren said who does it doesnt matter as long as someone does van slapped gerin on the back well fox youve trained up the sapling to grow the same way as the tree and since the tree grows straight thats a good way for the sapling to follow which is a fancy way of saying that the lad is right come on he glided forward amazingly light and quiet on his feet for so large a man gerin and duren followed the gradi chieftain kept on bawling orders to his men he wasnt hard to find any more than a roaring longtooth would have been the fox suspected he would have been about as glad to stumble over a longtooth as over the chief van stretched out his arm palm facing the fox gerin obediently halted van didnt even point that hed stopped was enough gerin peered through the screen of bushes a gradi came running up to one of his fellows who stood there he gasped out something the other man listened then turned to one side and shouted this was the enemys leader sure enough well all dash out together gerin whispered wishing he had his bowkilling the big fierce raider from a distance would have been safe and convenient one two as he said three another gradi runner burst into the clearing the fox grabbed at his friend and son trying to hold them back but too latetheyd already launched themselves at the gradi chieftain he burst out of the woods too half a step behind them half a dozen strides and they were on the three gradi that was unfortunately just enough time to let the raiders break free from their momentary shock raise their axes and fight back the two lesser gradi sprang in front of their chief one of them engaged van the other duren the first two foes they found that left the leader for gerin he would willingly have forgone the honor the gradi was bigger than he was and younger than he was too the gradi also knew more about using an axe than did gerin who still held the weapon hed snatched from his fallen foe the only advantage gerin had try as he would he couldnt think of any voldar the gradi shouted and cut at his head he duckedand almost fell victim to a backhand cut the gradi was as strong as he looked and as quick too gerin made a cut of his own a tentative one which the enemy leader easily evaded the gradi chopped at him again he took this blow on the shield and felt it all the way up his arm to his shoulder his best hope he thought was for van and duren to beat their men and help him he didnt see any way he was likely to beat the gradi chief on his own by the fierce sneer the gradi wore he didnt see any way gerin was likely to beat him either he feinted once feinted twice then chopped again gerin once more managed to get his shield in front of the blowbut it hit square and true the axehead smashing through his protection the very corner of the sharp edge of the axe kissed his arm with fire he held on to his grip on the shield thoughthe wound was not severe and when the gradi captain tried to pull the axe free so he could strike again he found he could not it had twisted and would not go back through the narrow hole it had made he shouted in fury and alarm gerin did not give him the chance to clear the axe from the shield instead of backing away he moved close to the gradi so the fellow had no room in which to draw back his arm the gradi didnt like that his lips skinned back from his teeth in a horrible grin he should have let go of the axe and run instead he kept trying to jerk it loose and to fend off gerins own lefthanded blows since his left arm and the foxs were on opposite sides and since his right hand clutched the useless axe handle he could not do it after gerins second stroke got home the gradi groaned and his grip faltered the fox hit him again this time in the side of the neck the gradi let out a startled grunt his eyes went very wide he let go of the axe his mouth shaped a word gerin thought it was voldar but it had no breath behind it the gradi swayed toppled fell gerin whirled to help van and duren van had his own man down and was yanking his spear out of the gradis belly a loop of graypink gut came with it duren was fighting a defensive battle against his foe when van and gerin both rushed to his aid the gradi who opposed him turned to flee he did not get far another gradi burst into the clearing staring in shocked dismay at what he found there he did escape before gerin and his comrades could pursue come on the fox said this isnt the whole job we cant just beat them herewe have to break them if he lived he knew hed want to sleep three days and would wake up stiff and sore in every joint even if he did he plunged into the woods nonetheless there was more hard fighting as the day wore along but something seemed to have gone out of the gradi when their chieftain fell the sun was only a little more than halfway down toward the west when gerin emerged from the woods and saw a few a very few gradi running off toward the west past bidgosh pond behind him the sounds of battle were ebbing such shouts and cries as he could hear were almost all in either elabonian or the trokm tongue half a bowshot north of him someone else came out from among the trees a trokm he looked toward the fox and waved gerin waved back adiatunnus he called slowly adiatunnus came toward him the woodsrunner looked as tired as gerin felt diviciacus went down puir wight he said my own right hand he was all these years a rare sad thing but he straightened lord prince weve beaten the buggers and in a way i dont think theyll be over soon from here we can clear the northlands of em right out to the edge o the sea i think that may be so gerin answered more men elabonians and trokmoi both came out of the woods and gathered around their two leaders hardly daring to believe what hed just said gerin repeated it i think that may be so it is that lord prince adiatunnus said positively then he paused perhaps to weigh his own words aye it is so lord prince and twas you who made it real i couldna ha done it i own as much no man but your own self could ha done it lord prince he shook his head nay that isna right who says its not van boomed angrily i do adiatunnus answered he sighed then went not to one knee but to both no man but your own self could ha done it lord king xii from a hillock not far away gerin stared at the orynian ocean it was not like the greater inner sea save in being a large body of water the blue inner sea was calm peaceful the gray ocean rolled and pulsed and smashed against rocks sending spray high into the air it was in its way as barbarous and as vigorous as the gradi who rode it a strong stone keep sat by the ocean not far south of the niffet the fox had driven the gradi from most of the northlands their remnant lingered here he did not think he could storm this keep he could not properly besiege it either not with its back to the orynian ocean the gradi from the north could keep it supplied by a road he did not control duren climbed to the top of the hillock he looked out at the ocean for a while he found it endlessly fascinating then he pointed toward the keep the gradi still held what will you do about them father he asked confident the fox would come up with something even if he couldnt see for himself what it was gerin gave him the only answer he could this year nothing weve done all we could weve done more than i ever expected as long as the gradi gods are at war on their own plane the gradi themselves we can beat or at least meet on even terms which is good enough what if they sally after we go away though duren said ill leave men behindmy vassals elabonians and trokmoi both the gradi killed most of the local lords their claims have lapsed well restore some keeps maybe build some new ones and make this a harder land for them to overrun than it used to be before all the lords were rivals to all the others now theyll be able to call on one another against the gradiand on me too aye duren said they can call on their king on his own gerin would not have claimed the title aragis the archer who styled himself grand duke had stayed quiet this summer probably hoping gerin and the gradi would wreck each other leaving him to pick up the piecesand the rank that went with picking up the pieces what he would do when he found out gerin was wearing the rank remained to be seen but adiatunnus had been a rival almost as dangerous as aragis and adiatunnus had been the one to call him king almost makes me think there is such a thing as gratitude gerin murmured father duren asked never mind the fox answered the trokmoi had been as willing as his own men to acknowledge his kingship how long that willingness would last also remained to be seen while it did he would make the most of it you could push people further if you moved them in the direction they were already going and fear of a gradi revival would make them want to pay attention to the man who had stopped the raiders the first time we have to have ships of our own he said he knew hed said that before without ships of his own the gradi would be able to rebuild their strength and assail the northlands again at a time of their choosing duren had another thought what do we do if the gradi gods end up overcoming baivers and the underground powers gerin set a hand on his sons shoulder im less worried about that now than i was before i saw how potent baivers could be when he chose even if voldar beats him she wont rout him if she could do that she would have done it already and if she does beat him well we may be able to stir up other sleepy elabonian gods against her and her friends baivers will let them know the fight is one they need to make that will put the gods more in the world if you know what i mean than they have been since time out of mind duren said ive thought the same thing the fox agreed i dont like the notionin the face of the gods powers the ones we have look pretty small but if thats what happens then it is thats all well have to make the best of it we can one way or another i expect well manage you will duren said remembering himself at the age when his beard had begun to sprout gerin knew how rare and precious his sons unalloyed approval was duren went on you always find a way is that how i want to be remembered gerin wondered he tasted the words in his mind he always found a way it wasnt the sort of memorial a hero in a minstrels song would have chosen for himself or was it gerin was himself the hero of more than one song cycle though the fox of whom the minstrels sang bore scant resemblance to the one who dwelt inside gerins body he always found a way aye you could do worse than that when we get back to fox keep my mother will be so proud duren said he was without a doubt right he meant selatre of course he knew she hadnt given him birth but he hardly ever seemed to think about that as best gerin could tell he didnt remember elise any more the fox did he wondered if she was still alive if she was he wondered what she would think to hear him called king of the north his mouth twisted no point to thinking about it hed never know knowing hed never know he forced his thoughts toward more immediate concerns saying im not much worried about what selatre will think of me shes fond of me whether people call me king or not when we get back to adiatunnus holding though i do want to see how the rest of the trokmoi take to the title what will you do if they reject it duren asked i dont know gerin looked sidelong at his son maybe well have a war ive seen enough of war for a while duren burst out youre learning lad gerin told him youre learning you leave everything to me now adiatunnus said as they were about to go back east over the venien river gerin laughed out loud i didnt get this old by leaving everything to anybodyexcept me i named you king once now the trokm chief said in some exasperation am i likely to go back on that naming with your own southron warriors all around me the ugly kerns truth to tell i dont know what youre likely to do gerin answered as hed hoped adiatunnus took that for a compliment a tribute to his deviousness the woodsrunner slapped his driver on the back the driver urged the team ahead they splashed through the veniens ford at a gallop their hooves and the chariots wheels kicking up spray that sparkled in the sun you dont want to let him get too far ahead or who knows which way his mouth is liable to start running van said even before hed spoken though duren had sped up crossing the venien right behind adiatunnus and in the same style van rumbled approval down deep in his chest thats a fine lad you have there id noticed gerin remarked which made the outlander laugh and duren standing there in front of both of them fidget noticeably trokmoi working in the fields called questions to the returning warriors the shouts of victory they got back started them whooping in turn adiatunnus added whenever he got the chance come back to the keep now and ill give you summat even more worth the hearing of it he didnt actually go into the keep but gathered with his own people and the returned elabonian warriors in the square of the large village in front of the castle with the sense of drama any good chief had he waited for the crowd to buildand to buzz serving women brought ale out of the keep and poured out dippersful to whoever looked thirsty when the trokm judged the moment right he clambered up onto a big stump and shouted the gradi are ruined for fair sure and they are their nasty gods still locked in a shindy and themselves pushed all the way back to the ocean that unleashed an ocean in the village an ocean of cheers adiatunnus reached down and hauled gerin up onto the stump with him he went on the southron here he had summat to do with ita wee bit you might say gerin was used to both the excesses and understatements of trokm oratory so were adiatunnus listeners who cheered the fox adiatunnus warmed to his theme and ill have you know im vassal no more to the prince of the north that brought cheers too but cheers of a different sortthe cheers of trokmoi bayingly eager to break free of any feudal obligations the fox wondered if adiatunnus was about to betray him after all then the trokm shouted nay for now im vassal to gerin the fox king o the north and so named out of my very own mouth silence slammed down for a moment as the trokmoi took that in and worked out what it meant then they and gerins elabonian retainers all cheered louder than ever adiatunnus gave the fox an elbow in the ribs taking half a step forwardany more and he would have fallen off the stumpgerin said ill try to be a good king a fair king for everyone elabonian or trokm and if anyone elabonian or trokm tries to take advantage of me hell think a tree trunk fell on him is it a bargain aye they roared he suspected they were cheering deliverance from the gradi more than they were cheering him but he didnt mind that without him they wouldnt have had the deliverance he was glad they had sense enough to realize thatfor a little while he hopped down off the stump a very pretty trokm girl with redgold hair handed him a dipper of ale he poured it down when he gave the dipper back he noticed how bright a blue her eyes were what moist inviting lips she had just how snugly her linen tunic fit over firm young breasts he was meant to notice in what seemed more a purr than a voice she said a king is it what might it be like to sleep with a king if you ever come to fox keep you can ask my wife he told her she stared at him those blue blue eyes went hard as stone cold as ice she flounced off he counted himself lucky she hadnt crowned him with the dipper youre a wasteful man fox van said the gods dont make em that goodlooking every day ill survive gerin said and i wont have any crockery thrown at me when i get home which is more than i can say for you you mean fand van said gerin nodded the outlander rolled his eyes shed throw things at me whether i futtered other women on the road or not so the way i see it is i might as well that sort of reasoning would have sent a sithonian sophist running for cover it sent gerin looking for another dipper of ale with luck one from a serving girl not quite so anxious to try him on for size just because he was wearing a fancy new title he sighed a little van was right she had been very pretty a sentry up on the palisade peered out at the approaching force of chariotry who comes to fox keep he called he knew the answer to that question gerin had sent messengers ahead with news of what hed done nevertheless he answered loudly and proudly gerin the fox king of the north enter your keep lord king the sentry shouted the rest of the men on the palisade erupted in cheers cheers that soon echoed from within the keep as well the drawbridge thudded down gerin tapped duren on the shoulder his son drove him over the drawbridge and into the courtyard he hopped out of the chariot then and embraced selatre she said i hoped this would happen one day im so glad it has and so proud of you i thought it might happen one day gerin answered though i never expected adiatunnus to be the one to proclaim my rank up until the gradi grew to be serious trouble i thought killing him would likely be what made folk style me king rihwin the fox came over and set his hands on his hips for your information he said loftily i find this everswelling titulature of yours in questionable taste then grinning he clasped gerins hand youre impossible gerin told his fellow fox rihwins mouth opened gerin beat him to the punch line bloody implausible anyhow the king geroge shouted the monster still short a fang held up a jack of ale in salute the king one more feast gerin thought one more big feast and i can send my vassals back to their own keeps and let them eat their own food the fields past which hed ridden on the way back to fox keep looked to have good crops coming in he hoped they would that would let him begin to rebuild his stores which were painfully low if his vassals had good harvests too they might even be able to send grain west to the lands across the venien which had had such a dose of gradistyle weather that their fields were unlikely to yield much this year then the fox stopped worrying so much about the fields and the harvest dagref clotild and blestar came rushing out of the great hall and swarmed over him and duren i want to hear everything that happened after you left dagref said i want you to tell it to me now in order so i dont get anything mixed up im sure you want that gerin said hugging his eldest by selatre he was also sure that having heard everything once dagref would be able to correct him on details for years afterwards and the boy would be right too almost every time dagref could be quite alarming gerin went on ill tell you everything soon maybe even tomorrow right now i want toi need tospend time with my vassals its not fair dagref protested youll start to forget things itll be all right clotild told him papa has a pretty good memorymost of the time she added with a small sniff papa blestar said happily papa gerin hugged him too he wasnt finding fault with his father probably though for no better reason than that he was too young selatre gave gerin a jack of ale he poured a small libation down onto the ground and said thank you lord baivers as with the battle cries there in the woods not far from the ocean he had no idea whether the god of barley and brewing heard or was still too busy fighting the gradi gods to pay any attention to mere mortals he didnt care he was grateful and willingno eagerto show it he went through the keepinto the great hall back out to the courtyardseveral times drinking eating clapping his vassals and their vassals on the back and telling them how splendidly they had fought something which in most cases had the virtue of being true they were doing much the same thing themselves though less systematic in their mingling he got called lord king often enough to begin to get used to the new title even if he still wondered what aragis the archer would do in response to his wearing it night fell so many torches burned people hardly seemed to notice and then here and thereon benches in the great hall in quiet corners of the courtyardthe warriors who had returned to fox keep with him began falling asleep gerin remembered wishing he could sleep for three days after that fight in the woods he was still far far behind and likely would be for oh the next twenty years if he lived so long not far away from him fand demanded of van and how many wenches were you after sleeping with this time she sounded halfdrunk and more than halfdangerous to gerins horror van who had drunk a good deal himself began counting on his fingers to make sure he got things right seven it was he announced at last as proud of his precision as dagref might have been its an old man youre turning into fand told him you said a dozen the last time her voice rose to a screech keep your breeches on curse you she dashed her jack of ale into his face dripping and sputtering he roared at her she roared back even louder gerins head started to ache he looked around for his children the younger ones along with vans son and daughter were curled up on the rushes not far from the doorway to the great hall but well away from the path people used to go in and out someone had spread a couple of wool blankets over them they were fine where they were he saw no point to waking them up and taking them to their bed they might not fall asleep again for half the night he didnt see duren at all that probably meant his eldest was finding a way to celebrate his return that would have made his wife shout as fand was shouting at van since he didnt have a wife though the fox did see selatre with dagref clotild and blestar conveniently asleep he also saw an opportunity he caught her eye then glanced toward the stairway that led up to their bedchamber she smiled and nodded with only the two of them in it the bed seemed uncommonly large uncommonly luxurious making love without having to hurry or to worry about the children waking up at an inconvenient moment seemed uncommonly luxurious too afterwards gerin thought of the pretty trokm girl who hadnt managed to tempt him into imitating van chuckling he told selatre the story then asked her what might it be like to sleep with a king i she said like it geroge looked dubious as gerin walked up to him carrying a small bowl filled with fine moist clay the monsters thin lips skinned back from his teeth those teeth looked so extremely formidable gerin wondered whether he wanted to go through with what he had planned he decided he did open your mouth he told the monster youre going to have me eat clay geroge protested you didnt tell me id have to eat clay you dont have to eat it gerin told him you just have to let me press it up against your teeth so i can get the shape of the fang you have left ill use the mold youre giving me to make a gold tooth like it to put on the other side to take the place of the one the gods under ikos took itll taste horrible geroge said i dont think i want to do it its only dirt gerin said its not even very dirty dirt if you know what i mean its the fine clay they use for baking pots when geroge still shook his massive head the fox sighed and said when were done ill give you a jack of ale to wash away whatever taste there is oh all right geroge still sounded reluctant even after gerins promise which showed how unwilling he had been before open your mouth gerin said again eyes rolling gerin did the fox brought the lump of clay up to it with more than a little trepidation if geroge chose to bite down now hed spend the rest of his days onehanded geroge grunted as gerin made the impression of his fang and the teeth near it he went from grunt to growl but held still splendid gerin said gently freeing the clay if youd wiggled there i would have had to do this all over again oh what a liar im getting to be he thought doing it once had been hard doing it twice he didnt care to contemplate doing it twice geroge peered down with interest at the marks his teeth had made in the clay theyre big arent they he remarked i didnt know they were that big i thought they were more like yours did you gerin said thats what comes of living among humans all your lifewere your touchstone your standard of comparison that probably made geroge and tharma a lot safer to be near than they might have been otherwise he took the bowl with the impression to the oven the potter used in his trade and fired it as the potter would have fired a platter or a storage jar when it came out and had cooled he took it to the shack where he worked his magic he had no intention of doing anything magical to it but had a small furnace of his own there in it in another small bowl he put some armlets and rings from his treasury loot taken from the trokmoi he stoked the little furnace and used goatskin bellows to make the fire burn hotter yet hed carved his tongs himself of wood and faced them with bronze so they wouldnt char so fast or even catch fire at an inopportune moment with them he lifted the bowl and poured molten gold into the mold he prepared for it the mold took almost all the metal he had melted geroge did indeed have big teeth when the metal had cooled he broke the mold he used a bronze chisel to cut away the gold that filled the impressions of other teeth near the fang then polished the fang by shaking it in a hide bag full of fine sand after hed attached a couple of thin wires to the base he took the gold tooth to geroge this time the monster opened his mouth willingly enough gerin put the gold tooth in the gap the monsters gods had left when they ripped the real fang from geroges mouth he used the wires to anchor the artificial fang to the genuine teeth on either side of it what do you think he asked geroge the monster explored with his tongue the change in his mouth it feels all right he said then he opened his mouth in an enormous smile what does it look like your other fang except its gold gerin answered that was literal truth but it wasnt what geroge wanted to hear he waved to tharma who was walking across the courtyard and pointed to gerins dentistry how do i look like a monster with a gold tooth gerin thought but held his tongue waiting to see what tharma would say i think you look very handsome she replied after grave contemplation geroge preened and swaggered gerin didnt know whether the answer and geroges response to it pleased or worried him more chariot wheels rumbled on the paving blocks of the elabon way along with the chariots gerin led a goodsized force of men riding horses the army he headed was smaller than the one he had taken west over the venien against the gradi but more than large enough to be formidable like the force that had traveled west it included both elabonians and trokmoi adiatunnus having sent a contingent of woodsrunners at gerins request van looked back and chuckled if this doesnt have em ready to piss their breeches nothing ever will thats the idea gerin answered anything worth doing is worth doing properlyor worth overdoing if youd rather think of it like that aye that suits me pretty well the outlander said considering his excesses whenever he got out of fands sight gerin had to agree with him duren pointed ahead theres the border post between bevanders holding and ricolfs no thats not right his father told him theres the border post between bevanders holding and yours and if anyone has any doubts about that well i expect we can convince him to change his mind he waved back over his shoulder to show what he meant the guards on ricolfs side of the border stared in popeyed wonder at the army bearing down on them gerin started to tell duren to stop and parley with them then decided to hold his tongue duren was going to be the baron here not himself duren did stop in a shaken voice one of the border guards asked who ah who comes to the holding formerly of ricolf the red he sounded as if he couldnt decide whether to sell his life dear or flee for the nearest woods his companion at the border crossing added not just whowhy he was gawping at the trokmoi as if wondering if theyd decided to settle down in the neighborhood i am duren gerins son grandson to ricolf the red and heir to this holding through my mother ricolfs daughter elise duren answered having completed the service i owed my father i have come to take my rightful place as baron here from this day forth i stay in this holding brought a few ah friends along have you lord the first guard asked he was looking at the trokmoi too he has my support as you might have guessed he would gerin put in both border guards nodded oh yes lord prince they chorused gerin van and duren grinned at one another being at the forefront of news was always enjoyable to the guards duren said allow me to present you to my father gerin the fox king of the north so proclaimed first by adiatunnus the trokm after we all vanquished the gradi together in a way gerin thought it was too bad the two guards had already been staring their eyes couldnt get much wider they jaws couldnt drop much farther the first one the one with the slight hitch to his speech said i would uh be glad to have more of that uh tale lord and i would be glad to give itanother time duren answered now i want to settle myself in the keep that is mine he flicked the reins the horses began to trot because he was driving the lead chariot in the army that was the best signal he could give for the rest of the cars to enter the holding that was now becoming his on the way down to the keep that had been ricolfs peasants who saw durens army fled for their lives i dont like that any better than you do father duren said pointing to serfs running for the shelter of the woods i worry about it less here than i would otherwise gerin answered for one thing this is a goodsized force and all the more frightening on account of that and for another remember weve got trokmoi with us the woodsrunners havent been seen in these parts since just a little while after they flooded over the niffet aye thats so van agreed and the reason they havent been seen in these parts for so long is that youve held them away from these partsnot that anybody around here will want to give you credit for it i didnt do it to get the credit for it the fox said i did it because it needed doing he chuckled besides the only thing a baron in one holding is liable to give his neighbor credit for is catching unpleasant diseases from his sheep van snorted so did duren although he unlike the outlander tried to pretend he hadnt lying by the elabon way the keep that had been ricolfs was well positioned for its holder to keep an eye on north and southbound travelers the frantic stir and bustle on the walls said nobody there had seen anything like the approaching army for a long time the cry of who comes to this castle betokened not just curiosity but genuine alarm duren needed no prompting from gerin to answer as he had at the border duren gerins son come to claim the lordship here which passes to me from ricolf the red through his daughter elise my mother then he added let down the drawbridge this instant ricrod he did not say or suffer the consequences afterwards but his meaning was plain to gerin it was evidently plain to ricrod too for the drawbridge came down in short order duren drove over it into the courtyard of the keep followed by so many other cars that resistance from the men already inside quickly became hopeless as he snapped orders some of gerins men took charge of the doors into the great hall of the castle to make sure they could not be slammed shut against the newcomers gerin approved he would have taken charge of the keep the same way but instead of a host of armed men only ricrod the steward came out of the great hall he looked round in amazement at the force that had come to install duren as baron the size of that force drove from his head whatever objection he might have had welcome lord he said to duren and then to gerin and welcome to you as well lord prince my fathers style these days with the gradi beaten is lord king duren said that made ricrod stare and several soldiers exclaim in the holding that had been ricolfs the gradi had never been more than a name as he had with the trokmoi gerin had shielded the lands belonging to his former fatherinlaw from the onslaughts of the invaders but if only a name the gradi were a potent name to the men here and the importance of the name only grew if beating them had been enough to let gerin assume a royal title after the tale had been briefly told duren said ricrod send messengers at once to authari and hilmic wacho and ratkis order them to report here to my keep at once that they may give me homage and fealty the look he gave the steward was less than warm i know you can get messages to them quickly eryes ricrod said to gerin he sounded nervous in ricrods boots the fox would have been nervous too the messages hed sent the last time duren had been through this holding had almost ended up getting its rightful overlord killed ricrod coughed a couple of times then bowed low it shall be as you say lord in all things with dawn tomorrow the messengers go forth that will do duren said grudgingly he still stared through the steward did you wait till the next morning to send them out when i left this keep on the way to ikos lord i did ricrod said he nodded toward the altar that smoked close by the hearth in dyaus allfathers name i swear it very well duren said mollified by the answer gerin thought his acceptance wise unless he planned to remove ricrod in which case it didnt matter but if he was going to keep the steward and work with him he needed to show he trusted him otherwise even if ricrod hadnt been inclined toward plots he was liable to acquire that inclination in a hurry the foxs eyes went to the altar dedicated to dyaus he wondered if the head of the elabonian pantheon noticed when someone swore an oath in his name from what baivers had said dyaus was even further removed from the material plane than the rest of the elabonian gods voldar now gerin didnt want to think what the gradi goddess might have done to one of her people who falsely swore by her except perhaps one who swore falsely to gain advantage over her foes but dyaus seemed to ignore such transgressions would ricrod know that or feel it somehow gerin studied the steward he had trouble deciding he shook his head it wasnt properly his concern or wouldnt be for long this was durens holding duren would choose whom to believe here whom to doubt if he chose wrong hed pay for it to duren ricrod said er lord with the lord prince your father now become the lord king your father do you hold this keep as a free and independent baron or as his vassal gerins respect for ricrods wit till then low rose sharply that was a good question and one whose answer every petty baron in the holding would want i am my own man here duren answered i have sworn vassalage to no one for this keep nor has anyone asked me to swear it if you think i will deny i am my fathers son though you are making a mistake hed said much the same thing here shortly after his grandfathers death it had seemed theoretical then now it mattered and mattered a great deal ricrod smacked his lips tasting the reply i could not ask you to speak fairer lord he said at last and sounded as if he meant it several of the soldiers at the keep also nodded well said came from one of them gerin grinned to himself duren was starting off here as well as anyone could hope what would happen after authari and the other leading vassals arrived was liable to be a different story though up on the wall of durens keep ricrod looked away toward the southwest why dont they come he muttered fretfully glancing over to gerin who stood beside him they should have begun appearing a couple of days ago if they dont come soonauthari brokentooth especiallyill go pay them a visit and well see how they like that gerin said it would keep your men from eating this keep out of food ricrod muttered gerin didnt think he was supposed to hear that so he politely pretended he hadnt the first of ricolfs leading vassals came in that afternoon gerin would have bet on ratkis bronzecasters arriving before any of the others and would have won that bet had he made it with anyone ratkis wasted no time in going to one knee before duren and saying good to have a lord again in this holding good to be here duren said im sure i still have a lot to learn some of that i expect ill learn from you ratkis got to his feet and turned to gerin hes already learned a good deal from you sounds like he raised an eyebrow and did the messenger have it right that youre calling yourself king these days he had it right gerin answered and waited to see how ricolfs vassalnow durens vassalwould respond to that i hope you get away with it lord king was all ratkis said considering that gerin hoped he would get away with it too he didnt see how he could complain about ratkis answer authari brokentooth wacho fidus son and hilmic barrelstaves all arrived within a couple of hours of one another on the following day each of them came with a large force of chariotry no doubt as large as he could muster in his minds eye gerin saw messengers hurrying from one keep to another the sum of their three little armies though was about half the size of his as they were crestfallen to discover got their line nibbled by a bigger fish than they expected van said gleefully instead of pulling him up onto the bank they find that theyre going out into the creek so they do gerin said and do you know what im not the least bit sorry for them maybe now seeing what i can do if i like theyll realize they arent big enough to quarrel with me and theyll settle down and be goodor at least not impossiblevassals for my son if that was what the three vassal barons had in mind they didnt show it right away authari stomped up to ricrod and all politesse forgotten demanded has your messenger gone daft whats this nonsense about kings he was babbling glancing nervously toward gerin the steward cleared his throat and answered ah lord authari no nonsense to it there stands the king of the north authari clapped a hand to his forehead you havent had enough of lording it over men who are by rights your peers he snapped at gerin who named you king anyhow did you do it yourself as the fox had more than once already he took considerable pleasure in answering no the first man to use the title was my vassal adiatunnus the trokm autharis jaw dropped hilmic and wacho both gaped at gerin all three of them must have known how much trouble adiatunnus had given him over the years and had probably hoped to match his thorny independence authari found his voice first what did he go and do that for he sounded not just disbelieving but outraged for driving the gradi back to the edge of the ocean and for embroiling their gods with others so we could pin em back there gerin answered calmly if youll think back van added youll recall the fox here was the one who put paid to the monsters a few years back and to the wizard balamung a few years before that so hes done a thing or three to deserve being called a king what in the five hells have you done to deserve to say he doesnt several of autharis men nodded when they heard that which made gerin work hard to keep a stiff face he said what ive done doesnt matter not here not now this trip isnt about me its about my son here and about the oaths you swore after you heard what the sibyl had to say about him i said i had to serve my father before i came and ruled this barony on my own duren put in now ive done that and now im ready to take up my rule here does any man in this keep say i have not the right there it was a challenge set out with more blunt force perhaps than gerin would have used but with undeniable power the crowded great hall in the castle that had been ricolfs and was now passing to his grandson grew very still men leaned forward to hear if any of ricolfs vassals would challenge that succession always a temporizer authari asked as ricrod had before him whether duren intended to hold the barony as his fathers vassal as duren had before he denied it it doesnt matter authari said then gloomily were still going to be in the middle of this kingdom whether were a part of it in name or not bah gerin thought he was right about that everyone outside durens barony with whom he would deal would be one of the foxs vassals unless he tried dealing with aragis the archer in which case gerin would make him regret it faster than hed ever imagined authari still looking for a way to play ends against middle hadnt noticed all the implications of what hed said wacho for a wonder did give it up he said were fighting somebody too big for us now you say that authari demanded angrily his suave manner eroding with his hopes but wacho nodded and so did hilmic who said look around you hes got too many men for us to fight hes got adiatunnus trokmoi backing him instead of making his life a misery and how did you manage that authari snapped at gerin arent you the one who was always prating about what a pack of savages the trokmoi were and how we elabonians shouldnt do anything with em except drive em back over the niffet since gerin had done a good deal of prating on exactly that theme he answered carefully when youve seen the gradi its amazing what a bunch of good fellows the trokmoi seem alongside em he looked down his nose at authari not that youve ever seen a gradi of course autharis scowl was a joy to behold till the fox remembered he was trying to get the petty baron to accept his sons overlordship not to make an enemy for life of him scowling still authari said had they come here wed have beaten them back maybe we would authari wacho said but the point is that they didnt come here and the reason they didnt come here is that the lord princeuh the lord kingbeat em back before they could gerin studied wacho in some bemusement he was showing more in the way of common sense than hed given any hint of having till now hit a man over the head with an idea often enough and he sometimes got it authari brokentooth was getting it too but not caring for it once he had it he set a hand on the hilt of his sword as he glared at ratkis bronzecaster if you hadnt shown up at the wrong time wed all still be free he snarled what there on the elabon way when the fox here was coming back from ikos the second time ratkis asked authari nodded ratkis by contrast shook his head i heard about what happened there you could have squashed him but you funked the job and youve got no one to blame for that but yourself under his breath he added not that you will and sure enough authari snapped thats a lie but it wasnt a lie gerin knew it and authari probably knew it too down in his heart of hearts he lacked the gamblers nerve that would have spelled the difference between a petty baron and something more prominent he looked around the great hall out toward the courtyard and out toward the encampment some of gerins men had made beyond it the fox could gauge the moment when he accepted that he could not change what he saw bah authari said we might as well get this over with he looked around again this time for duren ratkis bronzecaster did more than look he waved and got durens attention gerin waved too if authari was going to give homage and fealty the opportunity had to be seized not wasted duren hurried over gerin used elbows to help clear a space in the crowd where authari and his fellows could kneel ratkis bronzecaster had already sworn loyalty to duren but had no objection to doing it again on the contrary when he gave his new overlord homage and fealty he obviously meant what he said which exerted extra pressure on the other three men who had formerly been ricolfs vassals to mean what they said too after they had given duren homage and fealty he said in a loud voice now we see how the prophecy biton delivered through his sibyl at ikos is fulfilled may the omen prove good gerins men cheered raucously so did a good many of the ordinary troopers hilmic wacho and authari had brought with them that in turn cheered the fox if ordinary soldiers favored his son their leaders would have a harder time making trouble for duren and reminding the folk here of the oracular response also struck gerin as clever duren could claimand claim truthfullyhe took the barony with the support of the gods the fox made his way over to his son its yours now use it the best way you know how if you have trouble you know you can call on me yes i know that duren nodded i shouldnt do it save in direst need though or people will think i cant handle my own troubles thats the answer a man gives gerin thumped his son on the shoulder duren might have sounded like a man but he didnt look like one not in that moment he looked about the way gerin would have expected a youth leaving the only home hed ever known to look worried and a little afraid ill have to make my place here he said i wont have it on account of who you are thats so gerin said choosing to misunderstand him a little your place here comes from your grandfather and your mother he wondered again what elise would think if she learned her son had taken over her fathers barony he wondered again if she was still alive then he wondered what hed think what hed feel if he found out she was alive all things considered he hoped hed end his days content just to wonder my place here will spring from me from what i do and what i dont do duren persisted if im right if im clever ill do well and if im not ill have no one to blame but myself youre my son all right gerin said duren looked puzzled gerin explained most menaye and most women toowill blame anything and anybody but themselves for everything that goes wrong in their lives if you know better that puts you ahead of the game from the start i know better duren dropped his voice im not authari to try to blame ratkis because he didnt strike hard when he had the chance if authari were as bold in truth as he dreams of being youd have more trouble with him sure enough with him as he is though gerin also spoke quietly the most youll have to fret about is poison in your soup unless i miss my guess hell never try to fight you straight up if you do miss your guess i expect youll avenge me duren said bite your tonguehard gerin gestured to turn aside the evil omen ive tasted revenge too many times already and its a dish id sooner not eat of again as you say father duren matched the foxs gesture gerin set a hand on his shoulder youll do fine lad he said the men jump when you talk to them and thats a gift straight from the gods if it isnt there you cant bring it out and you have a head on your shoulders even if its a head without much beard on it right now dont take too much for granted dont fall head over heels in love with the first pretty girl you find down hereor even the third pretty girland try to learn from your mistakes do that and youll make a fine baron good advice duren said maybe he would turn out to be the one young man in a hundred who actually took good advice more likely hed have to do a lot of learning from his mistakes so long as he doesnt make one that kills him gerin thought hardly anybody learns much after that a servant came by carrying a pitcher of ale gerin held out his drinking jack the servant filled it he drank as far as he could tell he badly needed more ale in him if his mind filled with such gloomy thoughts in the aftermath of a goodsized triumph the ale didnt make him stop worrying maybe he would do that when they flipped earth onto his shrouded body on the other hand he was liable to be thinking they werent doing a proper job of burying him that was a morbid thought too it made him laugh anyhow authari wacho and hilmic took their men back to their castles the day after they acknowledged duren as their overlord ratkis bronzecaster who was on better terms with his new suzerain stayed a day longer then he too departed leading his retainers off to the southwest ricrod looked visibly distressed when gerin didnt leave the next morning you think theyre liable to come charging back as soon as they decide weve upped and gone van asked i dont know gerin answered im not what you call dead keen about finding out the hard way either and if the steward here wants to grumble about us eating the storerooms empty let him he lowered his voice so only van could hear if im not crazy id say duren picks himself a new steward as soon as he has his feet on the ground you are crazy fox but nobody ever said you were stupid van answered nobody ever said that about duren either which means youre almost sure to be right none of the reluctant vassals tried anything untoward so gerin and his army rode north three days later duren stood on the wall of the keep now his waving till a bend in the road took his father out of sight the fox was waving too when high ground hid duren he felt it had robbed him of a piece of himself too he wondered how long he would take to get over the feeling he wondered if he ever would up in the watchtower of fox keep the sentry winded his trumpet a chariot approaches from the south lord prince a moment later sounding embarrassed he corrected himself lord king i should say still not being altogether used to his own royal title gerin did not take offense when those around him had trouble remembering it he hurried up onto the palisade to see who had traveled almost to the niffet to pay him a visit a couple of the men up there shouted out a challenge to the newcomer from his chariot he shouted back at formidable volume i am marlanz rawmeat sent to treat with gerin the fox by my overlord the grand duke aragis the archer that got complete and attentive silence from the men up on the wall gerin included hed been sure he would hear from aragis about his assumption of the kingship he hadnt expected to hear so soon he called marlanz youre my guestfriend from ten years ago use my keep as your own for as long as you choose to stay here hearing that the men at the gatehouse lowered the drawbridge so marlanz could ride over the ditch and into the keep aragis envoy was much as the fox remembered him a big strong muscular fellow smarter than he looked and now a bit thicker through the middle than he had been ten years earlier gerin also remembered he had a streak of wereblood in him but the moons had not come full together in clumps of late and so marlanz remained wholly human in form he clasped gerins hand in a grip few warriors could have matched good to see you again fox he said its been a long time you look well i was thinking the same of you gerin answered that was your son heading up what was old ricolfs holding marlanz asked word came down ricolf had passed on its true im sorry to say gerin looked sharply at marlanz maybe he hadnt come about the title after all has the archer a quarrel with that unless i were going to claim ricolfs barony for my own which ive never wanted to do it has no other heir but duren if you doubt me go speak to the sibyl at ikos aragis envoy spread his hands and shook his head you havent meddled in the grand dukes part of the northlands so he has no business meddling up here and so far as he knows what you say about your sons claim is true but gerin realized his first guess had been right after all go on he said marlanz rawmeat coughed as if to advertise he spoke hesitantly hed gained in subtlety since his previous trip north but the point of the visit could not be delayed is it true fox what the grand duke has heard that youve taken the title of king for yourself actually i had it given to me gerin answered by adiatunnus the trokm of all people we heard that too but had trouble crediting it marlanz said if you say its so though ill believe you the question grand duke aragis would have me put is this what do you mean by it when adiatunnus offered it to me i kept it because i think ive earned it gerin answered if aragis disapproves marlanz broke in to repeat what do you mean by it when you style yourself king of the north do you lay claim to the whole of the northlands do you claim to be overlord to the grand duke if you do i am to tell you he rejects out of hand any such claim oh gerin said and then oh again because that let him make noise without obliging him to make sense it also gave him a chance to think and think he did he felt as he had when light returned under the shrine of ikos after he and the monsters gods finished their strange parley no longer altogether in the dark i see what troubles aragis tell him no marlanz in my own lands my style is now king not prince but i do not claim any lands i did not claim before simply because of my new style as far as im concerned the grand duke aragis is lord of his own lands and is not obliged to me in any way for them that is the question i was asking yes marlanz said gratefully the grand duke will be pleased at the news i bring him you and he have lived side by side with each other for a long time now he may not be your closest friend but he respects you and i him gerin said truthfully he was glad he had earned aragis respect aragis from all he had seen either respected you or fell on you like a landslide and crushed you he was a man with no middle ground in him he has always thought so fox marlanz replied he did not call gerin lord king possibly because aragis had told him not to gerin gave a mental shrug he was not about to fret over trifles marlanz looked thoughtful then went on you said you claimed no new lands because of your new style do you claim new lands for some other reason gerin eyed him with considerable respect a decade earlier he wouldnt have noticed such a subtle point the fox would have been just as well pleased if he hadnt noticed it now but since he had noticed it he had to be answered aye i do most of the land between my former western border and the orynian ocean has passed into my hands by right of conquest over the gradi weve heard somewhat of this down in the south but the tales are new and sound confused marlanz said what really happened that was a dangerous question to ask a man whod studied historical philosophy down in the city of elabon it was a particularly dangerous question to ask in this case where the quarrels of the gods which mortals could at best only partly understand clouded or with stribogs discomfiture unclouded the picture but gerin knew marlanz didnt want the truth or not all of it what he wanted was a story the truth set into an interesting framework that the fox could give him come into the great hall and drink a jack or two of ale with me he said easily ill tell you what happened in the hall sat geroge and tharma marlanz reached for his sword then checked himself these are the two of whom ive heard not so yes gerin said marlanz rawmeat when his were streak came out hadnt looked much different from geroge the fox decided mentioning that would be imperfectly tactful and so kept quiet he introduced the monsters and marlanz to one another pleased to make your acquaintance geroge said politely speaking as he usually did for the two of them uh pleased to make your acquaintance as well marlanz answered perhaps taken aback by the spectacle of a wellmannered monster but doing his best not to show it his best was good enough to satisfy geroge and tharma who were less than exacting critics they both smiled at him which left him taken aback again warily he said i hope you dont mind my asking but is that tooth made of gold real gold geroge agreed lord gerin made it for me to make up for the one the gods under ikos tore out of my head its not as good as a real tooth but its better than a hole in my head yes i can see how it would be marlanz said turning to gerin he asked in a low voice this is what you spoke of earlier by the gods under ikos he means the gods of his own kind this is what i spoke of earlier aye the fox said as for the other he does mean the monsters gods but he never calls them the gods of his kind or anything like that he may well be right not to call them that too for he and tharma are of the monsters blood but they dont act like them i would not presume to quarrel with my host marlanz replied by which he meant he thought gerin was spouting nonsense then gerin remembered the hunt on which hed joined the monsters earlier in the year and geroges excitementin every sense of the wordafter hed killed maybe i am spouting nonsense the fox thought i expect ill find out instead of pursuing that he changed the subject i brought you in here for ale but weve been standing around talking instead dont let it worry you marlanz told him ale i can get anywhere even the meanest peasant village here at fox keep i have many things to see and to talk about that i think i would find nowhere else in all the northlands despite that gerin did get him a jack of ale only after hed handed it to marlanz did he pause to wonder about the propriety of pouring ale for someone else now that he was a king since marlanz accepted it without comment he decided not to make an issue of it himself is it all that different at aragis keep he asked half slyly half from genuine curiosity it is marlanz answered the grand duke is you will forgive me of steadier and more orderly temper than yourself yes he had learned the arts of diplomacy in the years since gerin had last seen him the fox who knew aragis had no trouble extracting the reality from the bland phrasing anyone who made aragis unhappy once was quickly disposed of so he never got the chance to do it twice gerin knew that could happen to him the best way to keep it from happening was to beor at least to seemtoo strong for the grand duke to attack with any hope of success but not so strong as to put aragis in fear of him the balance between those two was delicate picking his words with care the fox asked how will aragis respond to my taking the kingship once youve made it plain i intend him no harm that depends marlanz said if he believes me when i tell himif he believes you for what youve told meall should be well if he decides not to believe me or rather you he let gerin draw his own pictures none of the pictures his fertile imagination conjured up filled him with delight aragis the archer was a long way from the best of rulers obedience through fear worked but not well but as a soldier aragis was not only as direct and aggressive as a trokm but also more cunning than any woodsrunner even adiatunnus going to war against him even with superior force carried distinct risks the fox said i hope youll be convincing marlanz for your sake and the grand dukes and mine but that was one more thing he would not say to aragis envoy he wondered if marlanz would cast about for some incentive to be convincing the bluff young warrior hed known a decade before would never have thought of such a thing but this marlanz was subtler smoother aragis had felt no need to send an older more polished man with him as hed done the last time hed used him as ambassador marlanz took a long pull at his ale gerin eyed him narrowly that sort of thoughtful pause was exactly what a man looking for a bribe would give in an effort to demonstrate that the notion had only just now occurred to him the fox wondered how much in the way of gold and silver he had left after a summer spent campaigning with his warriors and feeding them when they werent in the field carlun vepins son would knowor if he didnt gerin would either have to train up a new steward or go back to doing the job himself but all marlanz said was i think i will be fox will you give me your oath by father dyaus that what youve told me is true he held up a hasty hand not that i doubt you mind i mean no offense but if i can tell the grand duke youve sworn it i understand gerin replied and gave him the oath even as he said the words his eyes traveled to the altar to dyaus that stood close by the hearth he wondered once more if the allfather paid any attention to oaths offered in his name from what baivers had said he had his doubts but you didnt want to be wrong about something like that best to go on as if dyaus were as immanent in the material world as voldar had been before baivers and the monsters gods distracted her he wondered what would happen if one day voldar won her fight up in the divine gradihome hed told duren he could deal with her and still thought he was right but again he didnt want to have to find out do you know he said to marlanz sometimes the most you can hope for is to stay ignorant im ignorant of what you mean marlanz answered smiling good gerin said and slapped him on the back the fox began reckoning achievements in negatives voldar did not come down to the material world against him and aragis the archer did not go to war the monsters did not burst out of the caves under bitons temple at ikos one more worry hed had and authari hilmic and wacho did not join together to overthrow or slay his son as the days flowed past one after another he began to believe those negatives might hold together for a time that let him savor the positives a good harvest and peace among his vassals even including adiatunnus the best surprise of all came from carlun once the harvest had been gathered and payments in kind brought into fox keep the steward came up to gerin with parchments in his hand and a surprised look on his face he thrust the parchments at the fox saying lord king if ive reckoned rightly we have enough here to get through the winter i never would have believed it not with all those gobbling warriors trying to eat the keep empty he still thought like a serf if it werent for those gobbling warriors gerin reminded him youd be explaining how this keep is set for supplies to some gradi chieftainif you were lucky more likely youd be dead i suppose so carlun admitted but it seemswasteful he made the ordinary word into a curse why fix a roof in summer when the weathers fine and looks like staying fine for a long time gerin asked the same reason you have men trained in war sooner or later you know troubles going to come being ready ahead of time is a better idea than trying to fix things at the same time as theyre falling apart carlun chewed on that for a while then reluctantly nodded gerin meanwhile checked the stewards figures with meticulous care as far as he could tell everything gibed that meant carlun was either a very clever cheater or too afraid of him to take any chances he suspected the latter that suited him fine winter was the quiet time of the year serfs and lords alike living on what theyd stored up in summer and fall when they hadnt stored enough what they got was famine which all too often brought peasant uprisings in its wake to try to head them off gerin did send what grain he could west of the venien to the lands where unnatural summer weather courtesy of the gradi gods had ruined the crops he scored another negative success the serfs there did not revolt in a horrid sort of way i understand why things are quiet there he said to selatre one day they dont have much food but there arent many of them left either not after living under the gradi for a while and then after the war what little theyve got along with what little we could give them is somewhere close enough to get them by his wife nodded life for farmers is never easy having grown up a peasants daughter she knew whereof she spoke after a moment she added youve done everything you could and more than most lords would have dreamt of trying it sounds like an epitaph gerin said laughing a moment later as with duren his hand and selatres twisted in a sign to avert the evil omen that done he let out a long sigh we got through it selatre nodded again so we did and after what we got through it has to get better because how could it get worse thats why we go on living he answered to find out how it could get worse selatre poked him in the ribs and he had to admit though he didnt have to admit out loud he deserved it as winters went this one was mild again to gerins relief hed feared the gradi gods if they got free at that season of the year would do their best to freeze the northlands solid nothing of the sort happened though and in due course winter gave way to spring leaves came out on the formerly bare branches of oaks and maples apples and plums fresh grass sprouted on the meadows pushing up through the yellowbrown dead growth of the year before the peasants yoked their oxen to the plow and planted wheat and rye oats and barley gerin blessed baivers and hoped the god heard him he had one more worry in the middle of spring elleb math and tiwaz came to fullness on successive nights no reports of werebeasts ravaging flocks or peasants reached him though he hoped marlanz rawmeat hadnt given way to his lycanthropic tendencies during the run of full moons and then when for once he saw no trouble on the horizon at all the midwife came rushing up from the peasant village near fox keep to let him know fulda had been delivered of a baby boy he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand angry at himself for letting the imminence of the event slip his mind whats mavrixs bastard like he asked lord king youd better come see for yourself said the midwife a sturdy middleaged woman named radwalda and so the fox followed her down to the village she pointed the way to fuldas hut but showed no eagerness to go into it herself shrugging gerin stepped through the low entrance ducking his head as he went his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the gloom when they did he saw fulda sitting up on the bed she didnt look nearly so worn as other women hed seen just after childbirth one more advantage of divine parentage he supposed smiling she held up the newborn baby isnt he beautiful lord king im going to call him ferdulf hello ferdulf gerin said ferdulfs eyes which had been closed came open hello yourself the infant demigod said in a distinctly unbabylike baritone gerin looked at fulda she nodded oh dear the fox said fox and empire i up in the watchtower the lookout winded his horn a long unmelodious blast two chariots approach from the south lord king he bellowed from the courtyard far below gerin the fox king of the north cupped a hand to his mouth and replied thanks andiver well see who they are when they get here arent you going to go up on the palisade and have a look the sentry demanded indignantly in a word no gerin answered if two chariots worth of warriors can conquer fox keep either theyre gods in which case looking at them wont do me any good or else were all such cowards that the men who are on the palisade now would be running away and thats not happening either so ill wait for them down here thanks very much andiver said something the height of his perch kept gerin from understanding the fox decided it was probably just as well his son dagref smiled at him that was very logical he said dagref at fourteen was as remorselessly logical as the most terrifying sithonian philosopher whod ever made a living lecturing in the elabonian empire up until twenty years before gerins kingdom as well as the rest of the land north from the high kirs to the river niffet had been a frontier province of the empire elabon though had abandoned the land north of the mountains in the face of the devastating werenight caused by all four moons coming full at the same time and almost incidentally the barbarous trokmoi swarming south over the niffet it was indeed gerin said so what dagref stared at him man and youth shared a long face long nose and swarthy complexion dagref though had only fine down on his cheeks and chin and his hair was a brown almost black gerins neat beard and his hair were gray and getting grayer by the year he was past fifty now and often knew it by the creaking in his bones logic is the greatest tool the greatest weapon in the world dagref declared that depends on what youre doing gerin replied if youre in the middle of a brawl you cant slay a gradi or a trokm or one of aragis the archers jolly henchmen with a wellaimed syllogism thats why we carry these things every now and then he hefted his sword the sun glinted red as blood from the polished edge of the bronze blade dagref held a sword too he enjoyed fencing with it much less than fencing with his wits he was very dangerous with the latter only somewhat so with the former come on gerin made as if to attack him if some big ugly lug carves chunks off you it doesnt matter that hes never heard of the law of the excluded middle you wont be around to instruct him afterwards dagref parried the slash his answering cut made gerin give back a pace they did not work against each other as often as gerin would have done had he not been lefthanded learning how to fight him went only so far in teaching dagref how to fight others his son was lefthanded too which gave gerin the rare chance to see what others faced when they met him keep the blade up the fox cautioned you dont keep the blade up i can do something like this he snapped a cut at dagrefs head so quick and sharp that his son had to stagger back or even this the fox feinted another head cut if he hadnt stopped his thrust he would have put it into dagrefs chest yes i see dagref nodded and he did see too he had the makings of a good swordsman he had long arms and quick feet and didnt do the same thing wrong over and over again but he didnt automatically do the right thing either and when he did do it he didnt do it fast enough only years of patient practice would give him the speed he needed intellectually he realized that he was very good at realizing things intellectually lets try it again father those were the words gerin wanted to hear before he could go through the passage again though one of his men up on the palisade called a challenge to the approaching chariots who comes to castle fox the answer made gerin forget about swordplay and hurry up onto the palisade after all i am marlanz rawmeat emissary of king aragis the archer come to have speech with king gerin hello marlanz gerin called once he reached the walkway and could peer over the tops of the palisade timbers come in and be welcome ill listen to whatever aragis has to say though i dont promise ill do anything about it at his command the gate crew let down the drawbridge over the ditch around the palisade marlanzs chariot rattled into fox keep king aragis representative was a big burly man in his late thirties from previous encounters with him gerin knew he was smarter than he looked hello lord king marlanz said as the fox came down to greet him when gerin clasped hands with him marlanzs big paw a word that came naturally to gerins mind as marlanz had a were streak in him almost engulfed his own what brings you north this time the fox asked though he had the bad feeling he already knew and sure enough marlanz said lord king aragis bids me tell you that he is not going to stand idly by if balser debos son swears homage and fealty to you he warns you not to pursue that further the fox looked down his nose at aragis ambassador no mean feat since marlanz was three or four digits width taller than he aragis has no business telling either balser or me what sort of relationship we can have balser was never aragis vassal nor was his father before him balser styles himself baron nothing more but hes as free a man and as independent a lord as i amor as aragis is yes and aragis intends that he remain free and not come under your influence marlanz said if of his own free will he wants to declare himself my vassal aragis has not the right to forbid it marlanz rawmeat folded thick arms across his broad chest lord king king aragis is strong enough to enforce his will on balserand on you in the end it came down to strength gerin thought adiatunnus the trokm a rival now a vassal had first declared the fox king of the north after hed beaten the gradi pirates back to a single keep on the edge of the orynian ocean aragis had started calling himself king a little later his claim springing from his being the only noble left in the northlands with strength enough to stand against gerin if aragis tries that he will get the war hes been saying he doesnt want ever since the days right after the werenight gerin answered tell him that marlanz make sure he understands it and tell him that if he does try it i believe hell end up being the sorriest man ever born marlanz scowled hed known gerin long enough to know the fox did not casually make such boasts in marlanzs younger days hed been more a bruiser than a diplomat hed gained skill with years these days aragis probably trusted him further than anyone elsenot that aragis trusted anyone very far trying to strike a conciliatory tone marlanz said you have to see how things are lord king balsers holding points like a knife straight at the heart of the lands that acknowledge king aragis suzerainty if it comes under your control youre halfway to invading his domain right there gerin scowled back in aragis sandals his acquisition would look that way i dont want to use the holding as a knife i want to use it as a shield against aragis the fox said its hardly less dangerous to me in his hands than it is to him in mine you might remind him that he was the one who paraded chariots past balsers border to frighten him into yielding i cant help it if balser started talking to me instead it might be best if we could keep balser neutral between you and aragis inclining neither to the one nor the other marlanz said that would have been fine gerin said it was fine while it lasted i wasnt the one who changed it now balser doesnt think he can trust aragis to keep his hands where they belong am i supposed to tell him no im sorry i wont protect you from your neighbor even if you want me to marlanz looked unhappy i knew that was foolish he muttered gerin didnt think he was supposed to hear aragis envoy gathered himself lord king im sorry but i dont have a lot of room to wiggle here king aragis has told me to tell you that if balser becomes your vassal it will mean war between the two of you then it will be war gerin slapped marlanz on the back and waved him toward castle fox we dont have to start killing each other quite yet i dont think why dont you come into the great hall and drink some ale with me eat some bread and well see what else we can scare up for you ill do that right gladly marlanz said you brewed a fine ale the last time i was here lord king and youre not the sort to let something like that slip and you have a name all through the northlands for feeding your guestfriends well i probably earned it when i managed to get you out of my keep before you ate the larder emptyjust before gerin said marlanz laughed although like most of gerins jokes that one had a hard core of truth come on the fox urged and they walked into the great hall side by side van of the strong arm rihwin the fox and carlun vepins son sat at a table near the hearth and near the altar to dyaus allfather in front of it a tarredleather jack of ale sat in front of each of them van was also gnawing a roast rib of mutton as gerin and marlanz walked in the big outlander tossed it into the rushes on the floor to watch a couple of dogs squabble over it by all the gods its marlanz rawmeat van rumbled recognizing aragis envoy he rose from the bench and strode up to clasp marlanzs hand as they did whenever they met the two big men studied each other gerin studied them both the goldenhaired outlander was taller and broader through the shoulders but he was also older being within a year or two either way of the foxs age at his peak hed been stronger than marlanzhed been stronger than anyone gerin had ever known but marlanz a decade younger was closer to his own peak which had also been formidable if the two of them fought gerin didnt know what would happen that was strange in the more than twenty years since van had come to fox keep hed always been sure his friend could best anyone merely human now now were getting old gerin thought strength goes he smiled to himself guile though guile endures aloud he said marlanz says aragis will go to war with us if balser gives me homage and fealty hes welcome to try it van said i dont think hell be so happy afterwards though a few years earlier he would have whooped with glee at the prospect of a fight he still didnt shrink from itgerin couldnt imagine him shrinking from a fightbut he no longer rushed toward it like a man rushing toward his beloved my king is not happy about it now marlanz answered but he will not shrink from it not if that means seeing his own rights overthrown that made rihwin the fox speak up in good sooth king aragis has no right pertaining to the holding of balser debos son it never having been a fief of his i said the same thing gerin told him but not half so prettily you have not the advantages of a noble upbringing south of the high kirs rihwin replied as if forgiving his fellow fox for flaws beyond his control after two decades in the northlands rihwin still clung to the elaborate phrasing hed learned at the heart of the elabonian empire and to the gold hoop he wore in his left ear an affectation to which the rest of gerins vassals had never quite accommodated themselves marlanz looked from rihwin to gerin and back again as i have noted before he has the right to keep a stronger neighbor from taking advantage of a weaker one as i noted before gerin said pointedly if aragis werent a strong neighbor liable to take advantage of a weaker one balser wouldnt be interested in having me as his lord if you told him as much out there van said did you bring him in here to tell it to him over again as a matter of fact i brought him in here for some ale and some bread and whatever we can pry out of the kitchen in the way of meat gerin said he slapped aragis vassal on the shoulder again sit you down marlanz if aragis and i have to fight well fight meanwhile youre my guestfriend servants brought marlanz a drinking jack a round of flatbread and some ribs like the one van had been gnawing carlun vepins son gerins steward looked as if he was calculating the cost of everything and so no doubt he was the fox wouldnt have wanted him for the job if he didnt keep track of every jar of ale sack of beans and barrel of salt pork whatever carlun thought he kept it to himself while warriors other than gerin were around he was no fighting man hed been the headman of the serf village close by fox keep till gerin caught him cheating on the records there trying to hold back produce from his overlords notice that had earned him both a promotion and a warning about what would happen if the fox ever caught him cheating again either he hadnt cheated since or hed done it too well for gerin to have noticed the fox didnt think carlun was clever enough to get away with that he almost but not quite hoped he was wrong marlanz made eyes at one of the serving women gerin happened to know she was newly married and happy with her husband she kept on serving aragis envoy but did nothing to encourage him and twisted away before he had the chance to pull her down onto his lap he glanced over to gerin you always did give your serfs a lot of say in what they should do to keep your guests happy i havent changed the fox answered far as i can see forcing them to bed men they dont want only causes trouble if shes interested in you marlanz thats fine if shes not maybe you can find someone else who is marlanz didnt make an issue of it gerin remembered how hed been inclined to do just that the first time he came up to fox keep yes hed learned a thing or two over the intervening fifteen years and of course since he was fifteen years older himself he didnt burn so hot as he had then either i passed the night at your sons holding on my way up to your keep here lord king marlanz remarked changing the subject with a smoothness he hadnt had as a younger man he seems to be shaping into a fine baron in his own right for which i thank you gerin said aye i think durens a splendid lad of course being his father id think that even if it werent so well it is marlanz said and i didnt see any signs that his vassal barons are anything but what they ought to be either you had some trouble with that as i recall a bit the fox admitted duren held his holding as grandson to the previous baron ricolf the red not as gerins son ricolfs petty barons had been anything but enthusiastic about accepting him partly because they feared gerins influence and partly because with ricolf gone theyd had hopes of escaping vassalage altogether and setting up on their own as far as gerin could see the hope had obviously been foolish but that hadnt kept them from having it a lot of the hopes men had were obviously foolish to everyone but them aye durens a fine young fellow marlanz cocked his head to one side is he the heir to your kingdom or is that dagref whom i saw out in the courtyard with you yes gerin answered and let marlanz make whatever he would of it duren was his son by elise ricolfs daughter he hadnt seen her since duren was a toddler shed run away with a traveling horse doctor dagref his sister clotild and his brother blestar were his by selatre the former sibyl at the farseeing god bitons shrine down at ikos the fox sighed life was never so simple as you wished it would be yes to which marlanz demanded he was gerin knew persistent the fox just smiled at him after a bit aragis vassal figured out he wouldnt get a straight answer he smiled back shrugged and emptied his jack of ale a serving womannot the one hed tried to pawrefilled it for him gerin took a pull at his own ale he wondered where dagref had gone his eldest child by selatre had a curiosity as fierce and ruthless as a longtooth he should have been besieging marlanz with every sort of question the fox wondered what hed found more interesting than the arrival of a nearstranger had it been duren at the same age gerin would have guessed he was off with a girl but dagrefs curiosity was as yet more of the intellect than of the body one day soon the fox suspected a serving girl would kick his feet out from under him what happened after that would be interesting no sooner had gerin thought of his son than dagref as if summoned came running into the great hall he spared marlanz rawmeat no more than a hasty glance father come quick out back by the stables he exclaimed its ferdulf again oh by the gods gerin said which where ferdulf was concerned had alarmingly literal implications the fox sprang to his feet dagref the message delivered was already dashing away gerin pounded after him aware with every step that he wasnt as fast as he had been behind him he heard van and rihwin exclaiming too a moment later they followed the fox and marlanz came right on their heels he hadnt a clue about what was going on but he wanted to find out dagref sprinted around castle fox then pointed with a dramatic forefinger there he said there were clotild and blestar there too were maeva and kor vans children maeva though a year younger than dagref was already blossoming into ripe womanhoodbut womanhood of heroic proportions vans blood told in her temperament as well as her size and strength she wanted to be a warrior and gerin rather to his own alarm thought she would make a good one kor was even more alarming he also had his fathers build but took his incendiary temper straight from fand the trokm woman with whom van lived in something less than wedded bliss and there were geroge and tharma the two monsters towered over all their companions even maeva they were large and hairy and remarkably ugly with clawed hands and feet low foreheads little eyes under beetling brow ridges and long jaws full of big teeth though geroges right upper canine was of gold rather than being a natural fang they both waved to gerin who had raised them from he supposed cubs was the best word he didnt see ferdulf and then just before dagref said there again he did the preternaturally beautiful fouryearold had doffed his tunic and was walking around in the air about twenty feet off the ground magic marlanz asked from behind gerin with what was under the circumstances commendable calm the fox shook his head not exactly he raised his voice to ferdulf come down from there this instant before you he stopped before you hurt yourself didnt work as it had with his own children ferdulf wasnt going to hurt himself gerin wasnt sure ferdulf could hurt himself he tried a different tack before you drive everybody down here crazy what do i care ferdulf stood on his head supported by exactly nothing his voice was not a fouryearolds but the same rude rich baritone hed had since he was a newborn babe marlanz said lord king will you please tell me whats going on here he took geroge and tharma in stride hed met them before ferdulf however was new to him like most men in the northlands he viewed the new with suspicion gerin didnt in most cases with ferdulf he made an exception trying to sound casual he answered thats mavrixs son by fulda a peasant woman here now do you understand for a moment marlanz didnt then he did and his eyes got wide mavrix he tried his best to imitate gerins flat unemphatic tones but didnt have much luck the sithonian god of wine calm crumbled into astonishment youve got a gods get here lord king yes the little bastard gerin said which in dealingor trying to dealwith ferdulf had proved true in any number of ways dagref plucked at his fathers sleeve i brought you out here so you could do something about him he said pointedly the last time he started going around up in the air this way he piddled on all of us and i wanted to see if we could keep that from happening again the glare he gave the fox said his fathers reliability had just come down a peg for him what exactly do you want me to do gerin asked in some exasperation i cant lean a ladder against the air the way i would against the palisade he cast a cautious eye up toward ferdulfs little pecker mavrixs get had divine powers and a fouryearolds sense of humor the fox was hard pressed to imagine a more terrifying combination dagref took a deep breath if you dont come down from there this instant he told ferdulf none of the rest of us is going to play with you for a long time his voice broke in the middle of the threat so he didnt sound so fierce as he might have but he did sound as if he meant what he said he always sounded as if he meant what he said he gestured to his comrades clotild and blestar nodded so did maeva and kor and a beat late so did geroge and tharma oh all right ferdulf said sulkily sounding very much like his own father who raised petulance to an art he came floating down and put his tunic back on that was bravely done maeva said she eyed dagref with a thoughtful interest to which he as yet remained in large measure blind that was bravely done gerin agreed telling ferdulf what to do took nerve well his son had never lacked for that sense possibly but not nerve the fox went on but why did you call me when you could handle it by yourself i didnt know if that would work dagref answered and i thought you would have a better idea when you didnt he raised one eyebrow as gerin might have done you should have had a better idea he said without words in a much more cautious voice than hed used till now marlanz rawmeat asked what all can the little godlet do besides fly what all gerin clapped a hand to his head as if it ached when he thought about ferdulf it soon did ache who knows ill tell you this much i went to see him as soon as i got word hed been born and he said hello to me in that same voice you heard him use now life hasnt been dull since believe me is his mother a goddess too or a demon or marlanz fell silent seeming to guess how little he could guess gerins smile was ironic i told you his mothers name is fulda she still lives down in the village close to the keep here she has a pretty face and a ripe body which is why i used her when i was summoning mavrix against the gradiwhich in case youre wondering was a good idea that didnt work ferdulf listens to her when he feels like it and ignores her the rest of the time which is about what he does for everybody else you told me youd summoned mavrix the last time i came up here marlanz said remembering you didnt tell me hed got a woman with child ferdulf hadnt been born then the fox answered i didnt know then what id get for that matter i still dont know what i have why dont we go back to the great hall and have another jack of ale and we can talk some more about it good enough lord king marlanz hurried back to the hall as if he feared ferdulf and was trying to conceal it from everyone especially from himself selatre had been working in the kingdoms libraryan overstatement of what one upstairs room of castle fox held but an overstatement gerin had been making ever since hed succeeded his father as local baron more than twenty years before she came down for supper when she did marlanz bowed before her lady seeing as you were sibyl at ikos and seeing as the farseeing god spoke through you there he said getting around to his question a clause at a time like a lawyer south of the high kirs does that mean this ferdulf youve got here pays any special heed to what you say he spoke of mavrixs son as he might have of a dangerous wild beast which struck gerin as fitting enough selatre gave the question grave consideration almost as if she expected biton to speak through her here and now after scratching the side of her pointed chin for close to a minute she delivered a short answer not very often marlanz stared then started to laugh well thats straight and no mistake he said his last couple of words blurring into an enormous yawn he turned back to gerin if youll be kind enough to have somebody show me up to my bedchamber ill thank you for it ive spent a good many days on the road coming up from aragis keep i can do that gerin said and waved for a servant who led aragis envoy away the warriors who had accompanied marlanz would sleep in the great hall the fox had made sure they had plenty of blankets to stay comfortable no one at fox keep had to fear night ghosts for he made a point of giving them the blood they needed to keep from molesting mortals once marlanz was gone selatre put on that thoughtful expression again do you suppose we could find a way to use ferdulf she said in a low voice against aragis you mean gerin asked as quietly his wife nodded he said i never thought about it before i never imagined ferdulf doing anything but whatever he wants he looked around none of the men whod come to fox keep with marlanz seemed to be listening and a couple of them were already asleep but gerin had not grown as old as he hadolder than i ever thought id beby taking unnecessary chances the necessary ones were quite bad enough lets talk about it upstairs all right selatre rose from the bench in one smooth motion she and gerin walked up the wooden stairway hand in hand in the chamber nearest the top of the stairs van and fand were arguing the outlander and the trokm woman looked on quarrels as most folk looked on meat and drink gerin met selatres eye wryly he shook his head after elise had left him before hed met selatre hed shared fands affectionand her temperwith van for a while no wonder he did his best to keep his eventempered wife that way he had standards of comparison he and selatre shared the next bedchamber with their children since he didnt feel like explaining everything to dagref however much his son thought himself entitled to explanations and since clotild might well also still be awake he led selatre past that door too she nodded understanding his reasons without his having to spell them out one more reason to love her he thought rihwin had the chamber on the other side of the foxs since rihwin could no more keep secrets than fand could keep calm gerin walked by his room the next bedchamber held marlanz across from it was the library to which gerin and selatre were both drawn like feathers gliding toward rubbed amber few in the northlands knew their letters selatre hadnt not till gerin taught them to her after bringing her to fox keep hed thought to give her a useful place here not knowing he would fall in love with her in short orderand she with him too which struck him as stranger and more marvelous shed also fallen in love with books that unlike falling in love with him he understood completely hed done it himself he opened the door then gestured for her to go in ahead of him she didand started to laugh when he followed her into the chamber he laughed too there sat dagref in front of a lamp his nose in a scroll gerin glanced over at selatre anyone would think he was our child he said dagref looked up at his parents of course im your child he said testily and im sure you came in here so you could talk about something you think is none of my business youre right selatre told him it isnt fair he said how am i supposed to learn what i need to know if you wont let me find out about it he started to stalk off then stopped under gerins glare when he went back rolled up the scroll and replaced it in its proper pigeonhole his father stopped glaring that was good selatre said with a smile after her son did depart he figured out why you were unhappy something anyway gerin agreed tell him the same thing four hundred times in a row and he will start to listenif it suits him if it doesnt his scowl said what happened then after a moment he went on and yet if its something he wants to learn hell soak it up the way dry ground soaks up the first rain of the year selatre gazed at him with amused fondness anyone would think he had you for a father she murmured the fox tried to glare again but ended up laughing instead you know me too welland you have altogether too little respect for your king that made selatre laugh too but gerin quickly sobered can we use ferdulf as a weapon against aragis if we do go to war i would be happier trying it if he were the son of any other god than mavrix selatre said why do you say that because mavrix is about the least predictable god in anyones pantheon or because hes shown he isnt fond of me in particular yes selatre said as gerin had with marlanz he made a face at her despite her joke though both halves of the question could legitimately be answered yes mavrix was the sithonian god of wine beauty fertility creativity and of the chaos accompanying all those he did not know from one moment to another what he would do next nor did he care and his encounters with the fox over the years had mostly ended up alarming both the god who was a coward at heart and the man who was anything but gerin said for once id like to use a weapon against my foes that isnt stronger than i am so i wont have to spend so much time worrying whether it will turn in my hand and end up being worse than simply losing whatever fight i happen to be making the question then it seems to me is if we go to war with aragis whether we can beat him without resorting to extraordinary means selatre said gerin paused a moment to admire the precise phrasing of that he tried to answer with similar precision we canif everything goes right if adiatunnus chooses to remember hes my vassal and doesnt take the fight as an excuse to throw off his allegiance and set up on his own for instance hed better not selatre said with no small anger not when hes the one who first proclaimed you king hes been a good enough vassal since too gerin admitted but hes a trokm which means hes almost as fickle as mavrix if he sees the two greatest elabonian lords in the northlands going at each other the temptation may be too much for him to stand and there are the gradi too the seafaring invaders from the chilly lands north of the trokm forests had tried to establish themselves and their grim gods in the northlands a few years before fear of them was what had made adiatunnus remember he was gerins vassal fighting together instead of against each other elabonians and trokmoi had pinned the northerners against the orynian ocean more than that they could not do not when gradi galleys controlled the sea because voldar the chief gradi goddess and the rest of the northerners gods contemplated making the northlands into a frigid copy of the home from which theyd come a land too cold for even barley to grow there gerin had managed to persuade baivers the elabonian god of barley beer and brewing to join with the ferocious powers of geroge and tharmas kind and battle those gradi gods he didnt know whether that battle on the spiritual plane had been won or lost his best guess was that it still went on five years after its beginning time for the gods was not as it was for men what he did know was that without help from their gods the gradi hadnt been able to stand against him that was the only thing that mattered no not quite the only thing if voldar and the other gradi powers ever manage to pull loose from the battle i found for them they wont be very happy with me they havent done it yet and its been a long time now selatre spoke with her usual brisk practicality and if they do youll come up with something that wasnt practicality it was as far as gerin could see madness everyone else expects me to have all the answers and pull them out of my beltpouch whenever i need them he growled i thought you knew better she looked steadily back at him you forget ive been living by your side these past fifteen or sixteen years i know what you can do everyone else just guesses when that drew nothing more than a sardonic snort from the fox selatre went on you would come up with something i know you too well to doubt it maybe with ferdulf here you could use him to call on mavrix and that would be wonderful wouldnt it gerin said mavrix likes me about as well as voldar does trying to use one god who cant stand me to head off another one who cant stand me either i think id be better off jumping out of the watchtower and hoping i broke my neck when i hit besides voldars stronger than mavrix i found that out well youd do something else then selatre still sounded confident i thought of mavrix because we were talking about ferdulf so we were gerin said the best thing i can think of to do with him is to hope that his being here frightens aragis and to hope aragis never finds out how much his being here frightens me youre the king of the north amusement glinted in his wifes eyes nothing is supposed to frighten you she was poking him in the ribs to make him jump he knew as much but answered seriously no thats aragis as far as ive ever seen nothing does frighten himand that frightens me hes very simple like a hunting hawk he goes straight for what he wants knocks it down and kills it the only reason hes never gone after me is that ive always looked too big to knock down maybe i dont not any more i dont think marlanz is bluffing no aragis doesnt want you becoming balsers overlord selatre agreed she cocked her head to one side and studied him wouldnt you say that means hes afraid of you gerin started to say something then stopped what he did say in tones of appreciation was i think ive just been outargued selatre was still studying him but now in rather a different manner and what do you propose to do about that she inquired he got up walked over to the door and barred it hed had a serf skilled in carpentry install the bar and the brackets that held it a couple of years before at about the same time hed taken to storing a bolt of thick woolen cloth in one corner of the library that had perplexed dagref whod noted pointedly and accurately that nothing else but books ever got stored in that room its not doing any particular harm there so let it alone gerin had told him that was also true dagref had grumbled about it for a while but then as is the way of such things hed got used to it he probably didnt even notice it was there any more the other thing he didnt notice however alert he was to connections between events around him was that that bar and the roll of cloth had appeared in the library at about the same time he and clotild grew to the point where they didnt sleep much more than gerin and selatre did the foxs bedchamber had only one large bed in it private moments there got harder and harder to find what are you doing selatre asked now though her tone of voice suggested she knew perfectly well what he was doingand that she might have done it herself if he hadnt who me gerin unrolled the cloth on the floor when hed doubled it over onto itself it was a little longer than a woman or even a man might be lying at full length selatre came over and stood beside him as if altogether of its own accord his arm slid around her waist she moved closer her voice though was thoughtful as she said its really not quite so soft as the bed is it and you dont always remember to keep your weight on your elbows instead of on me she let out a small sigh that might have proclaimed she was resigned to his iniquities some pleasant little while later gerin murmured there you cant say im squashing you now selatre astride him nodded agreement altogether too solemn for the moment both of them started to laughquietly gerin slid his hands along her smooth warm length is this better then better her shrug was delightful even then though the answer she gave was carefully considered i dont know its not the same and youre not squashing me thats enough she began to move and the answers she and gerin found were not expressed in words once hed put on his linen tunic and wool trousers gerin rolled up the bolt of cloth and slung it back in its corner in the light of the single lamp still burning in the library it looked altogether mundane just one more thing for which there hadnt been room anywhere else in the crowded castle suddenly selatre started to giggle the fox raised an interrogative eyebrow she said i wonder what ferdulf would have thought if hed been walking in the air outside the window just then there was an aspect of ferdulfs unusual abilities gerin hadnt contemplated till then maybe he would have learned something he said which made selatre laugh again he went on considering which god hes the son of maybe he wouldnt have too he and selatre both laughed at that were they a little nervous if they were they both kept quiet about it he unbarred the door selatre blew out the lamp they went off to bed marlanz rawmeat looked as if hed bitten into something sour its still no is it he said and swigged at the ale which with bread and honey made up his breakfast its still no gerin said firmly if balser debos son acknowledges that he is my vassaland i expect he willill protect him from all his neighbors including aragis the archer im sorry to hear that lord king marlanz said ill take your words down to king aragis after that i expect ill see you in the field he put down the loaf on which hed been gnawing and made cutandthrust motions guestfriends dont slay each other of course but that doesnt hold for your men i know gerin said tell aragis also that i have no quarrel with him if he has no quarrel with me tell him i dont aim to use balsers land against him tell him he and i have managed to keep from going to war with each other up till now even though weve been the two strongest men in the northlands for most of the past twenty years im in no great hurry to change that ill tell him everything you say lord king marlanz upended his jack then looked into it as if amazed it held no more ale ill tell him but his minds made up if balser claims you for his overlord aragis will go to war when he says something like that its as sure as the sun coming up tomorrow from everything gerin had gleaned by intently watching his rival over the years marlanz was telling the truth when aragis said he would do something he would do it no matter how appalling it might be he was not a man who deviated from his declared purposes that made him more dangerous than someone who might be intimidated but also made him more vulnerable because he was more predictable but the lands he controlled and those acknowledging the foxs overlordship already marched over a long stretch of the northlands if he went to war with gerin he could pick the spot for the first assault tell aragis one thing more from me the fox said and marlanz rawmeat nodded attentively tell him that if he starts this war i will finish it and he wont care for that by marlanzs expression he didnt care for it either i will take your words to him just as you say them lord king he promised his face got longer yet i dont think it will help but ill do it all right ill tell you one thing too marlanz gerin said i dont hold this against you personally youre doing as a good vassal should following the orders of your suzerain i think youll be sorry for doing it even so thats in the hands of the gods marlanz said and then looked as if he wished he could have the words back they must have made him think of ferdulf and from ferdulf go on to mavrix he wouldnt know mavrix was none too well disposed toward gerin aragis did know thator had known it some years before but aragis had also seen gerin cozen mavrix into doing what the fox wanted him to do he might well reckon that meant man and god had patched things up with luck the prospecteven if it wasnt a true prospectof facing an irate god would give even the archer pause the prospect of facing an irate god had given gerin pause several times that didnt mean he hadnt done it it didnt mean he hadnt got away with it either he had no reason to assume aragis couldnt get away with it too he wished he did have such a reason try to make aragis see that i dont want this war will you the fox persisted if i did want it id hold you here and the first thing aragis would know was that my men were coming over the border at him as i say lord king ill pass on everything you say to me marlanz replied i dont think it will do much good as i told you before king aragis will answer that it only means you dont want war now right this minute not that you dont want war at all he sat a little straighter a little more defiantly can you tell me my king would be wrong yes gerin said if id wanted war i could have had it whenever i chose and ive never chosen war with aragis not down through these past twenty years he sighed he was blessedor perhaps cursedwith the ability to see the other fellows point of view and hell say the only reason i didnt do it was because i wasnt ready all this time and now i finally am he felt tired go on home marlanz pretty soon aragis and i can try killing each other and then well find out whos better at that the warriors who had accompanied aragis envoy up to fox keep had their chariots ready for the return journey gerins resignation to the prospect of war ahead seemed to reach marlanz where his earlier denials had been brushed aside as marlanz stepped up into his car he spoke urgently ill urge him to hold the peaceby father dyaus i swear it whether he listens to me if he doesnt listen to you maybe hell listen to edged bronze gerin waved to the gate crew let down the drawbridge the men in the gatehouse turned the capstan bronze chain rattled out a link at a time down went the bridge the fox waved again this time to marlanz rawmeat marlanz looked to be on the point of saying something more instead he bowed stiffly and tapped his driver on the shoulder the fellow flicked the reins the horses got moving the chariots axle squeaked as it began to roll the other car the one with a crew of warriors followed horses hooves thundered and wheels boomed on the drawbridge marlanz was still peering back over his shoulder at the fox when his driver swung south and took the car out of the narrow line of sight the gate offered gerin could have mounted to the palisade and watched marlanz till he was out of sight but what point to that he went back into the great hall and called for ale instead carlun vepins son sat in there cutting a length of sausage into identical bitesized chunks before he ate them he looked up from that fussily precise task and said there will be war then lord king im afraid there will gerin answered i dont see how i can turn balser down evidently aragis doesnt see how he can let me accept balsers vassalage if thats not a recipe for war i dont know what is carlun stabbed one of those chunks of sausage with the knife hed used to cut it he brought it up to his mouth chewed swallowed only then did he deliver his verdict it will be expensive thanks so muchi hadnt realized that gerin snapped the steward choked on another bite of sausage hed always been vulnerable to sarcasm gerin slapped him on the back steady thereexpensive yes fatal no i suppose not lord king carlun said nothing else youve undertaken has been fatalthough the gods can drop me in the hottest of the five hells if i understand why not he cocked his head to one side maybe its magic gerin turned his most enigmatic stare on the steward maybe it is he answered which made carlun look nervous gerin had studied sorcery down in the city of elabon before the elabonian empire severed itself from its fractious northern province hed had to return to the northlands with his magical studies like all the rest incomplete the trokmoi had slain his father and brother leaving him baron a job hed wanted about as much as a longtooth wanted an aching fang despite insatiable curiosity he hadnt intended to practice much sorcery after coming back to the north the only thing more dangerous commonly to himself than a halftrained mage was the fox backed up and started that thought again because he couldnt think of anything more dangerous than a halftrained mage that didnt mean he hadnt practiced magic every now and again amazing what desperation will do he thought when faced with a trokm wizard bent on destroying him for a fancied slight or with the eruption of the monsters from under bitons temple down at ikos or with the invasion of the gradi and their ferocious gods the risks of sorcery suddenly seemed smaller he hadnt killed himself yet that was the most he could say for his sorcery after a moment he shook his head rejecting false modesty in hairraising fashion the magic had done what hed wanted it to do balamung the trokm mage was destroyed the monstersexcept geroge and tharmawere made to return to their gloomy caverns the gradi were pinned back to a single castle at the edge of the ocean and because gerin hadnt killed himself oncethough not for lack of effort he thoughtboth his friends and his foes had conceived the notion that he really was a formidable wizard in his own right so long as he didnt conceive the same foolish notion and try to act on it he figured hed be fine thinking he had a true sorcerous talent also made people think twice about crossing him as now carlun said then i will prepare for war sure everything will turn out right even if i dont see how that went too far gerin shook his head again prepare as if you think everything will go wrong in your mind make things look as black as you can figure out how wed come through that then when something works out better than you expectif anything works out better than you expect he added from the depths of a deeply pessimistic nature you can take it as a bonus i understand lord king carlun hesitated then said forgive me lord king but in a lot of ways you think more like a serf than how i thought a noble would think i always thought nobles had so much they never needed to worry about what to do when things go wrong only goes to show you were born a serf and not a noble gerin answered the only people without worries are the dead ones and the ones who havent been born yet nobles dont worry about their overlords taking too much of the harvest away and making them starve they worry about their neighbors taking their lands away and killing them comes out about the same in the end id say maybe so carlun said but nobles press on peasants all the time and on their neighbors only now and again nobles in my domain had better not press on peasants all the time or on their neighbors either gerin said but he understood what carlun meant that was how things commonly worked in the northlands and how they had worked for generations he wondered if he ought to despair when his own steward seemed to think the changes he was making were anomalies that wouldnt last he got no time to contemplate that gloomy notion which might have been just as well herris bigfoot the headman of the peasant village close by fox keep came running into the great hall crying lord king lord king come quick lord king ferdulfs at it again hullo herris said carlun who was the headmans brotherinlaw hullo herris grudged his kinsman by marriage the one word but then gave his attention back to the fox will you come lord king gerin had already risen to his feet im coming herris though by all the gods im not certain what i can do to rein in ferdulf that you couldnt manage for yourself but lord king thats your job herris said the fox sighed it was his job which didnt mean he relished it how was he supposed to impose his will on a fouryearold demigod rather more to the point how was he supposed to do it without regretting it afterwards in weary resignation he asked whats he gone and done this time uh lord king youd better come see for yourself the headman answered people had been saying that about ferdulf since the day he was born hed spoken to the midwife while she was cutting the cord that had linked him to his mother hed greeted gerin when the fox came down to the village to see what mavrix had begotten on fulda and hed only become more alarming since as his power had grown with his body out of fox keep and over the drawbridge strode herris and gerin the village was only a short walk south of the keep the peasants lived in thatchroofed huts of wattle and daub smoke issued from the holes in the center of several of those roofs women cooking no doubt other women were working in the vegetable gardens by the huts or feeding the chickens that ran around as if they thought the place belonged to them not to the fox most of the men were away from the village either tending to cattle and sheep or weeding in the fields of growing wheat and barley gerin didnt notice any signs of unusual chaos which wasnt always the case when ferdulf got into mischief he noticed as much with something approaching hope in his voice youll find out lord king herris bigfoot said he led the fox toward fuldas hut before they got there fulda came outside she might well have been the bestlooking young woman in the village the long tunic she wore lessened but could not hide the impact of her figure rihwin the fox had chosen her at gerins urging to help attract mavrix to fox keep to fight the gradi gods after failing in that fight mavrix himself had chosen to impregnate her lord king she said now im sure he didnt mean it when that phrase got stuck to the mischief of an ordinary small boy it meant said mischief was worse than it had any business being when it was applied to the mischief of a small demigod whats he gone and done now gerin asked not sure he wanted to find out no that wasnt true he did want to find out he wished he didnt have to find out youd better see for yourself herris and fulda said in the same breath they looked at each other and laughed the headmans eyes lingered on fulda any mans eyes had a way of lingering on fulda seeing that gerin thought it was liable to cause trouble one of these days it would however be trouble of an ordinary sort trouble hed seen many times before trouble he knew how to handle the kind of trouble ferdulf caused was something else again whats he gone and done the fox repeated he was playing in the mud by the pond and he fulda began she gave up her shrug was magnificent youd better see for yourself herris said again gerin loudly exhaled through his nose spinning on his heel he stalked off toward the pond close by the village herris and fulda hurried after him both expostulating none of the expostulations made much sense that didnt surprise him had things made sense to the villagers they wouldnt have needed him to straighten them out he strode past the last hut there was the pond not much of a pond perhaps to a connoisseur of such but enough ducks swam in it in the mud by its edge the village pigs wallowed their happy grunting filled the foxs ears much as the gabble from herris and fulda had done not long before but not all of that grunting came from the edge of the pond nor were all the quacks that punctuated it from ducks on the water after a second more careful look at the peaceful scene ahead gerin turned back to the village headman and the demigods mother i owe you an apology he said not a common admission for a lord to make to a couple of serfs what are we going to do lord king herris bigfoot demanded idontknow gerin stared out at the pond most of the ducks there were of the ordinary sort the males with shiny green heads the females drab and brown all over a couple of them though a couple of them gerins eyes confirmed were ducks only from the neck down from the neck up they were pigs because their heads were smaller than they had any natural business being the grunts those heads admitted sounded strange but they were undoubtedly piggy grunts and sure enough one of the piggy bodies by the pond sported an outsized green head with a flat bill and another a head similar but brown neither pork nor fowl the fox thought dazedly what are we going to do it seemed to be the sort of day where everyone repeated himself herris turn again i dont know gerin was echoing his own words too then he found something new to add hope they breed true maybe herris and fulda both stared at him hed succeeded in startling them anyhow well theyand ferdulfhad succeeded in startling him too suddenly the village headman started to laugh i wonder if theyll lay eggs or have live young he said fulda voiced a more immediately pragmatic consideration i wonder what theyd taste like gerin tried to imagine a flavor halfway between duck and pork his stomach rumbled he didnt know whether his imagination was accurate but it was vivid enough to make him hungry he said if you find out what they taste like now you wont find out later whether they lay eggs or not youre right lord king fulda didnt seem to have thought so far ahead but herris bigfoot said lord king what will you do to ferdulf on account of this even if he is a gods son hes got no business changing things around so what if he starts putting the wrong heads on people next a lot of people are wrongheaded enough without getting switched around gerin said but that was a quip not an answer knowing it was necessary the fox went on ill have a word with him and what if he decides to put the wrong head on me there was a thought the fox wished he hadnt had pretendingmost of all to himselfit had never crossed his mind he turned to fulda is he back at your house yes lord king she said she hesitated torn between a mothers love for her child and the certain knowledge the child she had borne to mavrix was not of the ordinary sort whatever you do lord king be careful that was good advice it was such good advice in fact that gerin wished his career had given him more chances to take it as things had worked out for him though had he been careful he probably would have been dead several times over he started back toward the hut where fulda lived she and herris trailed after him he discovered ferdulf had come out while he was staring at the pigducks in the pond and the duckpigs by it ferdulf was whacking at something in the grass with a stick for all the world like any other fouryearold but he was not any other fouryearold he looked up at gerin and spoke in his mellow baritone i wonder how youd look with a big green ducks head he frowned in concentration nothing happened for which the fox was duly grateful probably pretty silly he replied after considering he refused to let ferdulf put him in fearor rather he refused to let ferdulf see he put him in fear in the same mild thoughtful tones hed just used he went on i wonder how youd look with your backside all red and sore you wouldnt dare ferdulf said you know whose son i am gerin did know only too well ive spanked you before when you earned it he answered which was also true he didnt tell ferdulf hed gone back to fox keep and got drunk afterwards to celebrate surviving the experience ferdulf frowned i was littler then i didnt know all the things i could do just because you can do something doesnt mean you should do it gerin said if ferdulf thought he was coming into his full powers at four what would he be like at fourteen at thirtyfour the fox did his best not to think about that he also did his best not to think about how unlikely it was for mavrixs get to understand what restraint meant why not ferdulf asked with what sounded like genuine curiosity sure enough he didnt understand gerins point patiently gerin explained because some of the things you can do either frighten people or make them unhappy so what yes ferdulf was mavrixs son all right how do you like it when someone frightens you or makes you unhappy gerin asked youre about the only one who ever tries to do anything like that ferdulf answered he looked thoughtful i wonder if i could stop you the fox felt fingers prying in his mind that was how he recalled the sensation later at any rate it showed him that ferdulf however strong he was by merely mortal standards was weak by those of the godsmavrix had rummaged through gerins thoughts and memories like a man going through a beltpouch in search of a pin stop that the fox said and tightened his mental muscles he wasnt sure that would do any good but had no intention of yielding to the little demigod without first putting up whatever fight he could ferdulf looked astonished as he usually did when things failed to go as hed thought they would how are you doing that he demanded youre supposed to be thinking about what i want you to think about not what you want to think about by his tone that latter wasnt worth contemplating those probing mental fingers groped harder gerin grunted ferdulf had told him his resistance had some success something an older wiser foe would have known better than to do so he kept on resisting as the palisade to fox keep had withstood a trokm siege he got the feeling resistance wasnt enough not by itself here he said youre going to think about what i want you to think about he couldnt reach out and touch ferdulfs mind not directly but there were other ways of gaining the demigods attention gerin grabbed ferdulf and flipped him over his knee ferdulf let out a squeal of pure outrage i said you wouldnt dare he cried the probing fingers vanished from gerins mind if nothing else the fox had managed to distract him just because you said it doesnt make it so not without a certain amount of trepidation gerin brought down the hand that wasnt restraining ferdulf the demigods howl was quite satisfactory ferdulf tried to rise straight up into the air as he had while playing at fox keep he did rise too but not very far not with the fox holding onto him have i got your attention yet gerin asked even with his feet off the ground he retained enough presence of mind to administer another dose of the medicine he had chosen why dont you put us both down and we can talk about it some more instead of fighting oh very well ferdulfs petulant tones were an echo of those mavrix used when as did happen once in a while the sithonian god was compelled to change his ways thank you gerin said most sincerely when his feet touched the ground again youre welcome ferdulf answered an unexpected bit of politeness he must have acquired from his mother he gave the fox a dirty look why are you so much harder to change than pigs and ducks as the implications of that sank in herris bigfoot and fulda gasped gerin gulped ferdulf had been trying to give him a ducks head then i dont know why he said im just glad i am and i want you to remember i am the next time you try to change meor anything elseyoure going to be in trouble have you got that yes ive got it ferdulf didnt look happy about it either which was a long way from breaking gerins heart the little demigod glared up at him how come you get to tell me what to do when youre only a mortal why the fox considered that i can think of a couple of reasons one is i may be just a mortal but ive been around a lot longer than you have i know more about the world than you do the first of those statements was undoubtedly true the second would undoubtedly have been true were ferdulf an ordinary fouryear old were ferdulf an ordinary fouryearold though he wouldnt have tried flying off with the fox and he wouldnt have tried decorating him with a mallards head either whatever else ferdulf was he wasnt trained to catch logical flaws he accepted what the fox told him more readily than gerin would have thats one he said whats two two is very simple gerin answered i just showed you im strong enough to do it didnt i besides being aragis argument over balsers allegiance that also had its logical flaws how long would gerin go on being stronger than ferdulf what would happen when he wasnt stronger any more gerin didnt know the answers to those questions he could think of things liable to be more pleasant than discovering what those answers were but ferdulf though a demigod was a fouryearold demigod as with any other fouryearold things as they were now seemed close to the way they would be forever yes youre stronger he said angry resignation in his voice but not everybody is if that aside didnt want to make herris and maybe fulda too run somewhere far far away maybe it should have gerin carefully chose a different issue im not the only one whos stronger than you ferdulf what about selatre my wife despite her disclaimer to marlanz ferdulf had been known to heed what she said thats not fair he exclaimed now the god she knows still keeps an eye on her and my father wont pay any attention to me you can tell that farseeing biton still holds selatre in his mind gerin asked of course ferdulf said cant you he didnt altogether grasp how limited the ordinary human sensorium was hed also said something else interesting though he probably didnt know it so mavrix was less than attentive to his offspring was he that didnt surprise gerin though he hadnt known it before a god of unbridled fertility didnt strike the fox as likely to make the most devoted parent for any one child will you behave yourself he demanded of the little demigod i suppose so ferdulf answered no more pigducks or duckpigs gerin said having dagref in his household hed learned better than to leave loopholes open and no more mixing any other creaturesor peopletogether all right all right ferdulf said not too much sulk in his voice gerin didnt trust his promise very far but didnt altogether discount it either from what hed seen of ferdulf the promise was worth about as muchand as littleas that of any other child of the same age sooner or later the demigod would forget hed made it and do something else appalling that was how children behaved even children of large powers but the fox didnt think ferdulf would go out and deliberately break his word fair enough he said we have a bargain then ferdulf nodded and went off to play gerin didnt think he walked a couple of feet off the ground intending to intimidate more likely he just wasnt thinking about what he was doing herris bigfoot by now took such minor impossibilities in stride he said thank you lord king we are grateful to you believe me for keeping him under what control you do gerin looked him straight in the eye quack he answered seriously quack quack quack herris looked horrified fulda gasped in dismay gerin let both of them stew for a moment then started to laugh that wasnt nice lord king fulda said sounding more sorrowful than angry he thought about it when ferdulf terrorized the villagers he didnt know any better gerin did youre right of course he told fulda i shouldnt have done it im sorry if anything the apologythe second in the space of a few minutesdisconcerted her more than the quacks had youre the king she blurted you dont have to say youre sorry to the likes of me he shook his head no youre wrong its aragis who never needs to say hes sorry thats the difference between us right there fulda didnt understand he hadnt expected she would ii who comes to fox keep called the sentry up on the palisade i am balser debos son came the reply from the chariot outside the keep i am here to give homage and fealty to gerin the fox the king of the north to acknowledge him as my suzerain and overlord of my barony the sentry whirled to see where gerin was as it happened he was standing in the courtyard not far away did you hear that lord king he exclaimed his voice going high and shrill with excitement did you hear that i heard it the fox answered hed been waiting for this moment for some time waiting for it and at the same time half hopingmaybe more than half hopingit would not come now that it was here though he would have to make the most of it he raised his voice balser debos son is welcome at fox keep let him enter bronze chain clattered as the gate crew lowered the drawbridge balsers chariot rolled into the courtyard the driver reined in the fine twohorse team balser got down from the car and walked over to the fox he was a young man dark slim not very tall but well put together who wore his beard in the forked style that had long been out of date but was suddenly all the rage again like the first stone sliding down a mountain to start an avalanche gerin remembered how the elabonian empire had blocked the last pass through the high kirs with just such an avalanche leaving the northlands to their own devices when the trokmoi invaded balser was going to cause a lot more trouble than he ever could have accounted for by himself his coming here in fact was no doubt the beginning of the rockslide well no help for it gerin hurried to meet him halfway the two men clasped hands i greet you balser debos son the fox said as his men gathered to watch the drama unfold use my keep as your own as long as you are here i thank you lord king balser replied if you should ever come south my keep is likewise yours gerin nodded he was glad to make a new guestfriend webs of host and guest guest and host each bound by the sacred ties of friendship to do no harm to the other stretched across the northlands without them feuds among barons would have been even worse than they were but balser had not traveled here to become a guestfriend however pleasing that might have been for the southern baron youre certain you want to become my vassal gerin said you dont care to stay your own lord as your father and grandfather were before you my father and grandfather never had to worry about aragis the archer balser sent gerin a curious look is it that you dont want my vassalage lord king thats not what you gave me to understand before no it isnt that aragis has threatened you aragis has tried to scare you out of your breeches as a matter of fact the breeches in question were dyed in bright checks of maroon and yellow a trokm mode that had grown fashionable among men of elabonian blood too scaring balser out of them would in gerins opinion have improved his wardrobe that however was not of the essence i dont blame you for wanting me to protect you from him and ill do just that the gods be praisedand you too lord king for your generosity balser said thats exactly what i want im not strong enough to hold him off on my ownhes shown me that you let your vassals remember theyre men id sooner go with you than have him swallow me down for which i thank you the fox didnt want to thank balser not really he wanted to kick him he wanted to kick aragis too for frightening balser into his own arms he wanted to kick aragis for being too arrogant to blame himself for frightening balser too had aragis shown only a little more restraint balser would have stayed neutral but the only man in all the northlands who had ever made the archer show restraint was gerin precisely because gerin worried him he could not bear to have the fox ruling balsers barony which lay close to his own another round of war was the last thing gerin wanted but that had nothing to do with anything war had come up to fox keep riding in balsers chariot balsers name had brought van and rihwin out of castle foxand selatre too a few paces behind them gerin didnt know where dagref materialized from one moment he wasnt anywhere to be seen but he stood at his fathers elbow the next vans daughter maeva had a quiver on her back and a bow in her hand she must have been practicing her shooting unlike dagref she hung back a little from her elders but balsers name drew her tooshe knew it meant fighting and that was what she wanted as the crowd grew balser said ill do it here and now if you like lord king we seem to have enough witnesses oh indeed the fox said its getting anything done without witnesses thats hard around here geroge and tharma came ambling around the corner of the castle gerin didnt think balsers name had attracted them but when they saw people gathering they hurried up to find out what was going on they were people tooor they were convinced they were balser didnt look so sure lord king id heard you kept a couple of those monsters at your keep but i hadnt believed it you may as well because its true im quite fond of them as a matter of fact gerin offered no compromise there whatever if balser didnt like it he could go back to his barony that would disappoint maeva who wanted a war but not the fox who didnt but balser showed no signs of packing up and leaving are they your vassals too he asked i do like to know the company im keeping one of gerins eyebrows rose at that display of sangfroid stepchildren more like he answered and had the satisfaction of startling balser in return why is everybody standing here geroge asked he pointed at balser with a clawed index finger and who is this strange gentleman hearing him speak and make good sense startled balser again the baron could have remarked on geroges being a strange gentleman himself gerin gave him points because he didnt instead he answered the question seriously i am balser debos son and i have come to give homage and fealty to your stepfather geroge and tharma both clapped their large hairy hands together oh good they said seeing that everyone who dwelt at fox keep took the monsters for granted helped balser do the same he turned back to gerin saying where were we lord king he answered his own question by going to one knee before the fox rihwin coughed and said meaning no offense son of debo but the ritual of offering submission to the king he being of rank superior to that enjoyed by other sorts of overlords requires the vassal to rest both knees on the ground gerin hadnt intended to make an issue of it as far as he was concerned one knee would have been as binding as two balser fortunately didnt seem inclined to make an issue of it either very well he said and went from one knee to two at the same time offering his hands to gerin palms pressed together the fox enclosed balsers hands with his own balser gave him homage i balser debos son own myself to be your vassal gerin the fox king of the north and give you the whole of my faith against all men who might live or die i gerin king of the north accept your homage balser debos son and pledge in my turn always to use you justly in token of which i raise you up now the fox pulled balser to his feet and kissed him on the cheek sealing the ceremony of homage by dyaus the father of all and the other gods of elabon i swear my fealty to you lord king balser said with a bow gerin bowed to him in turn by dyaus the father of all and the other gods of elabon i accept your oath and swear to reward your loyalty with my own i am your man lord king balser said not a formal part of the ceremony but a truth nonetheless so you are gerin said well feast tonight to celebratenot that he felt much like celebratingand then tomorrow ill send out messengers to some of my other vassals telling them your lands need protecting against aragis i want warriors down there as fast as may be balser looked less than delighted at that prospect but in the end nodded he seemed to be realizing for the first time what all having an overlord entailed gerins men were going to be overrunning his holding and he couldnt do anything about it they wouldnt burn and loot and kill as aragis men would have done at least not to anywhere near the same degree but they would be there and the holding would no longer be his in the sense it had been for so long and of course the presence of the foxs men in balsers holding was liable to bring aragis army over the border in which case the archers men would do the burning and looting and killing balser had come to gerin to prevent the fox thought he saw the moment in which balser figured that out too his new vassal wasnt so good as he might have been at holding his face straight second thoughts gerin asked him some balser answered which bespoke a certain basic honesty i couldnt go it alone any more and i couldnt stomach bending the kneebending both kneesto aragis that left bending the kneethe kneesto you for which ringing endorsement i thank you gerin said balsers worried expression made him hold up a hand dont fret you havent offended me you knew what you were doing and why you were doing it thats more than a lot of people ever manage now come on he waved balser toward castle fox well enjoy ourselves for the time being and then van broke in from the crowd of onlookers and then well go off and fight ourselves one bloody big war he didnt sound so eager as he would have in his younger days but he did sound very sure no one who heard him claimed he was wrong either gerin shouted for ale and ordered an ox slain carlun vepins son grimaced at that gerin took no notice of him telling the cooks lay the fatwrapped thighbones on dyaus altar and set them afire so the smoke will rise up to heaven and the allfather will favor what balser and i have done today actually by everything hed seen by everything other gods had told him dyaus hardly bothered noticing what went on in the material world gerin shrugged he still had to make the effort fand came downstairs to see what the commotion in the great hall was about a big rawboned trokm woman still more than handsome though gray streaked her oncefiery hair she carried a couple of pieces of cloth shed been sewing into a tunic and a long bone needle shed heard vans last remark go off and fight a war will you now she said advancing on him leave me behind will you now the outlander scowled i will he rumbled and pointed to the needle theres a weapon for piercing cloth not flesh fand scowled right back at him youve got a weapon in your breeches for piercing flesh she jeered and better nor half the reason youre so wild for going off to battle is that along the way you find some pretty young things to stick it into girls who arent after hearing your lies a thousand times the way i have better than half the reason im wild to go off to battle is that you arent carping and cawing at me while im away van retorted fand shouted at him again he shouted back each ones opening shot had made the other angrier no doubt because both contained a painful amount of truth gerin eyed with some concern the needle fand was holding shed stabbed a trokm lover before she turned up at fox keep she and van occasionally quarreled with more than words but neither of them had ever seriously damaged the other the fox wanted that to stay true balser glanced over at him they must care for each other gerins new vassal remarked else theyd try and kill each other over some of the things theyre saying that marched very well with gerins own thoughts some people enjoy quarreling he said ive never seen the sport in it myself in the midst of her own tirade fand heard his quiet comment she spun away from van and toward him sure and im not quarreling for nobbut the sport of it lord king gerin the fox she loaded his title and name with the familiar scorn that could only have come from a former lover pointing at van she went on im quarreling for that he willna keep his trousers on the instant hes out of my sight am i the only one van shouted by the gods its hardly better than luck my children look like me instead of coming to blows they went upstairs a few minutes later gerin breathed a silent sigh of relief hed seen them do that a good many times before too they found being angry added spice to their lovemaking that bemused the fox too it wasnt the way he worked rihwin the fox said as a calm descends over the battlefield he winked if you had a wife shed be after you the same way gerin said without a doubt you have reason lord king rihwin gave a bow that was only slightly mocking therefore i was wise enough never to wed therefore youve got bastards in half the peasant villages in my domain gerin said which was also true i am not a eunuch rihwin said with dignity and i do all i can for my byblows gerin had to nod rihwin was erratic and extravagant but not badhearted never a dull moment around these parts is there balser debos son was looking a trifle walleyed as if he hadnt expected anything like the turbulent stir of personalities hed found at fox keep maybe he was having more second thoughts about becoming gerins vassal too late now in all seriousness gerin replied i do keep trying for them but i havent had much luck balser laughed wrongly thinking hed made a joke riders went out of fox keep the next morning to summon gerins vassals to bring their retainers to his holding for the likely campaign against aragis so many men climbing up on horses backs balser said as bemused by the show of equitation as by what had gone on in the great hall the night before which to the foxs way of thinking had been on the mild side always something new here eh lord king i hope so gerin answered that he saw startled balser anew he went on dont you think life would get dull if we kept doing the same things the same old way forever the more so as a lot of those old ways dont work as well as they might balser plainly hadnt thought about it at all as plainly he would have been quite happy to go on not thinking about it at all and to see the same old ways go on forever if he could most people were like that as gerin had discovered to his continued disappointment about this business of horseriding balser said we dont hardly see it down in my part of the northlands hed steered clear of openly arguing with his new overlord and was turning the conversation back toward the comment hed made first not a bad performance gerin thought aloud he said its been more than twenty years now since one of my vassals duin the bold came up with those footmountsstirrups we call emthat let a man stay mounted while he uses both hands for archery and let him charge home with a spear without having to worry about going back over the horses tail the instant he strikes home we had good luck using mounted men against the gradi i think the chariot is on the way out for traveling i can see that it might be balser said easier to ride than to harness up a car every day and you dont have to worry about your axle or your wheels breaking either suddenly seeming to realize what hed said he scratched his head ive just spoken well of the new havent i ill not tell if you dont gerin said solemnly thats a bargain balser laughed but then held up a hand i dont speak well of everything new mind you are you saying riders will take the place of chariots in war too i have trouble believing that a man on horseback isnt nearly so frightening to his foes as a chariot thundering down on them maybe not gerin said but riders can go places chariots cant and can fight on ground that would have chariots tipping over and with chariots remember your driver has to tend to the horses he cant do much fighting with men on horseback youre not wasting one in three but every rider has to tend to his horse balser returned i dont see that the gains worth it one way or the other well find out gerin said there will be a lot of chariotry in the force i bring down to defend your landtherell have to be because a lot of my vassals dont like the idea of riding any better than you do ill have a good many horsemen along too though and well see how they fare against aragis chariots they gave the gradi plenty of trouble as ive said but the gradi fight on foot this will be a different test a test balser debos son tasted the words a fitting comparison for he went on you sound as if youre trying out different ways of brewing ale as a matter of fact adiatunnus the trokm gave me one not so long ago gerin answered his people have taken to roasting the barley malt almost to the point where its burnt id lay long odds they did it by accident the first time but it makes a pretty good brew black as rich earth and full of flavor balser threw his hands in the air i might have known youd have something of the sort to tell me he exclaimed and then looked at the fox from under lowered eyelids you havent given me any of this funny black ale i dont like to spring it on people as a surprise gerin said it does take a bit of getting used to or so most folk find but if youre game for something new i have a few jars down in the cellar balser was more willing to contemplate novelty in ale than he was in ways of fighting after hed downed a jack of the trokmstyle brew he smacked his lips a couple of times and said thats not too bad i dont think id care to drink it all the time but for now and again itd be fine itd go right well with blood sausage id say now that you mention it it does gerin said and called for some to prove the point while they were eating he went on you ask me the more choices you have in anything the better if youre bedding a woman for instance you dont want to just climb on top and pound away all the time balser looked as astonished as he had at the idea of fighting from horseback rather than in a chariot what other way is there he demanded gerin spent a moment silently pitying his new vassals wife if balser had one but then the fox while a student down in the city of elabon had become acquainted with a scroll that got copied and recopied as it passed from hand to hand and from generation to generation the text had been educational the illustrations even more so he didnt go into great detail the more he talked though the wider balsers eyes got balser could see possibilities if you pointed them out to him lord king he burst out idve become your vassal for this all by its lonesometo the five hells with anything else i never thought of getting vassals like that the fox said with a laugh more flies end up stuck in honey than in vinegar though dont they i wonder if adiatunnus would have given me less trouble over the years if hed spent more time figuring out all the different postures he could bend the trokm girls into balser ran his tongue over his lips im from far enough south that i havent had much dealing with the trokmoior their women are the wenches as loose as i hear well no gerin answered and balser looked disappointed the fox went on their ways are freer than ours youll never find a trokm whos shy about telling you what heor she very much or shethinks if they like you youll know about it and if they dont like you youll know about that too ah balser said well thats not too bad i suppose he was young enough and of rank high enough to assume that women would like him maybe he was even right on the other hand given how much hed shown he didnt know maybe he wasnt on the other hand gerin sighed on the other hand he said theres adiatunnus hes as good at hiding what he thinks as any elabonian ever born hes learned from us too since he brought his band of woodsrunners south over the niffet if he hadnt had me for a neighbor he might be the one styling himself king of the north these days he sounds like trouble balser said you should have killed him he is trouble gerin answered he was trouble anyhow i did try to kill him it didnt work if it hadnt been for the gradi id have tried again and that probably wouldnt have worked either the past five years hes been as good a vassal as a man could want he even came to fox keep so i could teach him his letters a woodsrunner both balsers eyebrows shot up why on earth did he want to do that i never felt the need myself hes always thought we elabonians were more civilized than his people and so aped us though hed never own as much out loud gerin said ill teach anyone who wants to learn i dont mind having serfs able to read and write for one thing it makes keeping track of what they have and what they owe easier for another some of them are sharpmy steward used to be a serf for instance ive heard some things about that balser didnt say whether he thought those things good or bad gerin didnt much care one way or the other he also wasnt quite ready to change the subject but i was talking about adiatunnus trokm or not he never shows ahead of time how hell jump hes my biggest worry in going to war against aragis as a matter of fact hows that lord king balser asked afraid hell jump you from behind thats just what im afraid of the fox looked at balser with somber approval the baron from the south might not think much of reading but he was not a fool and thats why ill be waiting and watching to see what he does now that ive asked him for men if he gives me all ive asked for well and good if he comes himself at their head better than well and good if he sends me excuses instead of men in that case i have to leave more men behind myself but then you wont be able to do a proper job of defending me balser exclaimed i wont be able to do a proper job of defending you if im fighting a big war up here either gerin pointed out he held out his hands as if they were the pans of a scale and moved them slowly up and down its not a matter of doing all one thing or all the other its finding a proper balance between them balser didnt say anything the noise he made in the back of his throat though did not sound like agreement of course we may be fretting over shadows gerin said it depends on adiatunnus balser made the same noise rather louder by dribs and drabs vassals started coming into fox keep they slept in the rushes of the great hall they slept in the courtyard and as the army grew they began setting up tents on the meadow near the keep and sleeping there every time a new contingent arrived gerin would look delighted and carlun vepins son appalled the fox thought of them as fighting men to his steward they were but extra mouths to be fed ill tell you what they are van said one day after a dozen or so warriors led by a young baron named laufram the lean stared in wonder at the nondescript keep of their overlord and at the swelling host theyre peculiar thats what how do you mean gerin asked i dont quite know the outlander confessed but theyre different from the way they used to be when i first came to fox keep were different from the way we used to be when you first came to fox keep gerin said we were young men ourselves then or near enough van shook his head with some impatience he answered i know that its not what i mean ive taken it into account or i think i have all right gerin spread his hands but if that isnt what you mean and you cant tell me what you mean how am i supposed to make sense of it van shrugged a massive shrug and walked off muttering into his beard a little while later though he came up to gerin at a pounding trot i have it captain he said hed never called his friend lord or lord prince or lord king by all the gods i have it the fox raised an eyebrow do you suppose taking a physic will cure you of it when van made as if to hit him he laughed and said all right you have it now that you have it what is it its this the outlander said importantly back in the old days your vassal barons would just as soon spit in your eye as look at you is that so or isnt it oh its so all right gerin agreed a lot of them had been used to dealing with my father to them i was nothing but a puppy sitting in the big dogs place i had to prove i belonged there every day the smile he wore was slightly twisted some of his memories of the early days after he took over the barony were fond ones others anything but thats right vans head bobbed up and down thats exactly right but these troopers coming in now and the barons leading them toowhat do they treat you like to the five hells with me if they dont treat you like a king gerin thought about it then he too slowly nodded maybe they do he said the ones who are lordlets now are the sons and grandsons most of them of the lords who held those keeps back twentyodd years ago you and i van weve outlived most of the men who started with us we havent outlived aragis van said not yet anyway his big fist folded around the hilt of his sword in grim anticipation no nor adiatunnus either gerin plucked at his beard outlasting the competition wasnt a very dramatic way of gaining the upper hand but it worked how many young men died long before they were able to show all they could do how many times had he nearly died himself more than he cared to think of that was certain ah adiatunnus van spoke with a certain fond ferocity gerin often heard the same note in his own voice when he talked about the trokm chieftain the outlander went on and what will you do if himself himselfhe put on a trokm lilt for a momentdoesnt care to come when hes called as a good vassal should worry the fox answered which made van laugh its not funny gerin insisted i was talking about this with balser too and fretting over it before i talked with him if adiatunnus waits till im all tied up with aragis and then rises against me i dont think id enjoy that much neither would he after you were through with him van said gerin thought that even his friends got the idea he could do more than he knew to be humanly possible van continued if he betrays you you could loose the gradi against him oh now theres a fine notion gerin exclaimed if you have a sore toe take an axe and whack off your foot well you could make him think you were going to do it van said and that when you got down to it wasnt the worst idea in the world ferocious as they were the trokmoi feared the gradi who had often beaten them in battle and whose gods had trounced their own if they hadnt feared the gradi so much adiatunnus would have gone to war against gerin years before instead of asking him for aid nevertheless i hope i dont have to think about it gerin said i hope he shows up here with a whole great whacking unruly lot of trokmoi in chariots he laughed at himself and if id said anything like that a few years back everyone would have been sure i was out of my mind dont you fret about it captain van reassured him everyone was sure you were out of your mind anyhow its such ringing endorsements that have made me what i am today the fox said which is bloody fed up with people who use friendship as an excuse to insult me he did not intend to be taken seriously and van obliged him dont fret about that either id insult you even if we werent friends both men laughed gerin laughed even more four days later when adiatunnus and a whole great whacking unruly lot of trokmoi in chariots did show up at fox keep he had all the relief off his face by the time the trokm chief swaggered over the drawbridge and into the courtyard or so he thought at any rate after the bows and the handclasps were over adiatunnus tilted his head back to look down his long thin nose at the fox he blew out a long breath through his luxuriant drooping mustachios and said sure and ill wager youre not sorry to set eyes on me at all at all well if youre bright enough to see that youre bright enough to see id be lying if i said anything else gerin answered youre not the sort of man i can take for granted you know adiatunnus preened like a lot of trokmoi he was vulnerable to flattery but gerin hadnt been lying either he would much sooner have had the woodsrunner under his eye than behind his back so youre finally going after aragis the archer are you now lord king adiatunnus said about time says i past time says i his pale eyes gleamed in his knobbycheekboned face for years i waited for the shindy twixt the two of you to start so i could put paid to you once for all he shook his big fist at gerin in anger not altogether assumed and you you kernyou wouldna fight him you were one of the reasons i never did gerin said again truthfully i knew youd land on my back if i got into it with aragistill you and i made peace with each other that is he said not a word about any worries hed had on summoning adiatunnus as a vassal this time if the trokm chief didnt already have ideas in his head the fox had no intention of putting them there adiatunnus as it happened already had them oh aye i thought on doing it the now but i held myself back indeed and i did thats interesting gerin felt a drop of sweat slide down his back why if you dont mind my asking not a bit adiatunnus answered two reasons in all the first is you came to my aid against the gradi when you were right on the point o going to war against me instead what a blackhearted spalpeen id be to forget it well by the gods the fox exclaimed gratitudes not dead after all he bowed to adiatunnus now youve put me in your debt but go on two reasons you said and you gave only one whats the other the trokm scuffed his foot against the ground more like an abashed boy than a man whod ably led his clan for more than twenty years sure and im shamed to own it but im shamed to lie too here it is fox and to the crows with you if you brag of it i was after fearing that did i hit you whilst you looked the other way youd still somehow or other make me sorry i ever was born i say that mind and i reckon myself not the least tricksy man living these days nor the weakest either gerin considered mm i dont know whether i could have or not i tell you this though i would have tried he doubted he could have done much to adiatunnus not if he was embroiled against a foe as formidable as aragis at the same time again he did not mention his doubts to the trokm ideas about how dangerous he was were ones he wanted adiatunnus to have when do we move against aragis adiatunnus asked whenever it is my warriors will be ready likely tell gerin gave him a saucy grin ill set the day for you two days before the one i tell my elabonians so we can all set out at the same time adiatunnus glared is that a tongue you carry in your mouth or a woodworkers rasp were not so slow as all that indeed and were not for youd fret over less an we were fair enough gerin said come drink some ale with me now and your warriors and mine can get drunk together and tell lies about all the different times they tried to kill each other and some of the tales they tell wont be lies at all fox darling adiatunnus said widin simrins son would be here for instance im thinking he wasna in his own keep when i passed it by on the way hither yes hes here gerin answered remember he and you are both my vassals now you cant go having your own little wars for the fun of it indeed and id never think such a thing the sparkle in adiatunnus eyes said he didnt expect gerin to believe a word of it but i do recall the days when we went after each other and not a doubt have i got that theyre in his memory as well hashing them out over some ale will be safer nor going through them ever was truth that gerin agreed falling into the trokm tongue for a couple of words like a lot of elabonians whod grown up on the border he used it almost as readily as his own language adiatunnus held up a forefinger one more question before i drink deep and forget i meant to ask it have you had more of your books copied out that i might buy them of you yes gerin answered a chronicle and a poem ah thats fine thats fine indeed the trokm chieftain said when you told me youd teach me the art of reading i bethought myself id learn it as i learned to use a tool or a weapon the more such things you know the better after all but you omadhaun you why did you not tell me beforehand itd be near as much fun as futtering why gerins eyes were wide and innocent if i had told you thatbeforehand mind youwould you have believed me nay i wouldna adiatunnus admitted he gave the fox a sudden suspicious stare dont go thinking youre civilizing me the now or whatever youre after calling it a trokm i am and i remain and proud of it of course gerin said more innocently still lord king i beg you put the army in motion soon carlun vepins son said you have no idea how fast theyre going through the stores youve built up over the years i have a very good idea how fast theyre doing it gerin returned i ought to and the reason you build up stores in the first place carlun is to be able to use them at times like these normally that sort of answer would have silenced the steward now though he shook his head and said truly lord king you must see this for yourself come down into the storerooms under the castle look at the empty shelves look at the empty chambers by the gods see what this campaign is doing to fox keep the fox sighed the trouble with carlun as with any good steward he supposed was that accumulating got to be an end in itself for him not a means to an end shouting at the former serf had produced no lasting relief humoring him might buy gerin a longer quiet stretch all right lets go have a look he said and rose from the bench in the great hall he and carlun had been sharing after exclaiming in glad surprise carlun rose too pausing in the kitchen only to light two clay lamps at a cookfire the steward handed gerin one of them and then led him down into the cellars below castle fox the air was cool and damp down there full of the yeasty smell of ale and a greener odor suggesting that somewhere back among those corridors a crock of gherkins had gone over carlun pointed to a bare wall look lord king we had jars of ale set there not so long ago i know that gerin said patiently if we all started drinking river water the first thing it would do is make all my vassals and all their vassals and all their retainers hopping mad at me the second thing it would do is give about half of them a flux of the bowels thats not really what you want if you expect to fight a war sometime soon and here carlun said dramatically paying no attention whatsoever to him he held the lamp close to another row of jars so the fox could see they had the lids off and were empty these were full of wheat and these over here were full of barley and these and you carlun youre full of beans gerins patience was breaking now when it broke it left sharp edges if i dont feed my soldiers that will get me talked about worse than not giving them ale the steward still was not listening the steward was determined not to listen in the darkness all around the flickering lamplight gleamed off his pale set face gerin had seen less battleready faces coming at him over shields carlun pointed toward a corridor down which theyd not yet gone and the peas lord king when you think whats happening to our peas what gerin was thinking was that this wasnt working as hed hoped no matter what he did carlun wasnt going to stop nagging him about how much the warriors were eating wearily he said all right show me the peas carlun and then well go back upstairs the men arent eating any more than i thought they would and the stores dont look to be in any worse shape than i thought they were carlun rounded the corner gerin followed close behind him with a gasp the steward stopped in his tracks gerin had to stop in a hurry too lest he walk up carluns back and perhaps set the stewards tunic on fire then the foxs hand flew to the hilt of his sword for he heard two other gasps from farther up the corridor he took his hand away from his sword as fast as it had gone there he started to laugh down here two gasps didnt mean thieves they meant two people surprised when they wanted privacy he had fond memories of some of the corridors in the cellar not this one in particular but some nearby he knew his son duren had amused himself down here too sorry to disturb you he called into the gloom at the end of the passage wondering if hed interrupted dagref at a moment in his education he couldnt possibly have acquired from a book from out of that gloom came a deep voice you startled us lord king we didnt think anyone would be down here gerin clapped a hand to his forehead he knew that voice it wasnt dagrefs carlun and i will go up to the great hall now he said when the two of you have put yourselves back together i want you to come up there too we have some talking to do im afraid aye lord king came the answer from the darkness come on gerin said to carlun who was still staring down the passageway lets go the steward looked back toward him as if hed gone mad but lord king were not nearly through the vegetables and we havent even begun on the smoked meats and er sausages to the five hells with the vegetables and the smoked meats gerin didnt mention the sausages if he didnt think about them maybe he wouldnt think about on the other hand maybe he would he grabbed carlun by the arm come on curse you do you want to annoy them hanging about down here that got carlun moving as the fox had thought it would it got carlun moving so fast he tripped on the stairs going up to the kitchens not once but twice once up in the kitchens he hurried out through them gerin followed more slowly he wondered if carlun would wait in the great hall to discuss beans and radishes and smoked pigs knuckles when carlun chose to find something else to do out in the courtyard the fox nodded without any particular surprise he hadnt hired his steward to be a hero he sat down at the bench where he and carlun had been talking a couple of troopers started to come into the great hall the fox waved them out again a serving girl walked over to him with a pitcher of ale he waved her away too wanting both a clear head and no audience for the discussion he knew he was going to have a couple of minutes later geroge walked out of the kitchens looking as nonchalant as he could gerin nodded and slapped the bench beside himself some of the monsters nonchalance evaporated as he came over and sat down gerin nodded again he didnt say anything not until tharma came out of the kitchens too she didnt even try for nonchalance worry twisted her face as she joined geroge and the fox well well gerin said then as mildly as he could how long has this been going on geroge and tharma were too hairy for him to tell whether they blushed by the way they wiggled on the benches he thought they did not long lord king geroge answered he did more talking than tharma the fox glanced over to the female monster youre not with child are you oh no lord king she said quickly i would know thats good he said and wondered where to go from there geroge and tharma had been raised as brother and sister he thought they were brother and sister the peasant whod found them as cubs and brought them to him said theyd been together but discussions of incest seemed out of place when they were the only two of their kind above ground in the northlands hed actually thought this moment would come sooner than it had are you angry at us lord king geroge asked reading his expression and tone of voice werent easy but he seemed more worried about the foxs anger than one of his own children would have been gerin shook his head if that wasnt irony he didnt know what was with a sigh he answered no im not angry youre the only two like yourselves in these parts and youre a man and a woman he knew no better way to put it what else are you going to do oh good tharma said i hope i do get to be with child before too long gerin coughed im not so sure thats a good idea he said one of the better understatements he remembered making in some time why not tharma asked you could marry us the way you or the headman does for the serfs and then the children wouldnt be bastards we wouldnt want that lord king geroge added seriously the fox was tempted to pound his head against the top of the table at which he was sitting all things considered he was more proud of himself than not over how hed raised them they earnestly wanted to do everything the right way the proper way the only trouble was they didnt see enough of the picture a failing anything but unique to their kind he explained as gently as he could you know how people who dont know you get upset when they first see you because you remind them of the trouble that happened around the time when you were born he couldnt come up with a politer way of putting that the monsters had done their horrific best to overrun the northlands and that best had nearly proved good enough oh yes we know about that geroge answered nodding his large fearsome head but once people get to know us they see were all right even if we dont look just like them part of the reason people saw thata big partwas that the two monsters were under gerins protection another part the fox admitted to himself was that as monsters wenteven as people wentgeroge and tharma were good people and another big part of the reason they got such tolerance as they did was that they were the only two monsters above ground i dont know how happy regular people would be if you started raising a family gerin said carefully they might worry that the things that happened when you were born would start happening again thats foolish tharma bared her prominent teeth in indignation we know how to behave we should you taught us yourself and wed teach our little ones the same way im sure you would gerin was absurdly touched at the faith they put in his teachings no his own children didnt pay nearly so much attention to them even so though people would worry and they might get nasty i dont want that to happen youre the king geroge said you could tell them to stop it and theyd have to listen that was how the monsters had lived to grow up in the first place gerin didnt know if he could stretch it to a family of them he didnt really want to find out hed contemplated getting rid of geroge and tharma when they reached the age where they could reproduce their kind he hadnt done it the reason he hadnt done it he now discovered was that he couldnt do it hed raised them as his stepchildren and they were in essence his stepchildren by all the gods be careful he told them he might have told dagref the same thing one of these days soon he would be telling dagref the same thing he gestured sharply geroge and tharma hastily rose from their seats and went out into the courtyard gerin stared after them he bunched his right hand into a fist and brought it down hard on the tabletop hed known this day was coming he was a man who prided himself on acting with decision now the day had come and gone and all he had to show for it was ambiguity he looked down at his fist and willed it to unfold when it did he started to laugh it was not amusement or not amusement with anything but the human condition the part of it that had to do with the difference between the way men thought things would work and the way they actually turned out and with making the best of that difference twenty years ago he muttered under his breath twenty years ago i thought i was going to slaughter every trokm on the face of the earth hed had good reason to think that too what better reason than the woodsrunners killing his father and older brother and making him leave the city of elabon to return to the northlands hed learned to despise hed taken vengeance as great as any man could have done and now and now adiatunnus walked into the great hall waved walked over and sat down beside him and clapped him on the back while shouting for ale and the fox was genuinely glad to have the trokm with him he was too honest to try to pretend otherwise to himself life he observed with a profound lack of originality is a much stranger and more complicated thing than we think when we first set out on it truth there adiatunnus agreed or would i be after calling a cursed southron like your own self a friend and meaning it that so closely mirrored gerins own thought he blinked in startlement adiatunnus went on but not a chance at all have we of making the pups believe it ive given up i have they think everythings simple sure and they do a grave now a graves a simple thing what comes beforenay you should have gone down to the city of elabon to study philosophy gerin said youd have made the sithonian lecturers work for a living i think philosophy were getting old you and i is that philosophy it will do till something better comes along gerin called for ale himself carlun vepins son stood beaming from ear to ear the army gerin had assembled was leaving fox keep the soldiers wouldnt stop eating and drinking of course but they would stop eating and drinking where the steward could see them doing it and where he could see the results of their depredations to carlun nothing else mattered dagref drove gerins chariot concentration turned the youngsters face masklike this was his first campaign and he was determined to make no mistakes he would of course despite all his determination gerin wondered how he would deal with that the only way to find out was to let him have the chance and see what happened van had another thought setting a hand on dagrefs shoulder he said i rode to war with your brother at the reins not so long ago yes i know dagref answered duren is older than i am so of course he got to do all these things first of course van echoed and winked at gerin the fox nodded that qualification was dagref to the core not only precise but also just a little slighting to anyone who dared presume he wasnt precise gerin said when we get down to durens holding in a few days hell be surprised how much youve grown yes dagref said and fell silent again five years earlier dagref had wanted to be like duren in every way he could now he was his own person and increasingly insistent that everyone acknowledge him as such no doubt he also thought about duren in a different way these days one of them would succeed the fox duren was gerins firstborn but dagref was his firstborn by selatre duren already ruled in his own right the barony that had been his grandfathers dagref as yet ruled nothing and nobody in another five years though or ten since gerin had yet to decide who would succeed him he didnt blame dagref for having the question a good deal in his mind too he wished he could send the lad down to the city of elabon even more than himself perhaps dagref was made for the scholars life the fox sighed he hadnt been able to stay a scholar and there was no guarantee dagref would either life as gerin had learned did not come with a guarantee that was a lesson serfs sucked in with their mothers milk most serfs seeing an army on the move whether made up of the enemy or of their overlords warriors ran for the woods and swamps with whatever they could carry women ran faster than menand had better reason to run the serfs who labored in the foxs holding though watched the chariots come forth from the keep without fear a few of them even waved from the fields and vegetable plots where they labored slowly over the years theyd let gerin convince them his soldiers were likelier to mean protection than rapine and rape as dagref drove past the village a small figure came out of one of the huts there and trotted after his chariot no child should have had any business gaining on a twohorse chariot this one did so with effortless ease father dagref asked in a small tight voice did you intend for ferdulf to campaign with us of course not gerin answered he waved to the little demigod go back to your mother no ferdulf answered in his utterly unchildlike tones the village is boring and with you and all your soldiers gone from the keep itll be boring there too ill go with you maybe you wont be boring he sounded as if with some reluctance he was giving the fox the benefit of the doubt gerins reaction was that life with ferdulf wasnt likely to be boring either but that didnt mean it would be more enjoyable go back to your mother the fox repeated no ferdulf said in his stubbornness not only childlike but godlike a point in common between the two aspects of his nature gerin had noticed before ferdulf stuck out his tongue like mavrix he could stick it out improbably far when he wanted to you cant make me either as if to emphasize that he leaped into the air and flew along ten or fifteen feet above gerins head jeering all the while if the little bugger doesnt knock that off van muttered behind his hand hes liable to find out just how close to immortal he is when he comes in for a landing i know what you mean gerin said he didnt expect van to try wringing ferdulfs neck or to succeed if he did try he understoodhe understood down to the groundthe reasons the outlander had for contemplating semideicide glaring up at ferdulf the fox declared if you dont come down from there this minute ill tell your father on you go ahead ferdulf answered he doesnt like you either thats true gerin said calmly but he wouldnt pick such foolish ways of showing it he thought he was even telling the truth whatever else could be said about himand a great deal else could have been said about himmavrix had style ferdulf did hesitate in his hesitation he fell a few feetalmost low enough for gerin to reach up and try plucking him out of the air at the last minute he thought better of it hed laid hold of ferdulf on the ground and had got away with it there doing the same thing from a moving chariot struck him as imperfectly provident dagref spoke over his shoulder arent you going to make him go back to the village im open to suggestions gerin snarled right now id be satisfied with making him shut up oh i can do that dagref said i thought you wanted what you said you wanted in the first place one of these days youll learn the difference between what you want and what youll settle for gerin said to which his son responded with only a scornful toss of his head nettled the fox snapped what forfeit will you pay if you dont make the little bastard shut up why whatever you like of course dagref replied van whistled softly hes asking for it fox you ought to give it to him so i should gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder go ahead do it now all right dagref said what forfeit will you pay if i do whatever you like of course gerin spoke in mocking imitation of his son hmm dagref looked up to ferdulf who was still flying along making a hideous racket you know right now youd annoy my father much more by keeping quiet than you do with all that noise silence after a minute or so van broke that silence with a thunderous guffaw gerin glared up at ferdulf who flew along still silent but made a horrible face back at him merely human features could never have accommodated that sneer of course a merely human being wouldnt have been flying along above the chariot either have i won father dagref asked aye youve won gerin admitted more than a little apprehensively what will you ask of me hed promised too much he knew hed promised too much now he had to deliver if dagref said something like declare me your successor on the spot he didnt see how he could do anything elseunless he could talk his son out of it talking dagref out of anything was no easy task he couldnt see his sons face dagref was concentrating on driving the chariot more silence stretched gerin knew what that meant dagref was thinking things over one thing he seldom did was speak too soon in that he was very like his father gerin had broken his own rule and now he would have to pay for it i dont know right now dagref answered after that pause for thought when i decide ill tell you all right gerin said youll know best whatever it turns out to be make sure its what you really want now and what you really want years from now too ah dagref rode on for another little while then said youre not going to tell me you were only joking and you didnt really mean it had he and dagref been having a purely private argument gerin might have tried telling him just that with a demigod as witness he thought the consequences of granting whatever dagref asked for would be less than those of trying to break his word no im not going to tell you that he said im going to count on your good sense van poked him in the ribs he grimaced the outlanders face bore an unseemly smirk the fox knew what he was thinking at dagrefs age good sense was hard to come by with anyone of that age but his contemplative son he would have had little hope himself as things were he had some dagref said all right father his chuckle was eerily like the one gerin would have used under the same circumstances im not likely to get another promise like that out of you am i you werent likely to get the first one gerin answered that was a sneaky bit of business you used playing ferdulf off against me i learned it from you dagref said youve been playing foes off one against another for years now sometimes they even notice youre doing it but never till too late he spoke matteroffactly he knew what he knew that gerins foesall of them men grownhad failed to see it till too late was their misfortune not his in his own rather withdrawn way he was formidable rihwin and a squadron of his riders came up and surrounded the chariot just then gerin was glad to watch them for a while they took his mind off both dagref and ferdulf the horseriders were staring up at ferdulf and exclaiming not all of them had paid the little demigod much heed till now ferdulf responded with a series of aerial maneuvers that would have left an eagle dizzy the riders clapped and cheered ferdulfs face bore a smug grin like mavrix he was vain dagref having used ferdulf to score his point against his father paid no more attention to him he watched the riders too gerin understood that most of them were young men a good number hardly older than dagref gerin hadnt seen so many nearly smooth cheeks and chins since his days in the city of elabon where shaving was the custom even the riders who had raised beards looked absurdly young to the fox one of them though very fuzzy made gerin wonder if he had even dagrefs years the fox shook his head hed been thinking more and more lately that the whole world was looking too bloody young but then he saw dagref eyeing that very younglooking horseman too and decided his eyes and wits hadnt been playing tricks on him after all he said son i can tell that riding horses is the coming thing you wont have to spend all your time driving a chariot you can learn what you need to know dagref looked away from the rider umm he said rather foolishly as if his mind had been somewhere else that was unlike him then he gave his usual serious notice to what gerin had said oh its all right he said i can ride a horse nowrihwins been teaching maeva and me and some of his own bastards when they come to fox keep i havent done any fighting from horseback yet but not a lot of men have youre right the fox said i dont think it will go on being so much longer though if we fight aragis now everybody in the northlands will know what horsemen can do and if they do what i think they will everybody in the northlands will want to have his own riders by this time next year now theres an interesting question father dagref said you could profit by sending out men to teach your neighbors how to fight from horseback but that would also be teaching them to fight better against you would it be worthwhile do you suppose yes that is interesting gerin said do i sell a man the axe he wants to use to chop off my head i suppose id have to decide one case at a time instead of laying down a blanket rule beforehand some id think i could trust some of the ones i couldnt trust id be sure i could beat and some i wouldnt want to help any which way ah dagref considered that then nodded youre saying that making a rule is like making a promise once youve made it you have to stick by it whether that looks like a good idea or not he coughed a couple of times then added i wish youd have said that more often when i was smaller straightfaced gerin answered i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about dagref turned to give him an irate stare after a moment they both started to laugh when evening came the army was still on land that had been in the foxs family for generations peasants who lived near the roadway came up to the army with sheep and pigs and chickens to sell adiatunnus watched the dickering with no small astonishment they run toward you not away he said to gerin its not that they stay in their fields the which is strange enough but they run toward you by the way he spoke the peasants might have practiced some unnatural vice theyve seen me lead armies south on campaign a good many times the fox answered they know we wont rob them or take any woman who doesnt want to be taken doesna seem right the trokm chieftain said if they dinna fear you how can you rule them oh they fear meif they get out of line they know ill make them sorry for it gerin said but they dont fear that well steal or rape for the amusement of it the idea is to make them feel safer with me over them than with anyone else they might think of adiatunnus walked off shaking his head as the sun neared the horizon tiwazs waxing gibbous disk halfway between first quarter and full grew brighter golden math a day before full crawled over the eastern horizon ruddy elleb and pale nothos were not in the sky both a little past third quarter they would rise not long after midnight just before sunset gerins men dug several short narrow trenches on the outskirts of their encampment they wrung off the chickens heads and cut the throats of the other animals theyd got from the peasants letting the blood spill into the trenches an offering for the night ghosts that might otherwise have driven them mad the ghosts came forth as soon as the sun disappeared from the sky gerin had been trying all his life to grasp their shape trying and failing nor could he understand their cries which dinned in his mind grateful for the boon of blood they tried to give him good advice but he perceived it only as wind and noise ive heard em howl worse van remarked i was thinking the same thing gerin said weve fed em well and weve got goodsized fires going to hold em away from us a bit but ive heard em a lot louder and more frightening than they are now i know what part of the answer is or i think i do van grunted ive seen it myself around your keep and in the village close by its that ferdulf isnt it i think so gerin said with a sigh the ghosts are just ghostsspirits that never found their way into the five hells theyre stronger than we arestronger in the nighttime anyhowbecause they havent got any bodies to worry about but stack them up against a demigod and they know theyd better walkuh flittersmall belike youre right van made a fist and smacked it into his open palm but i tell you this captain theres been plenty of times i wanted to slaughter the nasty little bugger no matter whose son he is heh gerin said and then you know i dont set much stock in being king not among friends i dont this time though im going to claim my rank if anybody tries killing him itll be me first wait till after weve fought aragis van said well yes that thought crossed my mind too the fox admitted i do wonder why ferdulf decided to come along though what worries me is that he is half a god the wrong half van put in the wrong god too come to that maybe but what does he know that i dont and how does he know it the outlanders jaw worked as if he truly were chewing that over and as if he didnt like the taste of the answer he got he spat on the grass bah he said best i can tell you is were all liable to be better off if we never find out cant argue with you there gerin said but my guess is were going to find out one way or the other i dare hope ferdulf is here so that if we do need some strange sort of help against aragis hell be able to give it to us aye van said i hope that too and if were wrong and hes along to let aragis have some help against us hell give it to us then too right up the yes i know i understand that gerin broke in hastily its the chance we take thats all ive taken a lot of chances these past twenty years and more whats another the one that kills you could be van said well yes the fox shrugged there is that iii every time a chariot came up the elabon way from the south gerin tensed wondering whether this would be the one that brought him word aragis had swarmed over the border into balsers holdingor whether aragis had swarmed over the border in some other place altogether in which case he would have to change his line of march in a hurry but no such news came on the fifth day after setting out from fox keep the army reached the castle from which gerins son duren ruled his holding the pace was slower than the fox would have liked but an army on the march of necessity moved no faster than its slowest parts holding the keep by descent from his grandfather as duren did he maintained full formal independence from gerin gerin had asked his eldest sons leave before entering his barony at the head of a fighting force he would have been astonished and dismayed had duren refused him that leave but duren did nothing of the sort the border guards he still maintained at the frontier between his holding and the lands over which the fox was suzerain stood aside as the warriors came past them their eyes got wide when they saw how many men gerin had with him gerin could not see the eyes of the sentry on the wall of durens keep but he would have bet they were wide too the fellows voice sounded more than a little awestruck as he hallooed who comes to the castle of duren ricolfs grandson he knew perfectly well who came but the forms had to be observed a great many men gerin had seen over the years got very upset when jolted out of the smooth routine of their everyday lives and so as if he were an unexpected arrival he answered i am gerin the fox king of the north come to guest with my son duren ricolfs grandson he didnt blame duren for using ricolfs name after his own on the contrary he found it a clever touch enter lord king and be welcome as lord durens guestfriend and as his father the sentry replied the drawbridge to the keep was already down with his holding altogether surrounded by the foxs lands duren feared no sudden assault gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder durens half brother drove the chariot across the drawbridge over the moat and into the keep duren was waiting in the courtyard as gerin had been sure he would be coming into this keep gerin saw ghosts that had nothing to do with the ones that came forth when the sun went down ricolf the red and elise and his own younger self he saw durens younger self too coming here at about the age dagref had now to claim this barony and make it his own that over these past five years duren had done he was nineteen now and looked enough like a young version of the fox to make gerin wonder for a crazy instant if he hadnt somehow slipped back across the years to his own early days oh duren was a little fairer a little stockier but the biggest difference between him now and his father at the same age was that his face held not the slightest trace of dreaminess gerin had been a second son able to afford such luxuries as thinking about whatever he chose with five years as a baron already under his belt duren worried about essentials first and everything else afterwards that did not mean he wasnt smiling good to see you father by dyaus and all the gods he said his voice deeper than gerins he folded the fox into a bear hug when gerin got down from the car then he nodded to dagref who still held the reins youve got him learning the trade i see same as you did with me at the same age how does it feel dagref his half brother weighed that with deliberation hed probably got from selatre too much to do not enough time to do it in he answered probably would be more if i were better at what i did you will be duren told him then turned back to gerin hes shaping well seems like he spoke thoughtfully in a way gerin hadnt heard from him before the fox knew what that meant the succession was in his mind well he would have been a fool if it werent the awkward moment passed quickly duren went on mothers well i trust he meant selatre he knew she hadnt birthed him of course but she was the only mother he remembered he hadnt been weaned long when elise ran off with the horseleech yes shes fine the fox said nodding clotild and blestar too and my pair as well said van who had got down to stand beside gerin and beam at the young man who was as near his nephew as made no difference youve grown up that you have beards thicker than mine was at the same age id say its darker duren said judiciously so it will look thicker than a yellow one like yours come into the great hall drink some ale with me so youre finally going to war with aragis are you father no gerin said hes going to war with me or he says he is marlanz rawmeat told me hed stopped here so youll have heard aragis side of the story he frightened balser into going over to me and now hell try to punish balser and me both hes welcome to try coming back from your keep marlanz didnt seem very happy duren said good gerin said he shouldnt be happy neither should aragis the archer is strong and tough and dangerous he can pick his time and his spot to start the war and once hes done that i aim to lick him im sure you will duren saidas usual more confident than the fox himself what help do you want with me if your vassals will send a few chariots south with the rest of the army that would be fine gerin answered if they dont want to do that though im not going to lose any sleep over it they dont love me some of them and they can say its not their fight do you want me to go myself duren asked as i say i wont turn you down but i dont see any great need for it either gerin said he nodded toward dagref you said it yourself its your brothers turn to learn the trade you already know yes duren didnt say anything more his eyes narrowed gerins mouth tightened things would never be the same for duren and dagref theyd be watching each otherand watching himtill the day he died after that regardless of the provisions hed made they were liable to square off against each other for that matter if gerin lived long enough blestar was liable to square off against both of them duren said ill feast your leaders tonight will you be swinging off the elabon way and heading over to ikos to find out what biton has to say about the fight against aragis i hadnt planned to no gerin said when the sibyl speaks the prophetic verses they usually stay obscure until after the fact and even when they arent obscure some people will try to make them so you ought to know that for yourself oh i do duren said my loving vassals doing everything they could to keep from admitting the god had said i was meant to be baron of this holding after all he snorted theyve got used to the idea by nowor if they havent they keep quiet about it that will do gerin said it will have to do you cant control how they think only what they doand only so much of that he raised an eyebrow a feast eh what does your steward have to say about that he says it will cost too much duren answered as best i can tell thats what stewards always say the fox laughed and nodded he ate bread and honey and smoking beef ribs and berry tarts in the great hall a little later and washed them down with ale as he ate and drank he thought of other longago feasts hed had in this place rihwin the fox sat across the table from him hed feasted here too when he was courting elise with a mischievous grin he asked shall i dance for you lord king go howl gerin exclaimed if rihwin hadnt got drunk and danced an obscene dance ricolf the red would have wed elise to him and then gerin didnt know and then what the world would have been vastly different for him he did know that the chamber duren gave him for the night was only a couple of doors down from the one in which hed slept twentyone years before the one in which elise had begged him to help her escape from a marriage to wolfar of the axe a marriage that most sensibly she did not want before too long shed been wed to the fox which also turned out to be a marriage she did not want duren couldnt have known where his father had stayed on that earlier visit gerin had no intention of ever telling him van had been in the next room then he was in the next room now hed brought a serving girl in there then hed brought a serving girl in there now the walls were thin gerin had no doubts hed been unattached then he was married to fand now gerin hoped he wouldnt bring her back an itemized list of his infidelities on campaign as hed been known to do life was hard enough already the outlander didnt have the stamina hed enjoyed two decades before quiet returned now sooner than it had then gerin took advantage of the quiet to go to sleep he woke up in the middle of the night in the next room van was snoring so was the girl they kept gerin awake almost effectively as they would have making love after a while he did drift off again he woke the next morning with a headache that wasnt quite a hangover a jack of ale and some bread and honey made it retreat if not disappear van washed raw cabbage down with his ale suggesting he had more morning pain than gerin did seeing the fox watching him he grinned and said i keep reminding myself what a good time i had last night last night i kept reminding myself how miserable id be today if i let myself drink too deep the fox felt smugly virtuous for feeling as good as he did theres the difference between us all right van said i had the good time and ill take the bad that goes with it you miss the bad aye but you miss the good too sometimes some people like mountains and valleys gerin replied some people like flatlands better me im one of them besides i dont really want any woman but selatremm not enough to do anything about it anyhow and he added with considerable dignity i dont snore honh van said thats what you think when adiatunnus didnt come out for breakfast as soon as gerin thought he should the fox asked duren to send a servant to pound on his door adiatunnus duly emerged looking much worse for wear than van did you see son gerin said to duren he was slow getting up when we campaigned against the gradi and he still is im not slow fox darling the trokm said in the cautious tones of a man who does not want to hear himself talk too loud what i am is dead be after having some respect for the corp of me he shuddered at the first taste of ale but looked more lifelike after hed downed a couple of jacks since you may not have to bury him in the courtyard after all gerin said to his son drawing a glare from adiatunnus well be off soon i dont know fox van said remember the rest of the woodsrunners are liable to be as sleepy as this one is we may not be out of here for two or three days and to the corbies with you as well adiatunnus said remind me once more were allies so i dont go cutting your throat from the sheer high spirits of it you and which army van returned politely they were just warming to the debate and still on this side of sword and axe and mace and spear when gerin said slaughter each other some other time if you must but remember for now that we have to take on aragis first sure and its all the fun out of life youre stealing adiatunnus said and van rumbled agreement the two of them united quite happily in complaining about the fox till the army left durens keep and headed off to the south balser debos sons driver brought his chariot up alongside the foxs now were getting close to my lands balser said better country if youll forgive my saying so than what youve got up around your own keep maybe gerin answered the timbers a little differentyouve got more elms and beeches and such down here not so many pines and your peasants can plant a few days earlier in spring and wont have to worry about frost quite so soon in the fall better country as i said balser sounded smug maybe gerin said or better some ways might be a truer way to put it youll grow a few things we dont but the elabon way here has gone back to gravel because peasants and local lords plundered the stone paving when there was nobody around to tell em they couldnt or shouldnt as if to prove his point gravel kicked up from one of the wheels to balsers chariot and hit him in the hand he grunted wasnt even gravel here when this land first came under my suzerainty balser coughed well lord king the way that works is you do what you think you have to do for the moment and let later on take care of itself gerin knew what that meant it meant balser and his vassalsand his serfs too if they thought they could get away with ithad been plundering the elabon way in his holding for building stone whenever they needed it he wouldnt do anything about that not when it had happened before balser was his subject he did say no more pulling up paving stone thats all over now if the road werent here balser we wouldnt be able to get to your holding fast enough to do you any good about aragis i suppose not balser plainly hadnt looked at it in that light before just as plainly he didnt care either i mean it the fox said this is part of what you bought when you gave me homage and fealty the elabon way is the one good thing the empire left behind when it pulled back from the northern lands ive done everything i could to keep it in good shape its turning into the backbone for my own kingdom well yes i have seen that you care about it balser admitted its only a road though after all he and gerin looked at each other with complete mutual incomprehension youll have to get used to some new ways of doing things now that you are my vassal gerin said and let it go at that yes lord king balser didnt sound dutiful he sounded resigned the fox had no doubt about what he was thinking something on the order of how many of those new ways of doing things will i really have to get used to and how many will i be able to ignore every one of his new vassals had thoughts like that after a while theyor most of them anyhowgot the idea that the new waysor most of them anyhowworked pretty well when gerin had come by this road years before on his way down to the city of elabon with elise and van hed thought the barons here well away from the river niffet were soft they hadnt trimmed the brush back from the road as well as they should they hadnt kept their castles in good repair theyd half forgotten they were supposed to be fighting men the past twenty years and more had changed that the trokm invasion the eruption of the monsters from under bitons shrine and endless rounds of strife among the elabonians themselves meant barons who werent alert didnt live long the ones who did live made sure no one ever got the chance to take them by surprise still no move from aragis gerin said when they made camp that evening thats not like him hes never been one to bluff and then back down if he says hell do something he does it hes a bastard but a reliable bastard not far away an elabonian fell on his face as if hed tripped over a stone in the grass but there were no stones in the grass the meadow was as smooth as an ornamental lawn in front of a high functionarys residence in the city of elabon ferdulf giggled gerin scowled van said ithe does tempt you to find out just how nearly immortal he really is compose yourself lord king rihwin said could it not be that by mere rumor of his presence the demigod intimidates and inhibits aragis the archer from trying conclusions with you remembering how thoughtful ferdulf had made marlanz rawmeat gerin had to nod ferdulf certainly intimidates and inhibits me he said it would be nice if he did it to everyone else van looked around to see if balser debos son was in earshot not spotting him the outlander chuckled and said balsers going to be mighty unhappy if you bring this army down to his holding eat every storeroom he has empty lay tight hold on the land that was his and then dont even have to do any fighting myself i wouldnt mind that a bit gerin replied fighting is wasteful but youre right balser became my vassal so i could protect him if he doesnt need protecting but had he not come to you for protection aragis could have swallowed him at his leisure rihwin pointed out thats so van agreed but he wont think about it hell think he never should have come to the fox at all if wheat and barley were as thin on the ground as thankfulness wed all go hungry most of the time and thats a fact gerin said still and all the crop does grow adiatunnus told me one of the reasons he set out on this campaign with me instead of revolting being a trokm hes revolting almost by definition rihwin broke in you keep quiet gerin told him which aimed at rihwin was good advice almost by definition as i was saying or trying to say one of the reasons he set out on this campaign was that he was grateful id gone to his aid against the gradi five years ago aye that was one van said the other if i recall was a nasty hunch youd turn around and kick him in the ballocks if he tried stabbing you in the back i never claimed gratitude was the only reason he chose to bring his men along with ours just that it was a reason gerin said he started to elaborate but both his old friends were laughing too hard to pay any attention to him after a moment he gave up and started laughing himself they reached balsers keep the next morning eight days after setting out from fox keep math and tiwaz floated in the sunpale sky the one at the third quarter the other a waning crescent not far from the suns skirts seeing the keep still undisturbed balser who was riding at the head of the army with gerin let out a sigh of relief we wont have to try to take it back from aragis the gods be praised he said i hadnt thought we would gerin said the countryside maybe but not the keep he hasnt had anywhere near the time hed need to starve it out and storming a castle is expensive even if you win if you lose trying it is likely to ruin you he looked east then west if aragis the archer hadnt come charging straight into balsers holding hed probably gone and hit the fox somewhere else along their border with the news not having reached him yet try as he would gerin couldnt make himself believe aragis really would stay quiet after giving such a blunt warning that he would go to war if gerin accepted balsers vassalage a look at balsers keep suggested why aragis might have thought it wise to launch his attack somewhere else the keep perched atop of knob of high ground that the baron had scrupulously swept clear of all undergrowth above ankle high a kitten would have had trouble approaching unseen no man could have not even afoot strong place the fox observed your strong place now lord king balser said and you didnt even have to win it at war was that bitterness it might have been in balsers shoes gerin seeing peace and tranquillity in the holding would have been wondering whether he could have gone on playing his two bigger rivals off against each other instead of finally yielding to one of them balser had alert men in his keep they were on the walls and ready long before the army came into archery range nor did they assume it was friendly for no better reason than its coming from the north with aragis for a neighbor gerin would have been alert too the men on the wall raised a cheer when they recognized their overlord they raised another cheer when he told them gerins warriors had come to protect them from anything aragis might try to do the second cheer was not so lusty as the first perhaps they hadnt looked to be quite so thoroughly protected but at balsers shouted command they lowered the drawbridge and let the foxs forces into the keep as far as gerin was concerned that finally proved balsers good faith i am your vassal lord king balser said thinking along with him what is mine is yours and you have handsomely met your obligations to me gerin had no doubt met those obligations altogether too handsomely to suit balser whose holding now lay in his hands ill send some men down toward your frontier with aragis he said most of the army will camp outside here we wont pack the keep too full and well try not to eat up everything you own this is the business of the whole kingdom now not just of the lands you rule the whole kingdoms resources will help support it thank you lord king balser bowed that you say such a thing is why i would sooner be your vassal than aragis balsers men came out to help the foxs warriors deal with their horses and chariots they exclaimed to see so many men on horseback rihwins troop galloped over the flatlands and drew more exclamations and applause at the way they handled their animals afterwards gerin and van started to head up into balsers keep the fox looked around for dagref to bring him along too he spotted his son talking with one of the improbably young implausibly fuzzy riders the one hed noticed early in the marches as being both younger and fuzzier than anyone had any real business being dagref seemed to sense gerins eye on him he made a hasty farewell and hurried up to the fox in the great hall balser served up stewed trout and apple tarts and ale flavored with honey he introduced to the fox his wife a plump young woman named brinta shell be glad of what ive learned from you too lord king he said i do hope so gerin answered resolutely keeping his face straight no balser hadnt forgotten their talk on different ways of doing things just at that moment the dogs in the great hall who had been happy enough to root around in the rushes for scraps all seemed to decide at once that soldiers legs were the longlost objects of their affection the soldiers for some reason did not share that opinion a great racket of shouts and yelps erupted what on earth brinta said with a giggle gerin looked this way and that till he spotted ferdulf the little demigod was giggling too nastily catching his eye gerin shook his head ferdulf stuck out his tongue the fox sighed ferdulf had already worked his mischief nothing to be done about it a serving maid was sitting on vans lap gerin suspected shed be sitting on the outlanders lap again or in some other posture as soon as the two of them found some privacy and another serving girl was hovering over dagref and doing it so obviously that he couldnt help but notice she was older than he but not by a great deal and looked more friendly than calculating dagref himself looked interested and surprised at himself for being interested yes your body will surprise you gerin thought watching while seeming not to watch if dagref was going to discover just what his flesh could do gerin was as well pleased that he should do it away from fox keep with a woman he probably wouldnt see again she wouldnt want so much to put on airs for being his first and hed be less inclined to imagine himself in love with her for no better reason than discovering what she hid between her legs oh by the gods gerin murmured when i make calculations like that i know ive been a ruler a long time too bloody long maybe im sorry lord king balser said i didnt quite hear that it wasnt anything really the fox answered turning toward him only the fuzz that gathers if you dont dust your brains every now and then brinta laughed a little she understood what he was saying a frown slowly spread over balsers facehe didnt and then a moment later he did and enlightenment slowly replaced confusion he had by then drunk enough ale to keep him from doing anything in a hurry thats well put lord king he said i thank you gerin answered courtesy of any sort hed found was uncommon enough to deserve encouragement well put balser repeated his breath was enough to get a man drunk reminds me of a story that the story as he told it had not much point and went on for so long gerin wished he hadnt encouraged it when at last it ended he looked around the hall again van and his new friend had disappeared gerin had expected nothing less he wondered what fand was doing back in fox keep and with whom when this campaign was over hed probably find out in alarming detail and dagref and the young serving girl were gone too gerin stared down at the table his son would be different when the sun rose tomorrow in ways he didnt yet suspect being dagref he was liable to be different in ways gerin didnt yet suspect too he still hadnt said what he wanted from gerin as a forfeit for making ferdulf keep quiet with some people the fox might have taken that to mean hed forgotten about it as far as he could tell though dagref never forgot about anything gerin realized hed been woolgathering when he looked up again and discovered balser and brinta had gone off to bed without his noticing he poured down the ale left in his drinking jack the woman who refilled it said lord king if youre weary ill take you up to your bedchamber now maybe hed been doing more than woolgathering there maybe hed been dozing he picked up the jack and said maybe thats a good idea lord balser has put you in the chamber next to his own she said up these stairs here down this hallas she spoke she guided him and its this door right here she worked the latch a lamp was already burning on a stool set by the bed she hesitated then asked lord king do you want me to go in with you what gerin said and then felt foolish the young woman had made what perfectly plain the fox smiled a lopsided smile my thanks thats kind of you but no i dont forget i have a wife when im away from home he waited to see how she would take that hed had such offers a good many times when he said no as he habitually did about half the time he ended up offending the woman whose company hed declined some people fondly imagined they were irresistible and that their beauty could move even a king had he been half his age a lot of them probably would have been right this time though the serving girl just shrugged and nodded however you like lord king sleep well then she went back toward the stairway not even waggling her rump to show him what hed be missing he went into the bedchamber took off his sandals and stripped down to his undertunic and drawers after hed used the chamber pot he lay down on the bed and blew out the lamp he didnt go to sleep right away the walls here were no thicker than those at durens keep and the noises from the chamber next door distracting by the sound of things balser was intent on trying out every variation on an ancient theme about which hed learned in fox keep and by the sound of things brinta also found the experiments interesting for a little while listening to them amused the fox after that he just wished theyd shut up so he could doze off he tried not to listen to them which was like trying not to think about the color red the more he tried the more he failed finally about the time when he should have got thoroughly annoyed he fell asleep instead his first thought on waking up to early morning sunshine was to wonder if balser and brinta would be at it again his new vassal was a young man but things next door were quiet either balser had worn himself out or hed already gone downstairs the fox splashed water from a basin onto his face got into his clothes and went downstairs himself balser was sitting in the great hall drinking ale and looking absurdly pleased with himself a couple of tables over sat van who was also drinking ale and looking absurdly pleased with himself and a couple of tables over from him sat dagref who was drinking ale and looking thoughtfulbut a long way from displeased with himself gerin started to go over to him then decided that wasnt the best idea hed ever had if dagref thought he was prying he not only wouldnt get anywhere his son would also be more inclined to hide things later so the fox remembered from his own youth anyhow he called for ale and he called for a couple of apple tarts and he made a point of not looking in dagrefs direction while he ate and drank after a little while dagref got up and came over to him good morning son the fox said concealing the pride he took in the success of his restraint good morning father dagref answered and seemed at a loss how to go on from there gerin hadnt asked if hed slept well against which he could have reactedone way or another after a moment the youth brightened could you break me off half of that tart please certainly gerin said and did he kept on eating his own breakfast when he spoke again it was of business well probably pass today here too tomorrow ill send men down along balsers border with aragis to show the archer we are here and we do intend to protect this holding that sounds good enough dagref had no trouble talking about things that would happen away from the keep its not as if weve tricked aragis in any way we let him know what we were going to do before we did it he has no proper cause for complaint i can see ha the fox said just because you cant see it doesnt mean aragis cant see it but in justice dagref began in his most didactic tones then his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth that startled his father who had seen him in a great many states but confusion seldom among them gerins gaze followed dagrefs and all grew clear coming out of the kitchen was the serving girl whod stayed close by dagref the night before exactly how close by him shed stayed gerin suspected he was about to find out the girl looked as if she hadnt had a whole lot of sleep but she was also of an age where she could get through a day without much sleep she also looked tousled and happy a look often harder to counterfeit than passion at the moment itself she came over to dagref and stood behind him of itself his hand found hers he sent gerin an alarmed look as if realizing hed given away the game he didnt realize hed given it away sometime earlier a little more slowly than he should have he also figured out he needed to say something father he announced this is rowitha hello rowitha the fox said gravely hello lord king she answered her hand tightened on dagrefs she found the moment almost as awkward as he did at last she managed your son hes very nice dagrefs face went as hot and red as the fire in the hearth i think so gerin said grave still im glad you do too id also say he nodded to dagref he thinks youre very nice yes dagref agreed with great fervor now he squeezed rowithas hand gerin hoped he wasnt going to decide he was in love with her dagref clung to his opinions as tenaciously as freshwater mussels clung to rocks that was fine when those opinions had some rational basis gerin didnt reckon bedding a woman for the first time any such rational basis convincing dagref it wasnt however was unlikely to be easy then he stopped worrying about how to deal with the beginnings of his sons love life for one of balsers men dashed into the great hall from the courtyard beyond crying lord king lord king aragis aragis the archer gerin sprang to his feet with an oath aragis has crossed over the border he demanded aye lord king balsers man replied balser and van were on their feet too and so was dagref rowitha for the moment forgotten hes here lord king what with his army gerin said by the gods is there fighting out there how did he get here with no word beforehand he looked around for his armor which hung on the wall not far from the fireplace and balsers man stunned him again saying no lord king as far as anyone on the wall can tell hes here by his lonesome down went the drawbridge as soon as it had thumped onto dry land on the other side of the moat aragis driver crossed over it and into balsers keep no hesitation gerin thought standing there in the courtyard with balser and dagref and van and some of his leading vassals but then aragis the archer seldom showed hesitation about anything which was one reason the fox wondered why they werent already at war without waiting for the chariot to stop aragis hopped out of it and strode briskly over to gerin he was a slim hawkfaced man of about the foxs age who leaned slightly forward as he walked as if he were a hunting dog following an exciting scent abruptly he stuck out a hand i greet you lord king he said as an obvious afterthought he nodded to balser baron i greet you lord king gerin said accepting the clasp aragis grip was firm and hard as it had been for as long as the fox had known him you dont mind my asking why arent we trying to kill each other right now dont worry i thought wed be doing just that by this time too aragis bared his teeth in what was as much snarl as smile i think id have won too but something more importants come up more important than which of us ends up ruling the northlands gerin said incredulously aragis head jerked up and down in a sharp emphatic nod gerin whistled softly under his breath a few times in his life hed been at the very edge of spreading news the outermost boundary between those who knew and those who didnt aragis plainly was such an outer ripple now the fox said youd better tell me then hadnt you aragis nodded again its not a question of which of us ends up ruling the northlands any more he said its a question of whether we can keep our heads on our shoulders by your five elabonian hells what are you talking about van boomed the empires come back to the northlands aragis answered for a few heartbeats that didnt mean anything to the fox save for memories of his student days down in the capital he hadnt thought much about the elabonian empire in the more than twenty years since it had closed itself off from its former northern province hed thought about it as little as he could get away with in the days before it had done so too he hadnt paid the tribute required of him because he hadnt got the protection the tribute was supposed to earn but if the empire had returned father dyaus he whispered thats the way of it all right aragis the archer agreed theyve cleared two of the passes through the high kirs and theyre sending soldiers through em i dont know what alls been happening down there these past years but it surely looks as though theyve got a lot of soldiers to send father dyaus gerin said again hed worried about aragis hed worried about adiatunnus and the trokmoi hed worried about the monsters from the caverns under bitons shrine at ikos hed worried about the gradi hed worried about ferdulf worrying about the empire of elabon long vanished from the northlands had never crossed his mind dagref spoke with his usual precision and accuracy something might perhaps be done against the empire if you two kings joined forces aragis turned his clear coldeyed gaze on dagref but spoke to his father saying no fools in your family are there fox this wouldnt be the lad who was kidnapped would it the one i got back for you from that cursed minstrel no thats duren his older half brother gerin answered this is dagref whom i present to you with the warning that youd better not ever be wrong in his presence or you will hear about it ah one of those aragis said and then paused the small grin hed put on slowly fading he gave dagref another long look mm no maybe not most of that kind think they know it all and turn out not to know a thing if this one says something hell have a good notion of what hes talking about youd have been the same way before your beard sprouted eh oh yes gerin answered putting an arm around his son who looked as if he could have done without the attention i was always sure in those days i wasnt always right mind you but i always thought i was dagref squirmed under the foxs arm let me be he said indignantly the only other way either one of you could come through this mess would be to ally with the empire against the other and how far do you suppose you could trust the imperials theyd use you and then sweep you aside both gerin and aragis stared at him then gerin was pretty sure he eventually would have reached that same conclusion himself but not with his sons effortless ease and ruthless clarity aragis made a sharp short bow to dagref he said i came here to propose alliance to your father you help me see i chose right i am in your debt dont let it worry you dagref said tranquilly my fathers in my debt too you didnt lose a bet to get there aragis turned a speculative eye on gerin dont ask me about that now the fox said more important things to think about as you say aragis the archer managed a thin smile still anyone who gets the better of you at anything needs careful watching shall we speak then of what needs doing against the empire balser debos son said use my great hall as your own lord kings of all the people in the courtyard he was the only one who sounded delighted at the news aragis had brought gerin had no trouble figuring out why it meant aragis and he wouldnt be fighting their war through balsers holding the noble might not even have to feed his new overlords large expensive army very long if the warriors headed south to fight against the elabonian empire theyd end up on aragis lands they want the land back aragis said after hed sat down and had a jack of ale pressed into his hand as far as theyre concerned its as if theyve never been away the one who came to my keep said i could stay onas baron mind you not as kingif i paid twentyone years worth of back tribute dyaus allfather gerin exclaimed did you let him live im afraid i did the archer sounded faintly embarrassed at the admission i wasnt ready to fight in the south theni had all my strength shifted north to go to war with you he spoke as if gerin should have expected nothing else since the fox had expected nothing else he only nodded aragis went on i just sent him out of my lands naked to let the empire have a clue as to how much it could ever expect to take away from me well done van boomed adiatunnus clapped his hands gerin admired aragis gesture too but probably would have handled the imperial envoy rather differently himself before he could decide whether to say as much dagref did it for him being less abrupt with the fellow might have proved more prudent dagref was still at the age where if something seemed obviously true to him he let the world know about it without troubling his head about things like tact i thought about that later aragis said after pausing to down his ale and hold out the jack for a refill he went on at the time all i thought about was that the arrogant bastard had angered me and so i was going to anger him right back by the gods are you fighting with the imperials down on the southern border of your kingdom then gerin asked aragis shook his head theyre holding some of the territory thats rightfully mine the whoresons i dont know whether you know it or not but these days i rule almost down to the foothills of the high kirs again his smile was one that a wolf might have offered easier pushing south against the odds and sods there than coming north against you fox good gerin gave back that same display of teeth aragis concern about him was the only thing that had kept them from clashing years before so you want my help against the empire do you its your neck too aragis answered steadily if they beat me by myself do you think theyll stop at the northern border to my realm and if they look like beating me do you think i wouldnt go over to them as your boy says and save what i can by helping them smash you flat no and no respectively the fox admitted aragis gave him that fierce smile again he sighed equal allies as we were against the monsters fifteen years ago aragis nodded as if that went without saying from his perspective no doubt it did gerin might have tried extorting more from him since he was the one more threatened but didnt bother aragis had a notoriously long memory for slights thinking as much gerin realized that while he intimidated aragis aragis also intimidated him adiatunnus realized the same thing at the same time youre giving him better terms than ever you offered me the trokm said indignantly youve been my vassal the past fifteen years and of your own free will too gerin retorted of course you spent a lot of that time forgetting it of your own free will but that doesnt make it any less so adiatunnus didnt look any less aggrieved either too bad for him the fox thought aragis the archer coughed theres one thing more he said gerin didnt care for his tone of course gerin hadnt care for his tone since hed come into the courtyard or for any of the news hed delivered wondering what he was saving for last the fox asked and that is theyve got wizards with em aragis answered glumly real wizards i mean trained in that sorcerers whatchamacallit of theirs down in the city of elabon collegium gerin said and aragis nodded hed forgotten the unfamiliar term well isnt that jolly gerin went on i dont think theres a single sorcerer like that in all the northlands and theyll have more than one along sure as sure thank you my friend i didnt think i could feel any worse now i find im wrong theyll know what theyre doing tooreally know every spell hed tried hed tried knowing he was liable to make a horrid botch of it he needed a couple of heartbeats to recognize the expression on aragis face for one thing it didnt sit well there aragis had for years molded his features to project harsh certainty and very little else for another he hadnt thought the archer granted him so much respect in this particular area but aragis said another reason i want you with me fox is the skill youve shown as a mage since the days of the werenight you havent got any idea what youre talking about gerin said his voice not far from a groan aragis went on as if he hadnt spoken and when marlanz rawmeat came back from your keep he told me you had a gods son living in the village close by if we have a gods son with us even those cursed imperials will have to sit up and take notice the archer grew eager did thisfergulf was that his name come south with you to campaign against me can we use him against the empire ferdulf gerin corrected absently yes he came along he didnt come to campaign against you so much i dont think he said he came because fox keep would be boring once the army left aragis looked blank gerin sighed looking around balsers great hall he didnt see mavrixs annoying son he turned to dagref go track down ferdulf would you please my fellow king here had better get a good idea of what hes pinning his hopes on dagref took a deep breath as if about to argue he didnt want to miss a single word of what passed between his father and aragis the archer seeing gerins face though he sensibly decided arguing here wouldnt do him any good and would land him in trouble he got up with no more than a small grimace and hurried out into the courtyard he came back soon enough ferdulf at his sideand for a wonder walking on the ground ferdulf as the fox had seen to his own discomfiture got on with dagref better than he did with almost anyone else gerin wasnt sure what that said about his sons character and wasnt sure he wanted to find out either dagref pointed aragis out to ferdulf the demigod strode up to him inspected him and shook his head this is supposed to be another king he said aragis eyes widened when he heard the deep voice coming out of the small body ferdulf sniffed doesnt seem so much of a much to me his gaze swung toward gerin of course youre not so much of a much either im so glad i have your respect gerin said aragis stared from one of them to the other gerin already knew the archer tolerated much less in the way of back talk and disrespect from subjects than he did himself and now despite having heard about ferdulf despite having heard for himself that ferdulf was not the ordinary fouryearold his body made him out to be he made the mistake of treating him as if he were you boy he said as he might have to any serf who was your father again gerin could have told the archer hed just done something foolish before he got the chance ferdulf demonstrated it as usual showing proved more effective than telling ferdulf walked over to aragis then he walked up aragis legs treating their vertical as a horizontal then he walked across aragis lap and then he walked up aragis chest treating that in the same fashion as he had the archers legs planting his feet on aragis collarbones he looked acrosseffectively downat his startled face my father man was the god mavrix of sithonia who was yours or didnt your mother know either aragis had courage not even his worst enemy would ever have denied that so now he heard only the insult and forgot a demigod had delivered it grabbing ferdulf by the ankles he tried to throw him away that didnt work ferdulf refused to be budged snarling an oath aragis sprang to his feet and grabbed for his sword everyone who was anywhere near him snatched at his arm to keep him from drawing the bronze blade enough gerin said sharply my judgment is that dishonors are even here what gives you the right to judge aragis and ferdulf said the same thing at the same time then glared at each other for having done so aragis ive put up with you since just after the werenight and you ferdulf ive put up with you for as long as youve been aroundit only seems like forever gerin said if i havent got the right to judge who does no one again demigod and king spoke together again they glared at each other neither was fond of the fox each was fonder of him than of the other get off king aragis ferdulf dagref urged standing on him like that wont do any good it does me plenty of good ferdulf said but he took a step off aragis chest into midair then drifted to the ground like a chunk of thistledown aragis rubbed at his collarbones he must have felt the weight of the demigod on him ferdulf you havent got much use for elabonians have you gerin asked a question whose answer seemed obvious would you were you i ferdulf returned rolling his eyes oh i dont know gerin spoke musingly now after all youre half elabonian yourself all the more reason to despise that half the demigod said without it id be altogether divine without it you wouldnt be here at all gerin thought but he didnt bother mentioning that instead he said well from what king aragis here tells me the empire of elabon is coming the emperor wants to make this part of the world do as he says when hes down in the city of elabon he wants to make this part of the world obey him the same way that sithonia has to obey him even after more than four years he didnt know just how much instruction mavrix had given ferdulf about sithonia or how much knowledge of his fathers homeland ferdulf had inherited or whatever the process was by which ferdulf knew what he knew he did know ferdulf knew enormously more than any purely human fouryearold had any business knowing would that be enough he could but hope ferdulf had disappointed his hopes a good many times and blasted them a few more this time he lived up to them the elabonian empire will never do to this land what its overmuscled morons have done in and with and to fair sithonia the little demigod cried his big voice echoing back from the roof beams of the great hall it shall not come to pass i shall not permit it aragis started to say something gerin caught the archers eye and shook his head ever so slightly for a wonder aragis listened to someone other than himself he kept quiet i shall destroy the elabonians root and branch i shall smite them hip and thigh ferdulf thundered some of balsers men broke into applause aragis the archer looked as if he was about to join them gerin caught his eye once more the fox shook his head again a gesture even smaller than the first one as slightly aragis ever so erect shoulders slumped gerin was glad ferdulf wanted to take on the forces of the elabonian empire he didnt think mavrixs son would be able to beat them singlehanded elabon had ruled sithonia for hundreds of years no matter how much the sithonians looked down their noses at their overlords divided into quarreling citystates the sithonians also looked down their noses at one another their gods squabbled among themselves if all their men and all their gods hadnt been able to keep the elabonians out of sithonia one badtempered little demigod wasnt going to keep the empire out of the northlands not by himself he wasnt as long as he despised the elabonian empire more than he despised either gerin or aragis though having him along wouldnt hurt what are we waiting for ferdulf demanded the sooner we strike these bronzebound blockheads the sooner we send them scurrying back into the south when we fight let us give no quarter every once in a while when trying to work magic the fox had a spell succeed too well he hadnt worked magic here not in the strict sense of the word but got something of that feeling nonetheless what would happen if and when ferdulf discovered he couldnt beat the empire by himself would all his joy in trying disappear would he turn on gerin and aragis instead this once gerin wished he werent quite so good at coming up with unpleasant questions long before he had any answers for them aragis said are we allies against the empire then you and i and ferdulf here you and i are gerin said i already told you that having the empire on my border i like even less than having you on my border aragis showed his teeth again in that snarling smile the fox went on as for ferdulf he turned to the demigod will you join with us against the elabonian empire i am against the elabonian empire ferdulf said if you want to stand against it too you may join with me gerin remained of the opinion that one gods son no matter how arrogant was not going to prove a match for all the soldiers and if what aragis said was true all the mages of the empire of elabon but he did not feel like quibbling about definitions with ferdulf instead he held out his hand aragis clasped it a moment later the demigod set his warm little palm over both their hands gerin had made a good many unlikely alliances in his time this one struck him as being as improbable as any balser debos son looked mutinous by the gods lord king why should i furnish you with twenty chariot crews all the fighting you aim to do will be off my land thats not the point gerin might have borrowed his hard harrowing smile from aragis the archer the point is that you owned yourself my vassal true you did it because you wanted me to help protect you but that doesnt mean your obligations go away when the danger to your holding disappears i have the right to ask this of you and ask it i do its outrageous balser exclaimed why should i send my men off to fight farther south than theyd ever have any natural reason to go because if you dont theyre likelier to be fighting here sooner or later anyhow gerin answered the idea if we can bring it off is to beat the empire as far south as we can if we can do that the imperials may never get up here at all if all the fighting turned out to be in the south aragis lands would suffer far more than his own that might end up giving him a decisive edge on the archer so declared the calculating part of his mind that never slept i suppose my twenty men are going to make the difference between beating the imperials and losing to them balser said scornfully by themselves i doubt it or else were in worse trouble than i think gerin said but if you leave yours home and widin simrins son leaves his home and adiatunnus leaves his home you didnt much like the idea of adiatunnus leaving his men home when you thought aragis was going to land on you like a load of rocks did you balser had the decency to turn red all right i see what youre saying lord king bah to the five hells with me if i like it oh im just dancing with glee myself at the idea of taking on the elabonian empire dancing with bloody glee the fox did a few rather awkward steps balser stared at him kings were supposed to be serious even solemn people gerin didnt fit the bill he hadnt intended to be a king he hadnt intended to be a prince or a baron if he wasnt always what the world thought he was supposed to be that was the worlds hard luck but he wasnt always a funny man either one more thing for you to think about he told balser how many men do i have on your lands right now that got through to his new and now reluctant vassal balser looked as if hed bitten into a pear about three days after it should have been tossed into a swill bucket for the pigs lord king when i became your vassal you promised youd respect my rights he said reproachfully so i did gerin agreed and when you became my vassal you promised youd live up to your duties this is one of them i am within my rights to ask it of you you are not within your rights to refuse it to me plainly balser debos son did not agree as plainly he couldnt do anything about it very well he spat out the words one by one twenty chariots and their crews to go with you when you leave my land i do thank you for them the fox said they will help and theres one other thing you need to remember the sooner you furnish them to me the sooner we will be able to leave your land and the sooner we stop eating your storerooms empty ah balser said i was wondering if youd be able to come up with a reason for me to give you the crews and cars in a hurry you have by the gods i thought that might be so gerin said balser sighed get caught up in the quarrels of neighbors bigger than you are and you find they make you do things and then expect you to like it i dont expect you to like it gerin told him i do hope youll see the need he got a shrug from balser which was about as much as hed thought the baron would give him then he shrugged too the elabonian empire was forcing him into a position not far from the one in which hed put balser he hoped hed have better luck than balser getting out of it aragis the archer studied gerins assembled forces ill tell you this much fox he said im gladder to have you with me than i would have been fighting you youve got more men here than i thought you could raise ive never picked a quarrel with you gerin answered i wasnt picking a quarrel with you over balsers holding either however you chose to take it but i wasnt going to back away either leave that aside since im not such a fool as to call my ally a liar aragis said which let him call the fox a liar even as he said he was doing no such thing youve put a lot of men on horseback here too you always were one to try things no one would have looked for maybe gerin raised an eyebrow you came here all by your lonesome and you say i do things nobody would look for what would have kept me from dropping you off balsers wall on your head aragis shrugged i counted on your good sense biggest worry i had was that some of your troopers would do me in before i got the chance to tell you what the empire was up to but your men are well disciplined toomaybe not quite so tight as mine but well enough your idea of discipline is to make your men fear you worse than any foe the fox said well of course aragis said as if surprised gerin contemplated discipline of any other sort its worked too tell me it hasnt gerin couldnt tell him that whether it would work for aragis successor was a different question maybe aragis didnt care maybe he thought one of his sons was as fierce as hean alarming idea if ever there was one my way works too gerin said and aragis could not deny that the fox went on well seeor our sons will see or our grandsonswhose way ends up working better by way of reply aragis only grunted gerin hadnt expected much more from him other times hed talked with aragis about anything further away than the immediate future hed got only incomprehension in return within aragis range of vision he was most effective beyond it he didnt seem to see at all how determined did the imperials seem to be about taking back the northlands the fox asked aragis if we give them one set of lumps or maybe two will they go back over the high kirs and leave us alone or do you think theyll keep coming after us no matter what we do i dont know the answer to that aragis answered i do know one thing if we dont give them a set of lumps weve lost the cursed fight he paused as if waiting for gerin to disagree with him when gerin didnt say anything the archer picked up again theyre every bit as arrogant as i remember them being and thats saying a lot so it is gerin agreed down in the city of elabon theyd look down their noses at you for wearing trousers instead of robes and for coming straight out and saying what you mean instead of talking all around it from four different directions at once he looked up at the sound of hoofbeats and a good day to you rihwin what can i do for you atop his horse the noble from the city of elabon tossed his head in anger more assumed than real i heard that last remark of yours lord king and i desire you to know that it filled my heart with resentment that i reject it as a slanderous and scurrilous assault on my former homeland that it bears not even the slightest relation to truth of any sort and that furthermore your syntax in framing the said remark being both slipshod and leaden causes me to prove the point of everything i was saying gerin suggested oh i am wounded wounded rihwin cried clapping a hand over his heart gerin snorted by the expression on aragis face he wouldnt have put up with rihwins flamboyant nonsense for a moment there were times when gerin wondered why he put up with his fellow foxs nonsense himself but over years rihwin hadnarrowlyconvinced him he was worth keeping around and then his friend did his best to unconvince him rihwins face took on a look almost of transfiguration in soft reverent tones he said with the empire returned to the northlands once more surely commerce between us and the longsundered south will soon revive as soon as rihwin spoke of commerce gerin knew what he had in mind gerin would have liked to see commerce revived too commerce in books and fine cloth and other such luxuries the northlands had trouble producing for itself rihwin however would be thinking of only one such luxury you dont mean commerce what you mean is wine and wherefore i pray you should i not rihwin demanded for one thing you get into trouble when you drink wine gerin answered you get into trouble when you drink ale too but you get into worse trouble when you drink wine for another with wine comes mavrix lord of the sweet grape do you truly want more dealings with him that did give rihwin pause the first time hed ever invoked mavrix just before the werenight the sithonian god had permanently taken away his ability to work magic their meetings since had not been marked with any great warmth either mavrix disliked and distrusted not only gerin but also anyone who had anything to do with him but rihwin was made of stern stuffeither that or he had a marvelously selective memory he said it should be all right lord king and for the chance to taste wine once more what risk could be too great he struck a melodramatic pose on horseback i like wine well enough aragis said but ale suits me he stuck out his chin and folded his arms across his chest in a different sort of melodrama the pantomime of demanding obedience as gerin could have told him getting obedience out of rihwin the fox was an uphill fight loftily rihwin observed some people are of the opinion that for no better reason than somethings suiting them it should suit everyone a proposition easily demonstrated to be fallacious aragis blinked gerin watched him sort through rihwins sentence a clause at a time he watched him scowl when he got to the end of it some people aragis rumbled are of the opinion that anyone else cares about their opinions to the extent of dumping a pisspot yes some people are rihwin agreed he and aragis glared at each other gerin would have bet the two of them were likely to rub each other the wrong way when he made bets of that sort he usually proved right when he bet something would go well on the other hand he was wrong dishearteningly often that afternoon his army reached the border between balsers holding and the lands aragis the archer ruled the border guards cheered kick aragis the arrogants arse one of them shouted the rest offered even more creative advice they all cheered gerin aragis tapped his driver on the shoulder his chariot broke out of the swarm and rattled over to the border station one of the guards recognized him and went from jeering to whitefaced and shaky in the space of a heartbeat at his whispered comment the other warriors shut up one by one i thought i would give you the chance to say to my face what you say to my back aragis told them i see you have not the belly for it this surprises me not at all at his order his driver took him back up alongside gerin that took nerve the fox said in his own coldblooded way aragis had style the archer shrugged most men are dogs they yap loud enough when nothing bigger and fiercer is around when challenged though they sniff your backside and then roll over use them as men and youll find them likelier to behave as men gerin said aragis shook his head they rode on in silence after that gerin would have been happier had he been more nearly certain he was right and his royal rival wrong iv gerin had not been down in the lands over which aragis the archer ruled for more than twenty years for some time hed been busy far closer to fox keep then after his attention reached so far south the only way he could have come was at the head of an invading army here he was at the head of an army but to what would have been his astonishment up until a couple of days before he wasnt invading before the empire of elabon withdrew beyond the high kirs the lands closer to the mountains had been more nearly a true part of the empire than the raw frontier up by the river niffet some of the villages hereabouts had almost deserved to be called towns close by the elabon way especially trade had flourished it was in fact the condition to which the fox aspired to lift his own holdings and aragis who had such splendid underpinnings for his kingdom was letting them slip maybe gerin remembered these lands as having been more prosperous than they really were because hed been so much younger the last time hed been through them but he didnt think so he hadnt been so young as all that he could see signs of change too and not for the better several villages had buildings standing emptynot just houses but smithies and potters works and taverns as well some had fallen down into rubble some were being torn down to patch other buildings still in use and only weeds and bushes grew in the blank spaces between houses where others had presumably stood some fields werent being cultivated either in them scruffy wheat and barley fought what was going to be a losing fight against brambles and saplings and plain ordinary grass you dont seem to have quite so many people as you did gerin remarked to aragis sounding as casual as he could just have to make sure the ones who are left work harder to take up the slack past that aragis was indifferent gerin wanted to grab him by the front of the tunic lift him into the air and shake some sense into him what are you doing you fool he wanted to shout dont you see that if this goes on a while longer the peasants you have left wont be able to feed all your warriors then it wont matter how strong your armies are or would be because you wont be able to keep them in the field aragis wouldnt listen aragis wouldnt have the vaguest idea what he was talking about aragis would get angry knowing all that gerin walked away instead of screaming at him van followed the fox if you could have seen the look on your face there when the archer said so what the outlander began if he saw it he didnt know what it meant gerin kicked at the dirt if he had known what it meant he wouldnt have let this happen to his lands in the first place gerin kicked again i wouldnt have had to fight him in another few years all this would have fallen under its own weight maybe van said or maybe if he heard the creaking he would have fought you if he won hed have your lands to ruin over the next twenty years even if he lost he wouldnt have so many fighters to feed gerin studied him thats a coldblooded way of looking at things its more the way id look at them than how id expect you to and whos been living beside you in fox keep these twenty years and more van returned he shook his head i wouldnt have thought that way when i first came there not when i swam the niffet with the trokmoi shooting arrows at me till i got out of range id spent so many years wandering i didnt expect id ever put down roots his head went back and forth again never would have thought id stay attached to the same woman so long either you dont let that worry you not when youre off someplace where fand cant see what youre up to and so what van said if i get the itch by the gods i scratch it his chuckle was mordant and if i didnt id get no credit for holding back one campaign we fought over in the southwest years ago this was i kept my prong in my breeches the whole time and when i got back to castle fox i said as much to my lady love what happened do you remember what happened fox sorry gerin answered you and fand have had enough dustups that that one doesnt stick in my mind no eh well it does in mine she thought i was lying is what she thought that put more fire under her cookpot than she gets when i tell her about all the pretty girls i rumple so i ask you what am i supposed to do i dont know the fox said as far as he could see van and fand quarreled as much because they enjoyed quarreling as because they really had anything about which to quarrel hed suggested as much to the outlander once or twice van had agreed with him which was alarming and had done exactly nothing to change his ways which gerin found even more alarming dagref trotted by on horseback he waved to the fox and to van loping along beside the horse barely visible over the beasts back was the fuzzybearded youngster gerin had noticed once or twice before as the army moved south he didnt wave has to be from some keep out in the middle of nowhere gerin thought the kings son isnt far from his own age so he can be easy with him but with the king and his old friendno van said one of these days before long kor will be coming with us when we go to war too wont be long not the way time goes by now youre right about that gerin said hell be something to watch out for on the battlefield too that he will van said proudly my size or most of it and fands temper or worse i tell you the truth the gods had better help anybody fool enough to stand in his way by the time hes seventeen and if maeva were a lad id have two grand warriors to leave behind me when i go he scratched his chin i wonder how many brats ive got that i dont know the first thing about a few i shouldnt wonder but ive never been like rihwin ready to keep track of em all rihwins almost as good at keeping track of his bastards as carlun is at keeping track of beans gerin agreed he spotted his fellow fox not far away and raised his voice a little the only thing rihwin cant keep track of is rihwin are you speaking to me or of me or against me rihwin asked in sooth i was but enjoying a vision a memory of days long past and nights as well nights spent in the pursuit of knowledge nights spent comparing the color and bouquet of one glorious vintage against another and mornings spent wishing you were dead gerin broke in rihwin looked indignant with his flexible features every expression he assumed was in a small way a work of art gerin took no notice of him but pressed ahead all you remember about wine is the parts of the drinking of it you enjoyed the parts that werent so much fun you forget rihwin shook his head there was he insisted nothing about drinking wine that failed of enjoyment for me i was a connoisseur he struck a pose of exaggerated estheticism that would have made mavrix proud fanciest word for drunk i ever heard van said rihwin looked indignant all over again giving a rendering full of even more virtuosity than the previous one before he could protest out loud though gerin spoke up in agreement with the outlander you werent much of a connoisseur the day we met you down in that horrible dive in the city of elabon the one not far from the sorcerers collegium what you were was somebody trying to climb into a wine jar through the little hole in the neck and you didnt care a lick about the vintage you were drinking after all these years i must confess to remembering little about the occasion rihwin said with dignity yes passing out will do that to you wont it gerin replied you were as cold as a carp on a snowbank van added if you grand and magnificent gentlemen who of a certainty have been sober every moment of every day of your lives insist on reviling me and casting imputations upon my character i shall be forced to take myself off and drown my sorrowsin ale worse luck rihwin marched away nose in the air behind him gerin and van both started to laugh theres nothing we can do with him gerin said and his voice held only admiration not a single thing how about a good swift kick in the arse van suggested if all the knocks rihwins taken over the years havent let in any sense one more kick wont do the job gerin said and van laughed again nonetheless gerin kept a thoughtful eye on rihwin the fox when rihwin got particularly vehement on the subject of wine strange things had a way of happening gerin didnt want strange things to start happening life at the moment was quite complicated enough without them unfortunately he had not the slightest idea what he could to do prevent them most of aragis warriors were down in the southern part of his lands keeping an eye on the forces of the elabonian empire even so more detachments joined the army the fox was leading aragis peasants and villagers might have had their troubles but his kingdom did seem to support an astonishing number of soldiers every one of them well armed well equipped and to all appearances a rugged customer i would have put even more men into the south against the empire aragis remarked to gerin when yet another contingent of his warriors came rattling up in their chariots to join the army but i had to hold a good many back to fight you in case you decided to jump on me and then worry about the empire to the five hells with me if you dont have enough fighting men to tackle two big wars at once gerin said if your trokm neighbor had decided to forget he was your vassal you wouldnt have brought so many of your own troopers down to balsers holding aragis spoke with as much certainty as if hed announced that math moved through the sky more slowly than tiwaz since he was right gerin changed the subject whos commanding the force youve got facing the empire my eldest son aranast with marlanz rawmeat to hold him steady should he falter aragis answered aranast has never tried leading that big an army before if hes up to it well and good if hes not i dont aim to let him throw away the kingdom thats sensible gerin agreed though he wondered how happy aranast was at having marlanz looking over his shoulder then something else occurred to him the first time you sent marlanz up to treat with me you had an older man with him too to hold him to the road if he tried wandering off you have your son with you here aragis said nodding to dagref one day hell lead men on his own for now hes still learning gerin nodded but still thought the two principles not quite the same dagref plainly lacked the experience he needed to lead now in a while he would as plainly have it aragis seemed to make a habit of using a man with such experience alongside one who was just on the edge of having it the idea was a long way from the worst one gerin had ever met that evening as the steadily growing army was encamping by the side of the elabon way a chariot came pounding up the highway wheels clattering on stone paving the driver whipping on the horses to wring every last drip of speed from them the fellow in the car with him sprang down as soon as the chariot halted lord king he gasped and then paused for a moment to catch his breath he was swaying a little if hed come a long way in a chariot going hells for leather solid ground probably felt unsteady under his feet gerin came over to hear what he had to say aragis frowned at that but said nothing the messenger resumed lord king uh lord kings theres an imperial coming behind me youll meet him on the road tomorrow ive no doubt but i can tell you what hes going to say good aragis said briskly and gerin nodded say on sandifer the archer glanced at the fox and shrugged a small shrug acknowledging that this business concerned both of them sandifer said lord uh kings hes going to give you ten days to disperse your forces or else there will be war voluminous war i heard him say whatever that means it means he talks like a southerner gerin said they like to throw in a fancy word every now and then whether they use it the right way or not i heard that rihwin called if they want volumes of war aragis said ignoring rihwin as did gerin well give them enough to fill the foxs library that wasnt using voluminous the right way either but gerin was not inclined to undertake literary criticism on his fellow kings utterances if it comes to warno when it comes to war he said do you aim to go back into your keeps and make the empire dig you out one castle at a time only if i have to aragis answered at once if i were fighting the imperials alone i might do that for theyd have far more strength than i do by myself but theyd ravage the countryside so that even beating them back now might mean losing to you next year my lands shield yours here youll notice thats what you get for living south of me gerin scratched his head aragis could see that having the elabonian empire devastate his territory would weaken him to the point where hed have trouble withstanding the fox he wasnt stupid nor anything close to it but the idea that he was doing to his own lands over the course of years what the empire would do in a single campaigning season had never entered his mind it wasnt immediately apparent and so wasnt there at all for him the archer said with you beside me fox i aim to fight those imperial bastards as hard as i can and as far south as i can one thing i will say about you now that youve said you will fight alongside me i dont think youll turn on me instead of the empire there are others in the northlands to whom id not trust my back gerin bowed slightly when it came to judging how things ran in the short term aragis was as good as anyone hed ever knowas good as he was probably could he trust aragis at his back the only answer he could come up with was sometimes he said knowing which enemy to pick counts for a good deal oh indeed aragis bared his teeth in one of his alarming smiles did i not rely on you to understand the elabonian empire was more dangerous to both of us than we are to each other did i not put my life in your hands on that understanding and no more you did gerin wondered whether he would have done that in reverse if say the gradi had been on the point of beating him five years earlier maybe maybe not too because aragis lived so close to the hereandnow every crisis was liable to seem a matter of life and death to him gerin was better at waiting than his hardcharging fellow king we cast defiance in the envoys teeth then and smash the empires army on the battlefield aragis eyes had a fierce falcons glint in them too he believed every word of what he was saying maybe that would help him make his belief real maybe it would make him try to do more than he really could gerin shrugged hed find out soon when the chariot bearing the envoy of the elabonian empire and those in which his retinue rode came into view gerin feltnot for the first time since leaving fox keephed fallen back in time through close to half his life not since his last trip down to the city of elabon more than twenty years before had he seen men dressed in the flowing robes the imperials south of the high kirs affected adiatunnus saw them too and did not know what to make of them is the empire after sending women to treat with us the now he asked not quite in jest no thats just their style down there the fox answered and they shave not only their cheeks and chins the way you trokmoi do but their upper lips as well i did it myself when i lived down in the city but you had the sense to go back to a better way adiatunnus said gerin shrugged sometimes different is just different not better or worse he looked around for ferdulf when he spied the little demigod he waved for him to come over ferdulf came looking suspicious more often than not gerin was doing his best to make him go away what do you want ferdulf growled see those fellows up ahead the fox pointed thats the envoy from the elabonian empire and his friends ferdulfs lip curled in splendid scorn so what do you want me to do about it miserable imperial his voice faded down into a scatological mumble that was just what gerin wanted they probably wont like you any better he said with a grin he did not show ferdulf seemed to have forgotten he too was an elabonian theyre the ones who hold down sithonia after all i wonder what i can do to them ferdulf mused dagref looked back over his shoulder at gerin gerin wished he hadnt done it the look might have alerted ferdulf to the notion that he was being manipulated if dagref did have to give gerin a look though a look of approval was the one the fox wanted dagref as his father had learned to his own discomfiture was better than anyone else at manipulating ferdulf up came the elabonian chariots the one in the lead had a shield painted in green and white stripes mounted on the pole between the two horses a shield of truce that chariot and the one behind it pulled away from the rest and approached the army that had set out from fox keep i am efilnath the earnest the fellow in the fanciest robe called commissioner to his majesty crebbig i emperor of elabon i see here aragis the archer who presumes to make the error of styling himself king rumor has it that others in the province are equally rash be any such others present that i might treat with and dismiss all such false claimants simultaneously i am gerin the fox gerin announced king of the north i am here in alliance with aragis i note efilnath that if you call claims false and say ahead of time you will dismiss them you are not treating with those who make them only disposing of them i also note that theyand weare not to be disposed of so readily he wondered who crebbig i was on his last journey down to the city of elabon hildor iii had reigned there an indolent excuse for a monarch whatever crebbigs faultsand being a man he was bound to have themindolence did not seem to be among their number as the elabonian empire does not recognize that this land has ever been anything but an imperial province so naturally we cannot recognize any men styling themselves kings save in recognizing them as rebels and traitors efilnath said aragis the archer growled something angry under his breath gerin was about to growl something out loud when his eye chanced to fall on one of the men in the chariot behind efilnaths the fellow was nothing special to look atnot too tall not too wide not too handsomeand wore a robe that would have been altogether ordinary in the city of elabon nonetheless perhaps by the way he carried himself perhaps by a certain look in his eye gerin knew him for what he was a wizard from the sorcerers collegium and he recognized gerin toonot as an equal as one who had completed the same arduous training but as one who had some part of it those oddly compelling eyes of his widened just a little plainly he had not expected to come across anyone in the northlands who shared even a fragment of his arcane expertise gerin understood that the elabonians south of the high kirs reckoned the northlands a barbarous backwater he knew they had a point but not so much of one as they thought they did he smiled at the wizard a bleak display of acknowledgment and warning the elabonian got down from his chariot and hurried over to efilnaths he whispered in the envoys ear whatever he saidand the fox had a pretty good notion of what it would beefilnath seemed unimpressed come what may a backwoods baron remains a backwoods baron he said a distinct sniff in his voice oh ferdulf gerin called sweetly come and say hello to these nice people would you please what nice people ferdulf snarled all i see is a bunch of elabonians who think theyre smarter than they really areidiots who think theyre halfwits as if his rumbling baritone wouldnt have been enough to alert the southerners that he was something out of the ordinary he also strolled along a couple of feet off the ground efilnath gaped at him so did the wizard in a different more intensely concentrated way who are you he demanded and then a moment later what are you by way of reply ferdulf stuck out his tongue it went out improbably far the tip wiggled like a serpents tongue for a moment then he drew the whole thing back in with a wet plop he smiled unpleasantly at the elabonian sorcerer sweetly still gerin said lord efilnath lord wizard call me caffer the wizard said as the fox knew it was not his real name wizards warded those to keep enemies from working magic with them lord efilnath lord caffer then gerin resumed allow me to present you to ferdulf the son of mavrix who when he is not accompanying me dwells in the village by fox keep a son of the lord of the sweet grape here efilnath exclaimed impossible not impossible caffer said it is truth he and the elabonian envoy conferred again more urgently this time gerin hoped the idea that ferdulf was at least in some measure under his control would get through to the imperials ferdulf didnt help remarking and a bloody boring hole that village is too yield to the empires might pay the tribute long owed us and all shall be forgiven concerning these usurpations of authority you have perpetrated efilnath said with what he obviously thought was true generosity return to your own barony abandon any false claims to suzerainty over your neighbors and live under the beneficent splendor of crebbig justly styled the magnificent pay twenty years tribute gerin shook his head not likely not when the elabonian empire wasnt here for a day of that time twenty years tribute yes efilnath said plus whatever you may have owed prior to that time our records indicate that you northern barons were shockingly lax in paying your dues even before such time as we temporarily fell out of touch with you thats a nice way to put it gerin said before you forgot all about us you mean before you left us to the tender mercy of the trokmoi you mean before you werent here to help us fight the monsters or the gradi you mean and if you go away again now youll expect us to pay you again for being gone wont you ignoring the sarcasm efilnath said you did not as i have noted contribute your fair share before we temporarily fell out of touch with you with a shrug gerin answered it all depends on how you look at things i never saw any imperial soldiers on the niffet helping me hold the trokmoi at bay if the crops failed i never saw any grain hauled up from south of the high kirs to help us i dont know about you efilnath or about your emperor crebbig either but im not in the habit of paying for what i dont see crebbig is your emperor as well as mine efilnath sounded shockedartfully shockedthat gerin could imagine otherwise caffer broke in speak to me of the gradi lord baron south of the high kirs we know less of them than we would like the foxs style is lord king even as is mine aragis said best you remember it lest he take your rudeness to heart and avenge himself on you aragis was likelier than gerin to do something like that gerin started to say he wasnt offended but then checked himself why not give the imperials something else to worry about he laughed scornfully instead ill answer he said they think they can rule this province and they dont even know who lives in it they temporarily fell out of touch thats all dagref said he struck the perfect tone it wasnt even scorn it said the empires envoy and wizard didnt rate scorn only amused disdain it struck home too in a voice less suave than he had used before efilnath demanded lord baron will you then yield to the authority of the emperor crebbig and beg his forgiveness for the autonomy you have usurped in a word no gerin answered this would look to be a word you people dont know well since your comrade heard it from aragis without listening to it ferdulfs yawn was as extravagant and as anatomically unlikely as the distance to which hed stuck out his tongue go away you foolish people he said you only prove how dull elabonians can be and then without warning all the gentleness disappeared from his mockery begone get out of this land you have no right to it i a gods son so declare efilnath flinched gerin would have flinched too had an angry demigod growled at him but the empires envoy was not without spirit the gods of elabon say otherwise and i serve them and the emperor what do you suppose the gods of elabon do say father dagref whispered to gerin efilnath and his friends here are elabonian but so are we how do the gods choose one side or the other my guess is they probably dont the fox whispered back the gods of elabon from everything hed seen intervened in human affairs as little as they possibly could most of the time that suited him fine against the gradi whose own gods were as aggressive as they were hed wished the elabonian deities had done more now hed be just as well pleased to have them keep on doing nothing in particular while he and dagref talked efilnath and caffer were also holding their own lowvoiced colloquy gerin couldnt make out what the elabonian envoy was saying whatever it was caffer agreed with it he nodded several times each more vigorously than the one before quit jabbering the two of you ferdulf growled at the men from south of the high kirs i told you once get out of here now i tell you twice leave while you can still take your clothes with you which is better luck than the last imperial envoy had isnt it now efilnath nodded to caffer the wizard pointed in ferdulfs direction his lips moved so did his right hand in passes gerin knew he would never be able to match for swift fluidity as aragis had said this was a mage from the sorcerers collegium the most highly trained and skilled band of sorcerers this part of the world knew ferdulf shouted in rage try and silence me will you he roared and suddenly despite staying the same size seemed much larger and fiercer than he had a moment before he pointed two fingers at caffer a vulgar gesture straight from the alleys of the city of elabon it was a vulgar gesture with power behind it caffer staggered and had to snatch at the rail of efilnaths chariot to keep from falling he looked astonished that his sorcery had failed the one flaw gerin had sometimes noted in trained elabonian wizards was a belief that because they could do so many things they could do everything but ferdulf looked astonished too he evidently had expected to flatten the elabonian wizard enough both of you gerin said sharply we met here behind a shield of truce shall we fall to blows now and save the waiting no efilnath said caffer gave a shaky nod to show he agreed with his superior ferdulf on the other hand looked readylooked eagerto continue the battle of powers gerin glared at him he glared back his eyes blazed with more power than the fox had ever seen in them resolutely gerin kept staring to his everlasting relief ferdulf finally nodded too go back to your soldiers then gerin told the imperial envoy when we meet again we shall be at war i said this earlier to your other ambassador aragis added now my fellow king confirms it if you want this land you will have to take it from usand from the gods son here he beamed at ferdulf gerin had never seen him beam before it was when you got down to it a pretty alarming sight we have powers of our own caffer said his voice wasnt as certain and bright as a newstamped coin though after that first clash with ferdulf doubts had entered his mind doubt was the enemy of strong sorcery the thought made gerin beam too in caffers direction the mage from the city of elabon looked as if he could have done without that sunny smile efilnath the earnest tapped his driver on the shoulder the fellow steered the horses in as tight a circle as he could they went off the elabon way for part of it their hooves kicking up clumps of dirt and grass then they got back on the road and clattered off down the paving stones in precise order of precedence the rest of the chariots in efilnaths party followed caffer jumping up into his car when it came past him as that car rolled away caffer looked back over his shoulder at gerinor perhaps at ferdulf who stood nearby ferdulf snarled like one tomcat warning another to go away caffer stared steadily back at hima stare that proclaimed i will not be coweduntil the soldiers in another chariot got between him and mavrixs son it will be war aragis the archer spoke with a certain somber satisfaction if the imperials will not heed words let them heed the flight of arrows and the thunder of chariotry it will be war gerin agreed he looked around i dont think efilnath or his men were paying much attention to our riders thats to the good in my view may they prove an unpleasant surprise for the imperials so may it be aragis said though sounding more as if he hoped it would be so than as if he expected it lets follow the imperials as close as we can gerin said if theyre as proud of themselves as they always used to be theyll expect us to cower and wait for them to come to us the more we can rock them back on their heels the better off well be oh aye no doubt of that if id had only a few more men of my ownor if i hadnt worried that youd jump me instead of joining me id have done as much myself aragis said he turned his harsh gaze on the fox and now for what youd likely call an interesting question who commands interesting indeed gerin said almost as lightly as hed hoped he could well its easy enough to answer you do just like that the archer stared hed been ready for an argument but gerin said just like that for one thing this is your land you know it and i dont for another you also knowor youd better knowill take my men out of the fight if you try to harm them with your orders that should be enough to keep you honest or close to it aragis weighed the words then nodded with his usual abrupt decision very well let it be so had you insisted on taking the lead i likely would have yielded but id have given you a harder time than you sound as though youll give me that also crossed my mind gerin grinned at the other king in the northlands i didnt feel like arguing with you every time i turned around either life is too short for that youre a perfectly good general ive seen as much i doubt wed do a whole lot better with me giving orders than with you why do you make me think youve won a victory when i see you yielding aragis asked suspiciously sometimes you can do both at once gerin told him the archer shook his head like a man bedeviled by gnats he couldnt see the only victories he understood were the ones where he went out and smashed something gerin nodded to himself with luck there would be plenty of that sort there had better be he thought more and more of aragis men joined the army as it moved south in the wake of the imperial envoy and his entourage at gerins suggestionto which the archer agreed after a sour lookthe newcomers rode at the head of the army that way gerin said blandly if the imperials have spies in your land theyll have a harder time spotting all our riders if the elabonians have spies in our land ill crucify them aragis obviously meant what he said down south of the high kirs the empire crucified miscreants the headsmans axe mostly settled them in the northlands but for spies gerin would not have been surprised in the least to learn that aragis might take the trouble to run up crosses marlanz rawmeat sent a charioteer back to aragis and gerin to let them know the imperial envoy had passed his army and returned to the host the elabonian emperor had sent into the northlands and the messenger added he says the horseman you sent to warn him this efilnath was coming got there ahead of the cursed imperial even though he went crosscountry as a chariot couldnt do no man afoot could have run fast enough to outdo a car either isnt that fine gerin said isnt that splendid isnt that magnificent rihwin the fox said oh shut up aragis the archer said gerin and rihwin both laughed at him till he looked so fierce they stopped rihwin probably wouldnt have stopped even then but gerin contrived to tread on his toes he wanted aragis angry at the elabonian empire not at his own allies he might make rihwin stop laughing making rihwin shut up was another matter in his best didactic tones rihwin lectured aragis so you see lord king judicious employment of men riding horses does in good sooth have the potential to smite the foe when and where he least expects it i see a man who talks too bloody much is what i see aragis rumbled and worked a small miracle rihwin did fall silent aragis kept right on scowling not so much at rihwin as at the world around him were going to eat this country empty curse it could be worse gerin said cheerfully oh how the scowl remained now turned full force on gerin he said easy enough could be the imperials eating your countryside empty for that matter could be the imperials burning out your countryside so nobodyd be able to eat from it aragis pondered that then looked surprised well youre right it could be worse he said gruffly that doesnt make this any too good though i didnt say it did gerin resolutely kept his tone light that wasnt too hard for him his land wasnt facing invasionyet his land wasnt facing being eaten emptyhis land had already had an army feeding off it when hed thought he was going to war against aragis rather than the elabonian empire the next afternoon gerins force came up to the encampment where aragis main army kept an eye on the imperials marlanz rawmeat rode out to greet the fox well met lord king he said clasping gerins hand im happier to see you fighting with me than fighting against me if you know what i mean heh heh oh yes gerin said i never wanted to fight a war with your king either and now i wont ill fight a war with the elabonian empire instead and i would have wanted that even less had it occurred to me not to want it marlanz said lord king i present to you aranast aragis son lord king aranast said politely bowing he looked like aragis right down to the cast of features that warned nobody had better disagree with him for any reason whatever gerin didnt think he had the force of character that would let him back up that cast of features but he wasnt very old yet either he couldnt have had more than a couple of years on duren thinking of duren made the fox wish hed accepted more support from his own eldest son he hadnt thought hed need it against aragis the archer the elabonian empire had rather greater resources than his rival king he didnt know what part of those resources the empire had committed or would commit to reconquering the northlands but hed find out soon enough aranast said weve all heard a great deal about you lord king thats nice gerin said blandly playing the simpleton to see how aragis son would respond aranast drew back half a pace struggling to reconcile the ruler whod held his father at bay for two decades with this fellow who sounded as if he had not a brain in his head after a moment he smiled a smile that matched any of aragis for icy precision much of what weve heard is how selfeffacing you are i see thats so all right then he wasnt a fool that disappointed the fox with a smile of his own gerin said if i wanted to stay in hiding i wouldnt have come south were glad you did whatever your reasons were marlanz said hastily the empire wont be so glad he paused is that ferdulf with you as he had up at fox keep he spoke of the demigod as if ferdulf were some kind of wild animal oh yes hes here gerin answered good marlanz said with heartfelt reliefone of the rare times ferdulf had ever inspired that emotion or indeed any emotion save inchoate or sometimes not so inchoate fury in anyone as if to prove he was there ferdulf strolled over rose into the air till he could look marlanz in the face and said i remember you youre the man whos made out of raw meat most men are marlanz replied with what gerin thought of as commendable calm he stared back at ferdulf i expect you are too well yes the little demigod admitted but not raw meat of such a gross and repellent sort as yours or the foxs here of that im comfortably certain no doubt youre right gerin said in a voice of elaborate unconcern when you go in the bushes its daisies and violets that come out not the stuff that makes them grow ferdulf gave him a look full of such concentrated loathing he had to brace himself to stand against it the demigod stalked off through the air he does dislike the empire more than he dislikes us doesnt he marlanz asked anxiously i had hoped he would ever since i learned the imperials were coming over the mountains he did anyhow gerin said which made marlanz look more anxious still and aranast downright alarmed the fox laughed it will be all right he and i have been carving chunks off each other for as long as hes been around hes used to it hell get over it but he despises the elabonian empire with a fine bright loathing that should be good for a long time to come do you plan to move straight against the empire lord king marlanz asked the fox gerin pointed to aragis youd better put that to your own overlord marlanz he replied hes in overall command here aranast looked as if hed already assumed that marlanz looked surprised then tried to look as if he hadnt it didnt work aranast had noticed marlanz would probably be unhappy after aragis found a chance to speak with him in private had the archer been operating against gerin he would have been delighted since they were on the same side he wasnt aragis said they are here they have no business being here my fellow king agrees they have no business being here he turned his fierce gaze on gerin as if daring him to disagree he couldnt disagree aragis came to a conclusion as obvious to him as a sithonian geometer found the proof of two triangles congruence and so we attack a mounted scout came galloping back to the army of the northlands lord kings he shouted to gerin and aragis who rode at the head of their conjoined forces the imperials arent far southjust back of the next rise south from the one i rode over here theyre in column but they arent asleeplook like they can deploy in a hurry whenever they take a mind to well hit them anyhow aragis said at his order his driver reined in gerin had dagref pull to a stop beside his fellow king aragis waved to gain the attention of the troopers behind him left and right he shouted form line of battle left and right cheers rose from his men and gerins both they were going to get the fighting so many of them craved the fox hadnt understood anyones being eager for battle not since his first one but a lot of people were the warriors peeled off across the fields to either side of the elabon way to make a ragged line that would only get more ragged as they advanced against the empire what about the horsemen gerin asked when aragis didnt give them any special orders the archer frowned thats right he saidsure enough hed forgotten about them after a moments thought he issued the command let them go off around to the right maybe they can take the imperials in the flank since they wont be looking for anything like that he spoke as if he didnt expect that to happen as if he was sending rihwins riders out of the way so he could get on with the main battle gerin didnt try to change his mind no matter why hed issued the order it made good sense gerin waved for rihwin drew his attention and relayed it aye lord king we shall essay it rihwin replied he glanced over to aragis the archer with an expression that said he too knew aragis didnt expect much perhaps we shall disabuse doubters of their dubiety talk fancy like that when you get near the imperials aragis said maybe theyll think youre one of them long enough to help you hurt em i shall lord king and i thank you for the suggestion rihwin said he surveyed aragis with respect no less real for being grudging but the archer hadnt finished if you dont fool them maybe you can bore them to death thank you again lord king so much rihwin said tightly he rode off to rally his men and take them in the direction aragis had commanded gerin wondered whether aragis had insulted him for the sake of being insulting or to inspire him to fight harder gerin also wondered whether aragis bothered drawing such distinctions wheres that ferdulf aragis demanded looking around i want him front and center against the empire front and center ferdulf came he and aragis made allies more unlikely than gerin and aragis back over the mountains with them ferdulf shouted and rose above the front rank like a living battle standard the troopersespecially aragis men who knew him only as a demigod and not as an obnoxious bratraised a cheer forward aragis shouted with another cheer with a rumble of wheels and squeaks from ungreased axles the chariots rolled ahead in the car with gerin and dagref van said ah well another brawl he hefted his spear now to make the other fellows sorry their mothers ever bore em aragis shouted again our cry is the northlands a third cheer rang out from his men and the foxs louder than either of the other two gerin set a hand on dagrefs shoulder drive as i command you or as seems best to you if im too busy fighting to give you any orders the gods keep you safe and you father and all of us dagref answered then he frowned his back was to gerin but the fox recognized the expression by the way his sons shoulders hunched forward a little after his usual pause for thought dagref went on but of course the gods wont keep all of us safe why make the prayer then if dagref was worrying over philosophical questions he wasnt likely to panic when the fighting started gerin had never gone into battle with that sort of preparation he didnt think duren had either but if philosophy helped keep his eldest by selatre on a steady course the fox would not complain over the first low rise rolled the army the chariots were just coming down the far slope when over the crest of the second rise the scout had mentioned came the lead chariots of the force the elabonian empire had sent out to reclaim the northern province it had abandoned a generation before at the sight of their foes gerins men and aragis raised a great shout derision and hatred all commingled hold the line steady aragis yelled by father dyaus ill cut the balls off the first chariot crew i see charging ahead all on their lonesome hold steady and the line did hold steady in the short run fear worked well enough to keep men obedient more and more imperial chariots came up over the crest of the second rise they were deploying as they advanced their line got wider as the fox watched he wished his men and aragis had been closer to them to hit them before they shook themselves out into line wishing got him what wishing usually got dagref said all their chariots look just alike isnt that peculiar not when you think about it gerin answered down in the city of elabon the empire has an armory where smiths and carpenters and such make weapons for the whole imperial army they have a pattern for spears and a pattern for helmets and a pattern for chariots too its not the way it is here where each keep will have its own carpenter or wheelwright with his own notions about how to do things then these cars will likely be better than some of ours but worse than others dagref said if they keep on making them to the same pattern long enough while we test worse against better sooner or later all of ours will be better than theirs or else well try something different altogether gerin looked west to see if he could spot rihwins troop of horsemen he was on the whole glad to discover he couldnt trees screened them from what would momentarily become the battlefield if they got round that screen they were liable to give the imperials a nasty surprise elabon elabon elabon the foe was shouting too in rhythmic unison very different from the great incoherent roar that came from the men of the northlands the imperials were much more uniform in appearance than gerin and aragis troopers each of whom equipped himself as he could afford and as he thought best the men from south of the high kirs put the fox in mind of the warriors ros the fierce had used to conquer this province in the first place a couple of hundred years before that comparison worried him ros warriors by all accounts had been as tough as any ever made thisll be the biggest chariot fight ive ever seen van said as more and more imperials came over the rise biggest chariot fight this part of the world has ever seen gerin answered unless there were bigger ones when we elabonians conquered it in the first place no sooner were the words we elabonians out of his mouth than he found them odd he thought of himself as an elabonian he spoke the elabonian language he worshiped elabonian gods he revered elabonian civilization not least the parts borrowed or stolen from sithonia and now he was going to do his best to defeat the soldiers of the elabonian empire of course theyd kill him if he didnt that was a powerful argument in favor of fighting ferdulf floated high overhead screaming abuse at the imperial army gerin didnt know what the little demigod could do beyond screaming abuse even that would help with his being so obviously supernatural maybe ferdulf didnt know himself whether he could do anything maybe he wouldnt know till he tried it and it either worked or it didnt to dagref gerin said if you see the empires wizards steer toward their cars if we can get rid of them we help our own cause more than we do by putting paid to ordinary troopers dagref nodded gerin reached over his shoulder pulled an arrow from his quiver and set it to his bowstring the two armies were closing fast already the first few arrows had begun to fly they fell far short of their targets there were always soldiers who couldnt wait till they had some reasonable chance of hitting something before they started to shoot closer and closer came the enemy cars gerins own mouth felt dry his heart pounded he understood why the overeager troopers had begun to shoot too soon it made them feel the battle had started and the waiting was over beside the fox in the jouncing car van was muttering come on come on come on gerin didnt think he knew he was doing it he wanted to get into the fight too but carried no bow straight ahead was an imperial with a gilded corselet and helmet that made him an officer of some sort and also a good target gerin set himself drew the bow to his ear in one smooth motion and let fly the bowstring lashed the leather brace on his wrist he grabbed another arrow nocked it and let fly again the officer in the gilded armor did not fall shooting from a chariot took a lot of luck even for the best of warriors of course with enough shafts in the air some of them were bound to be lucky here and there screams rose from both lines men crumpled and fell out of their cars as those bounded over the fields horses crashed down too sending chariots slewing sideways and once or twice crashing into one another and bringing more men to ruin buzzing like an angry bumblebee an arrow flew past the foxs ear he shook his head as if at a veritable insect indeed with enough shafts in the air some were bound to be luckyand unlucky for him an old pale scar puckered his left shoulder he knew what wounds were like here we go van said aragis wasnt being subtle about what he did he was throwing his army straight at the imperial forces maybe he thought they would break and fleethey were effete southerners after all the commander the elabonian emperor had sent over the mountains was taking the same approach to the warriors from the northlands maybe he thought they would break and fleethey were halfbarbarous rebels after all neither side broke neither side fled neither side did much in the way of maneuvering gerin aimed for the driver of the chariot that was thundering toward him his arrow caught the luckless elabonian right in the neck the fellow dropped the reins and clutched at himself as he fell out of the chariot a wheel thumped over him he lay very still one of the bowmen in that imperial chariot snatched for the reins he missed they dragged along the ground the horses no longer under anyones control slowed from gallop to walk dagref steered past them so close that van was able to use his heavy spear he let out a great shout of fierce glee as he watched the imperial soldier crumple some of the chariots of the opposing sides shot past one another others pulled up to avoid collisions the fight turned into a melee what had been neat lines turned into a confused jumble of chariots and horses some men kept on shooting arrows at their foes others at closer quarters drew swords and axes and slashed away at one another pull back in the emperors name an imperial officer shouted to his men well form line again and smash through these savages but the troopers of the elabonian empire could not pull back and reform they were locked together with the warriors from the northlands as tightly as if held in a lovers embrace smash em aragis yelled smash em to pieces gerin wondered how hed grown so strong with no better notion of strategy than that maybe ferocity had had more to do with it than strategy any of aragis men who gave ground would have to face him afterwards that meant giving ground was anything but a sure way to escape from danger an imperial chariot pulled close to the one dagref was driving one of the warriors in it turned and cut at gerin with his sword the fox leaned away from the blade which flew past him he snatched an axe out of a bracket set into the side of his chariot and smashed it into the troopers ribs it bit through the scales of his corselet blood gushed from the wound with a bubbling shriek and an outraged expression the soldier toppled van boomed laughter you do that once every fight captain seems like he said they never expect you to be lefthanded and thats a mistake they never get to make twice gerin started to answer but shouted watch yourself instead an imperial trooper with an axe ran toward the chariot from the side many horses on both sides were down many drivers had been hit many chariots had overturned some men kept fighting on foot van jumped down from the car and with a roar that might have sprung from a longtooths throat rushed at the soldier of the elabonian empire the soldier was close to a foot shorter than the enormous outlander whose helm and the nodding horsehair crest above it made him seem taller still when van thrust with his spear the imperial did not wait to try conclusions with him but spun on his heel and ran away to find a foe for whom he was more nearly a match shouting laughter van sprang back into the chariot dagref managed to get out of the press and send the car at gerins direction toward several imperial chariots whose crews were pressing hard against some of aragis men and some of his own a couple of the empires chariots also pulled loose and quickly moved to block his path suddenly ferdulf flew down from the sky and screeched in the faces of the imperials horses one team ran wild thundering out of the fight the other team didnt run at all the horses reared and screamed in terror the elabonian warriors clung to the rails of their car that was all they could do to keep from being spilled out onto the ground that also made them easy meat for gerin and van the fox shot one at close range van speared another the third did dive out of the chariot then and so preserved himself well done gerin shouted to ferdulf keep it upyoull drive them crazy floating in midair ferdulf grinned at the fox who with the elabonian empire as the new standard of comparison looked better to the obnoxious little demigod than he ever had before ive found something else new to do to them too ferdulf said he drifted up above the fight tugged his tunic up over his belly and it wasnt really something new it was the disgusting game hed been playing at fox keep when marlanz rawmeat came to visit then it had been nothing but disgusting now if a soldier of the elabonian empire unexpectedly got pissed on from out of the sky he was liable to be distracted for a few crucial moments during which he could neither attack nor defend himself very well several soldiers paid with their lives for such distraction ferdulf seemed to have an unlimited supply of his nasty weapon gerin had never thought that one of a demigods attributes might be the ability to piss endlessly without having to load up on water or ale that was not the sort of ability on which the sithonian mythologizers and their elabonian imitators dwelt they had their minds on higher things ferdulf didnt another attribute of his one the mythologizers might actually have mentioned in writing was his uncanny ability to avoid arrows he got plenty of chances to use that ability too plenty of outraged imperials sent shafts his way and he was not floating so high as to be anything but an easy target nevertheless every arrow missed gerin couldnt tell whether the arrows went wide or ferdulf dodged however that worked none struck home he took unpleasant revenge on the men who shot at him too and then with a squawk of surprise and indignation he tumbled out of the sky not far from the fox oh a pestilence gerin exclaimed caffer or one of their other cursed wizards found a spell that would bite on him after all dagref aye father dagref said and then looked back over his shoulder at gerin are you really sure you want to rescue him dont tempt me lad gerin said he would have liked it better had the words come out of his mouth sounding more like a joke but while he wouldnt have cared to explain himself to either ferdulf or mavrix the idea of leaving the sithonian gods irksome little bastard to his fate held an appalling appeal even though ferdulf wasnt flying arrows still wouldnt strike him they dug into the ground all around his little feet but none pierced his flesh finish him an imperial shoutedsure enough there was caffer looking indecently pleased with himself steer toward the sorcerer gerin shouted and shot an arrow at caffer the wizard deflected it with an absentminded pass he could not do so without effort though as ferdulf could and while he was momentarily distracted the demigod floated off the ground as soon as the arrow had gone by the mage from the city of elabon renewed his spell and ferdulf shouting in fury found his feet on the ground again gerin shot at caffer once more once more the wizard made him miss an imperial warrior jumped out of a chariot and ran toward ferdulf who after another leap into the air while caffer was otherwise engaged had again returned to earth cursing van sprang down and dashed to the demigods aid unlike the other trooper this one stood and fought the fox had scant time to watch that fight dagref by then had driven quite close to caffers car close enough for him to snap his whip at the wizard the whip wasnt so easy to deflect as gerins arrows had been caffer did manage to evade it then howled a spell the lash changed to a serpent in dagrefs hands the serpent hissed twisted and tried to bite that however did not work so well as caffer had hoped like a lot of boys his age dagref was fond of snakes this one was bigger than any gerin had seen around fox keep but that did not seem to faze his son dagref grabbed it behind the head he had to use both hands to control its writhing length gerin snatched up the reins to keep the horses from running wild thank you father dagref said then he shouted to caffer you made itnow see how you like it he threw the snake into the wizards car caffer had had a spell handy for turning whip to snake he did not seem to have one for turning a snake back into a whip he and his driver and the warrior in the chariot with them all shouted and stomped and slashed at the serpent which like every other serpent proved extremely reluctant to expire dagref took the reins back from gerin as calmly as if nothing had happened the fox shot a third arrow at caffer the wizard knew nothing of this one till it rammed its way between two ribs and pierced him almost to its fletching he straightened up and screamed a long wail of agony and surprise mixed since men like snakes could prove reluctant to die gerin shot him again this time in the face he spilled out of the chariot like a sack of peas with a shout of joy ferdulf floated above the field once more gerin looked around to see if van needed help against his foe the imperial warrior lay on the ground thrashing toward death vans spear dripped blood fool was brave the outlander said as he got back into the chariot but that doesnt make him any less a fool father im sorry but i havent got a whip any more dagref said considering what you did with it i think ill forgive you the fox answered his voice dry that was quick thinking dagrefs shoulders went up and down in a shrug i didnt see anything better i could do with the thing van looked around the field then nudged gerin fox are we winning this confounded fight or losing it gerin looked too to the five hells with me if i know he said they arent running and we arent running and were all mashed together with a certain sardonic pride he added the fights i make are neater than this anyhow aragis has no sense of tidiness you can tell him that when everything here is done van said with a grin wait till im around though if youd be so kind i want to hear what he says to you afterwards dagref managed to keep the chariot moving as he wanted even without a whip to speed the horses along what to do on the battlefield did not come naturally to him as it did say to van and to duren too but he thought well and did not let himself get rattled all that counted too and he managed to keep everything that was and should be going on straight in his mind which a good many men who reckoned themselves great captains had trouble doing he said shouldnt rihwin and his horsemen ride in from the flank sometime soon father dyaus gerin exclaimed his head whipped around toward the west id forgotten all about them where are they anyhow van looked west too probably in amongst the trees he said trying to figure out which side is which like you said fox this is about as untidy a brawl as ive ever seen well one way for them to neaten things up would be to attack right about now gerin said our men know who they are and the imperials dont except to figure out that they arent friends and he shut up neither dagref nor van was paying attention to him they were both staring west gerin took another look in that direction too his sour expression disappeared to be replaced by an enormous grin sounding more serious than he often did van said you ever by any chance think of going into the prophet business i leave that to my wife and farseeing biton thanks gerin answered regardless of whether or not hed foretold their arrival rihwins riders approached the battlefield at something close to a gallop gerins men and aragis cheered the imperials either cursed or laughed more slowly than he should have the officer who led the elabonian empires army figured out that the horsemen however peculiar they looked to him might represent a real threat he detached a squadron of chariots from his main forceno easy task considering how heavily engaged against the men of the northlands his army wasand sent them against the new foes on horseback when other imperials werent trying to kill him gerin watched with great interest the clash of the old way and the new to his vast astonishment it went exactly as rihwin the fox had predicted it would hed known rihwin more than twenty years in all that time he couldnt recall thinking such a thing before what he thought now was that rihwin had picked a splendid time to be right the chariots thundered across the fields toward the horsemen bumping and jouncing as they always did the warriors in the bumping jouncing cars shot arrows at rihwins men rihwins men shot back not only that they rode around the chariots as if the latter were nailed to the ground they shot back at the imperials from all directions at once anyone who tried to lift a shield against a shaft coming from the right was apt as not to be pierced by one coming from the left or the rear dagref said were watching the end of a whole way of fighting i didnt think it would happen quite so easily neither did i gerin said neither did anybody van said but happen it did before long the chariots the imperial commander had sent out against the horsemen were swept off the field as if by a broom rihwins riders began showering the men in the main imperial force with arrows some rode close to use sword and spear against their foes where the men of the elabonian empire had fought gerin and aragis chariots to a standstill the shock of the new alarmed them far more than its actual effect on the battlefield and the number of horsemen would have warranted at first by ones and twos and then in larger numbers they broke off the fight and withdrew to the south they werent routed they fought back fiercely when the men of the northlands pursued but they werent going to fight on that field any more either rihwin rode up to gerin his sword had blood on it so did his face an arrow had nicked one cheek but his face also bore an enormous grin gerin didnt blame himhed earned the right to grin how about that lord king rihwin said how about that well how about it gerin asked deadpan rihwin stared then started to laugh so did gerin why not theyd won v its a battle gerin said for the eighteenthor was it the twentythird time that afternoon its not the war this particular time he happened to be talking with adiatunnus the trokm chieftain gave him an impatient look as if he were quibbling over trifles theyre licked the now and well see them no more is it not so no curse it its not so the fox said wearily or rather its so that we beat them but theres no way of knowing whether that means theyve had enough or whether well be in another battle day after tomorrow adiatunnus said youre after telling me then that the elabonians from over the mountains are even more stubborn nor the lot of you kerns we trokmoi have been coping with all along as stubborn as we are anyhow were a branch off that trunk gerin said the other part of the bargain is theyre drawing on the resources of a land bigger than this province and all of it under the rule of one man its not split into fragments the way the northlands are if the emperor orders this army to keep fighting it will if he orders another army up over the high kirs well have to fight that one too maybe this whole business of civilization isna the fun i thought it was adiatunnus walked off shaking his head gerin went back to what he had been doing helping to care for the injured study and more practice than he wished hed got had left him as good a battlefield surgeon as anyone else in the northlands he dug out arrowheads stitched up slashes helped set a couple of broken bones and urged anyone with any sort of wound to wash it out with ale it helps clean he said and a clean wound is less likely to go bad than a dirty one wine would be better said an imperial trooper who had been pitched out of his chariot and captured while he was stunned so it would if we had any the fox agreed spotting ferdulf strolling along not far away he waved and called the demigods name rather to his surprise ferdulf came to him what do you want mavrixs son asked sounding less hostile than gerin was used to maybe ferdulf had figured out that he ought to be grateful and maybe the fox would flap his arms and fly to fomor hed borrowed the image from the trokm tongue fomor was the name the woodsrunners gave the moon elabonians called tiwaz hoping to take advantage of what passed for good nature with ferdulf gerin said do you have any healing powers by any chance mavrix had great power over flesh but gerin thought it wiser not to mention that lest ferdulf grow angry at being reminded however indirectly that he was only half a god the question seemed to take ferdulf by surprise i dont know he answered i dont think i ever tried why should i try anyhow even if i can all id be doing would be healing elabonians and i dont like elabonians youd be healing warriors who could fight against the elabonian empire again gerin pointed out there is that ferdulf admitted grudgingly his small shoulder shrugged oh all right ill see what i can do i dont know if i can do anything you know sometimes when i try to do something i find i can sometimes i cant that makes me angry be angry at the empire for causing these wounds in the first place gerin suggested dont be angry at our men who are hurt its not their fault no ferdulf said if they were better soldiers maybe they wouldnt have got hurt to begin with but having said that he went over to a man who was cursing as blood from a wounded arm slowly soaked the bandage wrapped around the injury whats he going to do the soldier looked at ferdulf as dubiously as the demigod was looking at him ferdulf reached out and touched the bandage the warrior exclaimed in delight ferdulf exclaimed too and jerked his hand away he grabbed at his own arm in the spot where the warrior had been wounded his lower lip stuck out in petulant dismay it hurts it hurts as if the arrow had gone into me but it took my pain away the warrior said while you were holding me it didnt hurt any more and i thought i felt it getting better if you know what i mean but when you took your hand off the wound it hurt again and i stopped hurting ferdulf said as if that were much more important to him no doubt it was gerin said could you try a little more even so this would be a great help in the war against the empire if you could do it it hurts ferdulf repeated gerin though had chosen the right hook with which to catch his fish ferdulf might have been reluctant but he set his hand on the warriors wound once more the fellow let out a great luxuriant sigh as his pain vanished again ferdulf grimaced and whimpered but did not let go then the soldier said dyaus allfather will you look at that with his good arm he pointed to the demigod gerin stared forming on ferdulfs little arm even as he watched was what looked as if it would be a wound of the same sort as the trooper had suffered gently the fox said ferdulf you dont have to go on any more in fact it might be better if you didnt when ferdulf looked down at himself he gasped and jerked his hand away from the wounded man along with gerin and the warrior he stared at his arm slowly what would have become a wound faded from his flesh you made mine better little fellow and i thank you for it the soldier said it doesnt hurt near so much now but i wouldnt have wanted you to go on any more not when you were going to start bleeding yourself any minute there too high a price to pay gerin said regretfully he clapped ferdulf on the back as if the little demigod were a man you did what you could and i thank you for trying if i were all god i could have done it ferdulf scowled no that thought was never far from his mind i feel the power in me but i cant keep it from doing what it does to me my body wont bear what it should the fox suspected that problem would plague him all his life which was liable to be a very long life indeed being only a man gerin had only human abilities which did not overtax his merely human frame ferdulfs abilities outstripped the body containing them as if a squirrel say were to be suddenly endowed with human intellect while gerin was pondering that aragis the archer came up to him he looked as happy as he ever did which wasnt very your men fought well fox he said nodding to gerin better than i thought they would and ive never thought they couldnt i understand that or youd have attacked me gerin said to which the archer unabashed nodded again gerin went on nothing wrong with the way your soldiers did their job either but ive always known any men you led would fight hard if they didnt youd have attacked me aragis said that was what he would have done and he judged others by his own standards after a few heartbeats he added you got more out of those riders than i thought you would too always up for something new what came next was half bark half chuckle keeps your neighbors on their toes gerin raised an eyebrow and grinned a lopsided grin thats the idea oh i know i understand as much aragis said even so i never thought youd put a woman on horseback he turned that coughing chuckle loose again women are for being ridden not for riding what in the five hells are you talking about now gerin demanded i havent got any women and aragis threw back his head and guffawed gerin was as astonished as if the high kirs had suddenly stood up on little spindly legs to dance a sprightly trokm dance by the gods theres something you didnt know the archer said haw haw haw who would have guessed it the fox with something going on right under his nose and he had never a clue haw haw he wiped his streaming eyes the last time something had gone on under gerins nose without his noticing elise had run off with the horseleech after close to half a lifetime that memory remained bitter as horseradish holding his voice under tight control he said youd better tell me just what you mean i mean what i say aragis face bore an utterly uncharacteristic grin i generally do which is more than some people i might mention can claim and what i say is thisif one of your riders tries to piss standing up itll run down her leg and if you didnt notice you ought to take your eyes to a smith and get em sharpened youre not joking gerin said slowly that was foolish and he knew it as far as he could tell aragis never joked the fox pointed toward the riders who as they usually did stayed a little apart from the rest of the warriors show me this woman you say is there father dyaus if you dont know a woman when you see one aragis didnt merely guffaw he giggled gerin wondered if a demon had taken possession of him it would have to be a very silly demon to get a giggle past aragis lips the archer took him by the arm all right come on then if you need showing ill show you while im about it shall i tell you how to make children too i have the hang of that thanks gerin said through clenched teeth now do as you said you would come on then aragis was still chuckling as he headed for rihwins riders gerin following fumed the archers head went this way and that gerin was about to start jeering when aragis arm shot out there by the gods talking to your own son she is did he bring her along to keep himself amused on campaign thats not a the words clogged in gerins throat the rider standing there talking with rihwin was the very younglooking fellow with the very fuzzy beard hed noticed a couple of times on the way south from fox keep hed thought that an improbable beard for such a young man to have now that he took a closer look he saw it was improbable because it wasnt real recognizing that it wasnt real he took a closer look at the face under it maeva he exclaimed vans daughter whipped her head around dagref spun toward his father and aragis then resigned turned back to face maeva gerin caught a few words of what he was saying bound to happen sooner or later well fox aragis said chuckling still is that a woman or have you forgotten what they look like that is a woman gerin agreed seriously that is a woman who now that youve found her out is liable to kill you for doing it aragis started to laugh some more then looked at him the archer looked at maeva too she stood a couple of digits taller than he did and was wider through the shoulders too and as gerin had recognized her face aragis recognized her name considering who her father is youre likely the one who isnt joking now he said not even a little bit the fox answered i tell you my fellow king i shouldnt want her angry at me he raised his voice maeva come here if youd be so kind dagref youd better come too you seem to have known what was going on yes i knew father dagref said with impressive artificial calm what of it you never forbade maeva to come on campaign with us and i never thought id have to forbid her to come on campaign with us gerin said because i never thought shed do it dagref talked right through him and she killed at least one imperial and wounded three more if that doesnt show she can hold her own on the field what does she have to do to prove it gerin started to answer that then stopped when he realized he had no good answer handy he turned to maeva what will your father say when he finds out youve come to war she shrugged which only made her shoulders seem wider hell probably shout and scream at me she answered but what can he say now im here and ive already fought he would have done the same thing he did do the same thing back when he was my age younger gerin said absently but he was a man youre here and alive and with a dead foeman dagref put in that is what you were going to say isnt it father aragis snorted gerin gave him a dirty look and dagref another then the fox spotted a tall nodding horsehair crest of crimson he waved in that direction van waved back gerin waved again this time to bring his friend over im not going to say anything right now he said as van ambled toward him ill leave that to maevas father maeva herself gave him a look he would sooner not have had but she stood straight and waited for van to arrive he towered over her but he towered over almost everyone hello fox he boomed what do you need me for now i was just about to he followed gerins glance toward maeva for a moment the fox didnt think hed recognize her under the false whiskers shed stuck to her face gerin was ready to twit van for that before remembering he hadnt penetrated maevas disguise either and then van did his grayblue eyes got very wide he started to say something but all that came out of his mouth was a wordless coughing croak of astonishment hello father maeva said by then she had her voice under control it was a strong contralto that could easily have been mistaken for the treble of a youth whose voice hadnt brokenalthough such a youth probably wouldnt have sprouted so thick a beard still gerin wasnt altogether astonished shed managed to pull off the imposture most people saw what they expected to see heard what they expected to hear maeva was as big as a man she was in a place where only men were expected to be she handled her weapons like a man so what else but a man was she likely to be an illustration of the difference between whats likely and what is the fox thought van finally found words what are you doing here they werent the best words perhaps but gerin would have been hard pressed to come up with better on the spur of the moment maeva had had the chance to compose herself why spinning thread and baking bread of course she answered with irony she must have learned from dagref van stared and spluttered dagref sounding helpful when in fact he was anything but said shes one of rihwins riders she killed an imperial and wounded a couple of more what will your mother say van demanded of his daughter that made gerin stare he couldnt ever remember hearing van use fands name in such a fashion before evidently maeva couldnt either with a shrug she replied when you go on campaign you dont pay attention to what mother says why do you think im going to listening with an analytical ear gerin admired that it assumed maeva had as much business going on campaign as anyone else the fox waited to see if van would accept or even notice that unspoken assumption the outlander shook his head like a bear bedeviled by bees its not the same not the same at all he said fine woman that your mother is theres only so long i can stand being in the same place with her do you think its any different for me maeva asked van coughed then turned red beneath his bronzed hide well aye its some different he answered and let it go at that rather than explaining how it was different that would have involved explaining how adultery ranked alongside fighting as his favorite campaign sports he coughed again then said now that i know youre here ill say youve had your fun and now youre to go back to fox keep where you belong maeva set her chin no she said a reply remarkable for simplicity and succinctness somehow the shade of red van turned was different this time i am your father ill have you know and what i tell you that you shall do no maeva said again did you pay any attention to what your father told you once youd killed your first man he was dead by then van said an answer that was not really an answer he turned to gerin youre the king fox if you tell her to go home and keep herself safe shell have to do it gerin suffered his own coughing fit then in all the years hed known van the outlander had never appealed to his authority till now thoughtfully he said i dont know isnt a lone girl on the road liable to face more danger than one in the middle of our own army she can take care of van began and then a couple of words too late stopped in his tracks dagref as was his way drove home the logical flaw with a mallet if she can take care of herself what point to sending her home maeva sent him a grateful look the one van sent him was anything but gerin said i dont think youre going to win this one old friend if she were a boy you wouldnt be trying but shes no boy which is the point to the business van said stubbornly i know soldiers and wait the fox held up a hand i know maeva too dont you think anyone who tried to touch her if she didnt care to be touched would end up a eunuch like the priests of biton and that bloody quick van kept frowning not right he said again not even close to right after a moment gerin figured out what was likely troubling him no doubt maeva could protect herself if she didnt want to be touched what if she did want to be touched though that had to be in vans mind aragis said youre not going to send her home he sounded as if this was the first time hed imagined that possibility gerin bowed to him lord king there she is he pointed to maeva if you think you can order her home and make it stick go ahead me i dont like to waste orders that wont be obeyed it weakens every other order i give after that one way to do it would be to forbid her from any future fighting here aragis said and to post guards around her to make sure she cannot join it he was not a fool he would never have done so well for himself had he been a fool maevas face fell gerin could indeed do that van saw as much too where his daughter wilted he beamed thats the way by the gods he said and bowed to aragis i thank you archer thats just the way oh yes a splendid suggestion dagref said had gerin loosed his own sarcastic tones quite so freely when he was younger on reflection he decided he had no wonder no one had liked him much dagref went on not only does it take one proved fighter out of the army it takes half a dozen or however many more out to watch her and make certain she doesnt do what shes already shown shes good at doing maeva had eyed him with a certain speculation back at fox keep he hadnt noticed then if he didnt notice now he was blind besides his education in such things had advanced since then but maybe he didnt after all for aragis was eyeing him too i am a king young fellow the archer said coldly do you cast scorn on me on you lord king of course not dagref answered but a king can spout foolishness like anyone else if you dont believe me listen to my father for a while aragis pursed his lips then turned back to gerin if that one can fight as well as he talks he will be dangerousif you let him live honh van broke in weve said the same thing about ferdulf close enough no wonder those two get on pretty well dagref took no notice of that he spoke to gerin who hadnt managed to get a word in edgewise about aragis suggestion father one of the things you always talk about is giving people the chance to do what theyre good at why else would you have made carlun your steward because you werent old enough yet to do the job the fox suggested perhaps a fourth in jest his son ignored him his son was good at ignoring him and getting better why else do you teach peasants to read and write if maevas good at fighting and wants to do it why shouldnt she have the chance you cant get maimed with a pen and a scrap of parchment in your hands curse it van said gerin still hadnt said anything no matter what he did say he realized he was going to make people he cared about unhappy he hated having to speak in circumstances like that too many times though he had no choice this was one of them slowly he said maeva has proved what she can do that she came south with us proves she wanted to do it much as id like to i cant see any justice in sending her back thank you lord king maeva said quietly dagref looked as pleased as if hed invented her van looked like a thunderstorm about to spill over maeva went on now i peel this fuzz off my face were i you i wouldnt gerin said with the beard you look like any other northern warrior near enough without it the imperials will see youre something out of the ordinary and take special care against you thats the last thing you ever want on the battlefield ive got rid of a good many foes who didnt think i was dangerous till too late i dont know van said i want em afraid of me with his tallplumed helm his gleamingly polished corselet of solid bronze and his great size and bulk he smashed gerins principle to smithereens he had the strength and skill to get away with it too dagref said a lot of the southerners shave their faces they might not take maeva for a woman just for a northerner who does likewise if youll remember son gerin said with a certain relish i didnt say they were liable to take her for a woman i said they were liable to take her for something out of the ordinary a man from north of the high kirs without a beard is out of the ordinary too why so he is dagref said youre right father he was not least disconcerting because he had no trouble admitting he was wrong gerin rubbed his own chin hed shaved his face when he came back up from the city of elabon but harsh ceaseless teasing had made himand rihwin tooconform in outward appearance if not in what lay beneath thank you lord king maeva said again i will do everything i can to show myself a worthy warrior for you i shall have words for you presently young lady van said and stomped off somehow that particular salutation seemed out of place when aimed at someone in a leather shirt with bronze scales sewn into pockets on it you handled that smoothly aragis said to gerin the fox supposed he meant it for a compliment i wouldnt have decided as you did but i can see how and why you did it which i never would have guessed when i spied your new warrior with a nod to maeva that might have been ironic or might not he took himself off too maeva went back toward the rest of the riders gerin expected dagref to follow her but the youth stayed i want to thank you father for keeping maeva with the army he said if youd ordered her back to fox keep i would have used the promise i won from you to make you change your mind would you gerin said and his son nodded half the foxmaybe more than halfwished he had ordered maeva back that would have rid him of the promise at a price he could afford now who could say what dagref would come up with now gerin eyed his son in a speculative way you must think a lot of her if youd give up the promise for that shes like a sister to me dagref said then a moment later he turned pink with characteristic honesty he corrected himself maybe not quite like a sister he didnt so much leave as flee rubbing his chin once more gerin stared after him the next morning gerins men and aragis moved south after the imperials the pursuit went slowly gerin had expected it would but it was even slower than hed looked for in their withdrawal the soldiers of the elabonian empire had manhandled boulders onto the elabon way and scattered caltrops not only on the road but in the fields to either side of it we may have won a battle fox but we havent won the war aragis the archer said theyll be ready to take us on again before long i thought as much from the way they pulled back gerin answered i said so to whoever would listen nobody much listened i wish id been wrong every so often he would roll past wreckage of the army he had beaten a chariot fallen to pieces a dead horse a hastily dug grave brown against the green of the fields to mark the final resting place of some imperial trooper whod died slowly instead of quickly every time he spotted a grave he wondered if maeva had seen it that probably didnt matter no one her age believed anything bad could happen to her the years taught you otherwise sooner or latermore often sooner a rider came trotting back from around a bend in the road lord king he shouted and then remembering himself lord kings what have the imperials gone and done now gerin asked lord king the scout answered seeming relieved to be speaking to a single sovereign lord king theres a wall across the road gerin pictured a barricade of rocks and logs perhaps with a few dismounted archers behind it to give approaching warriors a greeting less friendly than they might have wanted did you ride around it he asked do they have an ambush somewhere back of it couldnt ride around it lord king the horseman said its too wide to ride around he stretched out his arms as far as they would go whats he talking about aragis demanded irritably i dont know the fox admitted best thing i can think for us to do is go have a look for ourselves he tapped dagref on the shoulder forward wed better find out as soon as the chariot rounded the bend he saw the horseman had been telling the truth his own visualization had been at fault the wall was of red brick about ten feet high and stretched off to east and west as far as the eye could see van said the imperials couldnt have built that of course not gerin agreed or their soldiers couldnt have anyway its sorcerous without a doubt maybe its an illusion van said hopefully maybe if we go up to it we can go right through it it looked very solid of course an illusion that didnt look solid wouldnt have been much of an illusion gerin jumped down from the chariot he walked up to the brick wall and slapped it with the palm of his hand it felt very solid too suddenly suspicious he closed his eyes and walked forward he bumped his nose not too hard because he wasnt going too fast he opened his eyes he was staring at bricks up so close they were blurry he backed away the bricks became sharp and clear they didnt disappear no matter how hard he wished they would more and more of the army came round the bend in the road gerin heard the exclamations of surprise that rose from his men and aragis some were just exclamations of surprise he could deal with those he was surprised himself others though ones that came mostly from his men were full of confidence that he could get rid of the wall in short order van had his own ideas about how to do that saying dont be shy with the cursed thing he shouted for a hammer when he got onea stout bronzeheaded tool that looked about as deadly as the mace he carriedhe slammed it into the wall with all his strength nothing happened except that he grunted in pain and rubbed at his shoulder didnt even dent it he said in disgust you wouldnt gerin said its magical really van said packing enough sarcasm into the word to prove hed lived a good many years in fox keep aragis the archer said this is why i wanted you with me fox not against me gerin glared at him why so i can look like an idiot in front of your men and mine both aragis expression was one of stolid incomprehension he was convinced gerin was a marvelous mage nothing would unconvince him except watching the fox fail in that case he was liable to get unconvinced in a hurry hoping to sidestep the issue gerin looked around and shouted ferdulf what do you want the little demigod demanded he was back to being surly most of the time gerin wouldnt have let that bother him now he would have been glad for a little of the grudging gratitude ferdulf had shown right after the battle against the empire since he didnt have it he went ahead without can you fly up over the wall and tell us whats on the other side of it grass ferdulf said trees cows elabonians go far enough and there are mountains i dont need to fly over it to tell you that gerin exhaled through his nose i will not let the little divine bastard get my goat he thought with as much patience as he could he said knowing exactly where the imperials are might be good for us well probably fight them again once we get past the wall you know oh all right ferdulf said sulkily and hopped up into the air what happened next made everyone who saw it exclaim in surprise and alarm as ferdulf rose so did the wall in front of him he exclaimed tooangrily he didnt much care about obeying gerin having the elabonian empire thwart him was something else again but as fast as he flew as high as he flew whichever way from side to side he flew the wall rose to keep him from passing over it when he flew lower it shrank as if it or the wizard in charge of it could sense exactly how high he was at any given moment when he returned to the ground the wall went back to being what it had been before he started flying ten feet high and very solidlooking gerin rubbed his nose it felt as solid as it looked you ought to knock it down ferdulf said a wall like that has no business existing in the first place van didnt have much luck and if its magical im not sure we can knock it down gerin said for instance how thick is it i dont know ferdulf answered i think youre pretty thick yourself though if you stand here and let it baffle you rihwin the fox came riding over to gerin nice piece of work isnt it he said with the tones of one admiring a fellow professionals achievement even when that achievement inconvenienced him hed studied sorcery down in the city of elabon till a jape played on a senior wizard got him expelled from the sorcerers collegium despite that expulsion hed been a better mage than gerin up to the moment when mavrix took away his sorcerous powers he still knew magic well even if he couldnt work it any more id like it better if it werent so nice gerin said oh but its as pretty a use of the law of similarity as ive ever seen rihwin protested not only in building the wall but also in making detection of the keystoneor rather in this case the key brickas difficult as possible what nonsense is he spouting now aragis demanded irritably gerin took no notice of his fellow king father dyaus he whispered i do believe youre right of course im right rihwin said when have you ever known me to be mistaken pray tell only when you open your mouth gerin replied which reduced rihwin to irate splutters gerin ignored those too he walked up to the wall and examined it brick by brick sure enough each brick was identical to all its neighbors not just similar to them but identical each one had a chip near the center each had a scratch at the upper lefthand corner and each over to the right had embedded in it a tiny crystal or flake of mica that sparkled when the light caught it at the right angle isnt that interesting he murmured now youre the one full of drivel aragis complained tell me at once whats going on one of their wizards took a brick and sorcerously duplicated it about as many times as there are drops of water in the niffet gerin answered if i could find out which brick is the real one i wouldnt have any troublewell not much troublemaking the wall disappear ah aragis said and then all right i was beginning to wonder whether you were able to talk sense or not i see you are good as i told you i wanted you on my side because of the wizardry you know nowfind that brick and get rid of it rihwin had the grace to give gerin a sympathetic look its not quite so easy as that im afraid gerin said one of these bricks along the bottom row is sure to be the brick but which one go ahead lord kingyou tell me which one it is youre the wizard aragis said youre the one whos supposed to know things like that now get to work curse it he might have been ordering a lazy serf to spread manure over a field i cant tell which brick it is by looking any more than you can gerin said that means ive got a couple of thousand to choose from and thats liable to mean well be here for a while can we go around the bloody thing aragis asked maybe gerin said but i wouldnt bet anything i cared to lose on it my guess is that if the wall can go up and down to keep ferdulf from flying over it itll go from side to side to keep us from getting by it that makes more sense than i wish it did aragis said how do you go about finding out which brick is the brick then you have not put forward an easy question lord king rihwin the fox said the essence of the law of similarity centering on resemblance distinguishing between prototype and likeness is by its nature a daunting task if it were easy the cursed imperials wouldnt have bothered running up the wall in the first place aragis retorted he folded his arms across his chest and looked over toward gerin well well my fellow king much as i hate to disappoint youand to disappoint myself i might addi havent the faintest idea which one is the brick gerin answered i told you that once already maybe i can figure out some sort of sorcerous test though the gods only know how long thatll take or whether itll work youd need a god to tell you which one brick out of thousands is the real one and his voice trailed away youd need a godor maybe a demigod how about it ferdulf you want something more from me ferdulf said indignantly his sigh declared that he was put upon far beyond anything his powers might have made acceptable there are times when i wonder why the gods ever bothered creating mortals in the first place some sithonian philosophers wonder whether mortals didnt create gods instead of the other way round gerin said which made ferdulf despite being descended from a sithonian deity give him a horrible look he wished hed kept his mouth shut since he hadnt he went on in smoothly ingratiating tones be that as it may can you use your own great powers to see what we cannot it would give you another chance to have a go at the elabonian empire and embarrass the imperial wizard who put up the wall thinking it would stop us so easily oh all right even in agreement ferdulf was petulant in that he took after his father he floated up a foot or so into the air and drifted along to the west a couple of hundred yards its this one right here he didnt raise his voiceor gerin didnt think he didbut it came as clear as if hed been standing by the fox a helpful soldier ran forward and set his hand on the brick after ferdulf left it gerin trotted over to it ignoring the weight of his bronzeandleather armor to look at it was just another brick in the wall hed expected nothing different he turned to van whod followed him will you do the honors i will and gladly the outlander answered he smashed at the brick with the bronzeheaded hammer when a chip flew from it chips flew from all the others along the wall soldiers cheered van hit the brick again and again till it cracked in three places the rest of the bricks cracked too van pushed at one of the pieces with his foot it came away from the rest of the brickand the wall vanished about a hundred feet behind it stood a fellow in a fancy robe who looked absurdly surprised to be staring all at once at the entire army of the northlands thats a wizard gerin exclaimed as the man turned to run dont let him get away ill take care of that van growled he snatched up a piece of the brick he had broken and flung it at the sorcerer it caught him between the shoulderblades he went down on his face with a dismayed squawk before he could get to his feet again dagref and a couple of other men whod run after him jumped on him and frogmarched him back to gerin and aragis hello the fox said mildly i gather youre to blame for this latest bit of unpleasantness the wizard didnt answer gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth in mock dismay and i remembered manners south of the high kirs being so much smoother than they are here in the northlands tell us what to call you anyhow lengyel the sorcerer replied to that without hesitation it was after all only his usename not his hidden true name well lengyel suppose you start answering my questions gerin said still sounding mild but looking anything but well lengyel suppose you start answering questions or well see how long you last up on a cross aragis added youll have a cursed hard time working magical passes with your hands nailed to the wood sounding mild was beyond the archer but he did seem more matteroffact than menacing to gerin at least that made him more frightening not less it seemed to have the same effect on lengyel who did not look to be in a good position to work passes anyhow not with dagref jamming one arm up behind his back and the other held tight against his side after licking his lips the wizard said tell me what you want to know you were the fellow who made this wall the fox repeated yes lengyel said and then spoke in some exasperation and i certainly did not expect a pack of semibarbarous backwoods bumpkins to penetrate its secret quickly i did not expect you to penetrate them at all in fact you keep a civil tongue in your head if you want to keep any tongue in your head aragis said in about the tone gerin would have used to tell blestar to get down off the table dont worry about it archer gerin told him thats how the empire thinks of the northlands its how the empire has always thought of the northlands since the empire hasnt had anything to do with us for the past twenty years you cant expect them to have changed their minds during that time how did lengyels face suddenly twisted in pain stop that he hissed then you stop wiggling your fingers replied dagref who had given the wizards arm a yank i dont know what sorcery you were trying and i dont care to find out either lengyel bowed his head for the first time he seemed to realize the sorcerous wall hadnt come down and he hadnt been caught by a lucky accident you northerners are more clever than id expected he said slowly were clever enough to know were better off out of the empire than in it anyhow gerin said of course you dont have to be very clever to figure out that paying taxes and not getting anything for themno soldiers when the barbarians come over the border no grain when the harvest failsisnt the best bargain in the world you people have paid no taxes the past twenty years and you didnt pay many before that lengyel returned why you deserve to be rewarded for not doing what you should have is beyond me even when we did pay back a long time ago the city of elabon forgot everything this side of the high kirs gerin said that isnt the point aragis said the point is where in the five hells is the imperial army we thrashed once we thrash it again and maybe one more time after that you southerners will figure out that you ought to leave us alone this is the territory of the empire of elabon lengyel said we shall not abandon what is ours i think youd be wise to answer king aragis gerin said if you dont answer hes liable to get insistent and you wouldnt care for that believe me lengyelyou wouldnt lengyel looked at aragis he licked his lips again gerin hadnt said what aragis would do to him if sufficiently displeased hed figured lengyels imagination would come up with something more horrific than anything he might suggest if studying aragis hard face didnt start a frightened imagination working at a gallop nothing ever would to make matters worse aragis smiled the fox would not have wanted to be on the receiving end of that smile by all appearances lengyel didnt either his larynx worked a couple of times before he said the armymy armywill be most of a days journey south of here no doubt regrouping to face you rebuh you northernersonce more and this time come away victorious no doubt gerin said dryly nowwill the other wizards with the army know this wall has fallen or will we be able to give them a surprise greeting lengyel licked his lips again gerin saw evasion forming in his eyes dagref must have sensed the same thing for he gave the wizards arm another jerk upwards aii lengyel yelped have a care youll break it answer my father then dagref said pleasantly yes lengyels voice was sullen they will know too bad gerin said id have like to drop in on them unannounced but as aragis has said we will beat them one way or another van pointed at lengyel what are we going to do with him now keeping a cursed wizard captive in our midst could mean trouble for us so it could gerin said i hope it wont though he raised his voice ferdulf what do you want to annoy me with now ferdulf asked as touchy as he usually was he drifted through the air toward the foxand toward the captured imperial wizard lengyels eyes almost bugged out of his head as he stared at the demigod ferdulf went on what do you think im able to do that youre too stupid to manage for yourself i want you to keep an eye and an ear and whatever other senses you happen to need on this fellow here the fox pointed at lengyel if he tries to make a nuisance of himself with magic stop him if you cant stop him shout for the guards i expect theyll stop him for good yes ill do that ferdulf said a look of nasty anticipation on his face i dont like elabonian wizards not even a little i dont like what they can do either he hadnt cared for landing with a thump in the middle of the battle between the imperials and the men of the northlands he hadnt been able to do anything about it though not till gerin dealt with caffer by means altogether unsorcerous much as the late unlamented certainly by the fox caffer had lengyel asked what manner of creature is this ferdulf is that right before gerin could answer ferdulf shouted i am not a creature wretch you are the creature and a miserable creature you are too ill have you know i am the son of a god kindly grant me the respect due my station lengyel was not in a good position to grant anyone respect and dagref and his other captors did not loose their grip on him anyway the wizard spoke to gerin he wont be enough to hold back the might of the empire of elabon nothing will be enough to hold back the might of the empire of elabon do what you will with me for saying so but it remains true no it remains your opinion gerin answered my opinionand i know the empire better than you know the northlands i assure youis that you have no idea what youre talking about he nodded to his son take him away by the time two more days had passed gerin began to wonder how well hed really known the elabonian empire after all the imperials responded to defeat far more resolutely than hed expected they hadnt relied only on their sorcerous wall but had had scouts and skirmishers out south of it the skirmishers when they clashed with gerins men fought hard they wouldnt have acted like this in hildors day aragis said of course in hildors day they stayed down in cassat under the mountains and didnt bother with the rest of the northlands at all this new emperor of theirs must be a real meateater im afraid youre right the fox said gloomily ahead in the distance the latest party of imperial skirmishers fled back toward their own main force some of rihwins riders and a few chariots offering pursuit gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth i hope they arent trying to lure our people into an ambush you dont think they would do you dagref sounded far more alarmed and far less rational than usual gerin needed only a moment to understand why maeva was liable to be among the riders if he said something about that hed only make his son angry at him as well as worried what he did say was well its not beyond the bounds of the possible you know dagref nodded yes thats true he admitted as much to himself as to the fox i hope they dont though all right son i hope they dont too gerin said i do want to remind you our captains didnt get to be captains because they were so generous and trusting theyd follow the enemy wherever he went without another thought in their heads yes thats also true dagref said of course if all captains were as clever as you make out no ambush would ever work and we know thats not so van boomed laughter hes got you there fox i never thought id see the day when you were outlogicked but your sprout can do it now and then youre right gerin said and let it go at that van evidently hadnt figured out what dagref had that his daughter was liable to be riding into danger gerin supposed that meant dagref had outlogicked the outlander too had he been dagrefs age himself he would have pointed it out being the age he was he kept quiet not all the things the years had brought were welcome but discretion often came in handy before long the riders and chariots returned no ambuscade had awaited them and for that matter maeva was not among them dagref had the grace to look sheepish some little while later as the chariot rattled south along the elabon way van let out several startled oaths whats biting you gerin asked what nothing never mind van shook his head and looked determined not to answer the fox decided pushing him right then would probably be a bad idea the outlander had taken a while to work out what dagref saw right away was his guess and didnt care for it any more than dagref had nothos elleb and tiwaz were in the sky when the army camped that night the first pale moon a thin crescent swiftmoving tiwaz a much fatter one almost at first quarter and ruddy elleb a couple of days before full rihwin said i think theyll fight us again soon tomorrow or the day after if they wait much longer well be down to cassat youre likely right gerin said he caught one yawn then let another one loose they wont fight us tonight though with the ghosts abroad traveling by night will be more dangerous to them than we would there you speak sooth lord king rihwin answered he yawned too i shall have a good nights rest the better to lay waste the imperials come morning and the better to forget i was once a man from south of the mountains myself yes you had better forget that hadnt you gerin said pointedly he yawned again me im going to forget everything but my bedroll morning dawned bright and clear it also dawned without lengyel both his guards were asleep and remained so despite repeated efforts to shake them awake some drug or other i judge gerin growled examining the prostrate men with no small annoyance maybe he had it secreted on his person or maybe he found an herb he could use when he went behind a bush either way he raised his voice to a shout ferdulf what now the demigod demanded drifting over from some distance away the wizard escaped the fox snapped i didnt know anything about it ferdulf said he looked at lengyels unconscious guards too he didnt use magic to do it thats what i was looking for thats what you told me to look for if youll recall gerin exhaled angrily i dont care if the whoreson bored them to sleep reading bad poetry i didnt want him loose thats not what you said ferdulf replied with considerable aplomb i cant keep track of everything at once you know im only superhuman in the abstract gerin admired the line he had scant time to worry about the abstract since you let him get away i did no such thing ferdulf retorted you were charged with keeping him here gerin said i was charged with making sure he did not escape by magic the demigod said i did as i was charged and he did not escape by magic if a couple of witless mortals let him up and wander off when he didnt even have to bother with sorcery thats hardly my problem now is it he folded his skinny arms across his narrow chest and floated off the ground till he was staring the fox straight in the eye the expression on his face ached for a slap regretfully gerin held off from delivering it instead keeping his voice light he said it depends on how you look at things i suppose if you dont mind taking the chance that his magic will do worse things to you than caffers did you may be right ferdulf might have had a god for a father but he wasnt much better than any other fouryearold at looking ahead to the likely consequences of things he didand things he didnt do he was unhappy enough at what gerin said to let his feet scuff the dirt once more all rightwhat should i do about that he asked in tones much less toplofty than he usually used now that he has escaped can you use your powers to hunt him down or to help some troopers hunt him down gerin asked i dont think so ferdulf frowned or maybe i can i could try anyway gerin nodded he rose into the air now till he drifted high above the encampment like a badtempered cloud he twisted his body so that he faced due west then slowly began bearing ever more to the south gerin wondered what sort of sense he was using to feel for the vanished lengyel had it been a sense the fox possessed he could have done the search himself up in the sky ferdulf suddenly stiffened he dropped a few feet as he had a way of doing when he wasnt paying full attention to his flying were he wholly divine no doubt he wouldnt have had to worry about such things were he wholly divine gerin would have had to worry much more about him there he called down to the fox pointing southwest hes going that way that way was the direction in which gerin was almost certain the bulk of the imperial army lay how far away is he he shouted up to ferdulf can you tell hard to be sure ferdulf answered i wasnt sure i could find him at all you know yes yes gerin said but is it worth my while to send a few men after him or has he got back safe to the enemys main camp the little demigod dropped a few feet more i cant tell he said sounding angry at gerin lengyel and himself i wish i could but i cant a pestilence gerin muttered i wish you could too he looked around for aragis the archer wasnt far away shall we send men after the wizard gerin asked him were it up to me id say yes but youre the overall commander if you want to hold back and let him go i wont quarrel are you daft aragis growled of course send men after him bringing him back is worth the risk send some of your riders its the sort of thing theyd be good fortheyre faster than men afoot and they can go places where chariotry cant chase him till he wishes hed never run away good enough as gerin shouted for rihwin he reflected that the best way to fight aragis was liable to be leading him into a trap a place where hed think he had an easy victory but where in fact more foes waited than hed expect for the moment though he was an ally how many men would you have me send lord king rihwin asked and shall i take ferdulf if hell go with you certainly gerin answered thatll make it harder for lengyel to turn your troopers into toads he raised an eyebrow youre going to lead this chase yourself by your leave i am rihwin said since i could not even detect the presence of a woman warrior among my men id fain reassure myself that i am on occasion capable of seeing beyond the end of my nose fair enough gerin told him but dont just have your eyes open for lengyel remember the imperials are liable to be waiting for you somewhere out there too he hesitated then asked and how did maeva seem to you as a warrior i mean oh i understood you you need not fret over that rihwin looked chagrined had aragis not noticed what she was i doubt i should have done so this you must follow disturbs me for not one but two reasons first that she performs in every way so much like a man and second that i of all people simply failed to note her femininity and what would you have done if you had gerin asked and then answered his own question if she didnt make you sing soprano for trying to do that her father would have i do not molest women who find my attentions unwelcome rihwin replied with dignity given the number who find those attentions most welcome i have no need to bother or bother with the others what with the number of bastards hed fathered over the years that comment held no small grain of truth with more dignity still he went on in any event the charms of a womanor i should say a girlof that age hold little appeal for me all right im persuaded gerin said now go off and but rihwin once begun was not so easily headed maeva may well be attractive to someone with fewer years than myself your son for example immediately springs to mind aye he does doesnt he gerin said which seemed to disconcert rihwinmaybe hed expected indignant denials gerin waved his fellow fox forward go on get after that wizard dont stand around gabbing all day rihwin and a squadron of his riders went trotting south a few minutes later ferdulf went along with them gerin wouldnt have wanted to be an imperial mage the little demigod flushed out of hiding on the other hand he wouldnt have wanted to be rihwin using ferdulf as a hunting hound either most hunting hounds had the sovereign virtue of not talking back rihwin and his men had been gone only moments when someone spoke to gerin in a reedy tenor lord king he turned and found himself facing a fuzzybearded youth he needed a heartbeat to remember the beard was false and the tenor in fact a contralto what is it maeva he asked cautiously when you sent the riders out just now vans daughter asked did you tell rihwin not to put me in that squadron no gerin answered maybe i would have if it had occurred to me but it didnt i didnt tell him anything one way or the other did he say i did no he didnt say that maeva said but when he didnt choose me i wondered can you blame me i suppose not the fox admitted if youre going to do this though theres something i want you to think about all right what either in her own proper person or disguised as a man maeva was no one to trifle with this gerin said just because you can be chosen to do this that or the other thing doesnt mean you will be chosen all the time or that you have to be chosen it may just mean you werent chosen this one time and you may be the next maeva considered that with almost the grave intensity dagref might have shown at last she said all right lord king thats fair enough as far as it goes but if im never chosen for anything dangerous then it doesnt go far enough if that happens ill get angry her eyes blazed as if to warn that getting her angry was not a good idea being acquainted with her parents gerin could haveindeed hadfigured that out for himself he considered her words in turn youre with the army maeva youre fighting if you think none of the imperials could have killed you in the last battle maybe i should send you home after all she tossed her head a feminine gesture odd when combined with the false beard stuck to her chin and cheeks nobody knewwell nobody but dagref knewwho i was what i was i was just another trooper its not going to be like that any more it cant be like that any more i wish it could im not going to send you back no matter how much your father wishes i would gerin said that means youre going forward youll get more fighting believe me you will he paused what will your mother think when you come home fand was formidable but not in the same way maeva was my mother you heard me tell my father i didnt worry about that much but maeva thought it over my mother would probably say i didnt need to put on armor and carry a bow if i wanted to fight with men gerin laughed yes that probably is what shed say he wondered whether maeva knew he and fand had been lovers for a while in the dark time between elises leaving him and his meeting selatre if she did he wondered what she thought he saw no way to ask he didnt really want to find out some curiosity was better left unsatisfied he let out a small snort rihwin would surely disagree with him there but then rihwin didnt believe in holding back on anything whats funny now lord king maeva asked sometimes the things you dont do are as important as the things you do he answered maeva cocked her head to one side no doubt wondering how that could possibly be amusing would dagref have understood maybe maybe not too the fox couldnt think of anyone else so young who might have when gerin didnt seem inclined to explain further maeva went off scratching her head he was unoffended hed sent his vassals off bemused more times than he could count most of those times had worked out all right that gave him reason to hope this one would too he peered south and kicked at the dirt he also hoped rihwins chase after lengyel would work out all right but he had no particular reason to believe it would rihwin could perform far better than anyone who knew him only slightly might imagine he could also perform far worse until he did whatever he did on any given day no one could guess what that would be trees blocked gerins view he couldnt see as far as he would have liked he couldnt see ferdulf in the air any more either what was happening out there where he couldnt see how foolish had it been to let rihwin and ferdulf each erratic by himself go off together how sorry would he be when he found out how foolish hed been was that a bird in the sky down there to the south nono bird had ever flown with such a smooth effortless motion that was ferdulf and what did the birds think of the little demigod who invaded their domain gerin would have bet they found him as annoying as everyone else did he was coming this way and out from behind those trees here came horsemen they had people on foot with them gerin took that for a good sign also promising was the way ferdulf kept flying down and darting into the faces of the men on foot as if they were chariot horses of the soldiery of the elabonian empire the fox wondered if ferdulf was doing anything disgusting to them from on high that didnt seem the best way to treat prisoners he supposed they were gerin trotted toward the returning horsemen so did aragis so did a good many ordinary soldiers a lot of people were still curious to learn what the riders could do a horseman detached himself from the rest and approached the fox at a rapid trot after a moment gerin saw it was rihwin we have him rihwin shouted as soon as he was close enough for his voice to carry the soldiers cheered gerin clapped his hands together aragis looked astonished and didnt bother hiding it gerin called who are all the others you have there a round dozen of the fanciest whores off the streets of the city of elabon rihwin answered gerin blinked the soldiers burst into louder cheers rihwin waved them down would it were so but alas it isnt theyre imperial troopers at whose forward camp lengyel was staying they offered no resistance for we not only outnumbered them two to one but also came on them by surprise thanks going almost entirely to the aid ferdulf furnished you probably wouldnt have been able to do it in chariots would you gerin asked and rihwin shook his head aragis said i never denied horsemen had their uses fox i even said this was one of them dont twit me here he didnt sound so angry as he might have he couldnt have expected rihwin to succeed as fully as he had here came lengyel looking even more dejected than he had when the men of the northlands captured him the first time hello again gerin greeted him arent you glad were barbarians and dont know what were doing delighted im sure lengyel said sourly which made gerin respect him for the first time as a man rather than simply as a dangerous sorcerer rihwin said and lord kinglord kingswe have booty that may prove as valuable and delightful as our victory itself has been he pointed to the mounts of some of his riders the animals had skins tied on behind the horsemen grinning he went on here we find precious treasure scarcely seen in the northlands for a generation of men rihwin you didnt gerin began oh but lord king my fellow fox i did rihwin broke in did you think that after so long i could resist the allure of so much splendid glorious magnificent wine vi you idiot gerin said to rihwin you clodpoll you jackanapes you bungler you cretin you jobbernowl you madman you fool you loon you twit you lout you thank you lord king i have by now some notion of your opinion so you need not elaborate further rihwin said oh but i was just warming up gerin said i hadnt even begun to discuss your ancestry if any your habits and how lovingly the demons of the five hells will roast you after you diewhich may be far sooner than you think for im bloody tempted to murder you myself be reasonable my fellow fox rihwin said a request to which gerin might usually be expected to respond well could you imagine i would pour the blood of the sweet grape out onto the uncaring ground rather than bringing it home in triumph and what about the lord of the sweet grape rihwin gerin shouted too furious for reason to hold any appeal what about mavrix do you want to deal with mavrix do you want mavrix to deal with you what happens when mavrix and ferdulf make each others acquaintance how far away would you like to be when that happens can you get to a place so far away i dont know rihwin said an answer more inclusive than specific why didnt you bother thinking about any of those things ahead of time gerin demanded though he knew the answer only too well at the sight of wine anything resembling thought had fled from rihwins head rihwin said lord king imagine if youd been without a woman for most of the last twenty years and then found not one but half a dozen beautiful maids all of them not only willing but eager would you leave them behind would you spill their blood out on the ground instead of enjoying them its not the same and dont you try to distract me gerin said you havent exactly been pining away youve made do quite well with ale a man who wants women can without them make do with boys rihwin replied he can even if his temper runs that way make do with sheep making do though will not stop him from wanting women i ought to spill this wine right now gerin grated hed meant that to alarm rihwin instead it made the transplanted southerner brighten you mean you shant spill it out not right now gerin answered reluctantly not till i think it through which is a cursed lot more than you ever bothered doing blessings upon you lord king rihwin cried in fervent tones he seized gerins hand which alarmed his overlord then he kissed it which alarmed gerin even more have no fear rihwin said his eyes sparkling with amusement i am not one of those who wanting boys make do with women of that you may rest assured he changed notes yet again er lord kingwhy arent you going to spill the wine out on the ground gerin let out a weary sigh because ive seen more often than it suits memuch more often than it suits methat you and wine and the will of the gods are somehow all tied together the only reason i can think of to make it so is that your head is altogether empty inside which means they have no trouble filling it with their desires i loved the blood of the sweet grape long before i made mavrixs acquaintance rihwin said i should have been as glad not to make that acquaintance and i should have gone on loving wine had i not made it all of that is no doubt true gerin replied none of it has anything to do with how many pits of wheat are buried around the village by fox keep and none of it i fear has anything to do with why you found that wine and why you decided to bring it back here to our camp this may be so lord king rihwin said let us assume it is so if it be so if i act at the will of the gods rather than pursuant to my own will how is it you are furious with me when i was but the emptyheaded conduit through which they manifested their will because gerin stood there with his mouth hanging open realizing he had no good answer at last he said because youre handy curse it adding a moment later and because youd have brought back that wine even without a god whispering in your ear and you bloody well know it such a claim is all the better for proof rihwin said loftily if you do not purpose spilling the wine what will you do with it set a guard over it so you cant guzzle it gerin replied at once and watched rihwins face fall and so no one else can either he said for good measure but that did little to cheer his fellow fox you take all the fun out of life rihwin complained i hope so gerin said which made rihwin angrier yet the wine stayed under guard rihwin kept right on grumbling he wasnt the only one either most of those grumbles gerin simply ignored he couldnt ignore the ones from aragis the archer well go ahead my fellow king the fox said if you want to see what will happen go ahead if you want to meet mavrix face to face go ahead youre a king you can do as you pleasetill a god tells you otherwise anyhow suppose i drink it and nothing happens aragis demanded then you get to call me a fool gerin said suppose you drink it and something happens will there be enough left of you for me to call a fool aragis muttered something into his beard that gerin didnt catch the archer stomped off making a point of kicking at the grass at every stride he did not drink any wine gerin thought about teasing him then thought better of it and then he got a request for wine from someone else in a fashion he had not expected ferdulf came up to him in as nearly a polite way as hed ever seen from the demigod may i please have a taste of the blood of the grape he asked gerin stared as far as he could remember hed never heard please from ferdulf before not least because of that he didnt say no right away instead he asked why do you want it why do you think ferdulf replied with somebut not allof his usual irritating sense of superiority gerin had an answer or thought he did but didnt speak it he waited the arrogance leaked out of the demigod in a voice much smaller than ferdulf usually used he said if i drink wine perhaps it will bring my father thither that was the possibility that had occurred to the fox too it was not one that much appealed to him whatever ferdulf thought of it if your father does come he asked cautiously what would you do ferdulf looked confused and unhappy as opposed to malicious and intent on making everyone around him unhappy his more usual aspect i dont know he answered something else he hardly ever said i think id like to ask him why he brought me into the world and what he intends of me thoughthat for a beginning and who can say from there why did he start you gerin thought as best i can tell for no better reason than to annoy me mavrix had certainly succeeded there aloud the fox said why are you asking leave of me you have the strength to overcome the guards ive setim sure of it oh yes ferdulf said carelessly but i know it might cause trouble so i thought i had better ask before i do anything that didnt sound like ferdulf either if nothing else in the world intimidated him mavrix did gerin said i dont really think the time is ripe now tell me the truth do you the little demigod sagged maybe not he said and walked off with his feet on the ground his head down then suddenly he turned back hopping half his height into the air as he did so if my father were to be summoned though would he not take our side against the empire of elabon which has inflicted such indignities on sithonia over the centuries he might the fox admitted and let it go at that adding more would have reminded ferdulf that the men of the northlands were as much elabonians as the imperials he went on in a different vein saying remember what the imperial wizard told us thoughthe empire of elabon has ruled sithonia for all those years and the sithonian gods havent been able to do anything about it except slander the imperials that being so how much good will mavrix do us ferdulf descended to the ground once more he didnt answer but went off in the direction hed chosen before his afterthought gerin concluded he didnt think mavrix would do much good seeing a humble ferdulf was as novel an experience as any the fox had had lately he looked in the direction of the wineskins and the guards around them theyd drawn a fairsized crowd at first that alarmed him then he relaxed a little if a lot of people were hanging about the wine that would make it harder for any one manrihwins smiling face popped into his mindto sneak away with any of the blood of the grape while the fox was thinking thus van came up to him and said by all the gods captain its been a long time since i slugged down any wine if i could just undo the tie on one of those skins now wait fox what in the five hells do you think youre doing looking at me like that curse it fox put your sword back in its sheath have you gone mad no its the whole world around me gerin answered van examined him closely for signs he was joking by the way the outlander walked off shaking his head he didnt find any the next morning the army of the northlands rolled through another of those villages that had trembled on the edge of being towns and were now falling back unmistakably into the lesser status gerin had no time to do anything but mournfully note as much for a couple of bowshots south of the village imperial scouts riding chariots with fast horses began pelting his men and aragis with arrows ha aragis exclaimed they arent as smart as they think they are without waiting for gerins advice he shouted rihwin forward the riders aye lord king rihwin said and shouted orders of his own out rode the horsemen gerin looked to see if he could spot maeva among them but had no luck by the way dagrefs head followed the evolutions of the riders he was looking for maeva too with roughly equal numbers the horsemen routed the charioteers as they had at the first big battle between the imperials and men of the northlands the riders were faster and more maneuverable than their foes they shot no worse than the men in the chariots before long those chariots streamed back toward the southwest in headlong retreat i think we ought to form line of battle gerin told aragis were liable to run into the whole imperial army any time now aragis frowned if we dont run into the imperials moving forward that way will slow us down after a bit of thought though he nodded let it be as you say if we do run into them before were ready theyll make us sorry for it as he had before the earlier battle with the forces of the elabonian empire he halted the army and shouted left and right form line of battle left and right as they had then his men and gerins cheered that still left the fox bemused though he supposed he should have been used to it why didnt they think forming line of battle meant they were about to get maimed or die painful lingering deaths if they thought like that and if their opponents fought the same way nobody would fight wars and then and thenwhat then they would not die painful lingering deaths in battle which was not as gerins logical mind noted the same as saying they would not die painful lingering deaths fever might take them from life raving or they might die of a wasting sickness that ate them from the inside out or they might fall over from a fit of apoplexy and linger perhaps for years unable to speak and with half their bodies dead in life when you got down to it there werent any good way ways to die only bad ones and worse ones when measured with that ruler perhaps dying on the battlefield looked less appalling gerin looked up to ferdulf who floated over the army light as thistledown demigods unlike the divine half of their parentage werent immortal they commonly outlived ordinary mortals and they commonly died in ways ordinary mortals might envy such as dropping off to sleep and never waking up the fox wondered if the chance of dying was in ferdulfs thoughts now he doubted it no ordinary fouryearold gave such things a thought then aragis shouted riders to the right and left well hit the imperials on both flanks this time and see if we cant cave em in the horsemen who hadnt joined rihwin in his assault on the imperials cheered as they rode to take the positions to which aragis had ordered them gerin felt like cheering too to his fellow king he said youre learning aragis gave him a wintry look before answering the first time your father set a sword in your hand did you know straightaway everything you could do with it now you have given me a new weapon and i am beginning to discover what it may be good for fair enough gerin said better than fair enough in fact a great many people when they come across something new will either pretend it isnt there or try to use it as if it were old and familiar regardless of whether its really anything like the old and familiar a lot of people are fools cold contempt filled the archers voice tell me youve not seen that in your years as baron and prince and king and ill call you a liar to your face i cant do it gerin answered the difference between us i think is that you scorn men for being fools and i find them funnyat least i do my best to find them funny the gods know its not always easy easy aragis snorted its not worth doing you ask me gerin hadnt expected him to say anything different the archers arrogance had taken him a long way as long a way as it could have taken him unless he overthrew gerin and ruled as king of the whole of the northlands or unless he crossed over the mountains and cast crebbig i down from his throne were all different gerin observed with profound unoriginality so we are aragis said sometimes i think youre lightminded as a trokm then i look at what you do not what you say and i think youre hiding behind a mask all these years and i still havent figured out what to make of you he sent the fox an accusing stare good gerin let it go at that keeping aragis off balance had probably gone a long way toward keeping the two of them from fighting a war before they could take it any further ferdulf whizzed down toward them pointing southwest and shouting if thats not the imperial army beyond the next rise its a herd of elephants a moment later mounted scouts came back with the same news aragis for once looked at ferdulf with approval unalloyed he gave us the news faster than the riders did he took on a thoughtful expression warfare would be a different business if both sides had people up in the air spying on the foe i wonder if you could fight at all if the other bastard knew what you were going to do as you did it you could unless i miss my guess gerin answered youd just have to make it look as if you were going to do one thing while you really intended to do something else aragis studied him now for some time without saying anything when he finally spoke it was in tones of reluctant admiration aye and belike youd find some way to do just that too you are a sneaky demon no mistake he shouted and waved to his troopers and the foxs who werent forming their battle line fast enough to suit him in the car with gerin dagref said how could the archer not have seen that subterfuge would be necessary if each side could observe the others preparations for combat because he doesnt think as fast as you do gerin said and he doesnt like to play with hypotheticals in his mind ill tell you this though son if he really did have to worry about people spying on him from the air his dispositions would be the lyingest ones you ever saw thats a fact van agreed if its real aragis is good with it if its not real he doesnt worry about it foolishness dagref said with a sniff flicking the reins to bring the horses up to a trot the hypothetical has a way of becoming real without warning before it happened who would have thought the elabonian empire would come roaring back over the high kirs to trouble us i didnt think that would happen myself gerin said and id be just as glad if it hadnt happened too believe me the elabon way swung wide and he got his first glimpse of the imperial army but theyre here and were going to have to deal with them van said by the gods weve taught them something like respect they arent swarming toward us the way they did in the first fight then they thought they could ride right over us and make us run they know better now the stinking whoresons yes gerin said not altogether contented with the change in the imperials tactics he wanted his enemies to go right on being stupid it made them much easier to deal with he also glanced over at the outlander and look whos talking about the elabonian empire as if hed been born in the northlands and spent his whole life listening to people running it into the ground go howl van said with dignity its a fight and im on this side so of course the imperials are a pack of bastards if i were over on that side everybody from the northlands would be a filthy rebel there doesnt that make sense more than i like gerin answered he watched rihwins horsemen swing wide to right and left to take the imperial army in the flank the imperials didnt send squadrons of chariotry out against them to try to hold them up theyd learned better than that too what they hadnt learned the fox saw with rising glee was that if they didnt stop the riders they were going to get both wings of their army smashed up in a hurry dagref saw the same thing at the same time what do they think theyre doing he demanded like a schoolmaster faced with unprepared pupils theyre trying to throw the fight away van said ill let em anybody thinks ill complain if they make my work easy is plumb daft he started to elaborategerin knew it was a theme on which he would be able to elaborate for a good long whilebut then grunted in surprise and shut up some of the horses had gone down just as they were nearing bow range of the imperials flanks is that magic father dagref asked do you know i dont think so the fox replied if i had to guess id say the imperials have strewn some caltrops around to either side of their position to help ward their flanks they work against chariot horses so i dont suppose theres anything that would keep them from working against horses with men on top of em some of rihwins riders did get through and started plying the men of the elabonian empire with arrows but some hung back and even those who didnt had to ride more slowly they were an annoyance then not a devastation as they might have been seeing as much the imperials cheered horns blared along their line now they rolled forward they would not receive the attack of the chariots from the northlands while standing still themselves men on both sides shouted gerin and aragis troopers as individuals the imperials in the fierce unison that had seemed so effective in the first battle arrows flew as always the first few fell short but the range between the two armies closed rapidly men began to cry out horses began to scream here and there chariots overturned spilling soldiers onto the ground any place in particular father dagref asked as gerin arrow set to bowstring looked around for his first target the other king doesnt seem to take much care in the way he arranges things does he that held an unmistakable sniff before gerin could reply van laughed and said being the son of your father has spoiled you lad aragis had given us a decent field and a good chance to win if we fight hard and ive seen plenty of captains who lived to grow old and fat even though they were in the habit of handing their men a lot less dagref sniffed again he had high standards and was too young to have realized the trouble most mortals had meeting such standards pointedly he said you still havent answered me father steer for anybody who looks to have fancy armor or a fine team of horses the fox said most men of high rank enjoy showing off honh van said his castbronze corselet and plumed helm were without a doubt the most distinctive gear on the field you heard me gerins armor was not gilded nor even polished the leather that secured the bronze plates in place was scuffed and patched but all the leather and all the plates were sound the horses dagref drove were undersized and roughcoated but they had more endurance than most they were descended from a pony off the plains of shanda for which van had traded while accompanying gerin and elise down to the city of elabon more than twenty years before that horse had been even smaller and uglier but it was tougher than any other gerin ever knew obediently dagref pointed the team at an imperial whose armor was bright with gold paint and who wore a crimson cloak that fluttered behind him gerin let fly the officer of the elabonian empire threw both hands in the air and tumbled out the back of the chariot well shot van shouted though refusing to use the bow in battle he would not hold back praise from others who used it well dagref guided the horses toward another imperial who looked more splendid than his fellows gerin shot at the foeand missed however good a shot he was however much practice he had shooting from the pitching platform of a chariot he missed more often than he hit disappointed but not devastated he reached over his shoulder for another shaft thunk an arrow smote the leftward horse of the team just back of the animals left foreleg the horse went down as if clubbed the arrow must have pierced its heart its fall fouled the other horse the chariot tipped jounced along on one wheel for a couple of frantic heartbeats and then overturned spilling onto the ground all three men in the car gerin heard himself shouting as he flew through the air hed gone out of chariots before he tried to tuck himself into a ball to land as softly as he could even so the soft ground slammed against him as if it were granite his helmet spun off his head and bounced away pain shot through his right side which took most of the impact but when he tried to scramble to his feet he discovered he could nothing broken then that was somethingor would be if he could stay alive long enough to appreciate how lucky he was he was he discovered still holding his bow nohe was still holding a piece of his bow unlike him it had broken when it hit the ground he threw down the chunk in his hand and yanked out his sword then he looked around to see how van and dagref were both of them were on their feet too and seemed sound so for the moment they like he were lucky how long their luckand hiswould last remained problematical not very long seemed the likeliest guess the chariots of the elabonian empire were very close now and getting closer every heartbeat one of them thundered straight toward dagref who being slim and beardless and without sword or spear looked to be the easiest target of the three downed warriors gerin ranslowly favoring his right legto his sons aid dagref proved not to need any aid with him as with the fox looks turned out to deceive though he had no sword or spear hed held on to the whip he used to urge on his team a replacement for the one caffer had turned into a snake he waited till the elabonian chariot was terrifyingly close then lashed out with the whip striking one of the horses on its soft tender nose the animal screamed in shock and pain it stopped dead and tried to rear the driver kept it from doing that but the chariot thundered past dagref instead of riding him down and as it went past the whip lashed out again the driver screamed as loud as the horse had he clutched at his eyes the other two imperials in the car clutched at the reins hed dropped neither one of them could make a clean grab that was unfortunate for them because they got only the one chance dagref cracked the whip again one of them shrieked he shrieked again a moment later when van speared him in the sideshrieked and crumpled gerin scrambled up into the chariot the surviving unwounded imperial was an archer who carried only a dagger for selfdefense he didnt stay unwounded long he scrambled over the rail of the car and ran off howling and dripping blood killing the driver seemed unfair since he still had both hands clapped to his face in the middle of a battle though fair was a flexible notion gerin thrust home hard threw the drivers thrashing body over the side and seized the reins he started to shout for van and dagref but they were already up in the car with him with a flourish he handed his son the reins i think you know what to do with these he said he knows what to do with all sorts of things van said an enormous grin on his face dont you dagref the whip who me dagref looked absurdly pleased with himself a man could get an ekename any number of ways if he was very fair or very fat he might have one before he could toddle or he might be called his fathers son his whole life long earning an ekename on the battlefield didnt happen to everyone it didnt happen to many in fact dagref the whip gerin agreed better than dagref the surly or dagref the brown study or since the whip is still in my hand dagref remarked pointedly a prudent man would save such suggestions for another time a prudent man wouldnt have done a lot of the things ive done over the years gerin said youre the most prudent man i know fox van said that may be true but it doesnt say much for the rest of the people you know gerin retorted fand immediately came to mind but the fox was prudent enough not to mention her instead he said how prudent is it for that matter to ride around in a chariot when none of us has a bow you should have grabbed the one that imperial had before you pitched him out of the car van said aye that would have been prudent gerin agreed if only id thought of it at the time cant think of everything at once though no matter how much i wish i could van said well since we havent got one well have to pretend were some of rihwins riders and see how close we can get to the imperials ive always liked that kind of fighting better anyhow why am i not surprised gerin murmured being so big and so strong the outlander naturally excelled at closequarters fighting a man with a bow though might hurt him before he had the chance to do damage of his own dagref took the discussion between his father and his fathers friend as an instruction for him and guided the chariot toward the nearest one full of imperials the men of the elabonian empire seeing a car that looked like their own took a fatal moment too long to realize the warriors inside were foes van speared one of them dagref kept using the whip to wicked effect and by the time the brief fight was done gerin once more had a bow to call his own he reached over his shoulder to snatch an arrow out of his quiver an imperial screamed like a longtooth a moment later and clutched at the side of his thigh the fox shot another arrow this one missed he reached back yet againand found the quiver empty he scowled the quiver had been nearly full before he spilled out of the chariot before he he growled a curse most of the arrows must have gone flying from the quiver when he hit the ground he hadnt even noticed hed had rather more urgent things on his mind such as staying in one piece come on fox van said why arent you shooting at the whoresons ill tell you what gerin answered as soon as you figure out how to spear them without any spear ill shoot them without any arrows what the outlander stared then his face cleared oh aye we did go arse over souppot there didnt we well all right well have to keep on doing the way we did just now wont we sooner or later everyone will start running out of arrows dagref said oh indeed gerin nodded the next interesting question is whether people will run out of arrows before one gets stuck in one of us thats an interesting question in any fight interesting oh aye heh van snorted then spat in a way that was disgust in another way it was bravado not many warriors on the field gerin would have guessed had enough saliva in their mouths to spit he was a long way from sure he did himself he worked his cheeks experimentally then he stopped worrying about whether he could spit there ahead sure as sure was a gap in the imperials line where chariots had swung right and left around one that had overturned and then hadnt closed up again he looked around not far from himhow theyd got there he hadnt noticedwere a good many chariots full of trokmoi he waved to them a couple of the woodsrunners aimed arrows at him they lowered them when he shouted in their own language through there nowhe pointedand well be after carving a great chunk from the southron spalpeens do you want me to go through that gap and hope the barbarians will follow dagref asked by his tone hed heard ideas he liked much better but gerin said thats just what i want you to do be a mite embarrassing if the trokmoi decide theyd sooner be rid of you than of the cursed imperials van remarked what he meant was if that happens were going to get killed gerin couldnt recall the last time hed heard such a protest so elegantly phrased he stopped worrying about that too go on he told dagref quick now before they close up the hole all right his son urged the horses forward the fox shouted when the chariot did force its way between two manned by soldiers of the elabonian empire the imperials hesitated before trying to block his path as had happened once already they thought anyone in a chariot from south of the high kirs was bound to be a comrade as had happened once already they discovered they were mistaken gerin laid open the face of one of the imperial troopers on his left a cut that took the enemy doubly by surprise because he delivered it with his left hand on the other side of the car van speared an imperial archer out of a chariot the fellow looked comically surprised or would have had he not also been in agony well i think thats drawn their notice dagref said i bloody well knew it would draw their notice gerin answered as an arrow hissed past his ear what i want to know is has it drawn the woodsrunners in after us if it hasnt he let that hang if it hadnt van was rightthey would get killed he looked back over his shoulder and whooped with glee the trokmoi were behind him and more of them than hed expected often what looked suicidally stupid to an elabonian looked like fun to a trokm gerin was heartily glad of that not least because it meant the imperials wouldnt be concentrating on him alone theyd have other things on their minds such as stopping the penetration before it split their whole army in two sometimes distraction was better than victory sometimes they were one and the same chariots were at close quarters now everyone hacking and stabbing and shooting at everyone else the men of the elabonian empire seemed to feel a slight superstitious awe of the trokmoi who must have been much discussed but never seen during the years when the empire stayed south of the high kirs superstitious awe however had a way of lasting no longer than the first successfully blocked blow after that it was just man against man for their part the trokmoi went after the imperials with almost unholy glee the woodsrunners had no more use for elabonians than elabonians had for them but by now theyd dwelt south of the niffet for a generation to them gerins men were only partly hated southrons they were also neighbors sometimes friends sometimes even inlaws none of those palliatives applied to the warriors from south of the mountains they were the enemy pure and simple the trokmoi laid into them with an appalling lack of concern for what might happen to themselves so long as they could get in a few more licks at the foe because the woodsrunners were so fierce the imperials needed a disproportionate number of men to hold them in check and because they were making a move that would be important if it succeeded the imperials threw those men at them that didnt help their position along the rest of the line which was what gerin had had in mind there as he had before he aimed dagref toward a gap between a couple of imperial chariots if we get through there and bring a few trokmoi after us we really have cut the whoresons in two aye father dagref urged the horses forward wild whoops proclaimed that the trokmoi were still following the fox the imperials he faced knew they were holding an important part of the line they could hardly help knowing it with so many foes bearing down on them one of them let fly with an arrow behind gerin a trokm shrieked the fox had a perfect shot at the imperialor would have had one with any arrows in his quiver and then the imperial cried out and clutched at his flank from which a shaft sprouted to have hit him at that angle it couldnt have come from straight ahead gerin turned his head to the right recognizing him some of rihwins horsemen waved he waved back an enormous grin on his face weve got em van shouted by all the gods weve got em in the mill all we have to do now is crumble em from grain to flour itll be harder work than that gerin said the grain in the mill doesnt try to break the millstones is this really the time for literary criticism dagref asked possibly not gerin admitted an imperial who had been thrown out of his chariot flung a stone at him it clanged off his shoulder which started to throb maybe that was literary criticism maybe it wasnt whatever it was vans spear responded to it most pointedly the imperial was never heard to comment on a metaphor again with part of their army cut off and surrounded the rest of the forces of the elabonian empire began falling back as they had before the imperials retreated with a professional competence the men of the northlands trokmoi and elabonians both would have been hard pressed to match they held their ranks and kept fighting instead of running every which way which was the more usual response to defeat north of the high kirs they didnt seem to be saying were beaten gods preserve us it was more as if they meant all right youve got the better of us this time but it was probably just luck see what happens when we meet again thinking thus gerin said what worries me is this is the second time weve beaten them not the first dont you think they ought to be getting used to the idea that they dont fight as well as we do dagref said theyre probably getting used to the idea that theyre going to need reinforcements from over the mountains i wish you hadnt said that gerin told his son where are we going to get reinforcements if they do father dyaus where are we going to get reinforcements even if they dont its a bloody miracle that aragis and i are on the same side as things are what do we do if they should send another army over the high kirs dagref asked either fight it out or surrender and go back to cheating the empire out of the tribute it thinks it deserves the way i did in the old days gerin answered here he was winning a battle and dagref had managed to make him think he was losing pointedly he went on lets tend to one thing at a time if you please if we manage to botch what were doing now the empire wont need to think about sending reinforcements thats sensible father dagref allowed after his usual pause for thought nice of him to admit it eh fox van said with a chuckle dagref started to say something else gerin cut him off and the outlander too take it up after the fights over with he said meanwhile lets see what we can do to get it over with faster he raised his voice to a shout imperials give yourselves up and i promise you your lives one of the men in the surrounded pocket of charioteers asked and who are you that we should care about your promise gerin the fox king of the north he answered every once in a while wearing unobtrusive gear had disadvantages as well as good points if hed dressed like a king they would have known who he was if hed dressed like a king though they might have done a better job of trying to kill him what will you do with us if we yield ourselves the imperial inquired that was a good relevant question gerin wished he didnt have to come up with a reply on the spur of the moment if you yield now he said ill disarm you and send you north and settle you in peasant villagesone or two of you in each one because i dont want you plotting against me its the best i can do will you take it otherwise youll die right here either that or be used as slaves if you give up later and we decide to let you live what do you say the imperial whod been asking questions threw down his bow and took off his helmet good enough for me he said at once his comrades started throwing down their weapons too once gerin saw they were going to yield he detailed a small number of men to take charge of them then led the rest south in pursuit of the bigger part of the imperial army before long he caught up with aragis the archer ha aragis said i wondered what happened to you fox you disappeared for a while there and i thought i might be the only king left in the northlands but i see it isnt so he plainly wouldnt have been brokenhearted had gerin died but he didnt seem brokenhearted to find him alive either that struck the fox as a reasonable reaction no flies on aragis either the next thing he said was thats not the chariot you started out with today so it isnt gerin agreed they kept trying to kill us out there and they came closer to doing a proper job of it than i would have liked not wearing royal regalia had probably saved his neck ha aragis said again this time evidently intending it for laughter rather than a greeting what they do a proper job of is getting off a battlefield once theyve lost the main fight he waved ahead look at the order theyre keeping if they fought that well in the battle they might win gerin unrolled an imaginary scroll and made as if to read its title the triumphal retreats of the elabonian empire being a relation of the manner in which the said empire was won by its armies going backwards ha aragis said for a third time thats not half bad if only the bastards would go to pieces once we licked them wed drive em over the mountains and be rid of em once for all only if they decided not to reinforce dagref said aragis studied the youth for a long moment then shook his head hes got as nasty a way of looking at the world as you do fox worse gerin answered he glanced toward his son dagref preened that was the only word for ithe unmistakably preened van pointed ahead to the imperial army they are going to break away from us and to your five elabonian hells with me if i see anything we can do about it best thing to do is give up the pursuit if we cant break em gerin said if we spread ourselves too thin chasing them theyre liable to counterattack and then theyd steal a victory on the cheap i hate to say it but i fear youre right aragis said well gather ourselves up and then well hit em another lick in a few days sooner or later they ought to figure out they cant beat us he gave dagref a pointed look dagref as pointedly ignored it that made aragis laugh a genuine laugh to gerin he said he will be formidable wont he i expect so the fox answered of course hes had practice not paying attention to me dagref preened again aragis began shouting orders to bring the army to a halt when he saw they would be obeyed he turned back to gerin where has that ferdulf of yours got to i didnt see much of him in the fight neither did i gerin said he must have been doing something of his own unless i miss my guess hes his ferdulf not mine if you dont remember that hell make you pay aragis grunted ill remember men nowmen you order to do something and if they dont do it you make them how are you supposed to make a demigod pay if he doesnt feel like doing it ive spanked him once or twice gerin said sounding much much more casual talking about it afterwards then hed felt doing it he succeeded in impressing aragis i always knew you were brave the archer said up till now i never thought you were stupid aragis looked gerin up and down maybe i was wrong maybe you were the fox said im allied with you arent i aragis chewed on that for a little while then started to laugh so did gerin why not theyd just won another battle going back to the field gerin found laughter harder to come by the dead back there some of them men hed known most of his life and others not so old men hed known all their livesthey were every bit as dead as if hed been defeated the only consolation he found was that not so many of them were dead as if hed been defeated that might suffice for him he didnt think it would for them nor did victory ease the torment of the wounded they still screamed or groaned or wailed or hissed or stood or lay silent biting their lips against the pain till blood ran from the corners of their mouths there would have been more of them whom the fox knew and liked had the imperials won but that didnt help the ones who had been hurt moreover wounded men whod fought for the elabonian empire didnt look or sound any different from those whod followed gerin or aragis as he had at the earlier battle gerin did what he could to help the wounded extracting arrows washing cuts out with ale despite the curses of the men whod acquired those cuts and once or twice quietly cutting the throat of a man who could not live but would without help be a long slow painful time dying he hated that but hated their suffering more presently he came upon a young fellow with a fuzzy beard who was limping around with a bloody bandage on his right calf no not a fellow though his own arms were bloody to the elbow gerins stomach did a slow lurch maeva he exclaimed hello lord king she said her voice a little wobbly but firmer than a lot of others hed heard they wanted to draw the shaft but i wouldnt let them i know you have a good hand for such things she sat down on the ground pale yet determined ill do the best i can the fox said shed given him a compliment but not one of a sort hed ever wanted to get in the hope that talking would keep her mind off the pain he asked how did it happen she looked at him as if hed asked a very stupid question on reflection he realized he had how do you think she asked irritably i was riding along doing what i was supposed to be doing and my leg started to hurt when i looked down i saw whyan arrow was sticking out of it he nodded of itself one of his hands went to the other shoulder hed felt that same absurd surprise when hed been shot then it had started to hurt he reached down and undid the bandage saying lets see what weve got it was about what hed expected whoever had slapped the bandage on maeva had also cut the shaft of the arrow off short so it wouldnt be in the way that was as it should have been but it kept the fox from gauging how deep in the meat of her calf the arrowhead lay can you pull it out maeva asked id rather not he answered his voice troubled the imperials use barbed arrowheads same as we do pulling it back will make the wound a lot worse what will you do then maeva sounded calm but ragged at the edges she was liable to start screaming any time gerin didnt hold that against her or blame it on her sex hed heard plenty of wounded men scream on the battlefield hed been a wounded man screaming on the battlefield he used his knife to cut her trousers away from the wound so he could feel of it he also cut the checked wool on the inner side of her calf when he gently pressed there he felt something hard under his fingertip he grunted maeva flinched and hissed and let out a small fragment of a shriek before she could bite down on it its almost through he said actually thats pretty good if i push it all the way through the head will be out and then the rest of the shaft will come with it without much trouble he was telling the truth he knew he was telling the truth hed had plenty of practice sounding cheerful with wounded men too somehow this was different it was harder go ahead maeva said her voice more ragged now she set herself gerin had set himself too before they started working on that shoulder it hadnt done him much good he didnt think it would do her much good either he set his hand on the stub of the arrow and pushed hardsoonest over hed found was best maeva did shriek then hed expected she would pain deliberately inflicted was harder to bear than that which came by accident the barbed bronze arrowhead stabbed out through her skin though it was slick with her blood gerin seized it and drew the shaft after it there he said its donewell almost he carried a jar of ale with him when he poured it on both wounds in maevas leg she screamed again and tried to kick him easy he told her now im going to bandage it again he did with fresh rags blood started soaking into them from the old wound and the new maeva took a long shuddering breath thank you she said its better now im sorry i made so much noise i didnt hear anything gerin assured her he knew it wasnt necessarily better yet the wound could still go bad in which case she would be very sick and might even die hed done what he could do and made himself sound reassuring it wont be long before youre on your feet and running hard again it didnt cut the tendon you wouldnt have been on both feet if it had you should heal nice and clean thank you lord king she said that made him feel worse rather than better if he hadnt let her stay and fight she would have been angry instead of gratefulbut she would have been unwounded he knew which way he would rather have had her but as if picking that thought from his mind maeva went on im glad you gave me the chance to fight even if it turned out like this next time i hope ill be luckier gerin looked down at his hands they had her blood on them literally and now he supposed figuratively as well he kept trying to think of her as just another warrior hed had plenty of wounded young men tell him more or less the same thing shed said a moment before try as he would it wasnt easy that thought kept recurring fox a deep voice boomed from over on another part of the battlefield where in the five elabonian hells have you gone and got to now here gerin answered and waved maeva was frantically shaking her head had gerin thought before he waved he wouldnt have done it too late now van was already on the way over crimson horsehair plume nodding above him to make him even more unmistakable than he was already hullo fox he called still from some distance away patching up another by the way the outlanders voice cut off gerin knew exactly when his friend realized exactly whom he was patching up van came the rest of the way at a pounding trot he stooped beside his daughter what happened he demanded a question no more useful than gerins had been arrow she said doing her best to make light of it the king says it should heal well through the meat of the calf gerin said when van looked a query his way no tendon cutim sure of that she should heal clean the gods willing he added to himself maybe saying it over and over would help make the gods more willing van was still looking at him not with a question in his eyes any longer but with rising anger gerin had seen him aim that look at scores likely hundreds of enemies over the years the fox had never had it aimed at him run went through his mind as it was no doubt meant to do van growled if it hadnt been for you fox that gerin had had the identical thought would have done little to console the outlander gerin was sure of it but before van could say anything more maeva broke in sharply leave him be father how old were you when you took your first wound sixteen or so van answered i was lucky for a while ive made up for it since that was if anything an understatement he bore a great many scars gerin wondered how hed ever survived one wound that had gashed his chest and belly well then maeva said as if that said everything that needed saying but van shook his head its not the same chick he said the same thought that had been troubling the fox why not maeva said i fought well enoughoh maybe not so well as you father because im not the size you are even though im not small i kept fighting after i got hurt too it wasnt bad enough to make me quit the field what am i supposed to do van sounded plaintive something he very rarely did he looked to gerin curse it fox help me she sounds like i did when i was the same age and why are you so surprised at that gerin asked shes your daughter after all dagref sounds more like me than i ever thought anyone could he sounds more like me than i ever thought anyone would want to oh aye i can see that van said gerin laughed dagref perhaps fortunately was nowhere nearby van went on but its not the same hed said that before and sounded most sincere he still did dagrefs your son of course hell follow in your track am i not your child because i have no stones maeva asked before van could answer gerin said ive seen men with beards down to their belts who had less in the way of stones than you do maeva thank you lord king she said quietly van glared at gerin fat lot of help you are he growled and stomped off shaking his head thank you lord king maeva said again more firmly this time i think youre a great deal of help i know you do gerin answered the trouble is i still dont know whether im supposed to be helping you or your father he gave her a sudden sharp bow and i have other wounded to help if i am supposed to treat you like a soldierand im still a long way from sure that i amthen i have to go on as i would from another soldier why of course lord king she said as if surprised he could imagine thinking any other way that surprised him in turn and made him begin to believe he might in fact be able to think of her as a soldier gerin sat up on his blanket somethings wrong he said his voice blurry with sleep he looked around the campfires were lower than they had been though sentries still fed them to help hold the night ghosts at baynot that the ghosts hadnt had their glut of blood earlier that day snores rose from sleeping soldiers in an unmelodious chorus injured men groaned against their pain everything seemed to be as it should but gerin had not been dreaming when he thought something was wrong he was sure of that he did not know how he was sure only that he was he looked around again again he could find nothing amiss he started to lie down once more then checked himself he looked around yet again this time for rihwin the fox wherever there was trouble rihwin usually wasnt far away that was especially true when wine was involved gerin hadnt had to worry about wine for a good many years now he did worrying about wine meant worrying about rihwin but no there rihwin lay not twenty feet off snoring as unmusically as anyone else gerin let out a small sigh of relief if rihwin had no part in whatever trouble brewed odds were it wouldnt be so bad years of experience had led gerin to believe as much at any rate he yawned and lay flat again despite the yawn despite rihwins snores sleep would not come somethings wrong he said again quietly this time and got to his feet he would not find any rest till he made sure that prickly feeling of unease in his mind was imagination and nerves he breathed a little easier when he saw dagref too dagref probably would not make trouble on his own he knew precisely what sort of trouble dagref and maeva would make together though he would not have wanted to make that sort of trouble while wounded but with both of them so young who could tell what they were liable to do but they couldnt very well do anything with dagref sprawled asleep on a blanket a sentry was laying branches on a fire he looked up when he heard gerins footsteps is everything all right lord king he asked i dont know gerin answered im trying to find out he prowled on lengyel the wizard was liable to cause trouble too lengyel had already caused trouble as a matter of fact gerin stalked over to where he stayed under guard the guards were alert so was gerin when he saw that lengyel instead of lying there asleep was sitting up looking at him no lord king he hasnt done anything one of the wizards guards assured the fox he wakes up in the night sometimeshas to piss you know hes often a goodish while dropping off afterwards is he gerin gave lengyel a hard stare probably looking for another chance to get away if i found one i should be a fool not to take it the sorcerer said i regret to admit i have not found it your men have been more careful than i had expected he made a sour face very little on this side of the high kirs has been as i expected we never expected to see imperials on this side of the high kirs at all gerin said wed have been just as happy if you people had gone on minding your own business too instead of poking your snouts into ours even as he spoke he wondered if he was telling the truth if the imperial army had stayed south of the mountains he would have been fighting aragis instead by what the men of the elabonian empire had shown thus far the archer would have made a more troublesome foe on the other hand gerin had no guarantee that the elabonian emperor wouldnt send another army over the high kirs to give this one a hand in musing tones he said tell me what this crebbig i is like he chuckled into the darkness thinking how much he sounded like the imperials asking him about ferdulf his imperial majesty is bold and valiant and splendid and terrible beloved of his friends a terror to his enemies wait gerin held up a hand lengyel sounded as if he could go on like that for days without ever saying anything that mattered gerin said lets try it another way is crebbig hildors son if hes not what was he before his backside landed on the throne down there in the city of elabon how could you not know these things lengyel asked in surprise no trouble at all the fox answered very much the same way as you were ignorant about everything that has anything to do with the northlands the difference is i know that i dont know where you hadnt a clue that drew an indignant sniff from lengyel wizards knowing so much about wizardry naturally assumed they knew a lot about everything else too primly the sorcerer said you exaggerate i assure you no i dont gerin held up a hand wait never mind it doesnt matter just answer my questions about crebbig very well lengyel did not and would not call him lord king holding to the official imperial view that there were no kings north of the high kirs only rebels ruling against the authority of the city of elabon the wizard went on no crebbig is not the son of the emperor hildor iii who is now beloved among the gods dead you mean gerin said and lengyel nodded the fox asked did crebbig give him some timely help in becoming beloved among the gods lengyel nodded again this time so did gerin good now were getting somewhere what was the murderous usurper doing before he slaughtered his way to the top of the heap i resent the imputation contained within your words lengyel said i dont care gerin said cheerfully resent all you like you serve him i dont and i wont now answer my question what was crebbig the killer doing before he got to be elabonian emperor lengyel gave him another reproving look for that highly unofficial ekename he ignored it he was good at ignoring such looks having had practice with his children seeing it fail lengyel said the emperor was formerly commander of the elabonian garrison occupying the citystates of sithonia was he gerin said now isnt that interesting crebbig would have had a goodsized army behind him when he rebelled elabon kept a large garrison in sithonia for the good and sufficient reason that elabon needed a large garrison in sithonia down through the centuries of elabonian occupation the sithonians had never given up plotting and scheming and conniving and occasionally rising up against their imperial overlordsand being sithonians had never given up betraying one another to their imperial overlords either it was also interesting the fox realized a moment later because of the sithonian connections in his own life he hadnt actually seen a man from one of the citystates east of the greater inner sea since hed come back from the city of elabon more than twenty years before but since then hed had more dealings with mavrix than hed ever wanted and mavrix had saddled him with ferdulf and father dyaus he whispered and left lengyel so quickly the wizard and the guards all stared after him he didnt care something was indeed liable to be wrong and he thought he finally knew what sort of something too his nostrils twitched when he got close to where he was going he hadnt smelled that smell in a long time but he knew what it was rich fruity he couldnt have mistaken it for anything else guards stood around the wine rihwin the fox had captured from the imperials as guards had stood around lengyel the wizards guards hadnt been able to keep him from escaping once and the guards here hadnt been able to keep somebody from getting into the wine gerins nose told him as much though the guards didnt seem to notice anything out of the ordinary hello lord king one of them greeted him what brings you here trouble gerin pointed dont you see someones got past you and in among the wineskins cant you smell the spilled blood of the sweet grape once he showed them they had been befooled they exclaimed angrily and snatched out their swords before then theyd been oblivious curse the imperial wizard to the hottest of the five hells said the fellow whod greeted gerin his spells must have stolen our wits away thats not lengyel in there gerin frowned all things considered i rather wish it were ferdulf looked up from the wine hed been drinking bother he said glaring at the fox why didnt my glamour take you too its always harder if someone already knows what hes looking for gerin said do you know what youre looking for there with the wine my father ferdulf said i thought wed agreed that wasnt a good idea gerin told him aye we did ferdulf that most unchildlike baritone still as clear as if hed never begun to drink and then i stopped agreeing and i decided to do something about not agreeing what you should have done was come to me gerin said you didnt agree by yourself you shouldnt have broken the agreement by yourself either ferdulf shrugged it takes two to make an agreement but only one to be rid of it youd have tried to talk me out of this and youd best believe i would gerin broke in mavrix was the last personforce godthe fox wanted to see right now no one not gerin not ferdulf probably not mavrix himself could begin to guess what hed do but i dont want to be talked out of it ferdulf said the more i thought about that the more certain i got and so he raised a drinking jack to his lips his throat worked thats very fine it was sure to be only rough army wine barely worth drinking but he cared nothing for objectivity my father certainly made something better here than boring old ale ale suits me well enough gerin answered sincerely though i would be the last to deny wine is fine too ive drunk a deal of wine and drunk it with enjoyment the last thing he wanted to do was offend mavrix if by some mischance the god should be listening and choose to manifest himself here he succeeded in offending ferdulf instead trimmer the little demigod sneered drinking again this is good but that isnt badbah you havent much time mortal man you should be all one thing or all another not a bit of this and a bit of that gerin shook his head i have something of everything in me if i left something out that would be the waste ferdulf stared at him the demigods eyes caught and reflected what little light there was like a cats you dont answer as you should he complained you dont think as you should as best i can tell my father put me on earth where he did for no better reason than to have you torment me i doubt that gerin had always thought mavrix had sired ferdulf on fulda for no better reason than to torment him if ferdulf hadnt drawn the same conclusion gerin didnt intend to point it out to him life with the demigod had proved interesting enough as things were for his part ferdulf was not thinking about about his relationship with the fox i want my father he shouted loud enough that the cry should have awakened the entire campbut only gerin and the guards around the wine seemed to hear him i want my father he poured wine down his throat from a skin almost as large as he was alarm prickled through gerin dont do that he said urgently come on ferdulf give me the skin i want my father ferdulf shouted again the space around the wineskins seemed to expand my son i am here mavrix said vii father ferdulf cried in delight gerin trotted out his halting sithonian i greet you lord of the sweet grape he bowed low looking at the sithonian god of wine and fertility from under his eyelids mavrix as usual wore supple fawnskin a wreath of grape leaves kept his long dark hair off his forehead ferdulfs eyes had flashed mavrix glowed all over raiment and all the only darkness in him was his eyes twin pits of deepest shadow in his effeminately handsome face well he said now voice echoing inside gerins head as if the fox heard him with mind rather than with ears i have not been north of the mountains in some little while i cannot say this benighted excuse for a country has improved much since i last saw it i must tell you what do you mean now ferdulf sounded indignant im here and i wasnt the last time you came to fox keep well yes mavrix admitted he seemed something less than delighted to make his sons acquaintance even so the gradi dont trouble the northlands these days gerin put in he carefully did not add no thanks to you mavrix had tried to stand against voldar the ferocious chief goddess of the gradi but had not been strong enough baivers the elabonian god of barley and brewing had held off voldar and the rest of the gradi pantheon along with considerable help from the fearsome deities of the monsters under bitons cave gerin wondered whether mavrix despised baivers or the monsters gods more well yes if anything mavrix sounded even less thrilled than he had with ferdulf even so ferdulf ran over to him and caught him by the hand father he cried again mavrix inspected him if the sithonian god was impressed he concealed it exceedingly well yes i am your father he said you summoned me so i came now what do you want he sounded like gerin granting a brief audience to a man for whom he could not spare any more time he wanted ferdulf to come to the point so he could get back to whatever he had been doing ferdulf caught that too here i am the son you got on my mother he exclaimed have you no praise for me have you no words of wisdom words of wisdom were the last thing gerin would have asked of mavrix if the sithonian god had chosen to give him any he would have reckoned true wisdom likely to lie in ignoring them here and now the issue did not arise for mavrix only shrugged the sinuous motion put gerin in mind of a serpent i may be your father the god said but i am not your nursemaid ferdulf reeled back as if mavrix had slapped him however heartless mavrixs words sounded gerin thought they did hold good advice at least they told ferdulf in no uncertain terms that he could not rely on mavrix for anything but his existence whatever else they did they infuriated the little demigod you cant ignore me he shouted his feet came off the ground he shot through the air at mavrix like an angry arrow in his right hand the sithonian god bore a wand wreathed in ivy and vine leaves and topped with a pinecone the thyrsus looked like a harmless ornament in mavrixs hands though it was a weapon more deadly than the longest sharpest heaviest spear any human warrior could carry mavrix tapped ferdulf with the wand ferdulf groaned and crashed to the ground a child who annoys his father gets the stick as he deserves the god said to the demigod ferdulf was used to having more supernatural power than anyone around him he rose into the air again and hurled himself at his sire you cant do that to me he cried oh but i can mavrix answered and tapped his son with the thyrsus again again ferdulf hit the ground more heavily this time than before you need to understand that just because i came when you called you have not the right to abuse me nor shall you ever ferdulf moaned and lay in a heap alert as a longtooth mavrix stood there watching him a faint rank odor of wine lees and old corruption floated from the god making gerins nose twitch slowly with another groan ferdulf sat up why did you come when i called he asked in a voice full of despair i hoped you would see me and be proud of me i hoped he shook his head as if to clear it what a naive little creature you are mavrix said which brought one more groan from ferdulf the sithonian god turned to gerin i should have thought he would have learned better dwelling by you as he does for a mortal you have a moderate amount of sense even if he is a demigod hes only four years old gerin said concealing his own bemusement at hearing anything even remotely resembling praise from mavrix ferdulf heard it too heard it and did not like it how dare you talk to him talk to this this man more kindly than you do to me i dare because i am a god i dare because i am your father mavrix returned evenly by early appearances ferdulf annoyed him even more than the fox did his dark dark eyes stared at stared through his son how dare you presume to question me i am flesh of your flesh blood of your blood ferdulf said if i have not got the right who has no one mavrix answered now be quiet for a little while ferdulf tried to speak but produced only squeaks and grunts not intelligible words gerin was impressed he could do even so much when mavrix commanded silence of a mortal man silence was what he got seeing mavrix relatively welldisposed to him the fox asked lord of the sweet grape what aid can you give me against the elabonian empire at that ferdulf did fall silent he wanted to hear the answer too being anything but enamored of the empire mavrix looked troubled that troubled gerin sithonian legend spoke of what a coward mavrix was but what was on the gods face did not look like fear to the fox it looked like resignation that troubled gerin more i can do less than you might hope mavrix said at last if i could do more than you might hope do you think i would not have done it for fair sithonia rather than for this grapeless and otherwise unattractive wilderness but gerin shook his head you sithonian gods are still very much a part of your own country while the gods of elabon hardly seem to notice this world any more one has to shout to get their attention you might say mavrix nodded that is so and once gained their attention is frequently not worth having he sniffed scornfully as may be gerin said not wanting to disagree openly with the sithonian god of wine and fertility once hed summoned baivers the elabonian god had done more for him than mavrix had in any case that wasnt what he wanted to know he asked with the gods of sithonia immanent in the world while those of elabon are not how have the elabonianshe carefully did not say we elaboniansruled your land so long that is a cogent questiona painfully cogent question mavrix said the best reply i can give is that the folk of sithonia while they have a great many gifts from their gods conspicuously lack that of governing themselves elabonians on the contrary have next to no discernible gifts of any sort save only that of government it would take a stronger god than any known in sithonia to make its people unite regretfully gerin nodded that fit too well with what the imperial wizards had told him is there nothing you can do he said wondering what good is an impotent god especially an impotent fertility god i have already done all you require of me and more besides mavrix answered without my sonwho may by the way speak againyou would have no hope whatever of repelling the forces of the elabonian empire with him you have that hope nothing in the mundane world is altogether certain however either for gods or for men do not be smug do not be overconfident you may yet lose this fight too youre talking in riddles gerin said accusingly i thought you despised biton and so i do mavrix said with a curl of the lip but how am i to speak with certainty when i cannot see everything that lies ahead gerin wondered if he ought to go up to ikos to hear what the farseeing god had to say maybe hed made a mistake not doing that when duren suggested it he wondered whenand ifhed have the chance to leave the army and try to puzzle out one of bitons notoriously ambiguous oracular verses ferdulf said but what must i do to drive the empire out of the northlands i dont know mavrix answered i havent the faintest idea i dont much care either if the truth be known that anyone would be mad enough to wish to live in a land where the grape grows not is beyond me he turned his head toward ferdulf you will manage i expectunless of course you dont a sigh rippled out of him for some reason i am frequently disappointed in my offspring it must be the fault of the mortal women on whom i sire them nothing is ever your fault is it ferdulf said a thought also in gerins mind but one he found it politic not to mention when things go your way you take the credit when they go wrong someone else gets the blame you for example my charming child are entirely to blame for that unseemly temper of yours mavrix returned which to gerin proved only that the sithonian fertility god was not so perceptive as he thought he was ferdulf started to curse him gerin had heard some fancy curses in his time but very few to match the ones spewing from the little demigods lips when the fox closed his eyes for a moment he could easily imagine he was listening to a veteran abusing a man hed hated for twenty years if the abuse bothered mavrix he didnt show it on the contrary he beamed at ferdulf as if proud of him i love you too dear son of mine he said when the demigod finally paused for breath he stuck out his tongue even farther than ferdulf could haveand then he was gone ferdulf kept on cursing for quite some time even though only gerin stood beside him near the wineskins without warning he stopped cursing and burst into tears i was afraid something like this might happen gerin said as consolingly as he could thats why i didnt want you to try summoning your father he didnt care ferdulf spoke in tones of astonished disbelief he just didnt care i am his sonand he didnt care hes a fertility god gerin answered hes had lots of sonsand lots of daughters too he doesnt see much reason why a new one should particularly matter to him i hate him ferdulf snarled ill hate him forever hed better not show his ugly face around here again or ill make him sorry thats what ill do easy gerin said easy you dont want to talk that way about your father no matter who he is you especially dont want to talk that way about your father when hes a god i dont care what he is ferdulf said and then began to cry again ill pay him back for not caring about me if its the last thing i ever do if you try that its liable to be the last thing you ever do gerin said ferdulf ignored him the little demigod kept crying as if his heart would breakno as if it were already broken the men guarding the wine stared at him they were gerins subjects and knew about ferdulf they no more expected this behavior from him than they expected the fox to go on a fourday drunk and rumple every peasant girl he could get his hands on gerin stared at ferdulf too after staring he did what he would have done for any other crying child he walked over squatted beside ferdulf and put his arms around the demigod even as he did it he wondered how foolish he was being like any other crying child ferdulf could do all sorts of unpleasant things if he didnt feel like being held unlike any other crying child he could do all sorts of dangerous things if he didnt feel like being held but all he did was throw his own arms around the fox and bawl till he had no more tears left when sobs subsided into sniffles and hiccoughs gerin said why dont you go find your blanket now i dont think anything more will happen here around the wine tonight he devoutly hopedand that seemed to be the right word toonothing more would happen around the wine tonight all right ferdulf said but i will have my revenge you wait and see if i dont off he went hardly more than half as tall as a grown man but showing a determination few grown men couldor would have wanted tomatch when the fox straightened up his knees clicked he glanced over to the guards who were staring after ferdulf the less you talk about what happened just now the happier ill be he said the happier i am the happier youll be do you understand that aye lord king they chorused as gerin walked back toward his blanket he was gloomily certain the secret wouldnt hold he counted himself lucky mavrix hadnt gone and roused the whole camp that would have created a fine chunk of chaos which the sithonian god often enjoyed he lay down he wondered how he was supposed to go back to sleep after some of that chaosto say nothing of a despondent demigodlanded in his own lap he looked up at the stars and the moons tiwaz and elleb were in the sky both of them moving from full toward third quarter even elleb which had risen after tiwaz floated high in the southeast sunrise couldnt be too far away gerin yawned with his luck he thought hed have just dozed off when the sun came over the horizon and sure enough that was exactly what happened rihwin the fox set hands on hips and looked indignant he had a good deal of practice looking indignant along with innocence no sucking babe could match it was an expression he donned frequently this time though gerin would have been willing to bet at least most of the ire was real you quaffed the wine without inviting me rihwin demanded as if unable to imagine an act more heinous gerin shook his head i didnt quaff a bit of it he replied ferdulf did and sure enough mavrix came did you really want to make his acquaintance again do you think he would have wanted to make yours rihwin brushed that aside with an airy wave of the hand a gesture that came from south of the high kirs wine was quaffed and i quaffed none of it he said where i pray you is the justice in that i found the wine i brought the wine back to the camp i pant after the wine the way an old lecher pants after a young virgin gerin broke in that is what you meant to say isnt it well possibly i might have chosen other words to the same effect rihwin said with a disarming grinanother expression hed practiced and had need to practice but lord king unlike the lecher i have done without for fifteen yearsand now that the wine is a virgin no longer how can you begrudge my having it too i might have known better than to try a figure of speech against you gerin said of course youd turn it upside down and throw it back at me now rihwin looked smug he didnt need to practice that expression it came naturally you cannot in logic deny me he said and gerin nodded youre right i cannot in logic deny you he admitted but im going to go right on denying you just the sameand denying myself and van and aragis and everyone else if mavrix came for ferdulf hes liable to come again and id just as soon he didnt but this is unjust rihwin cried it has behind it no rational force yes gerin said and so rihwin simply stared at him gerin stared back hed had a lot of practice at keeping his features impassive what with rihwin ferdulf his own children fand and many others hed needed that kind of practice rihwin dropped his eyes not smiling gerin said go onget ready to move out were not done with the imperials you know not anywhere close off rihwin went every line in his body proclaimed mute outrage dagref who had been standing by listening to the exchange remarked he will try to get into the wine you know and the sun will come up tomorrow gerin agreed wearily tell me something i couldnt figure out for myself he stayed away from it as long as he did because no one else could get at it either now that ferdulf has but ferdulf is a demigod and son to the god of wine dagref said doesnt rihwin see any distinction between that case and his own the only thing rihwin sees is his own thirst gerin answered that worries me too but i can only do so much about it the best way ive come up with to make sure he stays away from the blood of the sweet grape is to keep him too busy to get near the wineskins that being so he sent rihwin out on patrol with a couple of squadrons of his riders whatever else rihwin was no one had ever accused him of being dullwitted he had no trouble seeing what gerin was doing or why he was doing it and gave his fellow fox a sour look but since gerins order also made perfectly good sense in military terms rihwin could do nothing about it but obey maeva did not ride out with rihwin and the others who fought on horseback gerin would have given rihwin a kick in the fundament had he sent any wounded warrior into action without dire need maeva still looked offended at being left behind how does the leg feel he asked her tell me the truth now a more experienced warrior probably would have lied despite that admonition maeva was young enough and seriousminded enough to heed it sore she confessed he set a hand on her forehead hold still he said when she tried to pull away youre not feverish is your leg hot around the wound a little she said and then in a very firm voice but only a little all right he answered that sounds like its healing as it should stay off it as much as you can the less strain you put on it the faster it will get better and the sooner youll have a scar that will startle your husband on his wedding night he thought or maybe some other young man on a warm spring night a good deal sooner than that if hed said what was in his mind he would have embarrassed them both by keeping his mouth shut he managed to embarrass only himself shaking his head he went off to get the army moving faster as they broke camp he soon saw again that the imperials while they had now lost two battles were still very much in the fight they had so many chariots out to slow down the northerners march rihwin sent a rider back to ask for reinforcements theyll smash us up if you dont send more men forward lord kings the messenger said well send more men forward by the gods aragis snarled well send the whole cursed army forward see if we dont he shouted orders gerin frowned that wasnt how he would have handled things it struck him as sticking his head into a longtooths mouth and inviting the beast to bite down scouts went ahead of an army to develop the opposition to see what was out there moving up with the entire force meant the scouts didnt have the chance to do their job and invited an ambush he started to protest then made himself keep quiet this was what hed bought when he agreed aragis should have command of the whole host he could not claim the archer was holding back his own men and endangering only gerins aragis was sending everyone into the fight he was sending everyone into the fight so aggressively that if the imperials did have an ambush set it might not do them much good he didnt seem to have many ideas as a general but he knew what to do with the ones he had and the imperials proved not to have set a trap after all their chariots had been skirmishing briskly with rihwins horsemen but drew back when so much support for the riders made its appearance thereyou see fox aragis said more than a little complacently we will drive them back to cassat and once weve done that well drive them over the mountains and out of the northlands for good by the gods maybe we will gerin heard the bemusement in his own voice he wouldnt have believed it when the war began but he was starting to believe it now one more victory over the forces of the elabonian empire and he didnt see how the imperial forces could sustain themselves on this side of the high kirs any more of course we will aragis didnt seem to have any doubts aragis never seemed to have any doubts about anything maybe he didnt have doubts because he was right so often maybe he didnt have doubts because nobody dared tell him he was wrong which wasnt quite the same thing whats cassat like these days gerin asked i havent been through it since just after the empire closed off the high kirs you remember what a sad place it was then aragis said remember how it pretended to be the capital of a province that didnt want to have anything to do with it that i do gerin said dyaus only knows what the governor theyd sent there had done to get himself shipped into exileno wait i remember it was something to do with getting an army chopped to pieces wasnt it whatever it was he hated everything that had anything to do with the northlands that wasnt quite true the imperial functionary had had quite a yen for elise so had gerin in those days shed disabused the governor with a knife to his throat disabusing gerin had taken longer and hurt worse by the time the job was through too didnt he though aragis said well like i say cassat was a sad place then and that was with traffic going over the mountains into the empire when the imperials closed the pass the place didnt have any reason for being at all what it reminds me of nowadays is a night ghost that wails because it isnt what it used to beit isnt much of anything just the remnant of something that was alive once upon a time gerin gave him a look out of the corner of his eye youd better be careful archer or youre going to end up writing poetry heh aragis said youre a funny fellow order those horsemen of yours forward again and well get on with this business the gods only know how much i want to get back to my own holdings without anybody to keep an eye on em the peasants are sure to be sitting around with their thumbs up their arses they cant sit idle all the time gerin said they have to eat this winter too they know it aye and theyll start thinking of that about two days before harvest time too aragis said meanwhile the weeding and the manuring wont have gone on half so well as they should instead of working theyll be swilling ale and screwing each others wives they might as well be barons the fox murmured van turned a snort into a cough in the nick of time dagrefs shoulders hunched as they would have done at the start of a laugh but he managed to hold it in what was that aragis said sharply never mind gerin told him you already think im too bloody lightminded where do we go from here after the imperials the archer replied without hesitation we bring them to battle wherever they will stand either in front of cassat or behind it we smash them and we run them back over the mountains if they want to come up into our country to trade well and good if they come here again with edged bronze in their hands well give them a new set of lumps and send them home again maybe we will gerin said as he had before listening to aragis made him believe it anyhow aragis certainly believed it we will he declared in such ringing tones that almost everyone within earshot turned his head toward him put your men on the left fox i shall put mine on the right well meet behind the imperials with the circle closed around them well make sure not many ever do get back over the high kirs to tell the tale he had perhaps automatically assigned himself the place of greater honor let it be as you say gerin answered honor mattered less to him and results more than to most of his fellows he was also pleased to see aragis coming up with a plan more sophisticated than the sort of headlong charge the trokmoi might have used he wondered if he should have been pleased to see the archer coming up with better plans even if they routed the forces of the elabonian empire they would still be left looking at each other across a border that made aragis acutely unhappy the more like an idiot aragis performed the happier the fox should have been and so he would have been but for the small detail that aragis ineptitude if any also endangered him he did find one question to put to the archer you dont want to start mixing your men and mine together more theyve fought two battles on the same side by now they should know they can trust one another against the imperials but aragis shook his head i dont want to change whats worked well already your men have brothers and cousins and friends fighting alongside them and so do mine theyll fight better in front of warriors they know and theyll fight better being certain in their bones the warriors close by them will come to their rescue if they get into trouble i think the archer has the right of it fox van said well maybe he does gerin allowed in fact i suppose he does his way the only place well have to worry about the kind of trouble he has in mind is at the join of the two armies just so aragis said besides while your men will obey me and mine will obey you each force will obey its own sovereign better less chance for treachery my way too i dont fear it not after these two fights but i dont care to leave myself open to it either gerin started to tell him he was being absurd but stopped with the words unspoken aragis wasnt being absurd he was being sensibly cautious now that gerin thought about it he didnt want to leave himself open to treachery from the archer either keeping his men together reduced the risk of it aragis saw him start to speak and then stop too the archer nodded as if gerin had proved his point in a way gerin had aragis said we are allies against a common danger not friends i do not see how we can be friends you and i once we drive the empire back south of the high kirs gerin began and then stopped again the two of them would have been rivals had the empire not cleared the passes through the mountains they would have been at war had the empire not done so hed thought as much only moments before if the empire left the northlands what would keep them from being at each others throats once more nothing he could see allies aragis repeated not friends so long as we remember it we should do well enough weve done well enough so far allies gerin agreed did he sound mournful or relieved even he couldnt tell were aragis his friend he might well sleep easier of nights on the other hand who could sleep easy knowing he was the sort of person able to make friends with aragis the archer that evening after the army encamped rihwin fell on his knees before gerin lord king i implore you let me taste of the blood of the sweet grape he cried what in the five hells do you think youre playing at rihwin get up for pitys sake gerin shook his head anyone would think i were a pretty little peasant wench you were trying to wheedle into bed truly lord king i suffer for lack of wine as i would suffer for lack of a friendly wenchs caresses rihwin replied as he climbed to his feet he winked at gerin and as truly i have wheedled a good many pretty peasant wenches into bed with just such words i dont doubt it for a moment gerin said they probably lie down with you just to make you shut up it could be rihwin admitted not a bit abashedbut then rihwin was seldom abashed i did not inquire as to why they did it i confess he gave gerin a sidelong look i would not inquire why you did it either lord king you have my solemn word gerin exhaled angrily to the crows with your solemn word you do know do you not that mavrix came visiting when ferdulf drank of the wine you captured of course you do i told you myself now i ask you again do you want to meet the god yes i do know that rihwin looked troubled i forgot where i heard it though and dismissed it as nothing more than camp gossip of course you did gerin snapped it wasnt what you wanted to hear so you bloody well ignored it you have a way of doing that with things you dont want to hear unfortunately it happens to be true one more time sirrah and answer me yea or nay if you please do you care to try conclusions with mavrix i dont care rihwin said hes taken my magic from me what more can he do short of taking my life and if he should take my life i shall die happy with the taste of wine on my lips its a better way to go than most i can think of that depends on what sort of end he feels like giving you but gerin threw his hands in the air all right by the gods go ahead and drink youve worn me downif i were a peasant girl id be taking off my skirt right now on your head be it though and i hope all your bastards are well provided for if you want to be a cursed foolif you insist on being a cursed fooli dont suppose i have the right to stand in your way rihwin seized his hand and kissed it gerin yanked it back with a startled oath rihwin said you are a prince among menno a king among men he winked will you not come and drink with me that we may greet mavrix together greeting mavrix was about the last thing gerin wanted to do nevertheless he said ill come with you all right if you think i trust you with wine while youre out of my sight youre even crazier than i think you areand that believe me would take some doing rail at me and insult me as much as you like so long as you dont stand between me and the blood of the sweet grape rihwin hurried away to return a moment later with his drinking jack which dripped i have rinsed it in the stream to remove whatever dregs of ale might have remained within good for you gerin said lets go lets get this over with the guards around the wine began to raise their swords to keep rihwin away from that which they protected gerin had given them very firm orders about that then the guards exclaimed in surprise seeing gerin stalking along behind him gerin countermanded the orders are you sure lord king one of the guards asked no im not sure gerin answered the only thing im sure of is that rihwin has wine where his wits ought to be and hes whined so much im going to let him drink some that will settle thatone way or another rihwin sniffed at gerins assessment of him he poured his jack full brought it up to his face and sniffed his expression grew blissful as he savored the bouquet truly i bless thee lord of the sweet grape he murmured he drank gerin waited for the sky to fall or at least for mavrix to appear in all his rather effeminate glory the sky did not fall mavrix did not appear nothing whatever out of the ordinary happened in fact rihwin tilted back his head so as to drain the last drop of wine from the jack he wiped his mouth on his sleeve a slightly puzzled expression stealing over his face well gerin demanded he looked around still no sign of mavrix rihwin kept on looking puzzled he stared down at the drinking jack as if it had somehow betrayed him its very fine lord king he said slowly in sooth i do prefer it to ale as i had been certain i should its very fine indeed as i say and yet his voice trailed off not so fine as you remember it eh gerin said no rihwin said in a small voice in my mind i had built up the idea of what it was like the idea of what it would be like and having gone without for so long i suppose i kept building it and building it until at the last i had erected a structure taller and wider than the foundation of truth would support and it just came crashing down on you gerin had not expected to find himself feeling sympathetic to rihwin any more than hed expected to find himself feeling sympathetic to ferdulf when the demigods encounter with his father failed to turn out as hed hoped but gerins friend seemed so uncharacteristically crestfallen he couldnt help himself rihwin let out a small sad sigh even so lord king have you ever wanted a beautiful woman who would not give herself to you your imaginings of what she would be like grow ever more heated until at last in them she puts to shame astis the goddess of love and if after that you do end up having her after all what do you find out gerin said you find out shes only another woman it has happened to you rihwin exclaimed not since i was very young gerin answered you always expect great things when youre very young he sent rihwin a pointed look most people get over it after a while so kindly rihwin murmured so generous so much like finding a wasp by thrusting your foot into the boot wherein it had chosen to pass the night well i shall have my revenge of course you will gerin said you come out with four times as many outrageous things as i do one of them is bound to skewer me before long but that was not the sort of revenge rihwin had in mind he filled the drinking jack with wine for a second time and instead of draining it himself pressed it into gerins startled hands here lord king you have gone without longer than i taste of the sweet grape and measure it against your memory curse you rihwin gerin muttered if he drank he was liable to draw mavrixs notice which was one of the last things he wanted to do but if he refused to drink he was liable to offend the sithonian god of wine which was another of the last things he wanted to do after a brief mental debate as to which was the worse risk he decided he had better drink i bless thee mavrix lord of the sweet grape he said in his seldomused sithonian and raised the jack to his lips the wine was sweet not sour like beer as rihwin had hed remembered that he did not think it was very good wine what army was in the habit of sending a fine vintage with its troopers but even if it had been good wine it would have been worth trading for but not worth ecstasies he said as much looking around warily again lest mavrix suddenly appear wherever the sithonian god chose to manifest himself he did not spring into being in the camp rihwin sighed again lord king i fear you have the right of it only wine what a sad thing to sayevery bit as sad i think as your only another woman maybe it is gerin said absently he kept looking this way and that waiting for mavrix to appear and do something appalling the god gave no sign of his presence gerin didnt know whether to be relieved or suspicious he ended up being both at once as if someone had shot an arrow at him from arms length and missed rihwin figured out what he was doing rihwin was not a fool no gerin shook his head rihwin was not stupidthere was a difference waiting for the lord of the sweet grape to come and turn us inside out he asked you deserve to be turned inside out gerin snapped he ran his tongue over his lips a few little drops of wine remained in his mustache their taste made him nervous all over again why rihwin said for thinking it would be safe and proving it for taking the chance gerin said the risk wasnt worth the reward you got yourself a jack of wine but you put your neck on the line to get it rather to gerins surprise that succeeded in embarrassing rihwin i thought the wine was worth my neck rihwin said perhapsi say only perhaps mind youi was wrong you got by with it gerin said i dont know that you deserved to get by with it but you did so let it go hearing rihwin admit he might have made a mistake made gerin back off a bit too and then rihwin said now that we know we may safely partake of the blood of the sweet grape what say we empty the wineskins as fast as we can to remove further danger what say we dont gerin answered dryly we dont know we can safely drink wine whenever we want all we do know is we got by with it once rihwin stuck out his tongue gerin ignored him and let out a long sigh and i dont think wed better get rid of all the wine whether by drinking it or any other way we may need to summon mavrix one day and wine is best for that he could hear the reluctance in his own voice but the words needed saying the reluctance got through to rihwin but so did the sense of what gerin said very well lord king let that be as you say my own craving having been slaked once shall not be so desperate as it has been till now heres hoping youre right gerin said but its liable to be as much in mavrixs hands as it is in yours rihwin gave him a horrified look he pretended not to see it and slapped his friend from south of the high kirs on the back lets get what rest we can i think we may fight in the morning they didnt fight the next morning nor the next afternoon either gerin began to wonder if the imperials were going to fall back not just to cassat but through it if that was so they might have given up on their efforts to reunite the northlands to the elabonian empire but then the morning after that rihwins riders came back to report that the imperial army was drawn up in battle array awaiting attack well give it to them aragis declared one more win and theyre gone for good he shouted orders for the advance do you think hes right father dagref asked as he steered the chariot out in front of the warriors who acknowledged gerin as their overlord as a matter of fact i do the fox answered beating an army once and seeing it keep its spiritthat can happen no doubt about it beating an army twice and seeing it keep its spiritwhen the imperials managed it that surprised me if we beat them three times running i dont see how they can keep from running themselves van nodded i think you have the right of it captain i dont suppose ive ever seen soldiers with so much discipline in all my days but discipline only takes a soldier so far if it keeps taking him into fights where he cant hope to win itll break like a dropped pot that does make good logical sense dagref looked back over his shoulder at gerin havent you tried to thump it into my head that battles dont always make good logical sense i think i ought to thump your head on the principle of the thing gerin said keep your attention on where weve going if you please not on where weve been out ahead of the chariots and out wide of them as well rode rihwins horsemen among them was maeva who found sitting a horse easier than walking around gerin almost mentioned her to dagref because that would have made sure his son looked ahead at all times he refrained though not wanting to remind van that maeva was in the fight and had already been hurt once above and ahead of the army of the northlands flew ferdulf the demigod had been subdued since meeting his father he seemed exuberant enough now though stabbing out his hand to show the position of the imperial army and then making several lewd gestures in the direction of the men from south of the high kirs gerins troopers whooped the fox saw the army of the elabonian empire a couple of minutes later he nodded in reluctant admiration the imperials looked as steady now as they had at the first clash theyd lost more men than gerin and aragis had having started with an army about the same size as that of the northlands they were now at a disadvantage they didnt seem worried though as soon as they spied their foes chariotry they began their war cry elabon elabon elabon gerin the men from the northlands shouted and aragis and anything else they could think of the trokmoi who rode with the fox let out a chorus of yips and yowls that might have burst from the throats of wolves maybe those howls were what made dagref say we sound like an army of barbarians and the imperials sound like civilized men gerin asked his son nodded the fox said well maybe they are but ill tell you this a civilized man doesnt smell any better four days dead than a trokm with mustachios that droop down to his collarbones thats a fact van agreed and another fact is youll die just as dead from a civilized mans sword as from a barbariansif the silly bugger knows what to do with it of course also true gerin said he raised his voice to ask dagref what do you think of these new horses they were still using the team from the imperial chariot onto which theyd forced themselves during the most recent fight dagref answered they havent the endurance of the beasts we brought down from fox keepthats certain but i do think they may run faster for a short burst that could prove useful theyre easiertempered beasts than the ponies we had which is pleasant the fox grunted if anything his son had told him more than hed wanted to know that was typical of dagref he loved detail and assumed everyone else did too with gerin that assumption was usually good now though he had too much on his mind to want a whole lot more rattling around in there elabon elabon elabon the drivers of the imperial chariots cracked their whips above the backs of their mounts and sent them bounding toward the men of the northlands gerin admired their spirit in the same sort of way in which he admired the courage of the trokmoi which is to say he admired it without seeing that it made much sense theyd been beaten twice what on earth made them think the result would be any different this time especially since they were now outnumbered whatever it was here they came arrows flew toward gerin and his followers some of his men began shooting back even if they were out of range hed told them not to do that but not everybody thought when he fought nocking an arrow gerin waited for a good target to present itself the imperial officers still persisted in wearing fancy gear to let their men see at a glance who they were that that also let their foes see at a glance who they were never seemed to enter their heads gerin sent two of them tumbling out of their chariots one right after the other men and horses on both sides went down one imperial chariot came to grief in front of another which collided with it and came to grief too along with looking for officers gerin sent shafts at drivers and at horses that last wasnt sporting and he knew it he didnt care if the horses went down the chariots couldnt roll order and discipline didnt hold long once the chariots were in among one another the tactics of the captains on either side didnt matter much it was a melee everyone smashing away at whoever was close by and happened to be shouting the wrong battle cry gerin tried to do something about that yelling for some of his troopers to overlap the end of the imperial line the imperials stretched too and didnt stretch so thin as to let him shatter them his mouth twisted this didnt look like a day on which anything would come easy then ferdulf dived down to horrify the horses of an imperial chariot they ran so wild dagref had to steer smartly to escape a collision van speared the driver out of the enemy car which meant it would keep right on going wild dagref was no demigod but he could also make himself unloved by the imperials horses his lash made them scream and turn aside from the chariot he drove one of the drivers who fought for the elabonian empire drew back his arm to do likewise to the team dagref drove before he could snap the whip gerin shot him in the shoulder he howled and cursed and dropped the whip but somehow managed to hang on to the reins that made gerin curse in turn how are we doing van shouted he looked as if he was doing pretty well for himself his face wore a fierce grin blood trails dripped down the shaft from his long leafshaped bronze spearhead no blood dripped from him doing well i think gerin answered he looked around the imperials are having to bend back to keep us from getting around behind them so their line is a bow nowit isnt a line any more and you can bend a bow only so far after that it snaps aye van peered toward the other wing aragis men seem to be giving the southerners a hard time too say what you will about that fellow the men he leads can fight ive never doubted that gerin said he wouldnt be dangerous to me if he werent dangerous to everyone else who got in his way too he hesitated then admitted i suppose i have to say i didnt expect him to be as dangerous as he is dagref said if he happened to suffer an unfortunate accident just at the moment when the imperials were routed and running for the high kirs i dont think my heart would break neither would mine gerin said then a bit slower than he should have he realized what else his son had been saying if aragis has an unfortunate accident it wont be on account of me all right dagref said equably gerin stared at his sons back the youth could indeed be formidable to everyone around him when he grew up as a matter of fact he was already formidable to everyone around him you keep your eyes open fox van said because i dont think aragis heart would break if you had an unfortunate accident along about the time the imperials were hightailing it for the mountains either and aragis doesnt believe in live and let live not even a little bit gerin could hardly argue with that aragis had about as much forbearance in him as a pike swimming in the niffet any other fish he saw was either his size bigger or breakfast but the fox replied i didnt get to be as old as i am by closing my eyes you know oh yes i do know that van said but if you want to keep on getting older dont shut em now instead of shutting his eyes gerin used them to gape at ferdulf whizzing around the battlefield stirring up chaos in the ranks of the imperials he flew untroubled whatever magics the wizards from the sorcerers collegium were using to try to bring him down they werent working not today and because they werent working the little demigod was making life miserable for the men from south of the high kirs life or at least the battle was pretty miserable for them anyhow gerin and aragis men did not beat them easily but beat them they did both ends of the imperial line bent back and back now gerin began thinking aragis dream would come to pass if his own men met the archers behind the imperials precious few soldiers would have the chance to get back over the mountains and let crebbig i know what had happened to them the officers of the empire realized as much their shouts grew ever more urgent and desperate gerin shouted too press them hard dont let them have a moments breather if we smash them here theyre ruined for good press them press them the men of the northlands did the imperials fought hard but though they managed to press forward here and there overall kept going back and back three arrows one of them gerins hit an officer who was rallying them they all struck within heartbeats of one another the fox was by no means sure his smote first van whooped as he watched the imperial topple from his car hes hit so many times he doesnt even know which way to fall the poor sod youve got your troopers thinking the same way you do captain anyone who cant see that an able officer needs killing is probably too stupid to go on breathing let alone be worth anything in a fight gerin answered with a shrug dagref said it would be a wonder father if your followers havent learned something from you as long as youve been leading them van whooped again have you ever been called old more politely fox thats not what i dagref began never mind i know what you meant his father said i also know van was trying to rattle you not me because he knows youre the easier mark i deny everything van said there dagref was triumphant even van sounds a bit like you father and ill bet he didnt before he came to fox keep that was true van and gerin had remarked on it too neither of them remarked on it now perhaps for fear of making dagref even more insufferable about his own cleverness than he was already then shouts came from the far rear of the bending imperial line gerin leaned forward trying to make out what they were a moment later he let out a shout of his own our men and aragis have joined hands weve got em in the barrelnow we pound em flat his men shouted too as they realized theyd surrounded the army of the elabonian empire most of the shouts were threats aimed at the imperials but the men from south of the high kirs stolidly fought on doing their foes as much harm as they could i think theyre too stupid to know how badly beaten they are van said you could be right gerin allowed if you are though its not the worst way for a soldier to be ferdulf kept on flying above the imperials and diving down to dismay them as before arrows refused to strike him he rose on high and dove rose on high and dove then he rose and instead of diving on the imperials flew straight to gerin watch out the little demigod shouted pointing to the southwest watch out what is it gerin demanded wishing ferdulf had been more specific and then when ferdulf was specific the fox wished he hadnt been theres another imperial army as big as this one or maybe bigger heading straight for us were going to get smashed like a bug between two rocks in remarkably selfpossessed tones dagref said well now we know why the imperials who are already here didnt panic when we surrounded them dont we gerin agreed sourly unlike aragis the general in command of the elabonian empires newly reinforced forces was capable of real strategy hed set out this tempting army here certain the men of the northlands would leap on it like a starving longtooth and the men of the northlands had leapedand now they were going to pay for it ferdulf hovered in front of gerins face like the gadfly he was what are you going to do he screeched what are we going to do were going to get licked thats what were going to do van said ferdulf screeched again this time wordlessly hes right of course gerin said which made ferdulf screech at him ignoring the racket the fox went on only question left now is how badly we get licked ferdulf go tell aragis what you just told me hes on the right hell get hammered harder than my troopers will i dont want to talk to aragis ferdulf stuck out his lower lip hes nasty go talk to aragis gerin shouted ferdulf flew off gerin hoped he flew off in obedience rather than in a fit of the sulks but wouldnt have bet anything he minded losing on it we ought to pull back now dagref said i know but we cant gerin grimaced if we save ourselves like that we leave aragis in the lurch why shouldnt we dagref asked hed do it to us mm i think not not here gerin answered if he goes under altogether or if i do that leaves the other one to face the whole weight of the empire by himself that doesnt strike me as something i want to do well maybe dagref said grudgingly gerin didnt find out whether ferdulf told the archer the second imperial army was on the way it mattered little aragis could not have remained in doubt very much longer the new cry of elabon elabon elabon pierced the rest of the battlefield noise like a knifeblade piercing flesh elabon elabon elabon the surrounded imperials answered the war cry with one of their own as soon as he realized he was trapped rather than trapper aragis pulled away from the battle without the slightest concern for what that might do to gerin the fox was less infuriated at finding his prediction wrong than he would have been otherwise for aragis was the one stuck between the two imperial forces most of the pressure fell on him gerin was able to break off his part of the fight without too much trouble and then having broken off he ordered his troopers forward in one last charge against the imperial force he and aragis had lately surrounded that made those imperials turn aside from their assault on the archer to repel him van sighed helping aragis get loose are you see any better ideas gerin asked the outlander sighed again no but i wish i did youre hurting yourself while youre helping him dont remind me gerin stared across the field aragis did seem to be pulling back not being surroundedthe fate he and gerin and inflicted though not for long enough on the first army from south of the high kirs seeing that aragis men would not be immediately cut off and destroyed satisfied the fox that hed done his duty by his ally now back he shouted now we get away he didnt know how hard the imperials would press his retreating force they had the numbers now to press him and aragis at the same time if they so chose the lunge they made after his men turned out to be halfhearted for one thing they remained intent on trying to break aragis against whom they could bring more warriors to bear than against gerin for another most of rihwins horsemenas many as were ablefell back on gerins force rather than on aragis the imperial chariotry had greatperhaps even exaggeratedrespect for the riders whose feints and countercharges looked to intimidate them and keep them from pressing harder than they did rihwin himself rode back to gerin with an anxious expression on his face i pray the wine is safe lord king he said its not the biggest thing on my mind right now gerin said in lieu of getting down from the chariot to find a rock with which to hit rihwin in the head im more worried about everything else the supply wagons carried most of them were on aragis side of the field without journeybread and sausage and cheese and whatnot were going to have to start foraging all over the countryside if we want to stay alive wine is also important rihwin insisted it being our best conduit as you yourself said to hope and beg for divine aid from mavrix not a good hope gerin said but the comment held enough sense to keep him from again wishing to clout his fellow fox he sighed all right rihwin have it your way i hope the wine is safe too now let me get back to running this retreat if you please rihwin sketched a salute lord king i obey his eyes twinkled when i feel like it i obey he rode off before gerin could find an answer the one thing of which the fox was glad was that his men still showed fight that let him conduct the sort of retreat the imperials had made before a retreat with teeth in it his lines werent so neat as the ones the men from the elabonian empire had maintained but they werent pushing him so hard as hed pushed them that evened things out as the imperials had broken free of his pursuit so his army broke free of theirs where now van asked what now those were indeed the relevant questions gerin took the second one first not because he had an answer but because he didnt i havent the faintest notion of what now except to get away in the best way we can so the imperials still have to do some fighting after the battle we just lost have to see what sort of shape were in have to see what sort of shape aragis men are in have to see if the empire lets us rejoin them maybe i stop being a king and go back to being a baron would you do that father dagref asked some concern in his voice if gerin was not a king dagref never would be i might if i didnt think the empire would nail me to a cross for taking a title they say i have no right to the fox replied being a kingby the gods even being a baronnever meant all that much to me of itself the best part of it always has been that its given me the power i need to make people leave me and mine alone but i dont think his usurping majesty crebbig i will want anyone around whos dared defy his glory and so im better off to keep on fighting thats the way of it van agreed you keep standing till they knock you down and you cant get up any more he looked around well be on our feet again before too long nowthe other question i put to you where now northeast the way were going gerin replied without hesitation with all these big villages that are almost little towns around the farmers down here are plainly growing more than they can eat by themselves if we have to forage off the countryside lets forage off countryside thatll give us enough to be worth taking makes sense to me the outlander said besides gerin said even if i dont know whats happened to most of our supply wagons i saw taverns in some of those towns tonight im going to drink something better than water not enough better if you listen to rihwin van said if you listen to rihwin youll hear any number of things that arent so gerin said youll hear any number of things that may be so but probably arent youll hear any number of things that are so but dont matter at the moment and i dont deny youll hear some things that do matter but winnowing the grain from the chaff is often more trouble than its worth you have the right of that van rumbled laughter then his heavyfeatured face grew bleak ive not seen maeva since the fighting started have you set eyes on her captain no gerin answered he did not like the way van looked at himit was as if the outlander were measuring him for a grave but then dagref said shes in the retreat with the rest of us i saw her off on what would have been our left when we were facing the imperial army i suppose its our right now that weve turned our backs on them she must have been one of the riders who got farthest around the flank of the first imperial force before the other one made us break off ah thats good to hear van said and his features cleared sounds like your child too to be at the fore of the fighting gerin said also more than a little relieved it does doesnt it now van looked proud and puzzled at the same time who would have thought a girl child would take after me so though i never did not for a moment dagref looked back over his shoulder if you dont mind my saying so you should have shes been practicing with bow and sword and spear since shes been big enough to hold them in her hands shes kept working with them too to get to be as good as she is why would she do all that if she didnt intend to use them in war one day when you ask it that way lad i have no good answer for you the outlander said with a sigh i thought it was a childish thing in her i suppose and that she would put it aside when she turned into a woman and take up the things of a woman instead that didnt happen dagref said if youd been paying attention youd have noticed shes been a woman for a year and she hasnt come close to putting aside her practice shes worked harder than ever as a matter of fact has she vans tone was surprised not so much at the news perhaps as at how emphatically dagref gave it to him youve been paying close attention havent you well of course i have dagref answered ive been practicing a good deal myself you know if i didnt notice what people did around me i wouldnt be much use to anyone would i van grunted and subsided perhaps he was even convinced dagref had spoken most convincingly he might even have believed what he was saying himself over the years gerin had seen a great many people talk themselves into believing what wasnt so thoughtfully the fox shook his head he was of the opinion that dagref was concealing from van rather than deluding himself he was also of the opinion that dagref had made special note of maeva practicing because she was maeva not because she was practicing hed also caught maeva noticing dagref which made life less than dull the sun sank toward the western horizon the imperials stopped harassing gerins rear guard and drew back he hadnt thought they would do anything else but he hadnt thought they would bring a second army over the high kirs either if aragis had been generous instead of greedy and given the fox the right instead of the left the archer would have had the easier retreat and gerin would have had to contend with two forces at once he wondered if aragis was thinking the same thing at the moment up ahead sat one of those notquitetowns common here close to the high kirs gerin ordered his men to encamp a couple of bowshots from it he wasnt worried about feeding them not tonight most of them would have bread or sausage or something on their persons and those who didnt would be able to get something he did need some sort of sacrifice against the night ghosts though he walked up toward the village dagref at his side van stayed behind to talk with maeva whod come through unhurt dagref had wanted to do that too but vans presence persuaded him to take himself elsewhere when gerin got to the village he wondered if anyone would be there at all his army had passed nearby on the way south and so had the imperials before them to his relief he found that if the inhabitants had fled as warriors briefly approached the place they were back now they were also willing he discovered to sell him a couple of sheep how did you keep somebody from stealing them he asked oh we managed answered the man who had them three words summed up generations of dealing with nobles and warriors always being the weaker but somehow getting through admiring that resilience gerin said well come to the tavern and have a jack of ale with my son and me ill take you up on that the villager said he led the fox and dagref into the tavern which wasnt too clean but likewise wasnt too dirty three ales he told the woman who looked to be in charge of the place he pointed to gerin this fellow here is doing the buying she nodded and filled three jacks she was somewhere in early middle age brown hairbeginning to go graypulled back from her pale face and tied behind her in the growing gloom inside the tavern gerin couldnt make out what color her eyes were she carried the jacks over to the table where he his son and the villager sat she didnt set them down till the fox put money on the table then she nodded and said here you are gerins head came up so suddenly that dagref and the villager stared he knew her voice her eyes were green he still could not see them but he knew hoarsely he spoke her name elise viii she set the tarredleather drinking jacks on the table very slowly and carefully as if they were cut rock crystal that might shatter at a touch gerin felt as if he might shatter at a touch too here whats this the villager said the two of you know each other how in the five hells do you know each other we manage gerin said his voice still ragged dagrefs eyes were wide as rounds of flatbread aye we do elise sounded as much taken aback as the fox did turning to him she said i didnt know your face i didnt know who you were till i heard you speak nor i you he answered he scratched at his beard he knew how gray it was its been a long long time yes she looked from him to dagref and back again slowly some small question in her voice she said surely this isnt duren he would be older youre right gerin nodded this is dagref my older son by selatre my wife since a few years after you you left did you know that duren is lord of the holding that belonged to your father elise shook her head which meant she was hearing of the death of her father ricolf the red for the first time no i didnt know she answered news moves slowly when it moves at all how long how five years ago now the fox answered a fit of apoplexy from everything i heard it was as easy as such things can be duren has the holding firmly in his hands these days does he elise still looked dazed she had plenty to be dazed about gerin was feeling dazed too he also felt as if hed tumbled twenty years back through time into a part of his life long closed off from that in which he was living now and had been since hed found selatre the villager whod come into the tavern with gerin and dagref gulped his ale well id best be off he said and got up from his stool and hurried out into the sunset dagref by contrast stared in fascination from gerin to elise and back again the fox thought his sons ears curled forward to hear the better but that might have been his imagination he hoped it was quietly he said son why dont you take the sheep back to the camp so theyre sacrificed before the sun goes down but dagref began he stopped then tried again but i want to then he realized that what gerin had phrased as a polite request was in fact an order and one that brooked no contradiction the glare gerin sent his way helped him realize that regretfully resentfully sulkily and very very slowly he did as his father bade him elises laugh was nervous he wanted to hear everything she said of course he did gerin said and once hed heard it hed know it all and be able to give back any piece of it you wanted as near word for word as makes no difference hed even understand most of it he takes after you elise murmured by her tone she didnt altogether intend that as a compliment gerin started to get angry before he let the anger show he saw that half of itmaybe more than half of it no certainly more than half of itwas all the things he hadnt been able to say since shed disappeared now trying to crawl out of his throat at once with an effort he crammed them back how have you been he asked a question that seemed unlikely to throw oil on the fire how do i look she answered everything she said seemed to have a bitter edge to it as if youve seen hard times gerin said she laughed again what do you know of hard times youve always been a baron in a keep or a prince or a king your bellys been full people do what you tell them to do even your son does what you tell him to do and who says the gods no longer give us as many miracles as wed like gerin said once a long time before his sarcasm had amused her now she just tossed her head waiting for him to say something of consequence holding back the anger was harder with an edge in his own voice he said im sorry its been hard for you it didnt have to be you know you could could what elise broke in could have stayed that would have been harder yet why do you think i left my best guess always was that you left because you got bored and wanted something new and didnt much care what it was gerin answered as long as it was new that would suit you you were the prince of the north elise said you were having a fine time being the prince of the northsuch a fine time you forgot all about me i was good enough for a brood mare and that was that one side of gerins mouth twisted in what was not a smile i needed to do everything i did you know if i hadnt done what i did odds are neither one of us would be here hashing this out now the trokmoi would have swallowed up a lot more land than they did thats likely so elise nodded i never said you werent good at what you did i just said you paid more attention to it than you did to meexcept when you wanted to take me to bed of course and you didnt pay all that much attention to me then not fair he said he hadnt seen her for twenty years and yet she knew how to get under his skin as if theyd never been apart i never looked anywhere else i never wanted to look anywhere else of course not elise said why would you i was handy come here elise take off your skirt it wasnt like that gerin insisted oh but it was she said they glared at each other gerin was convinced he remembered things just as theyd been elise obviously was as convinced her memory was straight and his crooked he had no records not for something like that he sighed its done its over you made sure it would be over have you been happier since than you would have been if youd stayed with me i hope so for your sake decent of you to say so though talk is cheap ive seen how cheap talk is over the years she pursed her lips have i been happier than i would have been if id stayed behind every once in a while much happier all together i doubt it the answer held a certain bleak honesty gerin sighed again he was tempted to walk out walk back to the encampment and spend the rest of his life pretending hed never run into the woman whod borne his oldest son but that thought brought up another one one he needed to ask about for durens sake do you have any other children i had two both girls she answered and then looked down at the ground neither one of them lived to be two years old im sorry gerin said so am i she said even more bleakly than before when she raised her head once more unshed tears glittered in her eyes you know you take a chance loving them but you cant help it no you cant gerin said ive had three since who lived we lost one youve been lucky elise said soberly she studied him for a moment then repeated herself in a different tone of voice youve been lucky yes of course i have he replied ive been steady too he could see she didnt understand what he was talking about when hed known her shed been ready to turn her world upside down at a moments notice that was how the two of them had come together he doubted shed changed much since that made her steady in an unsteady way youve been lucky she said yet again you sound as if you were even lucky enough to find a woman whose temper matches yours i didnt think there was any such creature you threw me aside he said of course you wouldnt think anyone else might want me thats not elise paused she was relentlessly honest well maybe it is true but not all true however you like gerin shrugged he could feel how tight a grip he had on his temper it struggled and writhed in that grip too the way van did when they wrestled together as the fox did with van he felt it liable to escape at any moment to try to hold it in check he asked did you find a man who matched your temper several of them she answered given how steadily changeable she was that saddened the fox a little but didnt surprise him elise scowled the latest one threw me over the son of a whore for a woman who couldnt have been more than half his age if he hadnt left this place in a hurry id have slit his throat for him or maybe slit him somewhere else she sounded like fand gerin thought she would have done it if shed got the chance as fand would have he asked how is what this fellow did to you any different from what you did to me he probably shouldnt have said that he realized as much as soon as the words were out of his mouth which was of course too late elise had been scowling at the latest man to disappear from her life now she scowled at gerin i never pretended prillon didnt exist i never pretended you didnt exist gerin returned ha elise tossed her head the tone flayed meat from the foxs bones he hadnt had that tone aimed at him in a long time she went on no one is so blind as the person who thinks he sees everything thats true gerin agreed he saw that she was applying it to him she had not a clue that it also applied to her even after his remark she didnt apply her own comment to herself the fox shrugged he hadnt expected that she would not really it hardly seems fair she said ive struggled all this time and what have i to show for it nothing to speak of and youyouve just gone on and on and on you were the one who left gerin answered with yet another shrug i didnt put you on a boat in the middle of the niffet and heave you over the side i would have he broke off he wouldnt have been happier had she stayed for a little while he might have been over the long haul of years he was happier the way things had turned out her mouth tightened she must have realized what hed been about to say and why he hadnt said it you may as well go she said theres nothing left at all is there no he answered even if that wasnt quite true the thing that had been dead inside him for twenty years stirred like a ghost at sunset but even ghosts drawn by the boon of blood that tried to give good advice only howled unintelligibly like the wind a man who listened to the wind instead of his own mind and heart deserved to be called a fool gerin pretended not to hear this ghost too would you like another jack of ale elise asked with brittle politeness thank you no hed seldom been so tempted to drink till he couldnt see he thought for a moment then said if you like ill send a messenger up to duren to ask if he wants you to come stay at the keep that was your fathers its durens through me elise said angrily why shouldnt i simply go and stay there if i so choose gerin ticked off points on his fingers item i am not the lord of that holding duren is item i do nothing to take a hand in his affairs without his leave item you left fox keep when he was barely able to toddle why are you sure hed want to see you now i am his mother elise said as if to a halfwit gerin shrugged her eyes blazed i remember why i left fox keep too you are the most coldblooded man the gods ever set on the face of the earth gerin shrugged again that made elise angrier to the five hells with you she snapped what would happen if i left on my own and traveled to my fathers holdingmy sons holdingby myself she would put herself in danger traveling alone after the life shed lived she had to know that after the life shed lived she also had to be good at coming through danger and she might find herself in danger if she stayed here too the imperials are liable to be coming through this place in a few days he warned im not afraid of them elise answered i have kin south of the high kirs too you know so you do gerin said if they happen to feel like it i suppose the imperials could give you an escort to the country south of the mountainsmaybe even down to the city of elabon his voice held a sardonic bite elise though chose to take him seriously maybe they would she said why shouldnt they im kin to nobles close to the emperor nobles close to the man who had been the emperor gerin thought how they stand with crebbig i is anyones guess how glad theyll be to see you is anyones guess too they werent very glad when you came calling on them before the werenight he didnt get the chance to say any of those things before he could elise went on and then id be living in the capital of the elabonian empire and youd be stuck here in the northlands how would you like that she was gloating loving the idea she knew how hed longed for the life of the city of elabon when hed been together with her he still longed for it but the longing wasnt a vital part of him any more even if it did stir in his heart now and again like her it had become a piece of his past and he was satisfied to leave it so he said ive spent most of the time since you left me trying to make the northlands into the sort of place where i might want to live up around fox keep i havent done too badly im happy enough to stay where i am if youd sooner go down to the city of elabon go ahead elise glared at him that wasnt the answer he was supposed to give nor the way he was supposed to respond he was supposed to get angry to shout and act jealous elise didnt quite know what to do when he failed to perform as expected he got to his feet im going to go if you like i will send a messenger up to duren i owe you so much at least if you want me to perhaps youd better come along with me he didnt like that not even a little but saw no other choice the gods only know what sort of shape this village will be in after the imperials come through here the only woman in among your army she said coldly no thank you no indeed you wouldnt be the only woman the fox answered vans daughter maeva is along riding a horse under rihwins command that startled elise she could fight gerin knew as much shed never dreamt of making a life of soldiering though after a moment her eyes went hard again no thank you she repeated id sooner take my chances with the elabonian empire have it your way gerin said you were always bound and determined to do that anyhow werent you me elise exclaimed what about you you know what the trouble is the fox said sadly the trouble is were both right thats probably one of the things that helped split us apart elise shook her head dont blame me for that you did it however you like gerin sighed goodbye elise i dont wish you ill if youre still here after we drive the imperials out of the northlands think again about finding out whether duren wants to see you maybe ill ask the imperials to take me up to his holdingmy holding she said theyre going forward youre not his face froze goodbye elise he said again and left the tavern at the edge of the village he looked back over his shoulder she was not standing in the doorway watching him go he hadnt really expected she would be captain why in the five hells arent you getting drunk van demanded something horrible like that happened to me i wouldnt be able to turn both eyes in the same direction for the next three four days when i first set eyes on her i thought that was just what i was going to do the fox answered but do you know what its been so long shes not important enough to me for me to want to do that vans eyes got wide that may be the saddest thing anybody ever said gerin thought about it i dont know not getting over her in all this time would be worse dont you think shes not much like mother is she dagref spoke very slowly picking his words with obvious care he didnt want to offend the fox who had after all fathered his halfbrother on elise but he also didnt want to speak well of her he balanced the one and the other better than most youths his age could have done gerin considered the question as carefully as dagref had asked it some ways yes some ways no he replied at last shes a very bright woman the same as your mother is but i dont think elise is ever happy with what she has if its not perfect its not good enough for her thats foolish dagref said van guffawed this from the lad who if you tell a dirty story twice and say the whore was awkward the first time and then that she was clumsy the next will call you on the difference then and there dagref had the grace to blush or perhaps the embers got a little more ruddy he said actually i think you called her stumblefooted the first time i heard that story didnt you stumblefooted i never van broke off and glared at dagref youre having me on do you know what i do to people who try having me on something dreadful and appalling or you wouldnt be telling me about it dagref returned unabashed what are we going to do about him fox van said to the five hells with me if i know gerin answered the way i look at it its the worlds lookout as much as dagrefs the way i look at it youre right van said dagref didnt rise to that as he might have a couple of years before nor did he let himself be diverted asking if shes different from my mother why did you marry her it seemed like a good idea at the time the fox replied dagref folded his arms across his chest not about to let an answer like that be fobbed off on him it was a pose gerin had assumed many times with larcenous peasants stubborn nobles and his own children having it aimed at him made him chuckle in spite of everything he said you cant always know ahead of time how youll get along with somebody you cant always know ahead of time if youll get along with somebody thats so van agreed take a look at fand and me oh nonsense gerin said glad to be talking about someone elses marriage instead of his own you knew perfectly well that you and fand didnt get along aye true enough the outlanders grin was on the sheepish side but we make a sport of fighting if you know what i mean most of the time we make a sport of fighting i should say some of it now some of it turns real i dont understand dagref turned to gerin why would you want to fight with someone you love someone youre living with why are you asking me the fox said i dont want to do that he does he pointed at van its the first time ive ever heard him say so out loud though to the crows with you van spoke without much rancor you want so much peace and quiet fox you want life to be dull all the bloody time no gerin shook his head this was an old argument and one in which he could take part without bruising i just dont want life to blow up in my face the way a pot of bean stew will if you leave it in the fire with the lid on too tight for too long sometimes life does blow up in your face though dagref said a truth as selfevident as any at the moment what are you going to do about this woman again he took a little thought to find the phrase he wanted nothing gerin replied which made both dagref and van stare at him he went on i wont send her up to duren without finding out whether he wants to have anything to do with her i offered to bring her along with the army so shed find out as soon as i did whether he wants her to come up to his holding but she said no to that van coughed if she hangs around here she wont know for a goodish while what duren has to say because the imperials arent going to stop following us theyll be here day after tomorrow at the latest i dont think that was the biggest worry in her mind gerin answered she has relatives south of the high kirs youve met one of themremember aye now that you remind me of it some sort of fancy noble gave the emperor advice van frowned in concentration valdabrunthats what his name was he had a mistress i wouldnt have minded tasting at all thats the name gerin agreed now me id forgotten about his leman till you called her to my mind you were too busy staring at elise to have much room left in your mind for other women the outlander said gerin would have got angry at him had he not been telling the truth dagref said if her family were advisors to the old emperor what does this new emperor think of them i dont know gerin answered that also crossed my mind i dont think it crossed elises and by then i wasnt going to bring it up if she goes south of the high kirs shes gone thats all i wont miss her not a bit and that was true or almost true hed missed her more than hed imagined possible back in the days just after she first left him occasional echoes of that feeling had kept cropping up through the years even after hed been happily yoked to selatre for a long time was one of those echoes cropping up now if it was he didnt intend to admit it even to himself he waited for van or dagref to challenge him van after all had known elise while dagref had few compunctions about asking questions no matter how personal but neither of them said anything he realized neither of them was going to say anything a small sigh of relief escaped him theyd let him off the hook ferdulf flying above them gerins men rolled north through the village the next morning the fox wondered if elise would come out and watch them go as some of the villagers did he didnt see her once hed passed through he decided that was just as well now instead of screening the armys advance rihwins riders covered the retreat they did a better job of that than gerin had thought when he gave them the duty rihwin came trotting up to him to report the imperials keep dogging us aye lord king but not very hard weve taught them respect i think for they are never sure if we might gallop out at them from some unexpected direction thats good gerin said if wed taught them so much respect that they stopped dogging us altogether that would be even better it would also be too much to ask for rihwin pointed out oh i wasnt asking for it gerin said if i did no one would pay me any attention but it would be better eryes rihwin said and soon found an excuse to rejoin his riders van chuckled that was well done captain not easy to confuse rihwinnot least i expect on account of hes so often confused on his ownbut you managed the outlander lost his smile have to tell you though im a bit on the confused side myself what are we doing now and why are we doing that instead of something else what are we doing the fox repeated were falling backthats what why are we doing it i can think of three reasons offhand he ticked them off on his fingers if we dont fall back the imperials will smash us here thats one if we do fall back maybe the imperials will string themselves out or give us some chance to hit part of them from ambush thats two and as were falling back were falling back into country that hasnt been foraged too heavily so we wont starve which we would and pretty bloody quick if we stay where we are three aye well there is that van looked around falling back toward land aragis rules if were not on that land already dont know how happy hell be if we take everything that isnt tied down and cut the lashings off what is tied down so we can take that too gerin looked around to the five hells with me if i know where aragis southern border is maybe well find boundary stones maybe we wont to the five hells with me if i care either if aragis thinks im going to starve to death to keep from bothering his serfs precious crops to the five hells with him too over his shoulder dagref said if the threat lay by the niffet hed eat you out of house and home without a second thought well the gods know thats true gerin said now he looked straight ahead north and a little east a thoughtful expression on his face ikos is just on the other side of aragis holdings too ive never had cause to go to the sibyl by the southern route but maybe i will he nodded more decisively than hed thought he would yes indeed maybe i will dagref said in the learned genealogies they say biton is a son of dyaus allfather but gerin held up his hand but thats elabonians writing for elabonians below the high kirs he finished biton is truly a god of this land here and everyone who lives in the northlands knows it even so dagref said compared to the gods of the gradi baivers god of brewing and barley is a god of this land even though we elabonians brought him here a couple of hundred years ago when we conquered this province because he is a god of this land you were able to use him against the gods of the gradi from that it would follow logically that i might use biton against the elabonian empire gerin interrupted once more yes i thought you might not have seen it dagref said a little sulkily well i did gerin clapped his son on the back dont let it worry you the two of us think a lot alike youre both sneaky van put in thank you gerin and dagref said in the same breath which made the outlander stare from one of them to the other gerin continued as i was saying before we were disturbed by a breath of wind there honh van said the two of us think a lot alike but ive been doing it longer so its likely ill come up with a lot of the same notions you do gerin went on imperturbably that shouldnt disappoint you and it shouldnt stop you from telling me whats on your beady little mind honh now dagref interrupted doing a surprisingly good impression of van gerin talked through him as hed talked through the outlander because you never can tell you might come up with something ive missed he took a deep breath triumphant at finally managing to complete his thought fair enough father dagref heaved his shoulders up and down in a sigh hard sometimes being a smaller less detailed copy of the man youve already become it makes me feel rather like an abridged manuscript no not an abridged one gerin said you just have a lot more blank parchment left at the end of your scroll than i do thats all hmm dagref contemplated that well all rightmaybe so he flicked the reins and urged the horses up to a better pace by the things youve said fox i know what the difference between you and him is van remarked tell me gerin urged dagrefs back expressed mute interest i will van said the difference is fox that your father had no more idea what to do with you than a crow would with a chick that came out of the egg with white feathers instead of black is that so or am i lying its so sure enough gerin agreed my brother was a warrior born everything my father could have wanted my father hadnt the slightest notion what to make of me i might be the first real live scholar spawned in the northlands in better than a hundred years and yet youre a king while your father died a baron so you never can tell van said but my point is dagrefs the second real live scholar spawned in the northlands you have a notion of what youve got there while your father had never a clue with you ah gerin said well theres some truth in that sure enough how about it dagref do you like it better that i can guess along with you some of the time or would you rather i had never a clue dagref looked back over his shoulder at the fox again i can guess along with you some of the time father what in the world makes you think you can guess along with me van guffawed gerin felt his ears heat riders and charioteers fanned out through the countryside around the village by which gerin had chosen to camp for the night they brought back cattle and sheep and ducks and chickens had to let the air out of a shepherd before hed cough up his beasts one rider said patting his bow so as to leave no possible doubt about what he meant under other circumstances gerin would have been angry at him for alienating the peasantry as things were the fox hardly noticed the comment he had his sword in his left hand and was wondering if hed have to start carving chunks off the village headman who was doing his best to act like an idiot from birth no the fellow said we dont have no grain stored in pits we dont have no beans in pits neither thats very interesting gerin said very interesting indeed i suppose you get through every winter by not eating during most of it seems that way a lot of the time the headman answered sullenly well all right gerins voice was light and blithe i suppose well just have to burn this place down so all these houses here dont get in our way while were searching the headman sent him a look full of loathing and led him over to the storage pits which had been concealed by grass growing over them i thought you had a name for being soft alongside aragis the peasant grumbled only goes to show you cant always trust what you hear doesnt it the fox returned with a smile the village headmans glare held even more hate than it had before having got what he wanted gerin generously affected not to notice keeping his army fed was at the moment more important than keeping aragis peasants happy that was his opinion at any rate he discovered the next day that aragis had a different one a chariot bearing the archers son aranast came jouncing over a side road toward gerins army when aranast had made his way up alongside the fox he spoke without preamble lord king my father forbids you from foraging on the countryside while in lands whose overlord he is does he gerin answered thats nice aranast took off his bronze potlike helm and scratched his head does that mean you will obey this prohibition of course not gerin replied if he can teach me how to subsist on no food while i cross his lands i might try it otherwise though ill do what i have to do to get through them you dare go against my fathers stated will aranasts eyes went round and wide and staring no one in aragis lands had dared go against his stated will for many years though aranast gave signs of being a fairly formidable fellow in his own right he seemed astonished anyone might imagine going against his fathers stated will i just said so werent you listening gerin asked politely hes not my suzerain so im under no obligation to obey him and hes told me to do something impossible which means id be an idiot to obey him do i look like an idiot to you young fellow aranast didnt answer that which might have been just as well his frown did its best to be severe to the point of threatening people were no doubt much more in the habit of calling him things like prince and heir and maybe your highness than young fellow taking a deep breath he said my father entered into alliance with you in good faith he did not enter into it to give you leave to plunder his holdings oh dont be a pompous twit gerin said which flicked aranast on his vanity much harder than young fellow had done the fox went on i told you once i dont aim to let myself starve if i were plundering though id have booty with me wouldnt i im feeding myself and im feeding my men would you like some roast mutton generous of you to offer me what already belongs to my father aranast remarked dagref was much younger but would have done the sarcasm better than aranast even so still the effort was there gerin rewarded it with sarcasm of his own glad you think so that drew another glare from aragis son where is your father anyhow the fox asked west of here aranast answered the imperials still press him hard some of them are between him and you i had to thread my way past them to deliver his word to you and to have you set it aside as being of no account it was a foolish word to deliver and you can tell him i said so he might be better off if more people let him know when he was being foolish gerin said but he sees no hope of linking with me again he does not being too sore beset aranast answered he hoped you might rejoin him and also expressed the hope that you would use your skill at magic to good effect in the struggle against the empire ill do everything i can gerin said with a sigh aragis persisted in believing he could do things he couldnt he held up a forefinger has aragis also forbidden the imperials from plundering his holdings aranast shook his head no for he did not think it would do any good you however are not his enemy unless you choose to make yourself so or unless he makes me one by insisting i do things i cant gerin said a man who asks too much of his friends starts finding out he doesnt have so many friends as he thought he did i will take your words back to my father that he may judge them for himself aranast said stiffly fine the fox told him tell him this too if he wants to fight a war against me after we beat the empire ill be ready the same as i was ready to fight a war against him before i knew the imperials were on this side of the high kirs he kept astonishing aranast you challenge my father aragis son said no one challenges my father ive done it for more than twenty years as hes challenged me all that time gerin answered tell him im doing what i have to do here no moreand no less still scowling still muttering to himself aranast aragis son got back into his chariot and rattled off toward the west toward whatever was left of aragis army well he doesnt lack for nerve thats certain van said eyeing the dust the horses hooves and the chariots wheels kicked up from the track along which it traveled who doesnt gerin asked aragis or aranast both of em now that i think on it the outlander replied gerin watched that receding plume of dust too after a moment he nodded getting livestock and grain from the peasants who lived under aragis rule turned out to be for the most part easier than gerin had expected the majority of village headmen had lived so long under the archer they seemed to have forgotten the possibility of cheating an overlord take what you will lord one of them told gerin whatever you take youd do worse to us if we tried to hide it from you the men and women who came up to listen to him talking with the fox nodded aragis evidently had given lessons of that sort a few villages though appeared to have no substance whatsoever only huts and whatever was ripening in the fields gerins men found no livestock even on searching the nearby woods and the headmen at such places staunchly denied having grain pits anywhere by their huts do what you want with me one said i cant give you what i havent got you should be careful saying things like that gerin told him if you said them to aragis or his men theyd do it the headman pulled off his tunic and stood there in his wool trousers he turned his back on the fox long pale ridged scars crisscrossed it laid the whip on himself he did he said with something that sounded almost like pride he didnt come away with anything here either on account of there isnt anything to come away with after seeing those scars gerin gave up and went on to the next village whose headman proved more tractable the fox remained unconvinced the serfs hed just left had as little as theyd shown but lacked both time and inclination to check as hard as he might have otherwise he also knew a certain amount of admiration for their headman anyone who could stand up to aragis had more than the common amount of nerve every so often the imperials hounding the foxs force would press forward a couple of the skirmishes were sharp but the men from south of the high kirs made no effort to get close to his army stay close to it and hound it to death which was what he would have done to theirs had it not been reinforced he wondered how aragis fared with more imperials after him the archer had sent no more messengers to him after aranasts unsuccessful mission keeps dotted the landscape as they did throughout the northlands most of the nobles who dwelt in them had gone to fight under aragis these days the castles housed striplings graybeards and noblewomen who were often more determined than the menfolk left behind some of the keeps opened their gates to share what they had and let gerin and some of his officers sleep in real beds somevery often those where petty barons wives seemed to be in chargestayed shut up tight against his force as if against enemies if youre friends you wont be offended that we dont let you in because youll understand why we dont one of those women called from the walkway around the wall of the keep she was running and if youre foes masquerading as friendswell to the five hells with you in that case gerin didnt push her any further for one thing he would have had to lay siege to the keep to get inside if she wouldnt let down the drawbridge for another what she said made perfectly good sense from her point of view van thought so too saying by the gods if fand were running a keep thats the sort of defiance she would shout youre likely right gerin raised an eyebrow maybe maeva gets it from both sides of the family aye maybe she van broke off three words too late and gave the fox a dirty look and maybe you talk out of both sides of your mouth maybe i do when theres a need but not this time gerin said ive said the same thing all along here van rumbled something down deep in his chest maybe it was just a discontented noise maybe it was an oath in one of the many languages hed picked up in his travels whatever it was he changed the subject whats the road up to ikos from the south like ive never taken it myself so i cant tell you for certain gerin answered i hear though that its easier than jogging west off the elabon way because it doesnt go through that haunted forest in the hill country there i wont miss that forest a bit thank you very much van said with a shudder theres things in there that dont think men have any business going through on the roads the gods help you if you wander off under the trees or if youre stupid enough to try spending the night there youre right the fox said i wouldnt want to do either of those things sounds like an interesting place said dagref whod never been through the forest van laughed so did gerin as much in awe as in mirth a lot of places sound interesting when you hear people talking about them at a nice safe distance he observed visiting them youll find is a lot less interesting than hearing people talk about them at a nice safe distance youve been into the forest dagref said youve been in it a good many times and you must have always come out the other side or else you wouldnt be here at a nice safe distance talking about it logic gerin agreed gravely but doing it once or even doing it a few times doesnt mean im anxious to do it again unlike some people i could name ive never been wild for adventure for adventures sake one of the things that make adventure adventure is that somebody or something is trying to kill you and im usually against that oh im against anybody or anything trying to kill me too van said best way to stop it ive always thought is to kill whoever or whatever it is first gerin shook his head the best way to stop it is not to put yourself in a place where anybody or anything can try to kill you in the first place a long life and a boring one van said with a sneer this argument strikes me as being moot seeing that we have an imperial army on our tail and another on our left thats dogging aragisthat we hope is dogging aragis dagref said a long boring life van repeated nothing to do but futter women and sit around drinking ale he paused as if listening to what hed just said then he stuck an elbow in gerins ribs almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot well it could be worse aragis holdings ran up close to the southern end of the valley in which lay the village of ikos and bitons shrine not even aragis had been so arrogant as to claim that valley as his own guardsmen from the temple patrolled the road that led up into ikos they did not bother on the road that ran west off the elabon way the strange trees and stranger beasts of the forest through which that road ran guaranteed its safety better than men with bronze weapons and armor of leather and bronze could hope to do here though on an open dirt track they were needed one of them recognized gerin lord king he exclaimed in no small surprise why do you come to ikos by this route after a moment he phrased that differently how do you come to ikos by this route having an army from south of the high kirs on my trail might have something to do with it the fox answered at which the temple guards exclaimed in dismay biton might havesurely would haveseen that but he hadnt told them anything about it gerin went on aragis and i made alliance as you may have heard which is what i was doing down in the direction of the mountains in the first place we had heard you had he had made common cause aye but rumors of the foe have been many and various the soldier answered its the empire even though wed forgotten about it up here it never forgot about us worse luck gerin said the imperials have beaten aragis too and theyre chasing him somewhere off to the west of here how do you suppose the farseeing god would feel about being shoved back into a pantheon headed up in the city of elabon if the empire tries such a thing there will be trouble the guardsman said positively he himself looked to be an elabonian in blood but several of the soldiers with him were plainly of the folk who had lived in the northlands before the elabonian empire first came over the high kirs a couple of centuries before they were slimmer than elabonians with wide cheekbones and delicate pointed chins selatre who had formerly been bitons sibyl at ikos had that look to her one of those men asked and why do you come to ikos now lord king his elabonian was fluent enough but had a halflisping halfhissing accent to it traces of the language the folk of the old blood still sometimes spoke among themselves partly because im in retreat gerin admitted but also partly because i would hear what the farseeing god has to say about thisif lord biton has anything to say about it the guardsman who had spoken first said you cannot bring your whole host into the valley to camp it may be that they shall be permitted to traverse the valley but they may not encamp in it why not gerin asked biton protects his own shrine even if we wanted to plunder we wouldnt dare but bitons protection reaches less certainly to the villages around the sacred precinct the temple guard replied we would not have them plundered surely with your numbers you can overcome us here but what sort of welcome will you have from the god if you do a point gerin said a distinct point very well it shall be as you say id sooner have my men foraging off aragis lands than those here in the valley anyhow so lord king would we the guardsman said you being allied to him i hope you will forgive my saying so but aragis the archer has not always made the most comfortable of neighbors he hasnt always made the most comfortable of neighbors for me either the fox answered and he has fewer reasons to keep from stepping on my toes than to keep from stepping on bitons or rather biton can do a better job of stepping on aragis toes than i can if hes not gone to war with you in all these years lord king he thinks you can do something along those lines the guard said you flatter me outrageously gerin said he enjoyed flattery there was he told himself nothing wrong with enjoying it the trick was not to take it too seriously when you started believing everything people told you about how clever you were you proved you werent so clever as they said he gave his army their orders the men seemed content enough to rest where they were if the imperials try to bring us to battle lord king well make em sorry they were ever born one of them said which raised a cheer from the rest since the bulk of the force from south of the high kirs was chasing aragis the fox thought his men did have a decent chance of doing just that when he started forward up into bitons valley adiatunnus surprised him by coming ahead too by your leave lord king im fain to be after seeing the sybil myself the trokm chieftain said the oracle here was a famous one youll know even back in the days when i and all my people dwelt north of the niffet yes i did know that gerin nodded but theres summat else you might not ha known adiatunnus said back before balamung the wizard the one you slew now back before he led us south over the river some of our chieftains came down to ikos to hear whether twould be wise to go with that uncanny kern but they were never heard of again that i recall puir wights as a matter of fact i knew that too the fox answered they tried to kill me here van and iand elise tookilled all of them but one he decided moving against me wouldnt be a good notion but balamung caught him and burned him in a wicker cage ah i mind me i heard summat o that now that you speak of it adiatunnus said but youll not mind if i come with you the now not unless you plan on trying to murder me inside the temple the way those other trokmoi did gerin replied nay though i thank you for the offer adiatunnus said which made gerin snort adiatunnus went on ive had my chances that i have and the putting of you in the ground for good and all ive found is more trouble nor its turned out to be worth for your sweet and generous praises far beyond my deserts i thank you most humbly the fox said and adiatunnus snorted in turn with a sigh gerin turned to rihwin if the imperials do pitch into us youre in command till i can get back send word to me straightaway and try not to wreck the army till i can come and join the celebration rihwin gave him a sour look for your sweet and generous praises lord king i thank you gerin chuckled and dipped his head conceding the round to his fellow fox when dagref drove the chariot up toward the temple to biton adiatunnus followed close in his own car above them floated ferdulf the temple guardsmen stared up at him with interest and curiosity so did gerin he said are you sure you want to visit the sibyl and the farseeing god biton and your father dont get on well that would do for an understatement till a better one came along which he didnt think would happen soon ferdulf turned a fine semidivine sneer his way why should i care what my father thinks or does he returned since he has no room in his life for me do his views on otherseven other godsmatter i told him he shouldnt have got into the wine gerin murmured to van the outlander rolled his eyes a mans own children dont listen to him why should anyone elses children whose son is that one of the guardsmen asked pointing up to ferdulf mavrixs gerin answered the sithonian wine god got him on one of my peasant women is it so the warriors eyes widened but mavrix and the lord biton worked together in driving the monsters off the surface of the earth and back into the caverns under bitons shrine so they did gerin agreed and it was the most quarrelsome cooperation youve ever seen in all your born days they drove past several neat little villages and the fields surrounding them the peasants in the valley of ikos were all freeholders owing allegiance to no overlord save biton that arrangement had always smacked of anarchy to the fox but he like aragis fought shy of trying to annex the valley if biton tolerated freeholders here gerin would too ferdulf flew down and hovered alongside gerin like a large badtempered mosquito in confidential tones he asked do you think the farseeing god will be able to tell me how to take vengeance on my father i have no way of knowing that gerin said if i were you though ferdulf i wouldnt get my hopes too high hes all god ferdulf muttered its not fair no it probably isnt gerin admitted but i dont know what you can do about it either white against greenery the marble walls of bitons shrine gleamed ahead the earthquake that had released the monsters had also overthrown it but bitons own power restored it at the same time as biton and mavrix recontained the monsters isnt that pretty adiatunnus said and then in speculative tones doesnt look so strong as the wall of a proper keep though and ive heard the god keeps all manner of pretties inside though so he does gerin said and its worth your life to try to steal any of them biton has a special plague he uses to smite people who walk off with whats his ive seen one or two hes killed with it its not a pretty way to go adiatunnus looked thoughtful but no less acquisitive as they drew near the temple compound back in the days when he was newly over the niffet he likely would have assumed gerin was lying and tried to steal he would have paid for it then he would pay for it now if he tried it too gerin didnt think he would be so foolish outside the gates attendants took charge of the two chariots no others waited there the shrine did not draw the crowds it had before the earthquake let alone before the days when folk came from all over the elabonian empire and even from beyond its borders to gain the sibyls oracular responses a plump priest with a eunuchs smooth face led the travelers into the temple compound ferdulf had been drifting along a couple of feet off the ground as soon as he passed through the entranceway he descended to the earth with a thump that staggered him he glared toward the temple ahead hes a full god too he growled resentfully so i have to do what he wants not what i want still not fair adiatunnus and the couple of trokmoi with him paid no attention they were gaping at the treasures on display in the courtyard chiefest among them the statues of the elabonian emperors ros the fierce who had conquered the northlands for the empire and of his son oren the builder who had erected the temple now standing above the entrance to the sibyls cavern both statues were larger than life both starkly realistic and both made of ivory and gold gerins voice was dry as he gave adiatunnus good advice pull your tongue back in there and stop drooling on the grass och tis no easy thing you ask of me fox darling the trokm chieftain said with a sigh his eyes flicked from the statues to stacked ingots to great bronze bowls supported on golden tripods id heard of these riches but the difference between the hearing of them and the seeing of them with the eyes of a man himself its the difference twixt hearing of a pretty woman and lying with her and these wont be all the gauds either im thinking youre right about that too gerin said theres plenty more in the caverns off the route to the sibyls throne adiatunnus sighed again as at the thought of the pretty woman he would never meet he glowered at the frieze on the entablature above the colonnaded entrance to the temple itself it showed ros the fierce driving back trokmoi with bitons aid adiatunnus did not approve of anything depicting elabonians beating trokmoi gerin didnt suppose he could blame his vassal for that they went into the temple adiatunnus and the two woodsrunners with him exclaimed again this time at the rich marbles of the columns the fancy woods that had gone into the pews and the gold and silver candelabra throwing sheets of light over them ferdulf exclaimed too but he was pointing at the cult statue of biton that stood near the opening into the caverns below the shrine the statue was not an anthropomorphic representation of the farseeing god as were the rest of the images in the compound instead it was a column of black basalt utterly plain except for scratches that might have been eyes and a jutting phallus how old is it ferdulf whispered in this place even he showed a certain amount of respect for the god who ruled here i wouldnt even try to guess gerin answered its been a shrine for a long long time even if it didnt used to be as pretty as we elabonians made it after we came up here not we elabonians ferdulf said testily i am no elabonian for which i thank all the gods biton very much included gerin made his voice sweet as clover honey on your mothers side you are he cherished the horrible look the demigod gave him perhaps he shouldnt have yielded to the temptation reminding ferdulf of his background was liable to make him less willing to oppose the elabonian empire turning aside every temptation though made life too dull to stand the priest waved the suppliants to the pews pray to the lord biton he urged pray that your question will be phrased in such a way as to make his answer which shall be true also meaningfully true for you that gerin thought was good advice the sibyls oracular responses were often obscure clearer after the event than beforehand he tried to clear his mind of all his worries so he could ask a question that would have as unambiguous an answer as possible just for a moment he looked up at the cult statue hed done that on other visits to bitons shrine those crudely carved eyes would seem to come alive for a heartbeat to look back into his he wondered if that would happen again it didand then some for an instant no more he saw the god as he had seen him in the little shack back at fox keep where he undertook his sorceries biton might have been a handsome man but for the eye in the back of his head that showed when he twisted his neck preternaturally far and then he was gone back into the basalt that statuethat is the god ferdulf whisperedhad he seen the apparition too thats not his imagethat is the god its how he looks when he isnt thinking about how he looks and when people arent thinking about how he looks maybe it is gerin said philosophers had always wondered whether gods were as they were because people conceived of them as being that way or if people conceived of gods as they did because the gods essentially were like that the fox suspected such arguments would go on forever have you composed your mind the eunuch priest asked gerin nodded the priest smiled then come with me we shall go down below the ground down to the cave of the sibyl where biton shall speak through her he tried to make it sound mysterious and exotic it was mysterious and exotic but gerin had gone many times into the cavern below the temple to see the sibyland for other darker purposes he climbed to his feet saying lets get on with it the plump eunuch in his fancy robes looked disappointed that the fox and his comrades were not trembling with awe but took a torch and led them all to the mouth of the cave elabonian workmen had put steps down from the cave mouth after a prominent visitor years before tripped fell and broke his ankle soon though gerins feet trod the natural stone of the cavern generations of suppliants seeking guidance from the sibyl had worn a path in the rock but it was a path more visible in torchlight than smooth beneath the feet every so often torches flaming in sconces added their light to that of the burning brand the priest carried a cool breeze made the flames flicker isnt that strange now adiatunnus murmured i always thought the air inside a cave would be still and dead as a corp it is the power of the god the priest said or else its something natural that we dont understand gerin put in the priest glared at him eyeballs glittering in the torchlight gerin looked back steadily biton didnt seem inclined to smite him for blasphemy with a disappointed sniff the priest resumed the journey down to the sibyls cave other paths led off that one other caverns opened onto it bitons priesthood used some of them to store treasures the trokmoi exclaimed at the gleaming precious metals the torches briefly revealed of course they also exclaimed at the beautiful but largely worthless bits of shining rock crystal set here and there in the walls of the cavern and some entrances to sibyls underground chamber were bricked up and sealed not only with masonry but also with potent magical charms some of the bricks baked with round tops like loaves of bread were almost immeasurably ancient ferdulf shivered as he came to one such wall monsters dwell behind these bricks he murmured thats so gerin agreed monsters like geroge and tharma they have an understanding of sorts with us now which is why some of these charms have been set aside here they could come forth but they dont their gods are in our debt for launching them against the gods of the gradi a mad venture the priest said adiatunnus nodded the torchlight made the shadow of his bobbing head dip and swirl since gerin was inclined to agree with them he didnt argue before he was quite ready they came to the sibyls cave bitons priestess sat on a throne that looked as if it had been carved from a single black pearl which glowed nacreously when light fell on it she herself wore a plain tunic of undyed linen the eunuch priest went up to her set a hand on her shoulder and murmured something too low for gerin to catch had the fellow been a whole man he would not have been permitted to touch her not only did sibyls remain lifelong maidens they were not allowed even to touch true men the sibyl looked something like selatrenot close enough to be near kin but plainly of the same blood she eyed gerin with curiosity perhaps the priest had told her who he wasno reason for her to remember his face with his last visit five years in the pastand reminded her that he was wed to the woman whod preceded her on the sibyls throne was she wondering what that would be like if she was she didnt show it you have your question she asked the fox i do he answered here it is how may the empire of elabon be made to give up its claims to the northlands and withdraw its forces south over the high kirs hed phrased it carefully not asking what he could do to make that happen perhaps it would happen without him perhaps it would not happen at all he forced himself to shove that thought aside he had scarcely uttered the last word when the sibyl stiffened she thrashed on the throne limbs splayed awkwardly her eyes rolled up in her head till only the whites showed when she spoke again it was not in her own voice but in bitons a deep virile baritone the foe is strong up to no good to rout him will take bronze and wood you must not find the god you seek twould make your fate a sour reek they snap and float and always trouble but without them fortune turns to rubble ix as soon as ferdulf left the temple compound he hopped into the air and let out a luxurious sigh of relief my feet were getting tired he said and then to gerin well was that obscure enough to suit you and to spare the fox answered ive had difficult omens from biton and the sibyl before but never one close to that as best i could see it was meaningless not difficult dagref said but can you see as far as the farseeing god gerin asked dagref only shrugged adiatunnus said im with the colt lord king when you hear summat without plain sense in it more often the reason is that its senseless than too clever for words im thinking more often than not gerin would have made the same argument here he said ive seen biton be right a good many times when everyone would have thought he was wrong im not going to say hes wrong here not now why do we hope we dont find a god van demanded if were seeking one shouldnt we hope we do find him and which god would you be seeking adiatunnus added twouldnt be biton his own self or were ruined or ever we start but he wouldna say who it was did you see obscure ferdulf had the right word for it gerin said sooner or later we will have the meaning laid out before us aye likely when its too late to do us any good van said that is the way of oracles sometimes the fox agreed but you never know till you try and now that we have gone and tried and got nothing to speak of for it what are we to be doing next adiatunnus asked shall we bring our army through the valley of ikos on the promise we willna linger mind i dont want to do that gerin said i dont think the god wants us to do that if its that or stay out and be destroyed then i might but not before i still have a fighting chance of beating the imperials and no one who opposes a god straight up will do anything but lose you say that dagref said you who have probably outdone more gods in more different ways than anyone else alive but never straight up gerin said the way to deal with gods is to trick them or else to make them do what you want by showing them it gives them some advantage too even if thats just that it lets them score off a rival or else to use a rival either to beat the god whos angry at you or to distract the other god so he doesnt care about you any more thats what you did with the gradi gods dagref said and gerin nodded so it is he answered the brawl i got them into has worked out betterwhich is to say its lasted longerthan i ever dared hope puts me in mind of something that happened to me a good many years ago back in my wandering days van said as they waited for the attendants to bring back their chariots probably something that didnt happen ferdulf said if its anything like most of your stories van glared at him i ought to pop you like the blownup pigs bladder you are he growled ferdulf rose into the air i am the son of a god and you would be wise to remember it lest we discover who pops whom he was not much more than half as tall as the outlander and couldnt possibly have weighed a quarter as much but that little body held power of a different sort from vans brute strength glaring still van said i dont care whose son you are you bigmouthed little weedid like to see you show that even one of my stories even one mind you has the smallest bit of falsehood in it ferdulf fell a few inches a sign of dismay or chagrin how am i supposed to show that he demanded i wasnt born yet when you were having these adventures you tell lies about and i havent been to the preposterous places where you had them then why dont you shut up van asked sweetly why dont you shut up before you open your mouth so wide you fall right in now ferdulf glared before he could say anything adiatunnus said im fain to hear the outlanders tale hes never dull say what else you will of him his comrades nodded vans stories had long been popular along the border shall i go on then van asked when even ferdulf did not say no go on he did this was out in the weshapar country east of kizzuwatna and north of mabalal the weshapar have the most jealous god in the world hes so crazy he wont even let them call him by his name and he has the nerve to claim hes the only real god in the whole wide world foosh what a fool of a god he is adiatunnus than what does he think of the gods of the folk who are lucky enough not to be after worshiping him he thinks they arent real at allthat the people around the weshapar country are imagining them van answered well i like that ferdulf said indignantly id like to fly over his temple and piss on it from on high maybe he would think that was his imagination too or else i could do you want to say what you would do or do you want to hear what this god and i did do van gave mavrixs son a dirty look the attendants fetched the chariots then everyone but ferdulf got into them he floated along beside the one dagref drove oh go on now ferdulf sounded very much like his father which is to say petulant thank you most gracious demigod from living with gerin van had learned to be sardonic when it suited him it didnt suit him very often which made him more dangerous when it did while ferdulf sputtered and fumed the outlander went on this god of the weshapar put me in mind of a jealous husband he was always sneaking around keeping an eye on his people to make sure they didnt worship anyone but him and wait dagref said if this strange god said none of the other gods around him was real how could people worship them they wouldnt be worshiping anything at all logic i dont think this god ever heard of logic and im starting to wish id never heard of you van said between you and ferdulf well be all the way back with the rest of the army before im through anyhow there i was on the way through the weshapar countryits hills and rocks and valleys hot in the summer and cold as all getout in the wintertrading this for that doing a little fighting on the side to help keep myself in food and trinkets when one of the weshapar chieftains got on the wrong side of this god howd he do that gerin asked to the five hells with me if i know van answered a god like that any little thing will do the trick same as a jealous husband will think his wife is sleeping with somebody else if she sets foot outside the front door he sighed maybe he was thinking of fand though he wasnt a jealous husband of the type hed describedand though he gave her plenty of reason for jealousy too gathering himself he went on like i say i dont know what zalmunnathis weshapar chief i was talking aboutdid to get his god angry at him but he did something because the god told him he had to cut the throat of his son to make things rightand to show he really did reverence that foolish god and did this zalmunna spalpeen tell him where to head in adiatunnus asked i would ha done no other thing but that but you and your people hadnt been worshiping this god for who knows how many generations van said zalmunna was in a state ill tell you he was in an even worse state because his son was all ready to let himself be used like a goat or a hog too if the god wanted him he was ready for it ready no he was eager as a bridegroom wedding the loveliest wench in the countryside you would think he would have had better sense dagref said no ladyou would think he had better sense because you have better sense yourself van said what you havent figured out yet is how many people are fools one way or another what you havent figured out is how many people are fools one way and another i wonder why they are dagref said a question aimed not so much at van as at the world around him the world around him did not answer van went on like i say the lad was ready to be offered up like a beast most of the weshapar were ready for him to be offered up too they were used to doing what their god told them he was their god how could they do anything else even zalmunna was thinking he might have to do it he didnt want to you understand but he didnt see that he had much choice we got to talking the night before he was supposed to go into this overgrown valley where that god had his shrine and kill the boy hed got himself drunk the same way you would have if this was happening to you he knew what i thought of his god which was not much so he came to me instead of to any of the rest of the weshapar well since their god was as jealous as he was and as stupid as he was like i say we got to talking when the time came for him to take his son down into the valley i went along his son didnt want me to come he was fussing and fuming like anything sometimes though you cant pay much attention to what these brats say dagref ignored him ferdulf stuck out his tongue at him van grinned miserable little excuse for a shrine this god had toonothing but a few piledup stones and a shabby stone table for the throatcutting business we got there and the gods voice came from out of the stones get on with it he said and he sounded like my old grandfather about two days before he died zalmunna laid his son down on the stone table he took out his knife before he used it though i hit his son in the side of the head with a little leather sack full of sand and pebbles the lad went out like a torch youd stick in a bucket of water id led a sow along too i lifted her up onto the table instead of zalmunnas son and zalmunna cut her throat what happened next gerin asked the god didnt strike you dead he took a long careful look at the outlander at least i dont think he did honh van said what happened was that god said there you see next time youd better pay attention to me he felt zalmunnas son stop thinking you understand and then there was blood all over the place it was just like wed hoped he thought zalmunna really had killed the boy i slung zalmunnas son over my shoulder and carried him back to the weshapar village wed started out from what happened when he woke up gerin asked to the five hells with me if i know van repeated i clouted him a good one he was still quiet as a sack of mud when we got back to the village zalmunna started shouting up a storm about what an idiot their god was and how hed fooled him and how they should all quit worshiping him and on and on and on me i thought that looked like a pretty fair time to find somewhere else to go so away i went and what might that ha been pray adiatunnus asked are you after telling us you were fain to keep clear o the quarrels twixt a god and his folk now that you mention it yes van said the fox will tell you ive done a stupid thing or three in my time but hell also tell you ive never done anything outright daft in all my born days oh i will will i gerin said this i have to let you know is news to me go howl van said anyhow a couple of days after that i felt myself a pretty fair earthquakesay about like the one that turned ikos topsyturvy and let the monsters out though i was right on top of that one and a ways away from the one im talking about now it would have hit hardest in the weshapar country unless i miss my guess you think the god caused it dagref said well zalmunna couldnt very well have done it van replied though he was angry enough to if only he could i cant tell you even now whether the weshapar still follow their nasty little jealous god or whether theyve all gone over to the ones their neighbors follow i would that adiatunnus said if you must be worshiping gods now better to follow the bunch that let you have a good time im thinking dagref had another question if all theseweshapar was it did fall away from the jealous god would he shrivel up and die for lack of worship its a good question van said but id be lying if i claimed i knew the answer to it for i dont but if its not what zalmunna was hoping for id be astonished its not a good question ferdulf growled not even slightly its a wicked question and a wicked idea gods are immortalits one of the things that make them gods how can an immortal die gerin asked a question of his own suppose youre a god and no one worships you for a thousand years or sohow would you like that would you be hungry if you werent dead wouldnt you rather be ferdulf considered that its not something my father need fear he said at last people will always worship a god who gives them wine a god who gives them the pleasures that go with fertility a god who aids them in all manners of creation thats so gerin said understanding from ferdulfs answer why the little demigod had been so upset the fox thought ferdulfs father would live forever too ferdulf had named good reasons he would stay popular among men wistfully gerin wished dagrefs father would live forever too bronze and wood van touched his sword hilt then set his hand on the chariot rail here we have the one thing and the other now we have to go forth and lick the cursed imperials you make it sound so easy gerin said his voice dry it was easy van said twice in a row it was easy why shouldnt it be once more youre forgetting something gerin replied even more dryly than before the two battles we won aragis and i were together and together we matched the number of imperials we were fighting they have more men now and theyve split us in two attacking when youre outnumbered doesnt strike me as the best idea ive ever heard and have you got a better one the outlander asked and gerin didnt the imperials had not pressed the pursuit so hard as they might have while he wasnt eager to attack them they still werent eager to attack him either those two victories he and aragis had won over them made them wary even with the advantage of numbers even so were going to get hungry pretty soon if we dont do anything but stay where we are van said driving home the point its either knock em back and find some new land to forage over or else fall back into the valley of ikosand farseeing biton isnt going to be happy about that i know now gerins voice was somber his guardsmen couldnt have made that much plainer could they he sighed if its fighting the elabonian empire or fighting the farseeing god theres not much choice is there rihwins riders in the van the foxs army moved out the next day those of aragis vassals who had not gone to war along with their king held their keeps shut tight against gerin they were holding their keeps shut against everyone they no doubt wished gerin and the imperials would all go away and leave them at peace or as close to it as they had known while living under aragis rule no matter what they wished they had not the strength to enforce their wishes the foxs forward move seemed to catch the imperials by surprise the riders drove back the scouts the forces of the elabonian empire had posted to keep an eye on them they killed a few too and captured several more maeva beaming from ear to ear brought one of those prisoners back to the foxand not coincidentally to her father and dagref i caught him myself she said pride ringing in her voice the prisoner looked indignant perhaps at being captured by a woman perhaps at being captured at all the latter it proved for he burst out you cursed rebels are a tougher nut to crack than they told us you were going to be when we came over the mountains they said some of you would want to come back under the city of elabon and the rest wouldnt be able to fight people say all sorts of stupid things gerin answered the trick is knowing whether theyre stupid for instance ill know if you lie because ive already asked these questions to other prisoners how many men have you got he got the answers he wanted they largely agreed with the answers hed had from other imperials his men had captured the soldiers of the elabonian empire outnumbered his own men but not overwhelmingly he had some reason to hope he could knock them back on their heels what will you do with me the prisoner asked what will you do with me lord king dagref and maeva spoke together in the tones they would have used to reprove younger siblings whod said something stupid they looked at each other both seeming surprised and pleased what will you do with me lord king for his part the prisoner seemed grateful enough to be corrected with words rather than with something hard slammed against the side of his head take him back that way maeva gerin said pointing over his shoulder dont do anything to him as long as he behaves himself if he doesnt behave himself well the ghosts will have fresh blood to drink tonight to the captured imperial he went on i dont quite know what well end up doing with you we may let you farm on a peasant village but i wont lie to youyou may end up in the mines it depends on where we can get the most and the most useful work out of you lord king if its use youre after i know something of smithcraft the prisoner said if that turns out to be true you wont go to the mines gerin said and if it turns out not to be true you will for having lied the imperial didnt quail from which gerin concluded he was either telling the truth or had some small practice lying take him away maeva i do thank you for getting her out of the brawling for a while van said youre welcome for whatever it may be worth gerin answered his voice mild he understood what was in the outlanders mind dagref on the other hand spoke to van in the same hectoring tones hed used on the prisoner maeva had taken you do understand dont you that she gets to go out of the brawling now because she was in it before oh aye i understand that lad van said manfully resisting the temptation to break dagref over his knee or offer him some other form of great bodily harm now if you want to ask me whether i like the idea or not i may just have a different answer for you aye i may for a wonder the brittle edge in his voice got through to dagref who suddenly made himself very busy steering the chariot gerin caught vans eye and raised an eyebrow van coughed a couple of times they both laughed stop talking about me dagref said without looking back which only made his father and van laugh harder more prisoners came back as the foxs advance drove in the scouts the imperials had set up to keep an eye on him he was mournfully certain his horsemen and chariots were not capturing all those scouts he pushed south and west harder to hit the main imperial army before the foe was ready for him instead of finding the imperial force concentrated to receive his men he found it scattered in detachments he hit them one after another glad of his good fortune they would skirmish with him and then draw off retreating toward the west every time the peasants in the eastern part of aragis kingdom did not seem delighted to have him foraging from the countryside rather than the soldiers of the elabonian empire some of them in fact probably would have preferred to have the imperials remain being strangers in the northlands and unused to some of the ways of the peasants there the men from south of the high kirs missed stores that gerin and his men had no trouble sniffing out theyd dealt with the local peasants all their lives and knew their tricks flatbread made from coarseground flour baked in the hot ashes of a campfire was not the most appetizing meal but it kept a man going van said we may run those buggers right out of here yet if they keep giving us ground by the gods well take it so we will gerin said gnawing on flatbread he kept looking toward the west his expression was glum van noted that you ought to be glad weve broken out of that cramped little stretch of ground where theyd pinned us back if you are youve not told your face of it i am glad we would have got hungry after a bit but im not delighted you see what theyre doing dont you running van said with a sniff running aye the fox said but running with a purpose van let out an interrogative grunt gerin explained theyre keeping themselves between aragis and us they dont want us joining up with him until their other force has hit him hard unless i miss my guess ah van took a bite of flatbread too he chewed on the bread and the idea at the same time by the look on his face he didnt much care for the taste of either he tried to make the best of things well theyll be the ones with the harder foraging now but the fox shook his head i have my doubts about that if they can bring two armies up over the high kirs theyll have a supply train with em too to keep them fed he listened to his own words a smile slowly stole over his face and theyve gone and let us out vans smile spread till it matched gerins wagons and wagons full of good things to eatthats what youre saying isnt it fox good things to eat gerin agreed probably more wine to help rihwin get drunk probably arrows and such too all sorts of things we could use all sorts of things wed be happier if the imperials didnt have and theyre falling back toward the west to keep us away from aragis the archer dont they realize youd think of the supply train do you know i dont believe they do gerin said to them after all im just a backwoods halfbarbarian he winked but ill tell you something im going to show them theyre wrong this will be grand fun van boomed as the chariot jounced along the stretch of the elabon way gerins counterattack had opened up grand fun for us i should saythe imperials wont like getting a door slammed on their prongs even a little bit wouldnt much care for that myself gerin had all he could do not to clutch at himself at the very idea but aye if it goes as we hope itll do us some good and make life harder for our chums from south of the mountains hed taken as many of rihwins riders as he could while still leaving enough to scout for the main mass of warriors hed left behind hed also taken the chariots with the fastest horses and those with the fiercest crews including a good many of adiatunnus trokmoi set the prospect of booty in front of the woodsrunners and theyd go after it the way a pack of hounds would run baying down the scent track of a stag he glanced east somewhere not far over there beyond forests and low hills lay the village where elise had her tavern gerin wondered what had happened when the imperials went through there after him a rider came galloping north up the elabon way toward his force wagons the fellow was shouting wagons when he was sure the fox had heard him he pointed in the direction from which he had come lets go gerin said and waved his men forward they whooped with glee the troopers in chariots urged their teams ahead the riders booted their mounts up from slow trot to quick sure enough as soon as the paved highway rose a little the fox saw the ox and donkeydrawn wagons coming toward him the riders were already whooping and reaching over their shoulders for arrows the drivers saw gerins oncoming men at about the same time as he spotted them they had a few chariots along to protect them against bandits but not nearly enough to hold back a force like the one gerin had assembled the charioteers did what they could they rolled up the highway in a spoiling attack to try to give the wagon crews time to form a defensive circle gerin was having none of that roll past them he shouted dont let them slow us down once we get in among the wagons well be able to throw the chariots into the bag too arrows flew as the imperials tried to delay his troopers a couple of men on either side tumbled out of their cars but then despite shouts of scorn and dismay from the warriors from south of the high kirs the fox and his followers were by speeding on toward the wagons a fierce grin stretched his mouth wide the circle remained incomplete his men knew they had to make sure it stayed incomplete too they broke in among the wagons some of the men from the chariots dismounted and set upon the wagon drivers the drivers fought back as best they could but they were not armored and many of them carried nothing more lethal than knives pointing to the havoc the dismounted chariot crews were wreaking van said wouldnt be so easy for riders to do that youre rightit wouldnt gerin agreed but men on horses can do things men in chariots cant too more things unless i miss my guess he raised his voice there go a couple dagref see if you can run them down before they make it into the trees aye father dagref steered the chariot after the closer of the two fleeing drivers as it pulled alongside the fellow van swung his mace its wicked spiked bronze head slammed home with a meaty thunk the driver shrieked and crumpled i would have let him yield gerin said mildly he wasnt yielding the outlander answered he was running as if the other driver had heard him he stopped running and threw up his hands gerin waved for him to head back toward the elabon way he obeyed but as soon as dagref turned the chariot aside he whirled and sprinted for the trees and got in among them before the chariot crew could do anything about it gerin shot an arrow at him but missed there you see van said try and be generous and look at the thanks you get hes not as smart as he thinks he is gerin said as the chariot bounced back to the highway if he comes out either well scoop him up or aragis peasants will put paid to him hell have a thin time either way thats not the point van said the point is we should have put paid to him and we cursed well didnt since he was right gerin didnt try to argue with him instead he said lets see if we can keep their chariot escort from getting away and letting the rest of the imperials know weve made their wagons disappear his shouts pulled other chariots from the northlands away from the wagons and into the pursuit he and his men caught up with what he thought was the last imperial chariot a mile or so up the elabon way seeing they would be overhauled the driver and the two warriors with him jumped out and ran for the woods as the wagon drivers had done unlike the wagon drivers they didnt get there now lets get these wagons back to our camp the fox said we havent got time to waste the faster we move em up along the road the less the chance the empire will have of getting them back some of the wagon drivers had surrendered gerin was glad of that because his own men while skilled with horses had less practice with donkeys and oxen the animals obeyed better when they saw what their fellow beasts were doing under drivers who knew how to make them work rihwin rode up alongside gerin i wonder what all weve captured for a wonder he didnt say i wonder how much wine weve captured same sort of things wed have along for our own troopers i expect gerin answered journeybread and sausage and onions and cheeseanything that keeps well dried fruit too maybe theres a name for dried grapes he snapped his fingers raisins thats what they call them raisins rihwin agreed its been a very long time since ive had raisins he still didnt say anything about wine which gerin had made a point of not mentioning gerin eyed him suspiciously as if wondering whether he was coming down with some peculiar ailment maturity gerin wondered trying again to find a name he shook his head if rihwin hadnt caught that yet he probably never would van said have to see what theyve got in these wagons besides food too sheaves of arrows like you said thosell come in handy for us maybe swords maybe metal fittings for chariots too thosed be nice lets move faster gerin said again captain trying to hurry a donkey bothers you more than it does the donkey van said the only way i know to hurry oxen is to fling em off a cliff whats that the trokmoi say dont fash yourselfthere you are were making the best time we can its not good enough gerin fretted he knew his friend was right he couldnt help worrying and barking and snapping anyhow eventually more of his own riders came down to screen the wagons from any possible imperial revenge only then did he relax his troopers cheered when the wagons came into camp when they started going through them they found about what theyd expected including one wagon full of wineskins gerin stalked around that wagon glum as a man with a toothache what in the five hells do we do with it he asked the air dagref was close enough to hear him my view is we ought to drink it if mavrix didnt come up to the northlands in a cloud of purple smoke when rihwin drank why should he care about widin simrins son drinking or adiatunnus either for that matter i dont know why he might care about widin or adiatunnus the fox answered i havent the faintest idea if he does care though is the risk in drinking worth the chance were taking no way to tell ahead of time of course dagref admitted but then mavrix would surely be insulted if we spill the wine and might be insulted if we dont drink it risks everywhere you so relieve my mind gerin said at which dagref bowed as if to a compliment ferdulf came swaggering up to the wagon walking with his feet far enough off the ground to let him look gerin the the eye youve found more of my fathers spoiled grape juice have you he demanded if thats what you want to call it yes gerin answered cautiously why because i still aim to pay him back thats why ferdulf said and now i know how to do it too wait gerin said and grabbed at the demigod he missedferdulf must have known he was going to try it with a mocking laugh ferdulf floated up into the air gerin leaped after him which proved how alarmed he was he didnt leap high enough or fast enough from above his head ferdulf mocked him you cant stop me this time nobody can stop me this time he pointed a forefinger at the wine and muttered under his breath gerin couldnt hear all of it but part of it was take that father and i hope you choke on it stop it gerin said urgently but ferdulf had no intention of stopping it not for him not for anybody he was going to do what he was going to do and if the fox didnt like it too bad for the fox what if mavrix didnt like it that obviously was what ferdulf hoped would happen he wanted the sithonian god of wine to come up to the northlands maybe he even wanted mavrix to punish him getting a rise out of his father might have looked better to him than the indifference mavrix had shown at their first meeting he drifted down to the ground a brat doing an imitation of a snowflake go ahead he told gerin drink all the wine you like i hope you and your troopers enjoy it what have you done the fox demanded ferdulf gave him a nasty smile youll find out and off he went before gerin could make up his mind to try to shake some truth out of him what do you think hes done dagref asked something horrible gerin snapped what does he ever do i ought to make rihwin open a skin and find out whats gone wrong hes wild for wine so he should be the one to see how wild the wines got doesnt that sound like justice to you dagref his son didnt answer with a question like that a long answer meant no no answer at all meant no too with a sigh gerin went and got a tarredleather drinking jack he took a wineskin out of the wagon undid the tie at the neck and poured the jack full he hadnt raised it to his lips when rihwin called oh no you dont my fellow fox i was all but supernaturally patient not even speaking of the blood of the sweet grape but if youre going to go ahead and quaff justice dagref said and sighed here gerin pressed the jack into rihwins outstretched hand since you want it so much its only fitting that you should have it go right ahead my fellow fox quaff rihwin should have been suspicious when gerin yielded so easily but he wasnt i not only want it he declared i deserve it he took a big mouthfuland then sprayed out as much of it as he could coughing and choking on what had gone down his throat feh he said vinegar well thats something of a relief gerin said i was afraid it would be donkey piss thank you so much rihwin snarled and you went ahead and let me drink it no gerin said i did not let you drink it you insisted on doing it i deserve it you said in my opinion you were correct you did deserve it if you hadnt been so greedy you would have let me taste or you would have let me tell you ferdulf had done something to the wine but noyou went ahead and took what you wanted and enjoyed it less than you might have done id say both as your friend and as your king that you have no complaint coming rihwin wiped his mouth on his sleeve which couldnt have done much good and id say both as your friendfor some indecipherable reason or otherand as your subject that you havent the faintest notion of what youre talking about he wiped his mouth again maybe you should go drink some ale dagref suggested that would get rid of some of the taste aye maybe i should go and rihwin gave gerins son a horrible look you take altogether too much after your father he strode away his back as stiff as an offended cats thank you dagref called after him which only made his back grow stifferit wasnt what hed wanted to hear dagref turned to gerin hell be a while getting over that so he will gerin agreed so he ought to be he scowled at the wagon then let out a long sigh we can pickle all the cabbages and cucumbers we like but were not going to be drinking wine thats so dagref agreed i wonder why mavrix hasnt descended on us in a cloud of fury hes not usually one to ignore insults is he no hes usually one to pay them back gerin answered thats why my heart fell into my sandals when ferdulf decided to take his petty revenge well why isnt mavrix here then dagref demanded as if his father were somehow responsible for the absence of the sithonian god of wine and fertility if i knew i would tell you gerin answered maybe hes finally decided he doesnt care what happens here in the northlands any more that would be nice wouldnt it or maybe hes raising a rebellion down in sithonia and doesnt have time to fret about this part of the world for a while but didnt you say he told you he didnt think the sithonians could successfully rise against the elabonian empire gerin asked yes i did say he told me he didnt think they could gerin answered and stuck out his tongue at his son doesnt mean he wouldnt try to raise one anyhow the sithonians have revolted against the empire a good many times over the years even if theyve always lost if the sithonians are revolting dagref said both thoughtfully and with malice aforethought that could be very convenient for us were guessing you know gerin said dagref nodded gerin went on were guessing with our hearts not our heads he sighed it would be nice but we dont dare believe it its like believing a pretty girl youve never seen will come looking for you it happens every once in a while maybe but not often enough that you can expect it for even a heartbeat i understand dagref said what happens anywhere else doesnt matter anyhow not unless we beat the imperials here thats also true gerin said in fact thats the truth about this war and we were on the point of doing it too till they threw another army into the fight nasty and rude of them if anyone wants to know what i think they want to win too worse luck very inconsiderate cant trust anyone any more can you dagref asked who said i ever did the fox returned the next morning ferdulf was loud and triumphant and obnoxious in other words not far removed from his usual self i gave my father a proper black eye he boasted and he hasnt had the nerve to come do anything to me i guess he sees whos boss in the northlands now youve done better guessing gerin told him ferdulf stuck his nose in the air following that nose the rest of him floated off the ground i do not have to stay here to listen to myself being insulted he said haughtily and drifted away like an indignant dandelion puff he hasnt the faintest notion how big a fool he is van said fools never do gerin answered thats what makes them fools strange thinking of a halfgod as a fool the outlander said but ferdulf gives us plenty of chances to do it so he does gerin said he could easily think of a few gods hed met whom he considered fools but he didnt mention that whether gods were fools or not they were vastly stronger than mortals a man insulted a god even a god as cowardly as mavrix at his peril a demigod insulted a god even a god who was his father at his peril ferdulf hadnt figured that outanother proof ferdulf was a fool what now van asked i dont know what we can do but keep on with what weve been doing gerin answered if we can keep riders moving along the elabon way the imperials are going to have a harder time supplying their armies up here and if we can keep pushing back the outposts of that force that was dogging us maybe well be able to join hands with aragis aye maybe we will van said and maybe once we do we ought to count the fingers on the hand we join with his too gerin once more would have argued with his friend more had he agreed with him less the men from the northlands did drive in a couple of more imperial positions which gave them new land from which to forage the men from the elabonian empire hadnt been on the land long enough to pick it bare nor were they as good at the job as gerin and his followers combining what they took from the land with what they captured from the imperial supply column the warriors from the northlands were for the moment comfortable he ate sausages and gnawed on chunks of journeybread and tried to decide what to do next probably about the same thing as his imperial opposite number was doing he could do one thing his opposite number couldnt he could send riders west to slide around the imperial forces between him and aragis men on horseback could go at least as fast as men in chariots and could go crosscountry on tracks and through fields and woods chariotry couldnt use maeva was not one of the riders he sent toward aragis as she had before when she wasnt chosen for a duty she complained he did his best to look down his nose at her it wasnt easy not when they were very much of a height youre right he said i didnt pick you so what its not fair she insisted i deserve to go into danger the same as any other rider you deserve to have your backside walloped the fox said now truly starting to get annoyed and its not fair is the battle cry children use im tired of it from you if you want to be a warrior act like one when youre not in the middle of a fight not just when you are youre holding me back because im a woman maeva said no im holding you back because youre a girl gerin said she stared at him astonished and furious at the same time he went on this is your first campaign remember take a look at the riders i sent west what do you notice about them pray tell theyre all men maeva said angrily thats right gerin agreed theyre all men there isnt a boy among them theyve all been riding horses as long as youve been alive a couple of them have been riding horses as long as anyone in the northlands has been doing it theyve all done a lot of fighting and a lot of fighting from horseback if youre still in the army ten or twelve years from now if im still alive ten or twelve years from now youll have a real chance of getting sent on a ride like this he wondered how maeva would take that kind of dressingdown fand would have flown into a fury at him van would have been angry too but not with the same sort of deadly rage but gerin had a great many years on maeva which made her take him more seriously than either of her parents would have done very well lord king was all she said before going off disappointed but not obviously irate watching her go the fox nodded in reluctant approval he almost wished she had thrown a tantrum that would have given him the excuse he needed to send her home but she offered him no such excuse however much having one would have pleased him and delighted van all things considered shed taken the tonguelashing like a soldier no sooner had that comparison crossed his mind than he wished it hadnt too late hed started thinking of maeva as a soldier even before he saw how well she handled herself when she was wounded he couldnt very well change his mind now not all the riders he sent out came back before any of them came back he had to try to withstand an assault from the imperials who had begun to concentrate against him once he started rolling up their outposts their commander was about as unsubtle as aragis the archer he simply gathered his force and rolled toward where he thought gerin had the bulk of his army he turned out to have a pretty good notion of that too mounted scouts brought the fox the word they cant be a quarter of an hour behind us lord king coming down that road there one of the riders said pointing west along the dirt road up which hed come well all right gerins grimace held annoyance but no real surprise hed poked the men from south of the high kirs they were going to hit back if they couldand they could he surveyed the ground through which the road ran it was mostly open countrygrain fields and and meadowswith a forest of oaks and elms off to the left well stay right here he said its as good a spot as any and better than most i think youre doing the right thing father dagref said weve shown that man for man were more than a match for the imperials so we have gerin agreed unfortunately theyve shown theyve got more men than we do he started shouting orders shaking his men out from line of march into line of battle he barely had time to post a couple of dozen chariot crews in among the trees with orders to burst forth against the enemys flank and rear when the time seemed ripe before a rising dust cloud and horn calls through it announced the imperials were at hand elabon elabon elabon the men of the empire shouted as if to leave no doubt who they were gerins men were not in any doubt his riders plied the leading chariots from the elabonian empire with arrows and javelins the horsemen in front of them kept the imperials from charging as ferociously as their commander probably would have liked the men from south of the high kirs were still learning how to face mounted foes one thing theyd learned was that when there were enough of them their foes had to give way archers shooting from tightly bunched chariots put enough arrows in the air to discourage anyoneon foot on horseback or in other chariotsfrom doing much to hinder their passage seeing their numberssure enough they were going to have more men in the fight than he didgerin waved and yelled to extend his line to either side and lap round them if he could hit them from three sides at once those numbers wouldnt do them much good his troopers could slay men in the middle of that rumbling herd of chariots without their having the chance to do him any harm theres a lot of them captain van said id noticed that myself gerin answered we scraped together all the men we could aragis and i the empire of elabon is bigger than the northlands and has more people too theyve sent a bigger force over the mountains than we can hope to equal most places thats a recipe for a lost war for the side that doesnt have the big army the outlander said thank you so much the fox snapped i never would have realized that if you hadnt pointed it out to me glad to help captain van said imperturbably he did not stay imperturbable after an arrow ticked off the side of his helm scratching a brighter line on the brightly polished bronze he cursed and bellowed and brandished his spear at the imperials though he couldnt have had the slightest idea which of them had shot at him gerin started shooting at the soldiers and horses of the elabonian empire in front of him one way to reduce the odds his men faced was to kill or disable as many of the imperials as he could one of his shafts struck the righthand horse of a team square in the breast the horse went down the chariot slewed leftwards colliding with the car and team next to it they slewed away in turn because the main body of the imperial was so tightly packed they ran into the team on their left too one arrow fouling three chariots half a dozen horses and nine men well shot van said seeing what the fox had done thank you the fox sounded modest letting the shot speak for itself come on men he shouted lay into them lay into them the men from the northlands did the imperials charge slowed as collisions and casualties took their toll of the cars in the front ranks the fight became a melee the sort of struggle in which gerins troopers had consistently proved to own the advantage gerin shot an arrow at an imperial officer with a red cloak draped around his shoulders the fellow was inconsiderate enough to lean to one side at the moment the shaft hissed past him gerin cursed how in the five hells am i supposed to get rid of the imperials if they keep trying not to get killed he demanded of no one in particular dagref as usual had an answer pretty rude of them isnt it father they arent behaving the way the enemywhoever the enemy isusually does when the minstrels sing their songs to the five hells with the minstrels too gerin growled he had a couple of reasons for despising minstrels first and foremost was that one who had practiced that calling had kidnapped his eldest son fifteen years before but the way they distorted the truth to fit into what made a good song grated on him too he wondered how the historians who recorded events down in the city of elabon would mention this clash to them of course he and his followers would be that highly variable creature the enemyrebels theyd call the warriors of the northlands and semibarbarians allied to true barbarians he knew their style being the enemy he probably wouldnt get any credit from the historians no matter what he did if he lost that he was the enemy would be enough to explain a great deal if he won theyd chalk it up to guile or trickery not courage as long as he won he didnt care how they chalked it up he wondered what sort of guile or trickery he could use to rouse the future historians ire looking around the crowded field he didnt see much opportunity for anything of the sort his men did have some advantage of position but the imperials had the advantage of numbers they seemed at least as liable to win as did the men of the northlands he sighed he hadnt wanted this particular battle not here not now he sighed again life had given him any number of things he didnt want the trick was to get through them as well and as quickly as he could to have the best chance to return to what he did in fact want he shot at that imperial officer againand missed again at a range from which he should not have missed he cursed in disgust the fellow seemed to lead a charmed life though gerin knew of no magic that would keep an arrow from piercing a man if properly aimed arrows would not pierce ferdulf but ferdulfs immunity was not the sort to which an ordinary man could readily aspire ferdulf swooped down on the officer from the elabonian empire for all the world like a illmannered hawk he shouted in the officers ears he waved hands in front of the officers face he flipped up his tunic in front of the drivers face giving the fellow a charming view of a semidivine backside with such distractions the officer couldnt do much in the way of commanding and the driver couldnt do much in the way of driving both men and the soldier in the car with them did their best to grab shoot or otherwise get rid of ferdulf they paid so much attention to him they didnt notice their chariot was about to collide with another till it did the officer and the soldier fell out the back of the car the driver got yanked over the front rail and under the horses hooves ferdulf flitted off to work more mischief elsewhere on the field gerin looked toward the forest in which hed placed those couple of dozen chariots he wished he had them in the fight either bursting from ambush or simply in the line with the rest of his men the imperials werent doing anything fancy but he didnt have enough men to drive them back that was becoming more and more obvious as the fight wore along all the imperials had to do was stolidly keep on fighting and odds were hed lose unless he came up with something spectacular for the life of him he had no idea what that might be he looked toward the oaks again he didnt want to send a messenger over there that was liable to draw the imperials attention to the wood which was the last thing he wanted a moment later he changed his mind about that truly the last thing he wanted was to be hacked to bloody pulp in the chariot a car full of imperials pulled alongside of his one of them cut at him with a sword the blade turned slightly so that the flat thudded against his ribs he hissed in pain anyhow and snatched out his own sword he and the imperial traded strokes till their chariots pulled apart from each other he thought he would have beaten the fellow had they fought longer being lefthanded he hadnt had to bring the sword across his body as they battled but what might have been didnt matter the truth was the trooper remained alive and hale to fight someone else gerin wondered how hale he was himself breathing hurt but didnt stab so he doubted hed broken ribs he could go on fighting he laughed which also hurt even if he had broken ribs he had to go on fighting dagref snapped his whip at one of the horses harnessed to another imperial chariot drawing near the horse screamed and reared and flinched aside despite the drivers best effort to force an attack you are getting good with that thing van said in admiring tones and then half spoiled the compliment by adding you must have got the practice flaying the hide off folk with your tongue i havent the faintest notion what youre talking about dagref replied with more dignity than a stripling had any business owning i know lad van said thats the trouble dagrefs dignity this time consisted of pretending he hadnt heard he didnt bring that off quite so well as he had the dispassionate answer more seriously gerin said maybe you ought to start practicing with a longer lash than most drivers carry son youre better with it than most that seems plain so you ought to get as much advantage from it as you can now thats not a bad idea father dagref said ive had the same thought myself as a matter of fact had he gerin studied his back which was remarkably uncommunicative maybe he had one thing dagref was never short on was ideas he seldom lied either unless he found an immediately expedient reason for doing so the fox couldnt see one here he also couldnt see anything that looked like victorycertainly not for his side the soldiers of the elabonian empire kept on fighting no matter what he did to them every once in a while in fist fights gerin had seen a man whom no blow would put down sooner or later even if that kind of fellow wasnt a particularly good fighter he would win by wearing down his foe that he thought worriedly was what he faced here he was hurting the imperials worse than they were hurting himhe could see that much the trouble was they could afford it better than he could their captain had brought more men to the battle than hed thought at first and hed known from the beginning he was outnumbered he looked over toward the trees again he waved on the off chance that anyone over there was looking in his direction and could recognize him at a considerable distance through the dust the chariots and horses had kicked up a sudden thrust at the flank and rear of the imperials would be extremely welcome about now the longer the men hed concealed in the forest delayed the greater the effect of that thrust would be he knew as much if they delayed much longer though the battle would be lost van looked in the same direction maybe theyre waiting for an invitation like shy maids hanging back from the dance there wont be any dance left if they dont come soon gerin said then he shouted out from among the oaks burst the chariots hed stationed there on toward the imperials they thundered picking up speed with every lengthening stride of their horses the crews in the cars shouted like men possessed arrows flew ahead of the chariots the imperials shouted too in dismay their whole line shook as gerins men took them from an unexpected direction come on the fox shouted to all his warriors whom the men of the elabonian empire had been pressing back now is our chance to beat those bastards as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished hed phrased that differently it was all too accurate for comfort hed hoped the flank attack would win him the battle instead it was doing exactly what hed saidit was giving him a chance to win that it was doing no more than giving him a chance told him with unpleasant clarity how much trouble hed been in forward he shouted forward his line went instead of moving back forwardfor a little while then the imperial resistance stiffened had he had a hundred chariots in the wood he might have thrown the men of the elabonian empire into confusion enough to let him crush them but had he had a hundred chariots in the wood he was likelier to have weakened the rest of his force so much the battle would have been lost before they could think about a flank attack dagref drove the chariot past a car full of imperials van speared the horse closest to him spouting blood the beast screamed and foundered dagrefs slash made the driver scream too and clutch at his neck gerin shot one of the archers in the car the other dove out before anything dreadful could happen to him thats as near a clean sweep as makes no difference van said as the archer ran for his life youll talk differently if he shoots you from ambush gerin said if he shoots uncle van from ambush he probably wont talk at all dagref said over his shoulder to the five hells with logic and with both of you too van said he looked around now we get down to it are we going to lick these whoresons or are they going to lick us gerin looked around too what had been an advance was stalled the imperials had managed to contain the band that had attacked them from the forest without much fuss without much style but with plenty of men they pressed ahead with the fight hed mauled them he had indeed hurt them worse than theyd hurt him much worse they kept coming anyhow he didnt know what he was supposed to do about that it wasnt how warfare usually worked up here in the northlands finding foes stubborn enough to keep fighting no matter how badly battered they were wasnt easy anywhere a lifetime of experience and as much reading as hed been able to do convinced him of the truth there he had just reached that unhappy conclusion when dagref said i dont think we can force them back father i dont either gerin said they have too many menthats all there is to it anything even close to equal numbers and wed beat them weve proved that but we havent got equal numbers and we cant get them well what do you aim to do then fox van asked ive got two unpleasant choices gerin answered i can give up this battle admit weve lost retreat and yield the field to the imperials or i can keep on fighting do the best i can and watch them chew my army to pieces one bite at a time youre rightthose are both nasty choices van said if you see any others please let me know gerin said van grunted while he thought then shook his head gerin sighed too bad i was hoping you would dagref said what will you do father what would you do gerin returned the battle was lost one way or the other but he might at least get a lesson out of it it wasnt so dreadfully lost that a moment spent here would matter one way or the other id hold the army together dagref answered at once maybe theyll divide their force or send out detachments we can pick off the way they did before or leave themselves open to ambush if we still have an army we can take advantage of that if we let them grind us here like flour were finished youre my son all right for better and for worse we think alike im going to see if the imperials will the satisfied with a win and let us go gerin raised his voice in a reluctant shout pull back men of the northlands pull back the imperials made no more than a token pursuitcertainly less than he would have made were roles reversed he thought the commander facing him was the one whod led the first imperial force into the northlands the other one with the larger part of crebbig is army had more drive and more imaginationand was facing aragis who while surely a driver imagined very little gerin had scant time to worry about aragis he had scant time to worry about anything except making certain he put enough distance between his army and that of the elabonian empire to let his men camp safely that with some effort he managed adiatunnus came up to him after the army halted and what do we do now the trokm chieftain asked to the crows with me if i know gerin answered x what the army did over the next several days was retreat gerin fought a number of sharp skirmishes with the imperials he never had any trouble pushing back their advance parties whenever the main force came up to support the scouts though he had to fall back himself before long he found himself with no choice but to abandon the swath of aragis country in which his army had been foraging he cursed at having to do it but it was either that or move south and let the imperials get between him and his own homeland he resolved not to do that no matter what if the elabonian empire wanted him out of his own holdings the imperials would have to come and dig him out one keep at a time just as aragis would have had to do if hed beaten him in the field good thing we stole their supply train van said as he gnawed sausage of an evening anything that keeps us going is good gerin said well have a hard time doing it again worse lucktheyve pushed us a long ways back from the elabon way now see any chance of turning loose a decent counterattack the outlander asked taking another bite i wish i did gerin said this fellow isnt leaving himself open though he doesnt fight like a trokm or one of our crackbrained barons up here i wish he would just charge straight ahead without looking where hes going it would make life a lot simpler but he doesnt want to do that slow but sure thats him doesnt seem stupid anyhow van said he looked back over his shoulder toward the northeast if he keeps coming hes liable to push us back into the valley of ikos whether we want to go there or not that thought had also crossed my mind gerin said unhappily if we have to go back through there well go back through there thats all biton is the farseeing god if he cant see far enough to figure out that were doing what we have to do not what we want to do hes not as smart as i think nor as smart as he thinks he is either van grunted gods arent gods because theyre smart fox theyre gods because theyre strong i wish i could say you were wrong gerin replied the trouble is i know too well youre right he looked around where was dagref last time hed noticed his son the lad had been eating sausage and journeybread not far away he didnt see dagref now hed waited for some pungent comment from him about gods and whether they were strong or smart and now almost disappointed realized hed have to do without a moment later he stopped worrying about dagref for rihwin the fox strode importantly up to him and said lord king im sure i know how all our troubles may be solved rihwin was enough to worry about any time rihwin sure was sure to make gerin worry im glad youre sure he said his voice as polite as he could make it that doesnt necessarily mean youre right of course some people have trouble understanding the difference rihwin looked wounded an admirable artistic effort lord king you have no call to make fun of me why doesnt he van asked in tones of genuine curiosity you leave yourself open to it often enough and to the five hells with you rihwin replied with dignity gerin held up a hand never mind enough wrangling how my fellow fox may all our troubles be solved rihwin raised an eyebrow he knew irony when he heard it for that if not for a number of other things gerin gave him credit but he answered as if gerin had meant his sardonic question soberly we need divine aid against the men from south of the high kirs youre a man from south of the high kirs van pointed out wait gerin forestalled the outlander he fixed rihwin with a baleful stare why do i think i already know the god whose aid you are going to tell me we must seek because he is one of the gods whom you know best perhaps rihwin said because he has come to your aid and to the aid of the northlands before because he is a god who has no reason to love the elabonian empire and a great many reasons to loathe it those must be the reasons you have in mindis it not so lord king mm possibly gerin allowed that mavrix is also lord of the sweet grape and what comes from the sweet grape also enters my mind for some reason or other why do you suppose that might be i havent the faintest notion rihwin replied van guffawed if you were as innocent as you sound youd still be a virgin at your age and that at least youre not rihwin ignored him which wasnt easy lord king he said addressing himself directly to gerin do you deny can you deny mavrix is our best hope among the gods of course i deny it gerin answered so would you if you had any sense though all the gods know thats too much to ask for biton is a god of this country mavrix is even more an imported interloper than we elabonians are biton is also aloof rihwin said the only way you got him to move against the monsters was with selatres help and with the added irritation of an appeal to mavrix he looked triumphant gerin let out a long exasperated breath rihwin if you want another cup of wine take another cup of wine if you think the risk is worth it go ahead if you get away with it well and good if mavrix tears your head off my view is that you bloody well asked for it but dont go wrapping your own desires in a scheme you claim will benefit all of us i should like to drink wine again aye rihwin said but i am no longer mad for it as i was before i slaked my thirst and my desire not long ago and when i slaked my thirst not long ago let me remind you mavrix made no appearance of any sort your jittery predictions to the contrary notwithstanding i propose enlisting him in our cause regardless of whether or not in the accomplishment thereof i once more taste the blood of the sweet grape wella disinterested rihwin now ive seen everything gerin said rihwin lookedno not indignant rihwin looked angry gerin for once did not think the expression was donned for the occasion to be casually discarded at need he thought hed struck a nerve all rihwin said though was are you sure you are disinterested in this matter lord king or are you prejudiced against me because of events now past honh van said who wouldnt be some of the things youve done would make the hair stand up on a bald man but rihwins question brought gerin up short he prided himself on viewing the world around him as disinterestedly as he could anyone who could be anything close to disinterested about rihwin though needed divine detachment not that afforded to mere mortal men slowly gerin said youre like the boy who says that just because hes pushed his sister into the mud half a dozen times theres no reason to think hell do it again not so rihwin said unlike that boy whom some of my bastards assuredly resemble i have learned my lesson i urge you to summon mavrix regardless of whether i play any role whatever in the summoning and also regardless of whether i get to drink wine then or afterwards after a bow to gerin he strode off bugger me with a pine cone van said now ive seen everything too if i thought you were wrong i would argue with you gerin answered he scratched his head much to my own surprise im willing to believe my fellow fox means what he says that brings me to the next question on the list is what he says a good notion or a foolish one having the help of a god is is better than not having the help of a god van said thats a general working rule of course mavrix is the sort of god who has a way of showing you that general working rules arent all theyre cracked up to be isnt he thats putting it mildly the fox said and theres this foolish feud ferdulf has chosen to pick with him too if mavrix does come here its more likely to be to warm ferdulfs backside than to give us a hand against the empire but if he did come to help us van said aye gerin said if he did he looked around again for dagref when he realized why he was doing that he blinked in surprise he admired the wits of few men enough to ask them for their views without his quite noticing it his son had become one of that small select group dagref did come back to the fire mavrix he said when gerin asked him about trying to summon the sithonian god mavrix hmm it was almost as if he had never heard of the god of wine and fertility gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth in annoyance yes mavrix you rememberfawnskins thyrsus tongue like a frogs oh yes of course i remember dagref said but even that sounded absentminded nothing like the sharp comeback he would usually have given he yawned rubbed his eyes and yawned again oh by the gods gerin snapped did you go and jump into an alepot is that why youre acting as if you havent got two sticks of sense to rub together im not drunk dagref said gerin eyed him with some reluctance he decided his son was telling the truth after one more yawn dagref went on i am tired am i allowed to be tired you werent acting that tired before you went off to wherever you went off to the fox grumbled since you werent you can give me an answer to my question before you lie down on your blanket should i seek mavrixs aid or not i dont see why you shouldnt seek it dagref answered you might be better off if you dont get it though thats what the oracle biton gave would seem to mean wouldnt it he hesitated if of course biton was talking about mavrix and not some other god altogether gerin grunted then said all right go to sleep youve earned it youve given me something new to think about i admit dagref unfolded his blanket wrapped himself in it and was snoring very shortly thereafter gerin eyed him and scratched his head his son didnt reek of ale and had spoken and thought clearly enough when he decided to put his mind to it but that mind had been somewhere else somewhere far away the fox let out a puzzled grunt that wasnt like dagref but his son once he chose to pay attentionsome attentionto what he was saying had indeed given him something new to think about the idea of summoning a god in the hope that he would ignore the summons hadnt occurred to the fox he doubted it would have occurred to him either dagref had a sideways way of looking at the world that could come in handy sometimes no doubt about it ah but the next question is what happens if we summon dear mavrix and he does decide to lend a hand gerin murmured that could prove embarrassing biton had plainly saidas plainly as the god ever said anything anyhowhe would be better off if he got no divine help when he asked for it what would he do if mavrix pitched in against the forces of the elabonian empire after some thought gerin smiled if mavrix did decide to aid him he could summon some other god so that his failure there would bring him into conformity with the oracle he glanced over to dagref that had an underhanded quality to it his sleeping son would appreciate then he glanced over at dagref again in sudden sharp suspicion if a young man disappeared for a while and then came back tired and with his mind far away from whatever his father was talking about one obvious explanation sprang to mind that it was obvious didnt make it true gerin looked this way and that to see if he could spy maeva he couldnt which proved nothing one way or the other the only ways to prove anything would be to catch the two of them in the act if there was any act in which to catch them or to have her belly start to swelland even that wouldnt prove who the father was van lay snoring a few feet from dagref for dagrefs sake gerin hoped vans mind didnt work the way his own did next evening rihwins eyes got big and round do you mean what you say lord king he breathed of course not gerin snapped im lying to build your hopes up he snorted in exasperation yes i mean what i say curse it ive thought things through and ive decided you had a good idea there after all we shall try to summon the lord of the sweet grape to our aid he wished hed looked up before he spoke ferdulf drifting overhead had been close enough to hear the demigod dove down to screech in his face you want my father here again i forbid it you cant forbid it gerin said you can make my life difficultthe gods know you do make my life difficultbut you cant stop me ferdulf i am going to do this what you do afterwards is your affair and mavrixs hell be sorry if he comes here ferdulf said darkly youll be sorry if he comes here and you try annoying him gerin answered hes stronger than you are and youd do well to remember it ferdulf stuck out his tongue im not afraid of him bring him on hell regret it he will gerin shrugged and forbore to argue any more people had an amazing ability to put unpleasant truths out of their minds the fox saw that also applied to demigods for that matter it probably applied to gods too shall we now summon the lord of the sweet grape to the northlands without any further delay rihwin said with a sidelong glance at ferdulf ferdulf sneered ill delay you all right ill turn all the wine you have left into vinegar the same as i did with that wagonload you captured from the imperials no you wont gerin said much as he might have told blestar he wouldnt jump off the palisade walkway back at fox keep and whats to stop me ferdulf said sticking out his tongue again if you turn that wine to vinegar gerin said deliberately i will use the vinegar to call your father it being the best i have for the purpose and i will tell him why i could use nothing better then we can all find out what he chooses to do about that ferdulfs glare came close to scorching him where he stood how could a mere mortal prove so hateful he demanded practice gerin answered come on lets get on with this he had rihwin do the actual honors drinking a cup of wine and imploring mavrix to appear his fellow fox was the one who most wanted the sithonian god to come forth gerin himself would have been just as gladgladderto have mavrix stay down in sithonia the only reason ferdulf wanted to see his father was to harass him we summon thee lord of the sweet grape rihwin called sipping the wine he and his riders had captured from the warriors from south of the high kirs he didnt shudder with ecstasy as he had before hed drunk his first cup of wine in so many years he simply drank without making a fuss about it gerin took that for a good sign well where is he ferdulf said nastily when mavrix did not forthwith appear is he asleep is he drunk is he off buggering a pretty boy or perhaps a pretty lamb you would do well i think to watch your tongue gerin said ferdulf stuck it out farther than any man could have and for good measure waggled the end of it there he said indistinctlyhe didnt bother pulling it back in before he started talking im watching it it isnt doing very much though heh gerin saidthe sound of a laugh without the mirth rihwin drank more wine and called on mavrix again the sithonian god stayed wherever he was he did not come to that part of the northlands rihwin looked unhappy so did gerin though he did not feel that way maybe he wont come maybe he wont hear us rihwin sounded as disappointed as he looked maybe he wont gerin also sounded as disappointed as he looked but again he did not feel that way maybe hes afraid of me ferdulf sounded arrogant he was a demigod he had reason to be arrogant most of the time he did not in gerins view have reason to be arrogant when he was talking about making a god afraid maybe when he was older ferdulf would figure that out for himself maybe he would stay arrogant as long as he lived maybe if he stayed arrogant around gods he wouldnt live so long as he expected rihwin drank yet again we implore thee lord of the sweet grape to favor us with thy presence he said when nothing happened gerin began well all right youve had yourself some wine rihwin but the lord of the sweet grape doesnt and then the lord of the sweet grape did glowing softly mavrix appeared before gerin rihwin and ferdulf the sithonian god did not look happy mavrix in fact looked intensely annoyed well what is it now he asked in a peevish voice you keep bellowing in my ear until i can hardly hear myself think rudeness thats what it is welcome lord of the sweet grape gerin said now that mavrix was here he had to make the best of it we have summoned you to the northlands once more to implore you for aid against the elabonian empire and and to take your muchused backside out of here and never come back again ferdulf broke in is that so mavrix said between that and so he moved from where he had been to right next to ferdulf apparently without crossing the intervening space he seized his son ferdulf squalled and tried to get away but could not mavrix gave ferdulf a harder more thorough spanking than gerin had ever dared administer this is for the filthy tongue in your head after a brief pause he walloped his son again harder than ever and this is for presuming to tamper with the blood of the sweet grapeso much wine wasted so much wine men will never drink in an aside to gerin rihwin muttered id do that to ferdulf for wasting a wagonload of wine too if only i dared mavrix has the power to do it gerin whispered back presently mavrix left off chastising ferdulf who collapsed in a weeping puddle the sithonian god turned his fathomless black eyes on the fox what were you saying before we endured that tasteless interruption lord mavrix i was saying that i hoped you might change your mind and aid me against the forces of the elabonian empire gerin replied no mavrix said he then repeated himself several times at increasing volume no no no does that adequately acquaint you with my feelings in this matter but why not lord rihwin asked why mavrix screechedyes he was exercised and gerin felt a certain amount of relief that rihwin had beat him to the question since this whole summoning had been his fellow foxs idea let the ohsoclever fellow take the heat for it and heat there was mavrix continued high and shrill i am not required to tell you anything you pustule on the backside of this backwoods nest of barbarians i know you are not required to do anything of the sort lord rihwin said for a wonder he had the sense to walk very small i thought you might in your great generosity deign to tell me thats all well mavrix said somewhat mollified by a mortals flattery you are trying but then you are trying too if you take my meaning he stuck out his tongue at rihwin but then drew it back in all right all right if you must know if you must one reason i have no interest whatever in coming to your aid is on account of what this little wretch did he dug his foot into ferdulfs ribs in what was half a poke half a kick i didnt do half of what i wish i could ferdulf snarled mavrix ignored him which was probably his good fortune the sithonian god went on dont you think theres a basic rudeness involved in insulting a deity and then beseeching him for aid dont you lord i did not insult you rihwin said gerin the fox did not insult you we are the ones who seek your aid not your son gerin would have been just as well pleasedbetter than just as well pleasedhad rihwin not mentioned him but when mavrix turned those deep deep black eyes his way he found he had no choice but to nod assuredly lord i offered you no insult he said and that was truehe unlike ferdulf knew better than to insult a god i dont care mavrix said sniffily my son insulted me and he associates with you therefore you might as well have insulted me that was breathtakingly unfair had gerin really wanted mavrixs aid he would have protested loud and long since he didnt he contented himself with saying i myself would never do such a thing and i cannot control everyone who associates with me he gave rihwin a pointed stare i dont care mavrix repeated i am insulted and one of yours insulted me you get nothing from me in return im not one of his ferdulf shouted im yours he showed me a pleasant peasant wench to tempt me to his keep mavrix answered pointing at gerin i let myself be tempted and then i let myself be tempted you ferdulf are the result ferdulfs curses aimed impartially at gerin and mavrix were loud and fierce and vile in point of fact rihwin who had a more intimate acquaintance with the charms of peasant women than did gerin had chosen fulda whod proved tempting to mavrix gerin refrained from mentioning that ferdulf was quite upset enough as things were rihwin said what other reasons have you for refusing lord none i need discuss with you mavrix said haughtily none i intend discussing with you whatever they may be they are mine and no business of yours in any particular hed said pretty much the same thing about his first reason which made gerin whose curiosity never rested ask can we not persuade you to explain yourself maybe mavrix would have explained himself maybe he wouldnt before he could speak though ferdulf broke in can we not persuade you to bugger off can we not persuade you to take a flying futter at fast fomor as the trokmoi say can we not persuade you to gerin did not get a chance to find out what else ferdulf might have wanted to persuade his father to do because mavrix gave the demigod another licking more savage than either of the first two demigod ferdulf might have been but he was not strong enough to withstand punishment from a god he wailed and shrieked and made noises not far different from those any child might have made after a drubbing from its father through that racket mavrix said to gerin you see how it is this north country is unpleasant enough without the insults with them it is intolerable i go and if fate be kind i shall not return he vanished well gerin said to rihwin so much for that eryes lord king rihwin answered i think it shall be some long while before i once more seek to have aught to do with mavrix lord of the sweet grape he sketched a salute and strode off shaking his head that left gerin alone with ferdulf not a position he would have chosen but the choice was not his to make he thought about walking off as rihwin had ferdulf after all had been the author of his own troubles the fox was mildly surprised to discover himself not hardhearted enough to leave the battered little demigod by himself in his pain are you all right he asked ferdulf you can bugger off too ferdulf growled youre laughing at me you hate me everybody hates me not quite everybody gerin answered though that certainly isnt from any lack of effort on your part you seem to go out of your way sometimes to make yourself hateful go away ferdulf said youre not my father i havent got a father as far as im concerned he isnt real he doesnt exist you were scandalized about the foolish god of the weshapar who said the same thing about his neighbor gods gerin said do you think it sounds any wiser coming out of your mouth i dont care ferdulf said i just dont care you had a proper father a father who cared about you gerin burst into laughter so bitterly raucous it made ferdulf stare the fox said what in the five hells do you know about it my father thought he could cure me of books and make me a warrior with the back of his hand it was only when he finally figured out he was wrong that he shipped me over the high kirs to be rid of me but you ended up a warrior anyhow ferdulf said so i did gerin said but that was my doing not hisand i didnt waste his time and mine with a pack of childish tricks and tries for revenge i am not a child ferdulf said i am a demigod you are a demigod the fox agreed but youre also a child thats what makes things so difficult for everyone around you good ferdulf said and drifted away apparently none the worse for wear from the beatings mavrix had given him and just as apparently intent on taking no notice whatever of gerins sermon the fox sighed he didnt suppose he should have been surprised aye lord king thats how it is fandil fandors son said as he rubbed down his horse i got around the imperials with no great trouble but it didnt do me as much good as i would have liked it didnt do you as much good as youd like either he patted the horses neck i will tell you this thoughi had no trouble getting through the bastards and back again wonderful gerin said sourly but once you did get through you found that aragis had gone to earth thats what i said lord king fandil returned to rubbing the horses back gerin sympathized with the animal fandils father had been called fandor the fat fandil was more along the lines of the chubby but gerin wouldnt have wanted to try carrying him on his back he doesnt plan on doing any more fighting out in the open then gerin persisted not if he can help it fandil answered he and his army are holed up in the strongest keeps they can find and he doesnt think the imperials can pry him out of them before winter comes and they get too hungry to stay in the field if they tear up the countryside but then go home what does he care hes ahead of the game his peasants arent gerin said but that only made him laugh at himself as long as the imperials went away aragis didnt care what happened to the peasantry gerin supposed he had to sympathize with that but aragis didnt care what happened to the peasantry any other time either fandil said looks like the imperials are settling down to the sieges too dont know whether theyll try knocking down walls or just sit there and starve the places out one at a timeif they can if they can gerin agreed the one thing im sure of is that aragis wouldnt put his men into castles that are easy to take and he wouldnt put them into castles that dont have plenty in their cellars either you know best about that lord king fandil said but what it looks like to me is were on our own over here gerin sighed it looks that way to me too fandil weve been on our own over here all along and we havent done any too well so far youll come up with something gerin might not have confidence but fandil like a lot of his men did i hope so gerin said to the crows with me if i have the faintest notion what it is though fandil didnt seem to hear that any more than aragis had heard gerin when he said he wasnt a sorcerer not for the first time nor for the five hundredth either he wondered why people didnt pay more attention to what other people said they already had their own ideas and that seemed to be enough for them the next morning he and van and dagref rode out along the picket line of horsemen he kept west of his force to warn him if the imperials decided to come at him again for the moment the men of the elabonian empire were holding back they had pickets out too in chariots to warn of any sudden move gerin might make against them theyre not bad fellows one of rihwins riders said pointing toward an imperial chariot perhaps a quarter of a mile away for business like this they dont bother us and we dont bother them when the time comes to really fight again theyll really go after us i suppose and well do our best to fill em full of arrow holes but whats the use till then none i can see gerin allowed its a pretty sensible way of going about things when you get down to it he glanced over at van in the outlanders younger days odds were he would have thundered out something about killing the foe whenever you found any chance to do it had gerin had adiatunnus with him the trokm chieftain probably would have said the same thing now but van only shrugged and nodded as if to say the horsemans words made good sense to him too little by little he was mellowing a couple of riders farther along the line maeva patrolled a stretch of meadow no lord king she said when gerin asked her i havent seen anything out of the ordinary as the earlier rider had she pointed toward an imperial chariot out of arrow range to the west theyre keeping an eye on us same as were keeping an eye on them all right gerin said right at the moment im not sorry things are quiet we need the time to pull ourselves back together theyre probably thinking the same thing about us lord king maeva answered seriously we had to pull back aye but we bloodied them they have more room to make mistakes than we do though van said by the gods we didnt make any mistakes i could see in that last fight and we lost it anyhow dagref said nothing at all that was unusual enough to make gerin keep an eye on his son as maeva kept an eye on the force from the elabonian empire and as the imperials kept an eye on gerins army for his part dagref was keeping an eye on maeva as best gerin could tell from watching the back of his sons head dagrefs eyes did not leave her she kept looking at him too well well the fox thought isnt that interesting gerin looked over at van again too the outlander was also eyeing his daughter but not gerin judged with that kind of suspicion van was still trying to figure out why in blazes she wanted to take the field and not worrying about anything else life would get even more interesting if maevas belly started to bulge gerin had had that thought before he wondered whether dagref worried about such things he might well not have himself at that age a man and a womanor a boy and a girlcould enjoy each other a good many ways without running the risk did dagref know about them he had little in the way of real experience but who could guess what all hed heard what all hed read who could guess what all maeva knew either still shaking his head gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder lets get moving he said with obvious reluctanceobvious to the fox at any rate and probably to maeva toodagref flicked the reins the horses began to walk and then to trot dagref was not so unsubtle as to look back over his shoulder at maeva gerin however could look back with no fear of rousing vans suspicions and he did sure enough maeva was staring after the chariot maybe that was because it held her father gerin wouldnt have bet on it though not anything he couldnt afford to lose after hed finished the tour of his pickets and convinced himself the imperials werent going to take him by surprise he had dagref drive back to camp when he returned rihwin and ferdulf were in the middle of a screaming row each plastering the other with names that stuck like glue van descended from the chariot and tried to break up the fight with the result that both rihwin and ferdulf turned on him gerin hadnt tried to interfere between his friend and the little demigod knowing that was what would happen if he did hed had a sufficiencyindeed an oversupplyof people shouting at him lately and saw no need to encourage more if van was of the opinion he hadnt been getting his own fair share of abuse he was in gerins view welcome to it vans furious bass roar blended with ferdulfs baritone and rihwins higher lighter voice to produce discord in threepart disharmony dagref rolled his eyes youd think uncle van would have better sense than to get mixed up in that he said aye good sense is hard to come by among these parts isnt it gerin said he didnt think he was being much more than his usual sardonic self his sons mind though worked in the same channel as his own dagref whirled around and gave him a look half stricken half relieved you know dont you he said i know now gerin said id wondered for a while aye you dont think van knows do you dagref asked in some alarmnot enough as far as gerin was concerned but some if he did know the fox answered do you think hed waste his time yelling at rihwin and ferdulf a point dagref said still not happily you had better be careful gerin saiduseless advice to most youths but dagref was notin some ways was notcut from the usual cloth if you get her with child youll think the five hells had come crashing down on you no matter how much fun youre having now another point dagref admitted there are he paused and coughed and might have blushed a little as he searched for words there are ways of doing things where we dont have to worry about that yes i know about those ways gerin said nodding i wasnt sure whether you did eri do dagref said and stopped there gerin was content to stop there too he couldnt very well keep an eye on his son not in this matter he couldnt he couldand didhope dagref and maeva would stay content to stop with substitutes when they found themselves alone together whatever maeva did she threw herself into it wholeheartedly in that she very much resembled both her parents that meant gerin would have to rely on dagrefs good sense and on dagrefs having good sense at a time when good sense was supposed to go flying out the door with any other lad of dagrefs age it would have been the most forlorn of forlorn hopes gerin studied his son he still didnt think the odds were any too good but he didnt think they were hopeless either he sighed whatever the odds were he had no choice but to accept them he rubbed his chin that wasnt strictly true maybe i ought to send maeva home to keep this from getting any further out of hand than it is already dagref looked stricken dont do that father you didnt send her home for anything she did so it wouldnt be fair to send her home for anything im doing unless youre violating her by force which i doubt you would do and doubt you could do youre not doing it altogether by yourself the fox pointed out at which dagref blushed again in musing tones gerin went on maybe i should send you home instead i hope you dont send either of us dagref said if you have to send one of us though send me gerin slapped him on the back thats well spoken for i know you arent trying to get away from the fighting but i do think ill leave you both here he found one other question to ask what will you do if van finds out he didnt think dagref would be able to come up with any answer for that but dagref did and promptly too run well all right gerin said with a startled laugh thats probably the best thing you could do though i dont know if youll be able to run far enough or fast enough have to try dagref risked a wry smile that reminded gerin achingly of himself maybe he wont be able to decide whether to set out after me first or maeva and well both be able to get away maybe gerin laughed again van though was too automatically competent a warrior to dither at a time like that he would settle on one of dagref or maevaprobably dagreffirst and then the other the fox hoped his son wouldnt have to learn that from experience after a few days scouts brought back word that the imperials looked to be getting ready to push forward again gerin clicked his tongue between his teeth far from a happy sound i knew it was coming he said with a sigh id have been happier if it hadnt come so soon though what will we do lord king a scout asked fight i suppose gerin sighed again the only other choice we have is letting ourselves get pushed back into the valley of ikos and i dont want to do that with everything else thats gone wrong in this campaign i dont need to have biton angry at me too we lost the last time we tried to withstand the imperials dagref pointed out why should this time be any different last time they picked the groundor they didnt leave me much choice which amounts to the same thing the fox answered they struck faster and harder than i thought they would we have better warning this time im going to fight where i want to fight by the gods what sort of ground are you thinking of dagref asked i have a place in mind as a matter of fact gerin said its a long thin stretch of meadow with really heavy woods on either side off to the left beyond the woods theres a little hill i intend to screen off with a good many of rihwins riders do you see whats in my mind i think so dagref answered you want to put men back there and trap the imperials between your two forces dont you thats what im planning yes gerin agreed now i have to hope the imperials dont see it as clearly as youve done but the imperials to his loud vehement and profane dismay did see the trap and refused to fall into it when his riders picked off one of the scouts from south of the high kirs he found out why weve got swerilas in command of us now the prisoner said swerilas the slippery men call him he sent arpulo werekas son back west to take charge of the sieges against gerin im gerin gerin said against aragis then i cant keep you rebels straight the captured imperial said swerilas figured that was the easier part of the job so he gave it to arpulo youve caused arpulo trouble swerilas decided he needed to deal with you himself were it not for the honor he shows me its a compliment i could do without gerin murmured and then swerilas the slippery eh hed be the fellow who was in charge of your second army wouldnt he aye the prisoner said arpulo led the first gerin scowled his life had just got more difficult he had arpulos measure even if hed lacked the manpower to beat him in their latest clash but swerilas an ekename like the slippery was all too close to the fox and swerilas had shown that he had more than a few ideas of his own gerin would have been happier fighting a bruiser who didnt think very well after he sent the prisoner away he decided he might have been lucky that swerilas had stayed out of his trap rather than letting himself go in with his eyes open and then smashing out in both directions at once gerins force was inferior to his in numbers against an average commander like arpulo the fox had no qualmswell few qualmsabout dividing even an inferior force against someone who knew what he was doing as swerilas plainly did dividing his force was asking to be destroyed in detail with another scowl gerin did his best to come up with a new plan against swerilas he had fewer options than hed had against arpulo and swerilas no doubt would be able to think of more unpleasant things to do to him than would have crossed arpulos fierce but unimaginative mind gerin dispatched all his horsemen to harass swerilas scouts to drive them back on the main body of imperials and to disrupt the imperials foraging as much as he could you riders are the one force we have that the imperials dont know everything about he told rihwin the fox well wring every particle of advantage we can out of that aye lord king rihwin said we shall fall on the men of the elabonian empire like a whirlwind we shall trouble them with continuous attacks from all directions until they weepingly regret ever having stirred north of the high kirs that was as grandiloquent as anything gerin had heard lately even from rihwin but rihwin fortunately was almost as long on fighting talent as he was on bombast gerin thumped him on the shoulder aye thats good thats what i want from you the harder he has to work against your horsemen the less leisure hell have to do anything against the main army here i shall think on this with gratitude as the imperials chew my force to pieces rihwin replied bowing go howl gerin said i dont want you to get chewed to pieces im counting on you not to let yourself and your force get chewed to pieces by the gods i dont want to fight a pitched battle with this swerilas i want you to keep him running every which way so hes too busy and hot and bothered to come and fight a pitched battle with the whole army oh i understand you lord king rihwin said whether what you want and what swerilas wants are one and the same remains to be seen thats true in any fight gerin said ill move forward as far as i can with the bulk of my force if you do get in trouble ill support you as best i can he set a hand on rihwins shoulder again do your best not to get in too much trouble would you how can you say such a thing about me rihwin drew back in an artful display of indignation have i ever been anything in all my days save staid and sedate he had an excellent straight face no never gerin agreed soberly both men laughed then rihwin said will you let ferdulf come along with me it will be easier to annoy the imperials if i have the best notion i can of where they are where theyre moving and what they want to try to do to me if you can talk ferdulf into going with you youre welcome to him gerin answered his grin was distinctly sardonic in fact youre welcome to him as a general principle as a general principle i dont want him thanks rihwins grin closely matched gerins didnt you hear us going at each other a few days ago most of the northlands heard you i should think gerin said i daresay you can understand me then as a flying spy though he has his uses whether hell want anything to do with you of course remains to be seen gerin said hes liable not to be very happy with you you know after the rough handling mavrix gave himyou were the one who was bound and determined to summon the sithonian god yes thats what ferdulf was screeching about before rihwin said but ill take my chances now you certainly will gerin agreed at which rihwin gave him a dirty look gerin went on talk with him though if after hes done insulting you some more he decides to go along i think youre righthell be quite useful to you as a flying spy after something close to half a lifetime with you and van of the strong arm i shant let insults from a badtempered baby demigod faze me rihwin said off he went ostentatiously ignoring the sour stare gerin sent after him sure enough he managed to persuade ferdulf to accompany the force of riders after the shouting ferdulf put up when he made the request though gerin wouldnt have blamed rihwin if hed buried mavrixs son upside down in the ground that at least would have made ferdulf shut up watching the little demigod wheel and swoop above the horsemen gerin was also just as well pleased not to be under there in the same way he would have been just as well pleased not to be under a flock of crows with griping bowels the crows would have let flyor let fallat random ferdulf if the evil mood took him could aim van was not watching ferdulf as the riders trotted away he was trying to spot maeva among the warriors on horseback and not having much luck turning to gerin he said i still wish youd made her go home shes doing what she wants to do you know the fox answered you couldnt stop it more than another couple of years at the most that would be good van said in a couple of years likely enough we wouldnt be worrying about the imperials any more unless wed already lost to them of course gerin replied no waiti take your point but we would be worrying about aragis or the trokmoi or the gradi or somebody by the gods if maeva wanted to fight somebody shed find somebody to fight and if you didnt feel like letting her shed fight you maybe maybe the prospect didnt make van look any happier but thats not the only thing i fret about come on foxyou know what soldiers are like well what if i do the fox said anyone who tried to take anything she didnt feel like giving would regret it as long as he lived and that might not be long either weve been over this ground before you know oh aye the outlander let out a long sad sigh why couldnt she have just stayed home and come to notice dagref say we could have married them off and that would have been an end to it gerin didnt gape like a fool he didnt burst into hysterical laughter he didnt even suffer a coughing fit the effort he needed to keep from doing any of those things would have let him lift the temple at ikos over his head and throw it from one end of the valley to the other in an offhand tone that somehow wasnt more elaborately casual than it should have been he answered if they like the idea you wouldnt see me complaining well have to see if we can make it seem as if theyre the ones who came up with it not us truth that van said one of the turns of phrase hed learned from the trokmoi that still occasionally showed up in his speech if anybody older than i was came up with a notion back when i was a sprat i didnt want anything to do with it he cocked his head to one side and studied the fox and you you must have been a terror when it came to listening to your elders who me gerin did his best to look like innocence personified his best evidently wasnt good enough for van guffawed aye you captain he said go on and look sweet all you fancy my guess is you werent any more ready to pay the least bit of attention to what your father told you than dagref is for you my father hit me harder and more often than ive hit dagref gerin said after a brief pause for thought that made me more likely to listen but i think less likely to agree van smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand sometimes youll settle for getting them to listen that way you say that now gerin said what did you say then ahh what difference does that make the outlander replied with a grin i was just a brat then wet behind the ears of course i wouldnt have believed that if anybody told it to me mind you rihwin began sending back prisoners and the occasional wagon pilfered from the imperials and news of what swerilas the slippery was up to the empires general looks to be pulling all his men back into a knot one of rihwins riders reported the same way a snail will go back into its shell if you poke it in one of its little horns he held up a couple of fingers imitating a snail the creatures have their eyes at the ends of those stalks gerin said a fact hed picked up in the city of elabon hed never had occasion to trot it out in all the many years since but his fiendishly tenacious memory hadnt let him forget it now that he finally did get to use it he discovered the horseman didnt believe him with a laugh the fellow said thats funny lord king i mean it gerin said indignantly if those little black dots on the ends of the stalks arent eyes where would a snail keep em how am i supposed to answer a question like that the rider said the whole world knows snails have no eyes but they do the fox insisted he couldnt persuade the horseman he wasnt joking finally in disgust he sent him back to rihwin gerin was still fuming when he turned to van who had listened to the last part of his exchange with the scout can you believe the stubborn ignorance of that man van chuckled he shook his head but not in the way gerin would have wanted oh no you dont captain the outlander said you can try and confuse a rider from some backwoods keep as much as you like but youre not going to do it to me by the gods when you come right down to it that fellow was righteverybody knows snails dont have any eyes gerin snarled a curse and stalked off he snarled another curse a couple of days later when the imperials mauled a detachment of rihwins riders the damage done was bad enough that rihwin felt he had to come back himself to explain they outwitted me he said sounding angry and embarrassed at the same time they had a small band showing making their way through wheatfields but more of them were lurking in the trees as soon as we were well engaged with the decoys out they swarmed thats unfortunate gerin said he looked down his nose at rihwin its also unfortunate that you let yourself be fooled by the sort of trick weve used so often ourselves i didnt expect it of the imperials rihwin said a little sullenly one of the reasons i came north of the high kirs all those years ago if youll remember is because interesting things happen here while all stays stodgy south of the mountains the way the emperors men fought in this campaign had given me little reason to change my view except for the forces commanded by this swerilas the slippery gerin said he beat us when we were almost down to cassat and he did it the same way he did here he stuck out one force and then he struck with another one we didnt expect if bait looks too juicy to be true my fellow fox it likely is but it didnt look too juicy to be true rihwin angrily kicked at the dirt by the gods you would have sent in the riders with no more hesitation than i showed it was a chance encounter nothing more no it seemed a chance encounteror you wouldnt have been ambushed gerin said he must have set it up by gauging where your detachment was which way they were headed and how fast he kicked at the dirt too which means swerilas is very slippery indeed i want another crack at him rihwin said no one does that to me not without paying for it unfortunately someone did do it to you gerin answered and i dont want you charging after the imperials all wild for revenge swerilas will be waiting for something like that for a wonder he got through to rihwin aye belike youre right rihwin said its just what a man from the city of elabon would expect in the northlandslet the locals make fools of themselves and then count on them to make bigger fools of themselves trying to recover of course odds are he didnt know he was facing another man from south of the high kirs gerin said go aheadrub salt in the throbbing wound rihwin struck a pose of affronted dignity then it collapsed and he chuckled speaking of men from south of the high kirs lord king did i tell you weve captured my cousin no gerin raised an eyebrow how did that happen usual sort of way rihwin answered he got wounded in the shoulderdoesnt look too badfell out of his chariot and we scooped him up when i found out his name was ulfilas batwins son i asked about his family because my uncles son batwin is a man of about my age and sure enough we are first cousins once removed youve been removed by twenty years and a mountain range too gerin said he sighed and put an arm around rihwin all right you walked into this one its over dont do it again he laughed i sound as if im talking to one of my sons dont i one of these days maybe just maybe youll grow up one of them has done it and the second is on the way i resent the imputation rihwin looked affronted again go ahead gerin said cheerfully ill probably have to keep right on lecturing you till they shovel dirt over one of us or the other you could shut up instead rihwin suggested they laughed both knowing that gerin shutting up was about as likelyor rather as unlikelyas rihwin growing up ferdulf came flying toward gerins main force here he comes the demigod shouted that cursed horse turd of a swerilas is heading this way and i dont think hes coming to invite you to take ale with him well i cant say im surprised gerin answered he couldnt say he was truly ready to meet swerilas assault either but volition didnt play any great role here how far away is he and how are the horsemen doing at holding him back hell be here in a couple of hours time maybe less ferdulf answered the riders are doing what they can but they cant stop the son of a sow all by themselves hes got too many men hes got too many chariots too i know that gerin said discontentedly hes got too many men and too many chariots for this whole army well what are you going to do about it ferdulf screeched the best i can gerin answered thats not good enough ferdulf said you have to beat him if you dont beat him the northlands are ruined if i dont beat him im ruined the fox said the possibility remains that i may not beat him he clicked his tongue between his teeth if i dont ill just have to go on from there you make it sound so easy scorn laced ferdulfs voice where will you go on from there pray tell i dont know gerin admitted i hope i dont have to find out ferdulf stared at him a trifle irritably he went on im not a god ferdulf im not even related to a god i dont know whats going to happen next all i can do is the best i can and see what happens i told you that already what a sloppy arrangement ferdulf said and what if you would be so generous as to tell me is the best you can do gerin had been thinking it over while the demigod carped at him im going to keep my men in one compact mass and hit the imperials as hard a blow as i can i dont dare divide my army against swerilas he has too many men and too many brains for me to take the chance what i hope is that ill catch him trying to do something fancy and punish him before he can pull all of his forces together he brightened a little go fly off and tell me how hes deploying that way ill have some notion of what im up against youre out of your head ferdulf replied with mournful certainty but away he flew gerin sighed and began shouting orders the men formed up as quickly as he could have wanted none of them showed any particular eagerness for the fight ahead not even adiatunnus trokmoi maybe that meant they were veterans who didnt need to scream like fiends to go out and fight well maybe it meant they had no particular hope of victory gerin hoped it was the one and not the other far faster than he should have given where swerilas force was ferdulf came whizzing back what now gerin asked in alarm had the imperial general stolen a march on him but ferdulf answered if youre going to fight in one large ugly lump are you fain to have me tell rihwin bring his horsemen back so they can take their lumps with the rest of you oh by the gods gerin exclaimed mentally kicking himself for having sent the demigod off too soon yes and thank you ferdulf im in your debt i admit it youre in my debt you owe your son a promise you owe the imperials a thrashingdo you think you can deliver on any of these ferdulf flew away before the fox had a chance to reply he sent his men forward toward that field hed found that was well suited to the size of his force as the main force advanced rihwins riders began joining them gerin posted the horsemen as a screen in front of the main body of chariotry and on either flank is that maeva van pointed off to the right he answered his own question aye it is he waved then muttered in disappointment she didnt see me curse it dagrefs head was turned in that direction he nodded it is maeva though and she seems all right he was better than he had been a little while before at sounding casual about it gerin looked west down the dirt road that ran through the field he nodded here came the imperials exchanging arrows with the last of his horsemen like his own troops the men of the elabonian empire were already deployed in line of battle sweeping down the road and along the open country to either side catching them in column would have been sweet but swerilas with his sobriquet was too alert to have let that happen elabon elabon elabon the imperials shouted gerin for one was heartily sick of that battle cry his own men yelled the usual northlands assortment of war cries and insults back at their foes forward gerin put everything he had into his own shout he wanted to be moving to receive the imperials charge not standing still waiting to be overrun dagref flicked the reins and cracked the whip above the horses backs they went from walk to trot to gallop one wheel of the car hit a stone the chariot flew into the air and came back to earth with a crash neither gerin nor van nor dagref did anything more than shift weight back and forth gerin looked to see if he could pick out swerilas the slippery among the imperials he couldnt swerilas was slippery enough not to deck himself out in raiment that made him a target the fox shook his head in disappointment he hadnt seen any other imperial officers that canny he started shooting anyhow if he couldnt find the best target hed hit what he could he didnt think swerilas had sent an outflanking party off to either wing if the imperial general had done such a thing ferdulf would have reported itor so the fox devoutly hoped that made it a straightforward slugging match army against army the same sort of fight arpulo had waged like the general hed replaced swerilas had greater numbers but swerilas quickly proved himself a better general than arpulo arpulo had let gerins men get round his flanks and attack his force from three sides at once swerilas by contrast made his own battle line wide and kept trying to lap round gerins force to the right and left very much unlike arpulo he knew what he had and what to do with it unhappily gerin extended his own line he knew what swerilas was trying to do make him thin his force enough to let the imperials find or create a weak spot and punch on through if they did that they could split his army in two and destroy one of the parts at their leisure other than retreat the only counter he could find was doing it to them before they had a chance to do it to him that meant thinning his line even more than hed done already to collect a force with which he could strike crew by crew his chariotry remained better than that of the elabonian empire without that being true he couldnt have done what he did even with its being true he gripped the rail of the chariot hard knowing the risk he took forward he shouted again dagref steered the car toward what looked like the weakest part of the imperial line for a brief shining moment he thought his striking force would break through the imperials still had a respect for the trokmoi just short of dread adiatunnus howling warriors did make them hesitate but swerilas unlike gerin did not have to stint one part of his line to send reinforcements to another he brought enough men in against gerins striking force to keep it from piercing his army through and through well what do we do now van yelled in gerins ear once the attack had plainly bogged down good question gerin answered dagref maneuvered smartly to keep the imperials from getting a chariot to either side of his own at the same time the maneuver brought the horses around so they were facing more nearly the way they had come than the way theyd been going gerin shot an arrow at one of the imperials closest to him and wounded the trooper in the arm but there were still too many soldiers from the elabonian empire close by with a weary curse the fox said now we go back i dont see what in the five hells else we can do not if we want to keep the army in one piece he managed the retreat as well as he could by then hed had more practice managing retreats than hed ever wanted hed never had to manage one against swerilas the slippery before though swerilas did what he would have done himself in the same place pushed hard and tried not merely to beat the army from the northlands but to wreck it gerin had hoped to be able to make a stand back at his camp but the leading imperials were too closely mingled with his rear guard to make that possible they were pressing gerin and his men too hard to make any stand possible for some time gerin had everything he could do to keep the imperials from getting ahead of his men and cutting off their line of retreat he did succeed in doing that muchthat little he thought of it at the timebut swerilas drove him almost to the southern opening of the valley of ikos before the light finally failed by all indications swerilas aimed to keep right on driving him when morning came too he looked north temple guards no doubt waited at the mouth of the valley he didnt care but for ikos he had nowhere to go xi a guardsman held his shield horizontally across his body to bar the road into the valley of ikos the lord biton forbids the entry of large bodies of armed men into the land surrounding his sacred precinct the fellow said gerin answered if the lord biton punishes me for bringing my army into his land then he will thats all he turned and waved his battered army forward get moving boys the god will know of your action the guard bleated as chariots began rolling past him and his spear hes the farseeing god so of course he will the fox replied hell also know why were doing it which is more than you do swerilas the slippery and the elabonian army are on our tail youre going to have more company than us and worse company than us too biton preserve us the guardsman said that would be nice gerin agreed but dont count on it too much because its liable not to happen the guard glared at him why did you have to lead the imperials here why couldnt you have fled in some other direction than this one its hard to flee straight toward the fellow whos just made you do it gerin pointed out and it was either come here or head off east toward the plains of shanda somehow i dont think im cut out to be a nomad but weve been free of the empire for many years the temple guard moaned will the officious priests from south of the mountains stick their long snouts into the way we run our affairs as i have heard they did in the longago and faroff days very likely they will gerin said thats what theyre good for sticking their noses into things i mean thats what theyll do if they win anyhow but my army is still in one piece even if we have lost some fights we may beat the imperials yet farseeing biton grant it be so the guard answered very well then i give you leave to pass into this valley unless the farseeing god should himself choose to overrule me thanks the fox said hed intended to take his army into the valley of ikos whether the guardsman gave him leave or not if the temple guard had been so foolish as to refuse to give his leave bitons temple probably would have had to get along without him from then on gerin figured he could square it with the god what use would a farseeing deity have for such a stupid guard we shall not grant leave to the imperials the temple guard declared if they enter they shall enter in bitons despite and shall face his punishment will you fight against the men of the elabonian empire gerin asked will you fight alongside us to protect the northlands that will be bitons judgment to make not mine the guardsman said if the god orders it we shall assuredly fight if the god orders otherwise we shall likewise obey him i havent the faintest idea was what he meant though his phrasing was a good deal more polished than that he hadnt come right out and said no gerin supposed that would have to do into the valley of ikos rode his battered troopers had the imperials been a little luckierand he knew it would have taken no more than thathis army would have been cut off before it got to the valley cut off and destroyed the imperials would have more chance to do that soon enough for now though rest time to see to the wounded time to see to the horses and chariots time to curl up in a blanket and sleep a sleep that seemed not far removed from death gerin looked forward to that kind of sleeplooked forward to it with a hopeless longing because he would be too busy to enjoy anywhere near so much of it as his men did as usual after a battle he did what he could for the men who had been hurt he did some horsedoctoring too that was harder and in a way more discouraging his men had a notion of why and how theyd taken wounds to the horses everything was a nasty surprise gerin was washing a cut on a horses rump with ale when rihwin came up to him the horse quivered and let out a whuffling snort but did not try to bolt or kick thats a good fellow the fox said the rider holding the horses head stroked its nose and murmured theres a brave fellow thats my beauty the words meant little the tone much with a sigh gerin turned to rihwin and what can i do for you his tone meant much too but in a far less gentle way rihwin answered lord king i should like to know what our next movement against the imperials will be should you gerin said rihwin nodded with a grimace gerin went on well by the gods so should i the only thing i can think of doing though is to keep on with what were already doing which is to say retreating back toward our own lands you mean rihwin said gerin exhaled in exasperation you must have been listening to that lackwit of a temple guard its very hard to retreat toward the enemy the technical term for that is advance for which wisdom i thank you o font of knowledge rihwin said not about to be outdone in sarcasm but that was not precisely what i had in mind as you know only one road leads from the valley of ikos to lands under your illustrious suzerainty and it is a road perhaps something less than conducive to rapid travel ah gerin said and nodded now i understand youre not happy about the notion of traveling through the haunted woods eh to put with as much abridgment as i can muster lord king no rihwin said are you not so youd notice gerin answered but if its a choice between that and staying here so the imperials can finish wrecking us i know which direction ill go all i can do is hope my men and i come out on the other side if we do maybe we can smash in the head of the imperials column as they come after us that would be good rihwin said without much conviction he didnt think it would happen then better still gerin said in a spirit of experimentation would be meeting the imperials here in the valley of ikos and driving them back plainly gerin didnt think that would happen either yes that would be better lord king he agreed not likely perhaps but better without a doubt how do you aim to produce a victory when lately weve known nothing but defeat i dont know gerin admitted which seemed to nonplus rihwin more than anything else he might have said the best we can hope for now it seems to me is to hope the imperials havent the stomach for a long hard campaign and give up and go home we might have had a better hope for that had we gained the aid of the lord of the sweet grape rihwin said thats not what biton said but then youve never been much interested in any opinion but your own rihwin scowled at him a moment later though the eyes of the man from south of the high kirs widened you demon from the hottest hell he whispered you let me go through the danger of summoning mavrix hoping and expecting i would fail and you said never a word i understand how surprising it must be for you to discover there are people who can on occasion keep their mouths shut gerin replied sweetly you really should try it sometime it can be useful to the crows with utility and to the crows with you too rihwin said his effort to stalk off in impressive fury was hampered when he bumped into van like everyone else who bumped into the outsized outlander he bounced off he kept stalking after that but it wasnt the same van shook his head i see you were rattling his cage again twice gerin answered then he corrected himself no i take that back he rattled his own cage once when he figured out i wasnt too unhappy that he hadnt managed to get mavrix to help us after all what did he do say you were trying to use him as a sacrifice the way the god of the weshapar wanted zalmunna to sacrifice his son he didnt use that example no but that was the general tone as a matter of fact the fox laughed laughing felt good it also let him take his mind off the unpleasant fact that he still had no idea how to stop the imperials but when he stopped laughing that fact remainedand it seemed to be laughing at him laughing and showing fangs as long as sharp as those of a longtooth maybe it was laughing at van too he said come morning that swerilas the slimy is going to start nipping at our tails again slippery gerin said swerilas the slippery no matter how slimy he is but he hesitated then spoke in some surprise i may just know what im going to do about him aye by the godsand by one god in particulari may just sure enough swerilas pushed his men forward not long after the sun came up the temple guards did resist them so did a rear guard of gerins men but the imperials were too many to be withstood for long and in swerilas had a leader who grew angry with anything less than victory gerin fed more men into the fight not so much in expectation of stopping swerilas as to slow him down and had swerilas not already been a suspicious sort failure to try to hold him off would have made him one slowing him down also let gerins main force forage among the prosperous villages of the valley of ikos as they retreated toward the sibyls shrine the temple guards peeled off to defend the temple from its marble outwalls gerin ordered his own men to keep on retreating dagref gave his father a curious look then all at once it vanished from his face bitons temple holds a lot of rich things doesnt it he remarked oh there might be a few in there i suppose gerin answered his voice elaborately casual why do you think that might be interesting to the imperial soldiers and their officers it just might his son said imitating his tone with alarming precision the one thing about which the men of the northlands always complain is how the elabonian empire squeezed wealth out of them like a man squeezing whey out of a lump of cheese biton isnt the sort of god who fancies being squeezed van put in you know that gerin said i know that the question is does swerilas the slippery know that and the other question is if he does know does he care he has wizards with him he has the backing of the elabonian gods or thinks he does maybe he wont care a figs worth and think he can take whatever he pleases wouldnt that be nice van said dreamily weve seen the plague biton sends down on people who try robbing his shrine all those blisters and thingsits not pretty not even a little bit fox dont you think this swerilas would look mighty fine all blistered up since ive never met him i dont know how ugly he is already gerin replied but any old imperial covered in blisters would look pretty good to me right now north of the sibyls shine lay the town that catered to visitors to the valley who came seeking oracular responses the town was not what it had been in gerins younger days traffic for the sibyl had diminished when the elabonian empire severed itself from the northlands and diminished again after the earthquake that loosed the monsters on the earth many of the inns and taverns and hostels that had served travelers were empty some were wrecks that had gone unrepaired since the quake fifteen years before grass grew where others had once stood the innkeepers whose establishments survived viewed the arrival of gerins army with the same delight that serfs would have shown over the arrival of a swarm of locusts and for similar reasons they feared the troopers were going to eat them out of house and home and they were right is this justice lord king one of them wailed as gerins soldiers gobbled bread and roasted meat and guzzled ale probably not the fox admitted but were hungry and were here and were bloody well going to eat if we win this war ill pay you back next yearby all the gods i swear it if we lose you can send the bill to crebbig i the elabonian emperor then ill root for you the innkeeper said you have a good name for not telling too many lies i wouldnt wipe my arse with a promise from somebody on the far side of the mountains not that i even have a promise from the whoreson to wipe my arse with gerin thought it likely the innkeeper would see the imperials at first hand before too long as hed hoped swerilas had slowed his aggressive pursuit of the men from the northlands when he came in sight of bitons shrine rihwins riders had no trouble holding the imperials away from the town of ikos not for the time being taking advantage of that the fox put as many of his men in real beds as he could the summers fighting had worn down his troopers the more rest they got now the better they would perform when they had to climb into their chariots again he slept outside rolled in a blanket himself which perplexed adiatunnus wheres the point to kinging it if you canna be after enjoying yourself the trokm chieftain demanded he hadnt been slow about claiming the pleasures of a bed gerin shrugged im all right some of the men with small wounds need mattresses worse than i do maybe thats so and maybe its not adiatunnus said most o these lads are half your agehalf my age too forbyeand think naught of a night in the open if you say you dont creak of a morning youre a better man than i amor else youre a liar i do creak gerin admitted but i dont creak too badly and half the time ill creak when i get up out of a bed in the morning too im at the age when creaking is part of being alive im used to it i dont love it but i cant do anything about it nor i adiatunnus said sadly nor i but i creak less if im rising from soft straw or wool sure and i do and so ill take a bed when i find one a bed is better when youre after finding a friendly barmaid too however you like gerin said with another shrug like van adiatunnus wenched whenever he found a chance he laughed at the fox now you canna be saying youre so old it stirs in your breeches no more when it does why not let it out to play plenty o girlsd lie down with you just for the sake of saying theyd bedded a king i dont want gerin stopped what hed been about to say wasnt true he wasnt immune from wanting an attractive woman when he was away from selatre what he did or rather didnt do about it was something else again he changed the direction in which the sentence had been going i dont want to complicate my life how many bastards have you got a good many ill allow the trokm answered laughing again not so many as rihwin i expect but i had fun getting every one of em all right gerin said i dont begrudge you the way you live your life why cant you let me lead mine as suits me best adiatunnus scowled again how can i be having a proper quarrel with you when you willna get angry my quarrel is with swerilas the slippery not with you gerin replied youre my ally and my vassal hes my foe he grinned a lopsided grin and when we were young neither of us would have believe that could be so not for a minute we wouldnt truth that adiatunnus said och how we hated the very name of yourself on the far side of the niffet too good you were too good by half at tying us all in knots whenever we thought to raid over the river and then we we did at last lodge ourself on this side who but you did so much against us and kept so many from crossing and now you are my overlord and we have the same enemies as you say aye tis strange and more than strange if i can put up with the likes of you gerin said i shouldntand i dontmind putting up with a blanket on the ground sure it was for your kindness and sweet spirit i first named you king adiatunnus said he walked off shaking his head and laughing the next morning maeva her face glowing with selfimportance came riding back from the line against the imperials with the fat eunuch who had taken gerin down to the sibyls cave he says he must have speech with you lord king im glad enough to speak with him gerin answered and turned to the priest how now awkwardly the eunuch prostrated himself before gerin as if before an image of farseeing biton lord king you must save the gods shrine from desecration he cried get up the fox said impatiently when the priest had risen gerin went on who says i must if you do not save the shrine lord king the arrogant wretches from south of the high kirs will plunder it of the accumulated riches of centuries the priest seemed on the point of bursting into tears for his part though gerin had hoped the accumulated riches in and around bitons temper would make swerilas forget about him for a while and so he repeated who says i must save the shrine is it a command sent straight from biton himself if it was he might have to obey it however little he wanted to but the priest shook his head the loose flabby flesh of his jowls swinging back and forth biton has been mute in this matter he said in his sexless voice but you lord king are well known for the great respect you have always shown the farseeing god if the farseeing god ordered me to try to drive the men of the elabonian empire from his temple i would do it or do my best to do it gerin answered on the whole truthfully since he does not though let me ask a question of my own why do you think i retreated past the sibyls shrine and made my base here in the town of ikos i wondered lord king the eunuch priest replied i thought surely you would defend us with all your power with all my power gerin heard the bitterness in his own voice if i had the power to stop the imperials why would i have retreated into the valley of ikos in the first place why would i have retreated through it why will i have to retreat out of it if the imperials attack me again the priest stared at him but you are the chiefest warrior in all the northlands how could you be beaten more easily than id like as a matter of fact gerin answered when the elabonian empire sends more men against me than i can withstand they beat me nothing complicated about it at all and you can be glad aragis the archer isnt here to hear you call me the chiefest warrior too hed disagree with you and he isnt pleasant when he disagrees he might as well not have spoken the priest didnt interrupt him but plainly didnt pay any attention to his words either the fellow went on and you are the favorite of the farseeing god as well how could it be otherwise when you are wed to bitons former sibyl he sighed perhaps admiring the close relationship with biton he thought being married to selatre gave gerin perhapsas he was a eunuchadmiring gerin for being married at all and where he had not before he gave gerin pause did being married to selatre give him any special obligations it had given him advantages in the past and accounts had a way of balancing even so he hardened his heart and shook his head saying if the farseeing god wants anything from me he can tell me himself ill do what i can then without orders from the god though im not going to throw myself and my army away have you got that the eunuch stared at him out of large dark tragic eyes i have indeed lord king he said i shall take your words back to my comrades in bitons holy priesthood that they may learn nothing shall suffice to rescue them from the rapacious clutches of the elabonian empire gerins children sometimes tried to make him feel guilty by taking that tone of voice it didnt work for them and it didnt work for the eunuch priest either though the fox didnt laugh at him as he often did at his offspring if biton wants his temple to stay unplundered i expect he can manage that without me i console myself with the hope that you are right the priest replied but i have seen little to persuade me of it he turned and waddled south back toward the temple thanks maeva gerin said watching him go you did the right thing to bring him to me even if we cant help him now i wish we could maeva said so do i gerin said but if we could beat swerilas army any time we chose dont you think we would have done it by now go on back and keep an eye on the imperials they did slow down for the temple the way i hoped they would sooner or later theyll start again aye lord king she sketched a salute and rode after the eunuch priest the imperials did not move that day gerin hoped for thunderbolts from the temple but none came glad at least for the respite he wrapped himself in his blanket and went to sleep while he slept he dreamt it might have been the strangest dream hed ever had he kept seeing everything in it from an enormous distance so he could make out nothing clearly at the same time he felt an overpoweringly strong sense of urgency it was almost as if he were seeing the very edge of an important dream truly intended for someone else he kept trying to get closer to the center of the dream to learn why it seemed so important try as he would though he could not his dreamself ground its teeth in frustration he might have stood at the bottom of some deep smoothsided hole too deep from him to climb out of it but he had to climb out of it no matter what when he woke he was on his knees his hands up over his head he stared around in confusion at the inns and houses of ikos and at the campfires around which most of his soldiers slept for a moment they seemed far less real than the dream hed just lost he bit his lip hed missed something important he knew hed missed something important he hated missing anything important in the straits he was in he couldnt afford to miss anything important he couldnt do anything about it though maybe if he lay down and fell back to sleep the dream would return they sometimes did maybe too he would find himself closer to the heart of the matter he bit his lip he didnt like maybes but with no better choice he lay down eventually he slept so far as he remembered he dreamt nothing more for the rest of the night in the morning dagref and ferdulf were missing gerin didnt fret so much over the demigod for one thing he thought ferdulf likely able to take care of himself for another the camp was a good deal quieter without ferdulf around but dagreffor dagref to run off struck gerin as highly unlikely and then all at once it didnt dagref could have had a perfectly good reason for slipping out of camp a reason named maeva that he should have been so foolish as not to come back before things started stirring was another matter one over which gerin intended to have some pointed conversation with him the fox couldnt even lose his temper not so thoroughly as he would have liked unless he wanted to alert van to the reason he was upset the outlander seeing he was worried but not fully grasping why said to the five hells with me if i like the notion of dagref and ferdulf going off together who can guess what mischief theyre liable to get into till they go and do it and that gave gerin something new to worry about hed been thinking so much about dagref and maeva together the prospect of dagref and ferdulf together had entirely escaped his mind that was an oversight on his part he realized you dont suppose theyve gone off to conquer the imperials all by their lonesome do you he hadnt intended van to take him seriously but the outlander said the gods only know what theyve gone off to try and do i dont think they can conquer the bloody imperials by themselves seeing as the whole lot of us havent been able to do that what they think they can dowho knows who knows gerin echoed mournfully dagref was at the age where he thought anything was possible as for ferdulf almost anything was possible around him since his driver had gone off gerin borrowed a horse from rihwins men and rode slowly and carefully down to the horsemen who were holding the line against swerilas imperials the fox wished hed put in more time on horseback over the years he managed a simple ride well enough but wouldnt have wanted to try to fight while mounted one advantage of going by horse rather than by chariot was that he went by himself without van along he didnt have to come up with fancy and fanciful explanations for why he wanted to see maeva but he got no satisfaction from seeing her nor did it seem that dagref had got any satisfaction from her the night before no lord king she said her eyes widening i havent seen either dagref or ferdulf why do you think dagref would have come to me for the obvious reasons he answered and watched her flush hes not back at the camp and he didnt tell me he was going anywhere my first guess was that that meant a tryst with you if it meant a tryst it wasnt with me now maeva sounded dangerous for reasons that had only a little to do with warfare if it didnt mean a tryst with you i dont think it meant a tryst with anyone gerin said maeva relaxeda little and grudgingly the fox scratched his head if it didnt mean a tryst with you i dont know what it did mean all at once he remembered the peculiar dream hed had the dream where hed been on the fringes of things and unable to figure out what was going on no matter how important figuring out what was going on was maybe hed had to stay on the fringes of things because the dream had truly been aimed at dagref the two of them had both remarked on how much they thought alike gerin didnt find it unreasonable that he should catch the edge of a dream meant for his son that though only raised the next interesting question who or what was aiming dreams at dagref two answers came to mindthe imperials and biton no three for mavrix might have done it too which would or could have accounted for ferdulfs absenceassuming of course ferdulfs absence was connected to dagrefs too much i dont know gerin muttered with a sigh whats that lord king maeva asked is dagref all right i dont know that either gerin said awkwardly he swung up onto the horse and rode back to the town of ikos he hoped against hope dagref would be there when he got back he even hoped ferdulf would be there when he got back if that wasnt a mark of desperation he didnt know what was but neither dagref nor ferdulf was there where in the five hells have they gone what in the five hells do they think theyre doing he asked of van who had already shown he didnt know the answers either well just have to see if the imperials ask us for ransom the outlander said if theyve got ferdulf as far as im concerned they can keep him there are people who would say the same about dagref gerin said gloomily but im not any of them if they have him ill pay what they want to get him back the price they want is liable not to be gold or copper or tin van said its liable to be a bended knee whatever the price is ill pay it gerin answered do you think im so much in love with having people call me lord king that id throw away my son so theyd keep on doing it no van said at once and if you were fool enough to throw your son away no one would call you lord king afterwards anyhow for everybody would sicken at being led by such a man heres hoping youre right gerin said he had his doubts but did not pass them on to the outlander van would surely sicken of being led by such a man but plenty of truly vicious people had gone on to long and successful reigns the fox though had no desire to emulate them he wondered if dagref and ferdulf hadnt gone south after all if instead theyd chosen to head west along the track through the haunted woods back toward lands within gerins suzerainty he had trouble imagining why they would want to do such a thingthe fighting here would be over long before they could bring back reinforcementsbut he had trouble imagining why they would go see the imperials too he slammed one balledup fist into the palm of the other hand what had that dream been if hed been able to see more of it some time in the middle of the morning his son and ferdulf came walking into the town of ikos up from the south not from the forest and hills to the west no one escorted them which gerin took to mean that no one had seen them while they were coming from wherever they had been that was his first to the two of them where were you neither answered right away dagrefs silence was thoughtful silence from ferdulf struck gerin as most uncharacteristic at last dagref said we went down to see swerilas the slippery just like that gerin said you didnt have any trouble getting through my pickets you didnt have any trouble getting through the imperials pickets you went right ahead and walked in to have a chat with swerilas aye we did ferdulf said the unemphatic nod he gave lent credence to his words we did dagref echoed sounding a bit surprised about it we had no trouble doing it i knew we would have no trouble doing it i had a dream that told me we would have no trouble doing it and it was a true dream ha gerin said i was right the dream was aimed at you i had it too or rather the ragged fringe of it did you now dagref looked interested i thought you might have or someone might have i thought someone on the outside was trying to look in you might say i didnt notice anyone else when i had the dream ferdulf said with more than a trace of hauteur i was alone communing with the god which god gerin asked your father not likely ferdulf exclaimed my wretch of a father communes with his hand on my fundament not with a dream in my mind with whom then the fox demanded why with biton of course ferdulf said and dagref nodded he did indeed tell us to go to see swerilas the slipperywho is truly as oleaginous an article as i have ever set eyes onand so we did biton has more power than i could hope to oppose and i daresay more power than my father too gerin didnt know whether that last was true or not either way it wasnt his problem he kept on trying to find out about the things that were his problem and what did you tell swerilas when you saw him why we told him to attack your army of course and not to waste any more time doing it ferdulf and dagref spoke together smilingly confident they had done the right thing you told him what gerin shouted how could you tell him that why would you tell him that it was what farseeing biton told us to tell him ferdulf and dagref chorused only after the words were out of his mouth did dagrefs smile slip on his face i wonder why biton told us to tell him that to ruin me gerin suggested i cant think of any other reason can you if swerilas attacks me hell push this army right along the path through the haunted wood west of here hell probably push us to pieces too trying to get onto that one path how are we supposed to hold him off we havent got the men to hold him off dont you know that we do know that dagref said of course we know that we knew it then too ferdulf nodded it didnt seem to matter then though dagref added in some perplexity and ferdulf nodded again why does biton hate me gerin didnt direct the words at his son and the little demigod but at the indifferent sky he doesnt hate you father now dagref tried to sound reassuring why would he hate you my mother was his sibyl on earth maybe he hates me for taking her away from him but gerin frowned and shook his head biton had never shown any sign of disliking his match with selatre but if this wasnt such a sign what was it he couldnt answer that question so he found another one to ask dagref and ferdulf what else did the farseeing god tell you to tell swerilas nothing much dagref answered we were supposed to make it plain to him that we came with bitons message but we didnt have any trouble convincing him of that ill bet you didnt gerin said he thought for a while then asked did biton tell the two of you to tell me anything why he decided to do this to me might be interesting to learn in a morbid sort of way you ferdulf had some of his arrogance back why on earth would the god want us to speak to you if he had wanted you to know anything he would have sent you a dream but he didnt did he he left you on the outside looking in didnt he no he wanted nothing to do with the likes of you gerin didnt get insulted as he might have done he just shrugged and said well the god might have sent a dream straight to swerilas the slippery too but he didnt choose to do that so i thought id ask about this nothing for you ferdulf repeated nothing do you hear ferdulf you need never doubt that when you say something people do hear you gerin said they may sometimesthey may oftenwish they didnt but they do hed hoped that would make ferdulf glower at him instead the little demigods childlike face took on an altogether unchildlike look of satisfaction as far as ferdulf was concerned the fox had paid him a compliment dagref frowned wait he said there was something i think there was something no there wasnt ferdulf said indignantly i just told him there wasnt i ought to know im half a god myself and the better half at that if i say there wasnt anything there wasnt and thats flat maybe we didnt have exactly the same dream dagref said maybe i got this because im my fathers son maybe you think you have this because whats really between your ears is rock not brains ferdulf retorted and stuck out his tongue dagref remained unperturbed which perturbed ferdulf whatever the reason there was something the youth said he turned to gerin here it is for whatever it maybe be worth its something like pick the right path stay on the right path dont go off the right path no matter what what a stupid message ferdulf said you must have made that up yourself why would a god say anything that foolish i dont know dagref answered ive certainly heard a demigod say a good many foolish things lately ferdulf did glower at that gerin said what path his son shrugged i couldnt begin to tell you until you asked i didnt even know i had any message for you at all maybe its the path through the wood west of here gerin said but then he shook his head i really dont see how it could be theres only the one path through that wood no right or wrong about it youre either on the path or in the forest and if youre in the forest well too bad for you so what in the five hells is biton talking about something youre too ignorant to understand ferdulf said im too ignorant to understand a great many things the fox said why i put up with you immediately springs to mind before ferdulf could find a retort to that a horseman came galloping up from the south lord king he cried lord king the imperials are attacking lord king after that everything seemed to happen at once the fox shouted for his men to form a battle line in front of the town of ikos they were still forming it when rihwins riders came back to them sorry lord king one of the horsemen said wiping at a bleeding cut on his forehead theres just too many of the cursed buggers for us to hold back and theyre coming hard too swerilas has a way of doing that gerin answered absently now what ferdulf exclaimed now what he hopped up into the air anyone might do that while excited ferdulf though was not just anyone he didnt come down again dagref answered him before gerin could now we fight what else can we do even if you float like a pigs bladder you wits should be better than the ones a bladder or even a pig comes with ferdulfs venomous glare showed that even the fox would have had a hard time being more pungently sarcastic aye gerin said now we fight now we his voice trailed away he looked from dagref to ferdulf and back again after stroking his beard for a moment he walked over to dagref and kissed him on the cheek then he did the same with ferdulf what was that in aid of father dagref asked ferdulfs comments were a good deal more pungent but had the same general meaning understanding gerin answered at least i hope its understanding if its not understanding if its anything but understanding im in even more trouble than i was alreadyand here id been thinking that couldnt possibly happen he didnt say that out loud what he did say was come on we have to meet that templerobbing whoreson of a swerilas with edged bronze before before what father dagref broke in before anything else happens the fox saidnot the sort of reply calculated to satisfy his son satisfying his son was not the most urgent matter on his mind right then though dagref gave him an irked stare youre being as deliberately obscure as the sibyl when biton speaks through her he complained youre and then as his fathers had done his voice trailed away wouldnt that be interesting he murmured what are the two of you talking about ferdulf sounded even more irritable than usual youre a demigod use your semidivine wisdom to figure it out gerin told him while youre at it why dont you fly up and tell me what swerilas is trying to do to us you dont need me for that you can see him from here ferdulf answered which was depressingly true but the little demigod did pop into the air perhaps as much for the chance that gave him to wave his backside at gerin and dagref as for any other reason off he flew i hope youre not wrong father dagref said so do i gerin said believe me so do i before the fox could say any morenot that there was much more to sayvan came rushing up demanding to know why in the five hells he and dagref werent in the chariot yet and why they werent charging forward to smash swerilas into some large number of small pieces we do have to try father dagref added i know we do gerin answered well lets be about it then he stepped up into the chariot where van was already waiting and fuming so did dagref who flicked the reins and got the horses moving van gave gerin a dubious look are you going fey on us captain he demanded do you think were as done as a slab of beef over a fire are you riding out expecting to be killed gerin shook his head no very much the opposite as a matter of fact i dont think were going to win this battle but i havent lost hope for the war in fact i have more than i did a little while ago now the outlanders stare was quizzical after a moment he shrugged all rightyouve got some sort of scheme cooking in that beady little mind of yours i dont need to know what it is right now as long as its something and you havent given up on us ive never quite done that gerin said ive come close a few times over the years but ive never given up ahead of his force of chariotry rihwins riders and some of the temple guards were righting to slow the force swerilas the slippery led elabon elabon elabon the imperials shouted their war cries ringing through those of the men from the northlands lets hit em gerin yelled to his own troopers he plucked an arrow from his quiver let fly and pitched an imperial out of the chariot his men cheered they didnt seem to have any particular hope of victory either but they went into the attack with a will and for a while they drove the imperials back toward bitons shrine temple robbers was the shout bitons guards raised they fought with a fury that made them stronger than their numbers rihwins riders strove mightily to keep the warriors from the elabonian empire off balance gerin began to wonder what he would do if his army beat the foe that would mean hed been wrong in the way hed thought things would go he shrugged it wouldnt be the first time ive been wrong he muttered whats that fox van asked nothing much believe me gerin answered just out of bowshot of the wall of the temple the momentum of his counterattack faded swerilas had too many men and was too good a leader to let an inferior force beat him his men rallied and began to push not only forward but out to either wing the foxs troopers had to fall back to keep from being outflanked and cut off gerin stayed calmer about this retreat than he had during earlier fights in which the imperials had used their numbers to gain the upper hand you know something van said what is it saying i know something probably pushes things further than they should go the fox answered i have some ideas though ah thats good thats fine van beamed he didnt even ask what the idea were instead he stuck a finger in his friends face there you see didnt i tell you youd come up with something and you walking around with a rain cloud over your head you told me i was wrong you told me i was crazy i dont know whether you were wrong or not gerin said in case youre wondering though i still think youre crazy when he ordered the army to fall back through the town of ikos without making a stand protected by the houses and other buildings van shook his head and said you dont need to wonder if im crazy im the one who needs to wonder whether youre daft maybe i am gerin said well know pretty soon north of the town he had two choices left he could fall back to the top of the valley and try to break out through the rugged hills to either side or he could swing to the west and take the one narrow winding road through the ancient wood that lay between the valley and the elabon way without hesitation he swung his men to the west stay on this path he shouted to the warriors by all the gods and by farseeing biton most especially stay on this path what other path could they go on fox van said theres only the one after all weve been along it going east and west often enough to know take another look gerin suggested van did and his eyes widened as soon as hed finished staring to either side he stared at gerin im not daft the outlander said i know im not daft that particular way anyhow if you tell me there used to be half a dozen roads climbing up toward the forest ill call you a liar to your face i know better they didnt used to be here unless im the one whos gone mad they werent here yesterday gerin answered that doesnt mean theyre not here now though he raised his voice to shout again stay on this road men no matter what happens stay on this road how do you know this is the right one father dagref asked gerin gave him a harried look i dont he answered in a low voice but i think it is and that will have to do he let out another yell stay on this road by the gods but lord king theyre outflanking us one of his men cried in a frightened voice the trooper pointed to either side sure enough swerilas the slippery with the luxury of numbers was dividing his force sending parts of it along the new paths that had appeared to either side of the one on which gerin and his men traveled never having been in the valley of ikos before swerilas did not could not know they were new stay on the path gerin shouted again he looked ahead the wood was getting closer and closer a few imperialsenough to plug the gap should his army try to reverse its coursefollowed the men of the northlands along the road they were using most though hurried along the other paths that led into the wood van chuckled but even the bluff outlander sounded a little nervous now i know what swerilas is thinking he said i know just what hes thinking the son of a pimp so do i gerin said hes thinking these roads will all come together inside the forest hes thinking hell rush men along some of them get ahead of us cut us off and wreck us once and for all if you look at things from his point of view its a good plan its better than a good plan in fact or it would be aye van said in a hollow voice it would be as he spoke dagref drove the chariot in under the trees it was one of the last cars that belonged to the men of the northlands to enter the wood west of the valley of ikos stay on the path gerin called to the riders and chariot crews ahead for your lives stay on the path ride through to the end of the wood and well see what happens then he hoped they heard him he hoped they could hear him he didnt know not for certain sound had a different quality here under these great immeasurably ancient trees the rattle and squeak of the chariot axle the clop of the horses hooves seemed distant attenuated as if not quite of this world he could hardly hear the noise from other cars at all light changed too as it filtered down through the branches interlaced overhead it became green and shifting making distances deceptive and hard to gauge gerin imagined seeing underwater would be something like this the green was not the usual shade it would have been in a forest either the fox could not have said how it was different but it was he noticed that whenever he entered this strange place maybe it was because so many of the trees and bushes in this place grew nowhere else in the world but maybe too it was because the rest of the world did not fully impinge on this place gerin tapped dagref on the shoulder stop the car he said his son obeyed the last few chariot crews who had been behind them went past the men in those cars gave gerin curious and alarmed looks dagref looked curious too and perhaps a little alarmed if we wait here very long father the imperial vanguard will be be upon us he said will they gerin shook his head you may be right but i dont think so listen obediently dagref cocked his head to one side so did van so did the fox he could hear ever more faintly his own men hurrying west through the old and haunted wood that was all he could hear but for a few soft padding noises from beasts he had heard before but of which he had never seen anything save once or twice green eyes where are the imperial whoresons van sounded indignant they should be rattling along close behind us dagref is right they ought to be coming upon us any time now and theyre racing along those other paths too the funny ones to either side of us we should hear them there too by the gods how could we miss em but i dont hear a bloody thing he dug a finger in his ear as if that might help where are they i dont know gerin didnt hear the imperials either as van said he should have nor could he hear his own men not any more all he heard now was his own breathing that of dagref and van and the horses panting and the jingle of their harness turn back he told his son swing the chariot around and go back toward ikos i will father dagref said but only if youre sure you want me to go on gerin said shaking his head a little dagref flicked the reins and clucked to the horses he was obviously reluctant so were the animals they rolled their eyes and snorted and flicked their ears but they obeyed dagref and he obeyed gerin the chariot turned on the path which was barely wide enough to let it do so and rolled back toward the east it did not roll far no sooner had it rounded the first turn in the road than there was no more road trees and bushed blocked the way looking as if theyd been growing there for the past hundred years dagref stared how could we have come up this path if theres no path to come up before gerin could answer van said the trees in this wood arent to be trusted and thats a fact they move around some kind of wayive seen it before never like this though never like this hes right the fox said ive never seen it like this either though because his voice trailed off something was watching him from the cover of the bushes he couldnt tell whator whoit was he couldnt even make out its eyes as he could sometimes spot those of the strange creatures that dwelt inside this haunted wood but he knew it was there something passed from it to himand to dagref and van it wasnt a message in words had it been though it would have required only two go away dagref swung the chariot back toward the west now the horses seemed glad to run they scurried away from that newrisen barrier gerin blamed them not in the least softly van said i wonder whats going on behind those trees i wonder whats going on other places in the forest something quiet but not something id guess thats making the imperials very happy id say youre likely right gerin agreed no matter how slippery swerilas the slippery is i think hes just run into something hes not going to be able to slip out of again i wish i knew what was happening to the imperials dagref said he had every bit of gerins relentless itch to know he had only a small part of his fathers years to temper that itch still gerin found the right question to ask do you want to know badly enough to step off the road dagref thought that over then shook his head he didnt spend much time thinking either gerin wondered what would happen if quite suddenly the road ahead closed off as the road behind had done whatever it was he didnt think he would be able to do much about it he hoped it would be quick but then he heard the rattle and squeak of chariots in front of him without his saying a word dagref urged the horses up to a quicker trot they soon caught up with the cars at the rear of his force the men in those chariots exclaimed to gerin and his companions lord king one of them said we didnt think youd be coming this way again when you stopped there well here i am the fox answered determinedly making his voice sound as normal as he could now are you glad or sorry oh glad lord king the trooper said and others echoed him how far behind are the imperials would you say dagref and van both looked at gerin he in turn looked for the best reply he could give farther than youd think he said at last and then liking the sound of the words repeated them aye farther than youd ever think the warriors took the literal meaning and missed his tone thats good one of them said maybe the bastardsll take a wrong turning and get lost in these stinking woods maybe they will gerin said again with irony his men did not catch when he spoke again though he was not being ironic at all i only hope we dont get lost in them ourselves dont see how we could a trooper said its just the one road and it looks like it runs straight on through doesnt get much simpler than that gerin didnt say anything he and van and dagref looked at one another again then that trooper spoke once more in puzzled tones i wonder what happened to the rest of the imperials the ones who went down those other paths so do i gerin said solemnly so do i he was relieved when the trooper turned out to be right the road stayed straight and the men of the northlands emerged from the wood into bright afternoon sunshine rihwin who had been one of the first men out was forming them into a line of battle to resist the imperials if we hit them hard he was shouting when gerin came out of the wood well have the effective advantage of numbers for most of them will still be back under the trees are you going to tell him father dagref asked softly gerin shook his head i dont know for a fact not yet he said the event will tell better than i could anyhow ferdulf came flitting over do you know that i had to ride in a chariot like an ordinary mortal all the way through those ugly woods he demanded well do you you seem to have survived gerin answered dryly ferdulf glared then floated off in a snit the army waited and waited and waited at last as the sun began to set the troopers made camp no imperials came out of the wood then or ever when morning came the fox rode into the forest again he had no trouble traversing it it seemed as normal as it ever did perhaps even a little closer to normal than hed ever known it before or perhaps the strangeness that dwelt within was sated for a time presently van said were farther in now than we were yesterday when we turned around and the track was gone arent we aye i think so gerin answered and dagref nodded after a moment the fox added its still here now or rather its here again now anyhow its as if the thing never went away isnt it isnt it though van fixed gerin with an accusing stare you knew this was going to happen didnt you this gerin shook his head i had no idea this would happen i did hope something would happen if the imperials came into this forest and i was lucky enough to be right not if the imperials came into this forest dagref said the proper phrase is if the imperials came into this wood what in the five hells difference does it make van said the forestthe wood so what youre not a bard to complain the one doesnt scan and the other does he paused dagref looked very smug but didnt say anything rare restraint for a lad his age gerin didnt say anything either that extended silence warned van he was missing something though not quite so quick as either gerin or dagref he was nobodys fool after a moment he snapped his fingers the oracle dagref grinned gerin just nodded aye the oracle he said van slapped him on the back almost hard enough to pitch him out of the chariot you sneaky son of a whore he said in admiring tones you sneaky son of a whore when the sibyl talked about bronze and wood i thought sure she meant swords and spears and arrowheads on the one hand and chariots on the other who wouldnt have thought that its what i thought first too and im not ashamed to admit as much gerin said and we kept fighting the imperials and they kept kicking us in the teeth its not surprising when you get down to itthey had twice as many men as we did near enough nothing like being proved wrong over and over again to make you think you might have misinterpreted an oracle dagref observed sounding appallingly like his father you had already fulfilled one condition of the verse when rihwin summoned mavrix but the god refused to aid us even so gerin said nodding one piece of the verse still puzzles me though dagref said they snap and float and always trouble what on earth was the farseeing god talking about there gerin looked at van the outlander was looking back at him he couldnt have said which of them started laughing first dagref let out an indignant snort laughing still gerin said that part of the oracular response seemed pretty plain to me even at the time to me too van added well i dont follow it dagref said getting angrier by the moment and furthermore let me tell you no let me tell you the fox broke in youre doing the snapping now you dont float but someone you know does dagref stopped and stared ferdulf and me he said in a voice much smaller than the one he usually used gerin nodded dagrefs eyes got even wider how did the god find a place for ferdulf and me in his prophecy van laughed youre not the most promising material lad but theres no accounting for what a gods liable to do dagref turned his head to give the outlander a dirty look over his shoulder he opened his mouth by the expression on his face gerin knew what he was going to say something along the lines of you may not think im so much but your daughter has different ideas without the least hesitation gerin kicked dagref in the ankle instead of saying what hed been about to say dagref let out a startled yip on this road of all roads gerin said youd better keep your eyes ahead of you and your mind on what youre doingand nowhere else he couldnt have been much less subtle if hed walloped dagref over the head with a branch for a wonder van didnt notice that he was giving a ponderous hint for an even bigger wonder dagref did then a moment later the fox forgot all about the indiscretion from which hed saved dagref through the clop of the horses hooves though the squeak of the axle and the rattle of the wheels of the car he caught the noise of another chariota chariot headed west straight toward him stop the chariot he told dagref and reached over his shoulder for an arrow his hand shook as he set the shaft on his bowstring his heart pounded cold sweat burst out on his forehead after the disaster that had befallen the army of the elabonian empire in this haunted wood who waswho could beriding through it now or was the right question what could be riding through the haunted wood now on came the other chariot steady and confident as if it owned not just the road but the rest of the wood too van muttered something under his breath it wasnt in elabonian it wasnt in any language gerin understood beneath his sunbronzed skin the outlander was pale he didnt know who or what was liable to be in that other car either and he didnt seem to like any of the possibilities that occurred to him dagref clutched the whip till his knuckles whitened is itthe master of this place father he whispered i dont know gerin whispered back i dont know if this place has any one master if it does i dont know if hes the sort of master who rides in a chariot but i think were about to find out around a slight twist in the path came the other car gerin dagref and van all shouted the instant they spotted it the driver of the other team shouted too in horrified surprise so did his passenger who threw his hands in the air bleating i yield spare me by the gods why its only a couple of imperials gerin said in slow wonder did you lugs come into this wood yesterday could they have survived when all their comrades disappeared but both imperials shook their heads by the gods no the passenger said we are not fighting men we are but harmless couriers gerin stared the imperial couriers hed known had been readyforaughts who delivered their messages come what might these fellows were a disgrace to the breedeither that or it had gone badly downhill over the generation during which it hadnt operated north of the high kirs and what message were you delivering to swerilas the slippery he asked when the couriers hesitated before speaking he went on you can tell me now or we can take the message pouch off your body and read whats inside it he aimed his bow at the drivers face which will it be you havent got much time to make up your minds neither courier was armed with anything more than a knife at his belt they must have thought they were traveling through safe country and that swerilas had crushed gerin by now the fox grinned they hadnt known everything there was to know well talk the passenger said at once the driver might have said something different if he hadnt been looking at an arrow from a range almost short enough to make his eyes cross as things were he nodded glumly the passenger went on youll probably like the news anyhow how do we know till we hear gerin didnt lower the bow speak up and the courier did we were sent here to recall both lord swerilas and lord arpulo to duties more urgent than suppressing these semibarbarous northlands all the empires forces are needed in more vital provinces for the sithonians are risen in furious revolt xii back at the encampment west of the haunted wood gerin examined the order the imperial couriers would have given to swerilas the slippery the one of them had summed up that order well enough crebbig i was abandoning the reconquest of the northlands because as he wrote the wicked treacherous underhanded sithonians and their effete and effeminate gods have banded together in a malicious conspiracy to overthrow our rule in sithonia an effrontery we do not propose to and shall not tolerate if ever two men had been bewildered the couriers were they that swerilas opponents had captured them was one thing and quite bad enough that swerilas army had vanished off the face of the earth was something else again and a great deal worse too gerin wasted no time on explanations with them for one thing he was far from certain of explanations himself for another he had matters more urgent to worry about than whether a couple of prisoners were contented do you see he said to rihwin the fox mavrix did have other things on his mind besides the northlands no wonder he didnt feel like helping us and no wonder he didnt thank you for jogging his elbow very well lord king rihwin said seen in retrospect you plainly have the right of it but you could not see in retrospect at the time and neither could i why twit me over it when i was doing the best i could that was such a good question gerin didnt answer it he did ask ferdulf what do you think of your father now i think he is an odious sniveling drunken degenerate who chanced to do you a good turn for reasons that had nothing whatever to do with you but only with his own selfish desires ferdulf answered that was nothing if not forthright it was so forthright in fact that it pitched the fox into a coughing fit oh come now he said when he could speak again ive hardly ever heard mavrix snivel ferdulf pondered that for a few heartbeats when he was done pondering it he laughed one of the few laughs gerin had ever heard from him then he floated away a contented little demigodcontented typically because someone else had just been insulted dagref came up to gerin father between our army and aragis we outnumber the imperials and since arpulo is ordered to withdraw anyhow we can beat him about the head and shoulders while hes going gerin broke in yes i intend to do that if the imperials lose one of their armies here in the northlands and have the other cut to pieces its likely to be a good long while before they poke their noses over the high kirs again regardless of whether they put down the sithonian uprising or not ah thats fine thats very fine dagref looked relieved i was just wondering if with so many things going on so fast that one might have slipped past you im glad it didnt no i managed to keep up there gerin answered havent moved against arpulo yet but i do intend to after that i have two other things on the list and then the gods willing i think we can head back up toward the niffet ah dagref raised an eyebrow and those are his father started ticking them off on his fingers first i need to see how things stand with aragis the archer dont forget we came south to fight a war with him not with the elabonian empire if the imperials have hurt his lands enough itll be a good long while before he can think of tangling with us again too if not well start a new verse of the old song next spring dagref nodded aye i saw that one myself its the only one i saw as a matter of fact whats the other i want to send someone to that village off the elabon way and find out what elise intends to do the fox answered if she wants to go to durens holding ill send her if shes gone there on her own shes liable to be aiming to stir up trouble between your half brother and me do you think she could dagref asked wideeyed hed always been slightly in awe of duren as younger brothers often are of older ones i dont think so gerin answered but i dont know nor do i want to be unpleasantly surprised now that i know where she is i want to keep an eye on her he didnt think elise would like that but he wasnt going to lose much sleep over whether she did or not hed finished his explanation but dagref didnt go away instead the youth took a deep breath and said father i know how i want to use the promise i won from you as we were coming south do you gerin said hoping he was doing a good enough job of disguising apprehension as polite curiosity i do dagref sounded very determined hearing how determined he sounded should have made the fox proud as a matter of fact it did make him proud it also made him more than a little frightened i suppose you intend to tell me he said when his son showed no sign of doing anything of the sort oh yes of course dagref snapped his fingers and looked annoyed at himself thats right you do need to know he took another deep breath maybe he too was less steady than he wanted to seem after letting it out and inhaling again he said when the time comes i want you to speak to van about maeva for me is that all gerin asked now trying to hide surprise dagref nodded the fox set a hand on his shoulder ill do it he took a deep breath of his own id do it anyhow if you like you can have your promise back and save it for something else you want dagref weighed that youve been worried about what id ask for havent you he asked the fox nodded he could hardly do otherwise dagref rubbed his chin on which some of the down was beginning to darken and yet youd let me hold on to the promise and still speak to van i just said so didnt i gerin wondered how much hed regret it but dagref was shaking his head that wouldnt be right i gave it up freely for something that matters to mewell you know how much it matters to me yes i do whether it would matter so much to dagref in half a year or in five years who could tell before the event farseeing biton surely but no one of lesser powers dagref made motions as if to push his father away that wouldnt be right he repeated do what i asked you to do and that will put us at quits no now gerin shook his head that will make us square i dont want the two of us to be at quits thats fair enough father neither do i dagref looked at gerin out of the corner of his eye if i did i could easily have asked for something else he didnt say something more not with maeva on his mind but that was what he meant and gerin knew it so you could gerin admitted what he could scarcely deny since you decided not to can we get on with the business of running the imperials back to their side of the mountains oh i suppose we can dagref said so magnanimous his father felt like kicking him in the teeth then they both laughed why not they were both getting what they wanted arpulo werekas son was still in the process of pulling together the detachments he had on aragis lands when gerin struck him the foxs army drove in a series of arpulos bands and siege parties the last thing arpulo had expected was that swerilas and his whole force would completely disappear from the scene whether he had expected it or not though it had happened his withdrawal became an undignified scamper as arpulo fell back from one keep he had been besieging after another aragis soldiers who had been trapped inside those keeps came forth and joined gerin in pushing the imperials ever farther south they accepted the foxs orders without complaint and obeyed him far more readily than his own troopers often did i know why that is van said with a sly grin theyre still used to the archer whod have their guts for garters if they tried telling him no they dont know how soft you are hmm gerin said how am i supposed to take that he held up a hand never mind i dont really want to know ill just ask you this if im so soft why has no one ever raised a successful revolt in twentyoddand a lot of them were very oddyears nothing hard about that captain the outlander answered whod follow a rebel against you whoever the son of a whore was hed be more trouble than you ever were and so everyones been on your side all along oh indeed the fox replied and that of course is why ive never fought a single solitary war in all the time since i became baron of fox keep well van paused to think at last he said not all your neighbors know you as well as they should thats what it is gerin snorted van was unabashed but then van was usually unabashed the next day arpulos men withdrew from around the castle where aranast aragis son was leading the defenders aranast was glad to be able to come out he was glad to join in helping to chase the imperials out of his fathers dominions he was appalled at the way his fathers vassals obeyed the fox you are not their sovereign lord king he told gerin that evening as the army encamped you have no business requiring them to act as you desire fine gerin said cheerfully in that case you can go back to your keep and stay there too that is not what i meant had aranasts back got any stiffer he would have turned to stone these men are vassals to my father king aragis the archer it is fitting and proper for your own vassals to grant you all due obedience it is neither fitting nor proper for the vassals of another sovereign to grant you the aforesaid obedience nor for you to claim it gerin felt like marching around behind aranast and giving him a boot in the arse that being a likelier avenue to admit sense than his ears regretfully abandoning the idea the fox said when we were campaigning against the imperials before i acknowledged your father as the overall commander i wasnt his vassal when i did it the world didnt end it wont end now either if his men obey me for a while my father will not approve aranast said if he has any sense he will gerin replied i dont know how much that proves i will admit besides your father is still besieged down therehe pointed southand so they cant very well obey him for the time being do please remember im the one who got rid of swerilas the slippery and won my half of the war i did that before the imperials retreated before they knew they were even supposed to retreat what did your father do locked himself up in a keep thats what thats unfair aranast said he was heavily beset and facing the larger half of the imperial armyagainst which he struck some strong blows good for him gerin said i have no complaint about anything he did no i take that backfor him to send you to tell me not to presume to forage off the countryside struck me as excessive and does to this day when he comes out of his castle hes welcome to take his men back for all of me in the meanwhile i intend to get some use out of them aranast sputtered and fumed he remonstrated with some of his fathers vassals gerin the fox has a higher rank than yours prince aranast one of them told him if you expect us to obey you shouldnt you also expect us to obey him that made aragis son sputter and fume even more but he gave the noble no answer the imperials had trampled down a good many fields of wheat and barley in aragis dominions and stolen a lot of livestock now that they were withdrawing from the northlands they set fires in the fields behind them both to hamper gerins pursuit and to leave aragis vassals and serfs as hungry and weak as they could aranast cursed arpulo with bitter hatred so did aragis retainers who rode with the fox so did gerin arpulo was conducting a coldbloodedly vicious retreat doing as much harm as he could before he finally went south over the high kirs but only the foxs long experience as a ruler a man whose every action was on display before his fellows let his curses sound sincere inwardly he was something less than downhearted at seeing how much aragis would have to do in the lands he already ruled before he could contemplate going to war against anyone else just before sunset the riders gerin had sent to the village where elise was keeping a tavern caught up with his army you havent got her with you gerin noted did she refuse to come no lord king one of them answered she wasnt there gerin scowled where did she go did any of the villagers know did she go south into the empire or north to durens holding no one knew lord king the rider said one day she was there as shed been for the past little while next morning she was gone the villagers made it plain she was not in the habit of telling them what she intended doing before she did it i believe that gerin said she was never in the habit of telling anyone what she intended doing before she did it he paced back and forth discontented with the world hed hoped to have an unambiguous answer about the woman hed once loved but the world hadnt been generous enough to give him one for her sake and his own he hoped elise had gone down over the mountains not up to her sons holding not only would the road up to durens be full of refugees and brigands and deserters from aragis army and gerins and the imperials and thus dangerous for her she might make the road dangerous for gerin if she reached the keep and inflamed duren against him gerin wondered again if she could do that in the end he had to shrug and shake his head he simply did not know by that time the next day hed stopped worrying about a woman hed seen for an hour or so over a twentyyear span he had more urgentperhaps not more important but more urgentconcerns his army came up to the keep in which aragis the archer had been besieged aragis proved not to be in the castle oh no lord king said the steward a pudgy fellow named wellas therthas son he went south in pursuit of arpulo when the imperials broke off their encirclement yesterday sounds like him gerin agreed he eyed wellas you could have stayed besieged a lot longer before they starved you out couldnt you oh aye lord king wellas answered but how could you have known that to bring it out so sure and certain he eyed the fox too with a mixture of respect and wonder call it a good guess if you like gerin said if wellas was still plump after a good many days shut away from the outside the siege couldnt have caused the defenders too much in the way of hardship gerin didnt want to come right out and say that though having no reason to hurt the stewards feelings the fox rode after his fellow king wellas thoughtfully helped supply the army with journeybread sausage and smoked meat from the castle storerooms proving the keep had indeed been far from running out of supplies gerin was quickly glad to have the extra food the imperials had set more fires behind their line of march and he could have done little in the way of foraging for that very reason he met aragis coming back up the elabon way the archer looked disgusted good to see you fox he growled though good was not a word that would have fit his humor we can do this better together than i could by myselfi havent the men for a proper pursuit and i just went after that bastard of an arpulo as soon as he pulled out didnt realize hed burn everything behind him as he went his lean facenot much leaner than when gerin had seen him lastwas streaked with soot and smoke he does seem to be doing that gerin said nodding a farewell present since he cant stay you might say so i gather aragis looked more disgusted than ever ive been penned up in there away from everything that looks like news what in the five hells happened did crebbig i his ever so illustrious majesty have the generosity to drop dead no such luck im afraid gerin answered the sithonians are revolting again and hes called his men back over the mountains ah is that what it is so well be rid of swerilas as well as arpulo eh aragis nodded too i wont miss either of them a bit and thats the truth his gaze suddenly sharpened what are you doing here fox i mean here in particular why arent you chasing swerilas men instead of arpulos for that matter where are swerilas men why didnt they come down and join their friends they were chasing me gerin answered they tried chasing me through the wood west of bitons shrine in the valley of ikos do you know that wood aragis eyes widened in his filthy face gerin took that for agreement he went on they rode into the wood they didnt ride out he explained the oracular response hed had from bitons sibyl and how he interpreted it bronze and wood aragis repeated i would have taken that to mean swords and chariots or maybe spearheads and spearshafts that the wood might be a wood i doubt id have thought of that i almost didnt either gerin said even when i did think of it i was a long way from sure i was rightbut i was in so much trouble i had nothing to lose by finding out aragis pointed at him did i not say that when the time came you would have some sorcery ready to wreck the foe you said it gerin agreed that you said it doesnt make it true rihwin summoned mavrix except that mavrix didnt feel like being summoned biton gave his oracular responseall i did was hear it when dagref and ferdulf went off to see swerilas i didnt know anything about it if i had known anything about it i would have stopped it if i could i dont know exactly what happened in the haunted wood and i dont think i ever will know by the gods i dont think i want to know either the only thing i did in all of that was ask biton for the oracular response and i didnt know what id get when i did everything you say is truetaken one thing at a time aragis let out a long angry breath but its only true taken one thing at a time put it all together and you were at the center of it the way a spider sits at the center of its web tell me that when rihwin summoned mavrix you werent hoping he would fail go ahead and tell mei want to see how good a liar you are not good enough evidently gerin said if you already know the answers why ask the questions because i wanted to find out if what i thought was true that you were in the middle taking advantage of everything that happened around you he glared at the fox like an angry wolf and you were and i curse you for it calmly gerin folded his arms across his chest i havent taken advantage of every tiny thing that happens around me i hope i am on my way toward doing that though in aid of which shall we discuss the matter of suzerainty over the holding of balser debos son aragis looked around had more of his men been close by than gerins the fox thought he would have ordered them to attack on the instant but more of gerins troopers stood near the two kings and they looked alert aragis earlier glare had been mild to the point of benignity compared to the one he gave gerin now you see what the imperials have done to my lands the archer ground out yes i see that gerin said you see theyve hurt my fighting force worse than yours aragis persisted yes i see that too gerin said nodding and so because i am weakened you think to gain at my expense aragis said of course i do gerin said im not gaining anything i didnt think was rightfully mine beforehand though how hard would you have squeezed me if things were the other way round you know the answer to that as well as i do youd take as much as you could get away with ive said it before aragis unless you make yourself so youre not my enemy youve spend twenty years not believing me will you believe me now because i am hurt here you think to drop the hammer on me aragis said as if the fox had not spoken youre repeating yourself gerin said the words are different the meaning is the same you ought to try listening to me instead if you dont want to listen to me by the gods im tempted to drop the hammer on you just to get you to pay attention for once in your life aragis turned the color of molten copper no one has presumed to speak to me in that fashion for a very long time he growled oh i believe that gerin said youre the sort who hands a fellow his head if he has the nerve to tell you something to your face that will make your vassals shut up around you i must say but itll also make you miss things you ought to hear youre not strong enough to hand me my head if i tell you something to your face so you can bloody well listen to me instead he wondered if he oughtnt to hurt aragis as badly as he could to keep the archer from trying for revenge as soon as he saw the chance the only sure way of doing that though was killing aragis now he didnt have the stomach for it murder was not a political tool he kept in his chest just for a moment aragis hand dropped down toward the hilt of his sword he checked the movement before he touched the hilt like a bear bothered by bees he shook his head slaughtering you might solve the problem but you haventquitedone anything to deserve it he said for which polite qualification i do thank you gerin said i thought about stretching you out bleeding on the ground too he grimaced this being a king is a nasty business sometimes so is being a baron so is anything above being a serf aragis said and being a serf is a nasty business too in a different way its a nasty business all the time with no letup ever if i have a choice between taking orders and giving them i know which ones for me if i had a choice id sooner do neither the fox replied aragis stared at him in blank incomprehension hed been sure aragis would do something like that as the archer himself admitted he liked giving orders with a sigh gerin went on since i dont have a choice id sooner be on the top than on the bottom i wont say different youd better not aragis said and ill tell you one other reason i didnt try to let the air out of you there youd answer to dagref gerin said hed meant it for a joke or mostly for a joke aragis however gave him a very odd look a look as nearly frightened as the fox had ever seen on his face how did you know that aragis whispered how could you know that to you hed be only a youth oh dagref is a youth all right gerin answered but its been a long time since i thought of him as only an anything if i dont strangle him in the next two or three years hell go far that one will he scratched his head did that mean hed made up his mind about the succession maybe he had duren was doing a perfectly fine job as baron of the holding that had been his grandfathers but how much did he look beyond it dagref had a wider view but dagref was also much younger and had never actually ruled a barony or anything else who could tell what hed be like when he was seventeen so maybe gerin hadnt made up his mind about the succession after all maybe back to matters at hand he said as much to himself as to aragis balser debos son wants me as his overlord i have accepted him as my vassal i dont want a war but i was ready to fight to keep that holding as part of my domain before the imperials came and i am still ready so he turned away picked up a long thin broken branch that had fallen out of a load of firewood and used it to draw a circle in the dirt around aragis feet shall we have peace or shall we fight answer me one way or the other before you step out of that circle aragis eyes looked about ready to bug out of his head of all the highhanded he spluttered you have not the right to use me so no one has the right to use me so he started to stride out of the circle but stopped when gerin held up a hand and said i have the right and its one even you understand what is it aragis demanded simpleim stronger than you are gerin answered nowpeace or war if you step out of the circle without naming one or the other we shall have war right now i promise to some degree he was running a bluff he was far from sure that if he suddenly shouted for his men to attack the archers they would obey him but he was also far from sure how many of aragis men would fight hard for their overlord aragis must have been making the same calculations and coming up with answers not far removed from his own you are an arrogant son of a whore he ground out to which the fox bowed as at a compliment may you toast your toes in the hottest of the five hells forever gerin bowed again aragis bared his teeth in another wolfs smile before going on but you are stronger than i am curse you take the holding of balser debos son keep it i hope you choke on it but i will not fight you for it he stepped out of the circle gerin wondered if he was lying if he was he would be made to pay for it that was all he had done as the fox required trying to hold him to moreeven trying to get an oath from himwould be too much in the way of arrogance weve beaten the imperials gerin said now if the time does come we can settle things that have to do with the northlands between ourselvesand if the empire puts down the revolt in sithonia and decides to have another go at us we can still fight side by side remember i am not taking anything that was yours you werent balsers suzerain you wanted him to become your vassal aye but he never did hmp if aragis was mollified he wasnt about to let gerin know it had the sandal been on the other foot gerin wouldnt have let him know it either but the archer had got a better deal from him than he would have got from from the elabonian empire and he had to know as much if crebbig i sent another army north the archer was unlikely to be inclined to throw in with it we arent friendsweve never been friends gerin said but weve had our borders march for a lot of years without going to war against each other and thats something a good many friends cant say id sooner see it go on than end hmp aragis said again he turned and walked away hed said he wouldnt fight the fox over balsers holding if he meant that everything would be fine if he didnt gerin sighed if he didnt there would be another war that was all another war gerin was mildly amazed at how little the prospect bothered him after so many wars what would one more be and maybe aragis would live up to his word after all stranger things had happened not many gerin muttered but a few they really have he might even have meant it he hoped with all his heart that he did mean it as gerins men began pulling back from the lands over which aragis the archer ruled as king aragis said not another word about his foraging on the countryside gerin took that for a good sign he did not take the state of the countryside for a good sign aragis and his vassals were going to have a hungry time of it over the winter maybe that would leave the archer too weak to fight come spring maybe on the other hand it would leave him with no choice but to fight come spring how will you know father dagref asked oh its a simple enough business the fox answered if he attacks me he does if he doesnt he doesnt thats all yes that is simple dagref agreed but what i meant was how will you know beforehand if he does choose to attack me i may not know beforehand gerin said i may get signs beforehand that tell me he isnt going to war though if his harvest is as it looks now his serfs are liable to rise against him if they do hell be too busy dealing with them to worry about me ill say he will van put in hes been grinding his peasants faces in the dirt for a long time if they rise up theyll try to pay him back all at once some of his vassals may decide to rise against him too gerin went on hes a demon of a warlord but thats not all that goes into the mix for making a good king maybe some of his barons will decide as much anyhow maybe youll help some of them decide as much dagref said hmm maybe i will if i can do it so that aragis doesnt figure out im doing it gerin said he thumped his son on the back one fine day youre going to make all your neighbors whoever they may be very uncomfortable he was liable to make all his friends very uncomfortable too but that was another matter gerin sent riders north to duren not only to let him know what had happened in the war against the elabonian empire but also to tell him the fox had met elise that was of course something duren was liable to know already gerin instructed the riders to bring word back to him if elise was at durens keep he wondered what hed do if she was he wondered whether he could do anything if she was he had his doubts balser debos son received him like a hero gerin listened to his new vassals fulsome praise with but half an ear hed heard such praise delivered many times before and heard it done better too as often as not he knew what balser was going to say three sentences before he said it that let his mind dwell on more interesting things there were some chief among them was the way rowitha the serving girl had come out into the courtyard and was staring so intently at dagref dagref might have stared back at rowitha too if maeva hadnt been standing by van only a few feet away as things were dagref alternated between a polite smile and doing his best to pretend rowitha didnt exist that was a tricky bit of juggling a man three times dagrefs age would have had a hard time bringing it off with aplomb he did about as well as could have been expected better than most his age would have done gerin thought because he habitually showed less of what was in his mind than most maeva was watching rowitha too watching her not much liking what she was seeing and liking it less by the moment shed slept out with the rest of the riders when gerins army was on its way south only a couple of people gerin certainly not among them had known what she was then things were different now but maeva couldnt very well keep dagref from going over and talking with rowitha after balser finally finished blathering not without giving more away to van than would have been wise she had to stand and stare and do her best not to fume too openly her best wasnt so good as dagrefs had been rowitha now rowitha didnt have to hold anything back and she didnt she listened to dagrefs lowvoiced explanation or part of it and then hauled off and slapped him a ringing report that made all heads in the courtyard turn his way he stood his cheek turning redactually his whole face turning red but his cheek turning redderwhile she stomped away haw haw haw van boomed well theres something thatll happen to most men a time or twelve before they shovel dirt on em the lad may be starting a little early but then thinking back he may not too maeva by contrast hurried over and put her arm around dagrefs shoulder remembering his promise to his son gerin spoke to van you said youd hoped her eye might fall on dagref if shed stayed back at fox keep maybe its fallen on him anyhow maybe it has van agreed in tones polite but imperfectly delighted he was probably wondering how long ago maevas eye had fallen on dagref and what might have happened since turning a thoughtful frown toward gerin the outlander continued well have to speak of this further when we get back to fox keep i expect i expect we will gerin agreed he also expected he would have to dicker with fand as if in anticipation his head started to ache dagref came over to him the mark of rowithas palm and fingers still printed on his cheek father he said would you mind if i asked you to spend as little time here in balsers holding as you possible can no i wouldnt mind that gerin hid a smile we do have to head north thats good dagref said thats very good he looked around to see if the serving girl had reappeared not spotting her he relaxed a little you know if you ask balser to make sure your lady loveexcuse me your former lady lovedoesnt come inside the castle as long as youre here hell likely find her something else to do gerin said do you think so dagref looked astonished gerin felt pleased with himself though he didnt show it dagref wasnt used to asking special favors just because of who he was then his son went on would you do it for me gerin was less pleased with that if you do it i said he replied youre the one who wants the wench out of your hair when we were here last i didnt do anything to get any wenches into my hair you are the soul of virtue dagref said sourly besides mother would be in your hair if you did anything like that i didnt have anyone special in my life when rowitha and i he coughed a couple of times finishing but i do now you see gerin only shrugged which left his son dissatisfied maybe dagref talked to balser and maybe he didnt in either case maeva ate in the great hall with gerin and van and dagref and rowitha did not make an appearance there dagref did his best to pretend rowitha had never existed maeva by contrast kept looking around for her she still dressed like a warrior with a sword on her belt maybe rowitha had noticed that instead of getting orders from balser gerin did not inquire it was not his business van kept watching maeva watching out for rowitha he kept muttering things that werent quite words and that didnt quite get past his beard and mustaches he was it seemed drawing his own conclusions and not much caring for the pictures they made every now and then he would glance over toward dagref too and then mutter some more this was a match you said you wanted gerin reminded him continuing to keep his promise i think its a good one too for whatever it may be worth to you eh whatever van had been thinking it wasnt about how good a match dagref and maeva might make now very visibly he did he grunted instead of mutteringprogress of a sort at last he came out with real words oh aye fox i dont doubt youre right or i dont doubt it too much anyhow but good match or bad i didnt look for it so bloody soon that i understand neither did i though i might have noticed a sign or two even back at fox keep gerin slapped his friend on the back there isnt one cursed thing in life that doesnt happen too bloody soon especially when it happens to our children van thought that over hed had enough ale to make thinking take a while slowly and deliberately he nodded tell your fancy sithonian philosophers to go on home fox he said once youve said that you dont need to say any more gerin approached durens keep with more than a little apprehension his riders had come back to let him know elise hadnt been there then but he would still have to tell his son by her about their meeting and strife between duren and dagref was one more thing that was liable to come too bloody soon if it ever came that was too bloody soon for him durens vassal barons had been anything but delighted about accepting him as their overlord gerin had wondered if they would see his own preoccupation with the south as an opportunity to rise against his son that hadnt happened everything looked peaceful as he led his army up the elabon way toward durens keep either durens vassals had thought the fox would win and punish them for rebelling against his son or else theyd figured duren could put them down by himself gerin hoped for the latter who comes to the castle of duren ricolfs grandson a sentry shouted as the foxs army drew within hailing distance the question had a certain formal quality to iteither it was gerin or someone was about to lay siege to the keep but duren not owing his father homage and fealty he treated with him as one equal with another i am gerin the fox king of the north returning from my campaign against the elabonian empire gerin answered again as one equal to another congratulations on your victory lord king the sentry said the foxs messengers would have told of that without any orders gerin heard the drawbridge began to lower enter into the keep of duren ricolfs grandson the baron eagerly awaits you sure enough duren stood just inside the wall he looked to be about ready to burst waiting for gerin to dismount from his chariot when the fox and van and dagref did get down duren couldnt at once ask gerin what was so plainly on his mind either he had to go through polite greetings first then those greetings turned more interesting than duren might have thought they would be he gave dagref a long long look as the two of them clasped hands you were on your way to turning into a man when you came down from fox keep now unless im much mistaken youve gone and done it duren sounded almost accusing dagref answered well now ive done more of the things men do than i had then anyhow he looked at his half brother out of the corner of his eye i even picked up an ekename i dont know if it will stick but i dont know that it wont either what is it duren asked warily he used no ekenamestyling himself ricolfs grandson had helped him gain control of the holding formerly his grandfathers dagref the whip dagref was still holding the lash hed used to urge on the horses and with such effect against the imperials he hefted it to show the source of the sobriquet duren looked something less than delighted then he looked astonished for maeva came up and placed herself alongside dagref in a marked manner gerin who had become something of a connoisseur of astonishment and who had seenand causeda great deal of it over the years judged that durens had at least three flavors seeing maeva there at all seeing her there as a warrior and seeing her there so solidly beside dagref when duren turned away from dagref and maeva he spoke plaintively to his father fall out of touch for even a little while and things go all strange by the time you get another look at them even if you dont fall out of touch things have a way of going all strange behind your back gerin answered also more than a little plaintively father you speak nothing but the truth duren said come into my great hallcome into my great hall all of youand have some ale and thenhe looked toward gerinthen i will hear about my mother he spoke the last word slowly and with some hesitation for which the fox could hardly blame him as they were walking into the castle gerin said elise didnt come up here then she told me she might she didnt now durens voice was flat uninflected he went on if she set out this way she never got here do you suppose something happened to her along the way that would be terrible gerin wasnt convinced it would be so terrible as all that but he understood how his son had to feel the idea that something might have happened to elise when she was on her way to see him for the first time since abandoning him as an infant had to eat at duren as consolingly as he could gerin said shes been traveling through the northlands for a lot of years and shes always been able to take care of herself i think its likelier that she went south to visit her kin down in the empire she was talking about that too he did not mention the other possibility that had occurred to him that elise might have suffered misfortune at the hands of the imperial warriors whod come through her village after his own army retreated out of it some soldiers did whatever they pleased in their foes country elise was no longer young and beautiful but she wasnt ancient and ugly either she might not have goneshe might not have had the chance to goanywhere at all perhaps fortunately durens mind was running in a different channel in an indignant voice he said im her kin too thats so gerin agreed but one thing about your mother was always plain as long as i knew herand now too from the little i saw of herand that is that she was going to do what she was going to do and she wasnt about to listen to anyone who tried to tell her anything different what would she say about you it wasnt duren who asked the question but the avidly curious dagref most likely she would say that i never cared what she wanted to do and that i never wanted to do anything interesting myself gerin answered doing his best to be just would she be telling the truth dagref asked well i dont think so the fox said but i dont expect that she thinks im telling the truth about her now either truth is easy enough to find when youre talking about things you can see or count on your fingers it gets a lot harder when youre trying to figure out why people are the way they are and how they truly are half the time they dont know themselves hmm dagref said plainly unconvinced i always know precisely why i do what i do maeva nodded vigorous agreement as much because he was very young as because she was enamored of dagref gerin and van laughed duren looked thoughtful as if wondering which side was right is that so van rumbled dagref nodded he might not always have been right about such things but he was always sure van cocked his head to one side and said then tell me precisely why youve formed an attachment with my daughter he stared down at the foxs son dagref did precisely what gerin could have done in the same circumstances he spluttered and turned red and said nothing intelligible maeva set her hand in his most times that would have steadied him here it only seemed to make matters worse well father how precisely did you beat the imperials duren asked not everything your couriers told me was as clear as it might have been maybe he was helping ease his half brother off the hook in which case he had more charity in him than his father would have had at the same age or maybe having learned everything he couldsurely not close to everything he wantedabout his mother he was just moving along to the larger events that had taken place down toward the high kirs gerin told him the oracular verse the sibyl at bitons temple had delivered how hed interpreted it and the role dagref and ferdulf had played in fulfilling it that made duren give dagref another sharp look dagref looked back with a bland blank expression he might have stolen from gerins face he wasnt immune to discomfiture but he got over it in a hurry getting no satisfaction there duren turned to gerin and said by what i have seen and heard of dagref and what i have seen and heard of ferdulf the two of them must be lively together and so they are gerin agreed theyre pretty bloody lively apart from each other too i can see that duren gave dagref another measuring speculative stare which his half brother returned duren turned back to the fox we need to talk the two of us the three of us dagref corrected gerin shook his head i need to talk to both of you i need to do it with each one separately my minds not made up about any of these things and i dont expect it to be any time soon it should beim your eldest duren said with no small bitterness he went on but im not your son by moby your wife who raised me i can see how that makes a difference less than you think gerin answered selatre has never once pushed me to shove you aside and put him in your place she knows youd do well and i know youd do well come to that im also coming to know dagref would do well too if no one shortens him by a head he would van put in and what will you do duren asked split the kingdom between us i couldnt find a better recipe for civil war if i brought a cook up from the city of elabon gerin said with a shudder remember the barony north of you that used to be bevons and how all his sons squabbled over it for years whatever else i do i aim to make sure that doesnt happen with or to everything ive spent so long building up what does that leave then duren asked what will one of us do if you leave the whole kingdom to the other it could be that youd stay content with this barony if dagref held the kingdom gerin held up a hand before either of his sons could say anything and it could be that dagref might want to study down in the city of elabon while you took on the burdenand it is a burden believe meof ruling that would depend on what the empire decides to do about the northlands of course and theres blestar to figure into all this dagref said hes only a little fellow now but i was only a little fellow when you went off to take over this holding duren id almost forgotten about blestar duren admitted not forgotten he was there but forgotten he could mean something in all this i hadnt gerin said the gods only know now how hell turn out when hes a man though as a boy hes better natured than either of the two of you was not that thats saying much duren and dagref joined in giving their father a dirty look that didnt bother the fox who wanted the half brothers as united as they could be if in annoyance at him fair enough dagref said do you really suppose father that the empire would let me go down to the city of elabon to study before gerin answered that he let his eyes flick to maeva for a moment by her expression she didnt realize she had a rival in learning very possibly a rival more dangerous than any woman no matter how beautiful no matter how passionate gerin smiled a little if she didnt realize it yet she would before too long and dagref had asked a good question the fox gave it the best answer he could if the empire decides to take another shot at conquering us then you wont be able to go south of the high kirs no but the revolt in sithonia and the drubbing the imperials took up here are liable to make them think twice my guess is thats more likely crebbig i may never recognize aragis and me as kings but i dont think hell come up and try to knock us over again either dagref and duren both thought that over duren said what do you expect from aragis after this i hope hell lick his wounds for a while gerin answered he has plenty of them he also has plenty of vassals whove seen me which means theyve seen that a man doesnt have to be a bronzearsed son of a whore to make a proper ruler if some of them rise up or if the serfs on aragis land decide theyve had enough of being squeezed to bits then aragis will find he has the same sorts of troubles as crebbig youd weep and wail over that wouldnt you van said setting a finger by the side of his nose so i would gerin said dryly id weep till my eyes were all red and swollen he let out an exaggerated sob everyone laughed some time later after roasted mutton and freshbaked bread and berry tarts and a good many jacks of ale duren waved for gerin to walk out from the great hall into the court between the outer wall and the castle itself darkness had fallen tiwaz a mediumfat crescent hung low in the southwest ruddy elleb just past first quarter shone in the south pale nothos nearly full climbed above the eastern wall math would not rise for another hour or two duren said i wish youd found out more about my mothereither more or nothing at all i understand gerin said setting a hand on his shoulder but we do what we can do not what we wish we could do i didnt expect to find out anything at all i didnt even know her till she spoke nor she me he started to add maybe shell turn up one day but decided that would do more harm than good duren was no doubt thinking it too but the gulf between thinking something and saying it yawned wide and deep now i wish id come along with you duren said maybe its just as well you werent there weve all changed a good deal these past twenty years last time your mother saw you you were making messes on the floor that was not his principal concern his principal concern was how much damage elise might do if she turned duren against him he still didnt know whether she could but he still didnt want to find out either ive changed duren said my mother must have changed or she wouldnt have gone away from you honh gerin said borrowing the useful notquiteword from van before he could add anything to it duren went on but you father youve hardly changed at all you only say that because youre watching me with a sons eyes gerin answered im like anybody else im soup in a pot and the years boil away more and more of the water so my flavor gets stronger and saltier the same way my beard keeps right on getting grayer the longer you live the more you go about the business of turning into yourself duren didnt fully follow that gerin hadnt expected that he would duren said i suppose ill have to go on as best i can i dont see what else i can do do you father i dont think there is anything else you can do gerin told him nothing useful anyhow pining away over mighthavebeens doesnt help he clicked his tongue between his teeth other thing ill say is youre elises son aye but youre my son too or you wouldnt think that way remember it i always do duren answered not quite for the first time gerin thought that whatever happened to his kingdom hed leave some good behind dagref urged the horses up from a walk to a trot the chariot swung around the curve in the road that brought fox keep into sight its still there and its still mine gerin said a lot of people have tried taking it away from you van said youve made em all sorry they mostly know better now i wish they did gerin said i wish they had for a long time id have lived a more peaceable life if it were so van snorted a wordless expression of his opinion about what a peaceable life was worth gerin ignored him the drawbridge swung down over the ditch around the palisade as soon as the folk inside fox keep recognized gerin and the warriors who still accompanied him those who did not dwell at his keep had already peeled off and headed for their own homes as he had to durens keep hed sent riders ahead to his own so people knew he was returning if not in triumph at least in something close to it men and womenand geroge and tharma with themcame spilling out over the drawbridge van pointed theres fand he said gloomily now im for it shell have to hear about every time i dropped my drawers for some hussy since i rode out of here and shell make me pay for all of em sure enough fand charged out ahead of most of the rest of the people so far ahead that ferdulf feeling mischievous dove on herand just missed spitting himself on a knife she pulled from her belt and thrust at him he darted away shouting abuse fand screeched back but for once after an army returned from campaign she did not screech at van instead she ran toward rihwins riders and screeched at maeva for going off and fighting without letting her know shed done it well isnt this nice van said beaming i come home to peace and quiet at least aimed at me the smile slipped it wont last it cant last it never lastsbut ill enjoy it while it does maeva plainly did not enjoy it mother she said im home safe ive killed a couple of men and im home safe gerin noted she did not mention taking a wound of her own she did not impress fand either och youve killed have you now if that was all you wanted you could have waited till some lustful young spalpeen tried putting his hands where they dont belong then stuck a knife twixt his ribs whilst he was after trying to stick summat else twixt your legs i have no trouble taking care of myself there either maeva answered no one will ever do anything to me that i dont want van rumbled something deep in his chest in front of gerin dagrefs ears turned pink and fand who though hottempered was far from a fool exclaimed and whos been doing things to you that you do want now maeva did not answer not in front of everyone but gerin had no doubt she would before too longand van knew and a good many others who could tell fand maybe she would approve of the match maybe she wouldnt too gerin would find out in due course ride on into the keep he told dagref easier to sort everything out in there than out here aye father dagref said as the chariot made its slow way forward through the crowd he and gerin both waved to selatre and to clotild and blestar as well van waved to kor his son looked furiously jealous of maeva whod had the chance to go out and fight and kill maeva let her hand fall to the hilt of her sword which only infuriated kor even more gerin whod had his older sibling flaunt privileges too knew a certain amount of sympathy for the boy he jumped down from the chariot as it slowed to a halt not too far away fand was still shouting at maeva why couldnt you go saving yourself for a nice lad like that dagref say instead of letting some rough soldier ha his way with you the shame of it now dagref jumped down after gerin as soon as a stable boy had taken charge of the horses well we wont have too much trouble there will we he murmured not if she wishes maeva had saved herself for me i mean theres always going to be trouble with fand gerin answered also quietly the only question is how much by the sound of that there shouldnt be too much of course when she finds out you and maeva are already well something more than friends therell be a row over that too i expect dagref sighed youre probably rightpeople get so excited over these things before gerin could respond to that selatre and clotild flung themselves onto him while blestar was flinging himself onto dagref gerin kissed his wife and daughter blestar didnt want kisses he wanted every single solitary detail of dagrefs adventures he wanted the details on the spot and not even his older brothers astonishingly retentive memory looked likely to be good enough to satisfy him clotild having got her share of kisses and hugs from her father tried to get some from dagref too which put him off his stride in his narration which made blestar shout at clotild gerin laughed its so good to be home he said selatre laughed too then she glanced at him sidelong i hope youll say that tonight and sound more as if you mean it she said adding if we can find somewhere to be alone that is the library gerin whispered in her ear even if ferdulf is liable to fly up and peek through the window and even if dagref is liable to figure out why we keep that rolledup bolt of cloth in there but the library even so yes indeed he slipped his arm around her waist she molded herself to him dagref will figure that out will he selatre asked gerin nodded his wife clicked her tongue between her teeth time does go on doesnt it doesnt it though gerin said he hesitated then spoke of something he had not entrusted to the riders whod come up to fox keep ahead of him i was passing through a village down in the land aragis rules and i happened to run into elise there just for a heartbeat the name did not register with selatre it was not one the fox had been in the habit of using often then it did and her eyes widened durens mother she said in a voice that showed nothing whatever aye durens mother gerin said i dont know where she is now or what shes doing he explained how hed told elise of ricolfs passing how shed spoken of going south over the high kirs and how she had not come back to the barony that had been her fathers and now was her sons and if you think im sorry that she hasnt youre very much mistaken no i dont think that selatre still held her voice under tight restraint that restraint was revealing in itself after a little while she said i never thought you would see her again neither did i gerin answered and i would have been just as well pleased if i hadnt believe me something in selatre eased the fox hadnt noticed how tensely she was holding herselfalmost like a bow strung and drawntill she stopped doing it she said im sorry but i cant help worrying about these things you did find her before you found me after all his hand still rested on the curve of her hip he squeezed just for a moment and do you want to know what she taught me he asked selatres nod was wary he said she taught me to know when i was well off because she gave me a standard of comparison you might say selatre thought about that for a moment then threw her arms around his neck after she finished kissing him she said you just made me want to drag you up to the library right now why gerin asked innocently did you come up with a new codex while i was away on campaign selatre snorted and planted an elbow in his ribs when you choose you can be most absurd she said best of all and one of the many reasons he was so fond of her was that she made it sound like a compliment how have things been while i was gone on the whole very well selatre answered the weather has been good and the harvest looks promising she and gerin both glanced toward the west the gradi still had their foothold in the northlands out where the niffet flowed into the orynian ocean but theyd stayed quiet since their gods got embroiled with baivers and the gods of the monsters who dwelt in some of the caves below bitons shrine if that fight ever ended the gods of the gradi and the gradi themselves might prove troublesome again it hadnt happened yet though with luck it wouldnt happen for many years to come on the whole you say gerin knew when his wife had things to add even if she tried to paint as bright a picture as she could she nodded now yes on the whole the one worrisome thing i can think of is that if tharma isnt carrying pupsand i dont think she is right nowits not from lack of effort if you understand what im saying gerin sighed loud and long well weve been waiting for that to happen for quite a while so i cant say im surprised the gods only know what ill do about it if she does bear pups or cubs or babies or whatever you want to call them but i cant say im surprised the gods who may know best what you should do if tharma gives birth are busy fighting the gradi gods selatre said oh the monsters gods gerin said and his wife nodded he went on i was thinking of them in a different connection a moment ago i suppose youre right and for that matter maevas luckyor careful onenot to be coming home great with child herself selatres eyes widened you mean fand wasnt just shouting to hear herself shout the way she does so often not this time the fox answered he hesitated then spoke one word more dagref selatres eyes got wider still but hes not old enough shes not old enough either come to that then she counted on her fingers and frowned time does run away doesnt it they could i suppose but i wish they wouldnt so do i gerin said outside of wishing though i havent the faintest idea what to do about it but let it run its course and see what comes of that van and fand both seem to think a match between the two of them would be good and i dont mind one either how about you if its what they want i dont mind his wife said i wouldnt want it right away though they arent old enough to know their own minds lets see what they think two or three years from now that sounds good to me gerin agreed my guess is van and fand wont mind either whether dagref and maeva will put up with waiting two or three more years though is another question if they stay attached to each other theyll just get more attached if you know what i mean i suppose so selatre said when i was their age though i was waiting for the old sibyl to die i was to be a maiden and had no chance to form an attachment to any male she took his arm in hers so that his also brushed against the side of her breast ive made up for it since thats good gerin let it go there he couldnt say he wondered if he would be around in two or three more years because saying as much would bring up the question of the succession and the succession was the one thing hed ever found that he did not care to discuss with selatre no shed never urged him to name dagref over duren he didnt think she would urge him to do that but he didnt want to set temptation in front of her either if dagref kept growing as well as he had latelyand if no one hit him over the head with a rock for being so maddeningly right all the timethe decision might shape itself if dagref made everyone want to hit him over the head with a rock even if no one did the decision would shape itself too the other way if neither of those things happened gerin would have to shape things himself he shook his head he would have to try to shape things himself whatever choice he made by the very nature of things he wouldnt be around to enforce it that would be up to his sons and to selatre if she outlived him and to all his vassals many of them these days the sons of the men whod first given him homage and fealty some the grandsons no matter how long you last he murmured far more to himself than to selatre sooner or later things fall from your hands his wife thought along with him as she often did they dont fall and break though someone catches them and carries on you did when the trokmoi killed your father and your brother she said no more than that she didnt suggest that someone would catch the affairs of gerins kingdom when they did fall from his hands suggesting such a thing was as much as implying that someone should be dagref gerin thought about duren competently running his barony about dagref fighting well and also falling in what might be love with maeva youre right he said one way or another things do go on pretty soon theyll be in someone elses hands not pretty soon i hope and whosever hands theyre in your mark will be on them selatre said he considered that then slowly nodded i suppose it will i helped keep the trokmoi from overrunning all the northlandsand the ones who did settle south of the niffet are mostly my vassals these days i kept the monsters from breaking out too all except geroge and tharma anyhow if i didnt drive the gradi from the northlands i pinned them back against the ocean and i could be wrong but i dont think the elabonian empire will trouble us again any time soon the gods know i havent been perfect but ive done pretty well when you think how things can go for a man ill take that he nodded once more aye ill take that
