jonathan kellerman the conspiracy club to the memory of my father david kellerman raging emotions dead tissue polar opposites was the way jeremy carrier had always seen it in a hospital setting no two disciplines were less connected than psychology and pathology as a practitioner of the former jeremy prided himself on an open mind a good psychotherapist worked hard at avoiding stereotypes but during all his years of training and clinical work at city central hospital jeremy had met few pathologists who didnt fit a mold withdrawn mumbly types more comfortable with gobbets of necrosed flesh the abstract expressionism of cell smears and the coldstorage ambience of the basement morgue than with living breathing patients and his fellow psychologists psychiatrists and all the other soldiers of the mental health army were more often than not overly delicate souls repelled by the sight of blood not that jeremy had actually known any pathologists even after a decade of passing them in the hallways the social structure of the hospital had regressed to high school sensibilities usthem as religion a lusty proliferation of castes cliques and cabals endless jockeying for power and turf adding to that was the endmeans inversion that captures every bureaucracy the hospital had devolved from a healing place needing funds to treat patients to a largescale municipal employer requiring patient fees to meet its staff payroll all that created a certain asocial flavor a confederacy of isolates at city central like was attracted to like and only the lastditch necessities of patient care led to crosspollination internists finally admitting defeat and calling in surgeons generalists taking deep breaths before plunging into the morass of consultation what reason could there be for a pathologist to contact a psychologist because of all that and because lifes hellish wristflick had turned jeremy carrier into a tormented distracted young man he was caught offbalance by arthur chesss overture perhaps jeremys distractibility formed the basis for all that followed for nearly a year jeremy had seen arthur once a week but the two men had never exchanged a word yet here was arthur settling down opposite jeremy in the doctors dining room and asking if jeremy cared for company it was just before pm an offhour for lunch and the room was nearly empty jeremy said sure then realized he was anything but arthur nodded and settled his big frame into a small chair his tray bore two helpings of fried chicken a hillock of mashed potatoes glazed with gravy a perfect square of corn bread a small bowl of succotash and a sweating can of cocacola staring at the food jeremy wondered southern roots he tried to recall if arthurs voice had ever betrayed southern inflections didnt think so if anything the old mans baritone was flavored by new england arthur chess showed no immediate interest in conversation spreading a napkin on his lap he began shearing through the first piece of chicken he cut quickly and gracefully using long fingers tipped by broad nails stubbed short his long white lab coat was snowyclean but for a disturbing spatter of pinkish stains on the right sleeve the shirt beneath the coat was a blue pinpoint oxford spreadcollar arthurs magenta bow tie hung askew in a way that suggested intention jeremy figured the pathologist for at least sixtyfive maybe older but arthurs pink skin glowed with health a neat white mustachless beard which gave insight into what lincoln s wouldve looked like had honest abe been allowed to grow old fringed arthurs long face his bald head was lunar and imposing under cruel hospital lighting jeremy knew of arthurs reputation the way one is aware of a strangers biography once head of pathology professor chess had stepped down from administrative duties a few years ago to concentrate on scholarship something to do with softtissue sarcomas the minutiae of cellwall permeability or whatnot arthur also had a reputation as a world traveler and an amateur lepidopterist his treatise on the carrioneating butterflies of australia had been featured in the hospital gift shop alongside the usual paperback diversions jeremy had noticed the single stack of drylooking dirt brown volumes because they drabbed in comparison with the jackets of lurid bestsellers the brown stack never seemed to reduce why would a patient want to read about bugs that ate corpses arthur ate three bites of chicken and put down his fork i really do hope this isnt an intrusion dr carrier not at all dr chess is there something you need need arthur was amused no just seeking a bit of social discourse ive noticed that you tend to dine alone my schedule lied jeremy unpredictable since his life had gone to hell hed been avoiding social discourse with anyone but patients hed gotten to the point where he could fake friendly but sometimes on the darkest of days any human contact was painful lifes little wristflick of course said chess given the nature of your work that would have to be the case sir said jeremy the unpredictability of human emotions thats true arthur nodded gravely as if the two of them had reached a momentous agreement a moment later he said jeremy may i call you jeremy jeremy i noticed you werent at our little tuesday gettogether this week a situation came up said jeremy feeling like a child caught playing hookey he forced a smile unpredictable emotions something that resolved well i hope jeremy nodded anything new come up at tb two new diagnoses an adenosarcoma and a cml typical presentations the usual spirited discussion to be honest you didnt miss a thing our little tuesday gettogether was tumor board a weekly ritual to am in the larger conference room arthur chess presiding over a confab of oncologists radiotherapists surgeons nurse specialists commanding the slide projector wielding a light wand and his voluminous memory for nearly a year jeremy had been the mental health armys representative in all that time hed spoken up once hed attended his first tumor board years before as an intern finding the experience an ironic grotesquerie slides of tumorravaged cells clickclicked on a giant screen the images obscured by nicotine haze at least a third of the cancer doctors and nurses were puffing away jeremys supervisor at the time an astonishingly pompous psychoanalyst had wielded a meerschaum pipe of freudian proportions and blown latakia fumes in jeremys face arthur had been running things back then too and hed looked much the same jeremy realized the chief pathologist hadnt smoked but neither had he objected a few months later a wealthy benefactor touring the hospital poked her head in and gasped soon after the hospital passed a nosmoking rule and the mood at subsequent tumor boards grew testy arthur sectioned a tiny square of corn bread from the host slab and chewed thoughtfully no loss for you jeremy but i do believe that your presence contributes really even if you dont say much the fact that youre there keeps the rest of us on our toes sensitivitywise well said jeremy wondering why the old man was bullshitting him so shamelessly anything that helps sensitivity the time you did speak up said arthur taught us all a lesson jeremy felt his face go hot i felt it was relevant oh it was jeremy not everyone saw it that way but it was the time he spoke up had been six weeks ago arthur flashing slides of a metastasized stomach carcinoma on the big screen defining the tumors in the precise latin poetry of histology the patient a fiftyeightyearold woman named anna duran had been referred to jeremy because of unresponsive demeanor jeremy found her initially sullen rather than try to draw her out he refilled her empty cup with tea got himself coffee plumped her pillows then sat down by her bedside and waited not caring much if she responded or not it had been that way since jocelyn he didnt even try anymore and the funny thing was patients reacted to his apathy by opening up more quickly grief had made him a more effective therapist jeremy flabbergasted gave the matter some thought and decided patients probably perceived his blank face and statue posture as some sort of immutable zenlike calm if only they knew by the time she finished her tea anna duran was ready to talk which is why jeremy was forced to speak up twenty minutes into a contentious exchange between mrs durans attending oncologist and the treating radiotherapist both specialists were voluble men wellintentioned dedicated to their craft but overly focused babybathwatertossers complicating matters further neither cared for the other that morning theyd slipped into an increasingly heated debate on treatment sequence that left the rest of the attendees peeking at their watches jeremy had resolved to stay out of it tuesday mornings were an annoyance his turn the result of a mandatory rotation that placed him in tooclose proximity to death but that morning something propelled him to his feet the sudden motion fixed fifty pairs of eyes upon him the oncologist had just completed a pronouncement the radiotherapist about to embark on a response was deterred by the look on jeremys face arthur chess rolled the light wand between his hands yes dr carrier jeremy faced the sparring physicians gentlemen your debate may be justified on medical grounds but youre wasting your time mrs duran wont agree to any form of treatment silence metastasized the oncologist said and why is that doctor she doesnt trust anyone here said jeremy she was operated on six years ago emergency appendectomy with postop sepsis shes convinced thats what gave her stomach cancer her plan is to discharge herself and to seek out a local faith healer a curandero the oncologists eyes hardened is that so doctor im afraid so doctor quaint and charmingly idiotic why wasnt i informed of this you just were said jeremy she told me yesterday i left a message at your office the oncologists shoulders dropped well then i suggest you return to her bedside and convince her of the error of her ways not my job said jeremy she needs guidance from you but frankly i dont think theres anything anyone can say oh really the oncologists smile was acrid shes ready to see her witch doctor then curl up and die she believes treatment made her sick and that more will kill her its a stomach carcinoma what are we really offering her no answer everyone in the room knew the stats stomach cancer so advanced was no grounds for optimism calming her downs not your job dr carrier said the oncologist what exactly is your job vis à vis tumor board good question said jeremy and he left the room hed expected a summons to the chief psychiatrists office for a reprimand and a transfer off the board none came and when he showed up next tuesday he was met with what seemed to be respectful looks and nods drop your interest in patients and patients talk to you more readily mouth off at the honchos and gain collegial esteem irony stank from that point on jeremy found excuses for missing the meeting the thing is said arthur we cellular types get so immersed in details that we forget theres a person involved in your case theres no longer a person involved jeremy said dr chess i just did my job im really not comfortable being thought of as an arbiter of anything now if youll excuse me of course said arthur unperturbed as jeremy bussed his tray and left the dining room mumbling something jeremy couldnt make out later much later jeremy was fairly certain hed decoded arthurs parting words until the next time the way jocelyn had died the image of her suffering was plaque on jeremys brain he was never allowed to read the police report but hed seen the look in the detectives eyes overheard their hallway conferences sexual psychopath sadistic one for the record book bob their eyes to do that to a detectives eyes jocelyn banks had been twentyseven tiny curvy bubbly talkative blond a blueeyed pixie a source of great comfort for the senescent patients she chose to care for ward e all ye who enter here abandon all reason advanced alzheimers arthrosclerotic senility a host of dementias undiagnosed rot of the soul the vegetable garden the neurologists called it sensitive bunch the neurologists jocelyn worked the to pm shift tending to vacant eyes slack mouths and droolcoated chins cheerful always cheerful calling her patients honey and sweetie and handsome talking to those who never answered jeremy met her when he was called up to e for a consult on a new alzheimers patient and couldnt find the chart the ward clerk was surly and intent on not helping jocelyn stepped in and he realized this was the cute little blonde hed noticed in the cafeteria thatfacethoselegsthatrear when he completed the consult he went looking for her found her in the nurses lounge and asked her out that night her mouth was open for his kisses breath sweet though theyd eaten garlicky italian food later jeremy was to know that sweetness as an internal perfume they dated for nine weeks before jocelyn moved into jeremys lonely little house three months after that on a moonless monday just after jocelyn ended her shift someone carjacked her toyota in or near the toodark auxiliary nurses parking lot half a block from the hospital taking jocelyn with him her body was found four days later under a bridge in the shallows a borderline district within walking distance of the citys cruelest streets a place of thriving businesses during the day but deserted at night on the periphery were derelict buildings and ragged fencing stray cats and long shadows and that was where the killer had dumped jocelyns body shed been strangled and slashed and wedged behind an empty oil drum that much the detectives revealed to jeremy by that time the papers had reported those bare facts a pair of detectives had worked the case doresh and hoker both beefy men in their forties with drab wardrobes and drinkers complexions bob and steve doresh had dark wavy hair and a chin cleft deep enough to harbor a cigarette butt hoker was fairer with a pig snout for a nose and a mouth so stingy jeremy wondered how he ate big and lumbering both of them but sharpeyed from the outset they treated jeremy like a suspect the night jocelyn disappeared hed left the hospital at sixthirty gone home read and listened to music and fixed dinner and waited for her the hedges that sided his tiny front lawn prevented his neighbors from knowing what time hed arrived or left the block was mostly renters anyway people who came and went barely furnishing the uninviting bungalows never taking the time to be neighborly the late supper hed prepared for two proved scant reassurance to detectives bob doresh and steve hoker and in fact fed their suspicions for at am well after verifying that jocelyn hadnt taken on an emergency double shift and shortly after phoning a missing persons report to the police jeremy had placed the uneaten pasta and salad in the refrigerator cleared the place settings washed the dishes keeping busy to quell his anxiety but to the detectives such fastidiousness was out of character for a worried lover whose girl hadnt come home unless of course said lover knew all along it went on that way for a while the two buffaloes alternating between patronizing and browbeating jeremy whatever background check they did on him revealed nothing nasty and a dna swab of his cheek failed to match whatever they were trying to match his questions were answered by knowing looks they spoke to him several times in his office at the hospital at his house in an interrogation room that reeked of gym locker was there tissue under her nails he said more to himself than to the detectives bob doresh said why would you ask that doctor jocelyn would resist if she had a chance would she said hoker leaning across the green metal table she was extremely gentle as ive told you but shed fight to defend herself a fighter huh would she go easily with a stranger just go off with someone anger seared jeremys chest muscles his eyes clenched and he gripped the table hoker sat back doctor youre saying thats what happened hoker smiled jeremy said youre blaming her hoker looked over at his partner his snout twitched and he looked satisfied you can go now doctor eventually they left him alone but the damage was done jocelyns family had flown in both her parents and a sister they shunned him he was never informed of the funeral he tried to keep up with the investigation but his calls to the detective squad were intercepted by a desk officer not in ill give em yer message a month passed three six jocelyns killer was never found jeremy walked and talked wounded his life shriveled to something sere and brittle he ate without tasting voided without relief breathed city air and coughed drove out to the flatlands or the waters edge and was still unable to nourish his lungs people the sudden appearance of strangers alarmed him human contact repulsed him the division between sleep and awareness became arbitrary deceitful when he talked he heard his own voice bounce back to him hollow echoing tremulous acne the pustulant plague forgotten since adolescence broke out on his back and shoulders his eyelids ticced and sometimes he was convinced that a bitter reek was oozing from his pores no one seemed repulsed though too bad he couldve used the solitude throughout it all he kept seeing patients smiling comforting holding hands conferring with physicians charting as he always did in a hurried scrawl that made the nurses giggle one time he overheard a patient a woman hed helped get through a bilateral mastectomy talking to her daughter in the hallway thats dr carrier hes the sweetest man the most wonderful man he made it to the nearest mens room threw up cleaned himself off and went to see his next appointment six months later he felt above it all below it all inhabiting a strangers skin wondering what it would be like to degenerate after the chat in the dining room jeremy braced himself for some sign of familiarity from arthur chess at the next tumor board but the pathologist favored him with a passing glance nothing more when the meeting ended arthur made no further attempt to socialize and jeremy wrote off the encounter as a bit of impulse on the older mans part on a frigid autumn day he left the hospital at lunchtime and walked to a used bookstore two blocks away the shop was a dim narrow place on a grimy block filled with liquor stores thrift outlets and vacancies a strange block sometimes jeremys nose picked up the sweetness of fresh bread but no bakeries were in sight other times hed smell sulfurous ash and industrial waste and find no source of those odors either he was beginning to doubt his own senses the bookstore was filled with raw pine cases and smelled of old newsprint jeremy had frequented its corners and shadows in the past searching out the vintage psychology books he collected bargains abounded few people seemed interested in first edition skinners maslows jungs since jocelyns death he hadnt been back to the store perhaps now was the time to return to routine such as it was the shops windows were black and no signage identified the business inside once you entered the world was gone and you were free to concentrate an effective ruse but it also had the effect of discouraging venture rarely had jeremy seen other customers maybe that was the way the proprietor wanted it he was a fat man who rang up purchases with a scowl never spoke seemed pointedly misanthropic jeremy wasnt certain if his mutism was elective or the result of some defect but he was certain the man wasnt deaf on the contrary the slightest noise perked the fat mans ears customer inquiries however elicited an impatient finger point at the printed guide posted near the shops entrance a barely decipherable improvisation upon the dewey decimal system those who couldnt figure it out were out of luck this afternoon the bearish mute sat behind his cash register reading a tattered copy of sir edward lyttons eugene aram jeremys entrance merited a shift of haunches and the merest quiver of eyebrow jeremy proceeded to the psychology section and searched book spines for treasures nothing the sagging shelves bore the same volumes hed seen months ago every book it appeared remained in place as if the section had been reserved for jeremy as usual the shop was empty but for jeremy how did the mute make a living perhaps he didnt as jeremy continued browsing he found himself fantasizing about sources of independent income for the fat man a range of possibilities from the loftiest inheritance to the monthly disability check or perhaps the store was a front for drugdealing moneylaundering white slavery international intrigue perhaps piracy on the high seas was hatched here among the dusty bindings jeremy indulged himself with thoughts of unimaginable felonies that led him to a bad place and he cursed his idiocy a throat clear stopped him short he stepped out of psychology and sighted down the next aisle another customer stood there a man his back to jeremy unmindful of jeremy a tall bald man in a wellcut outoffashion tweed suit white fringes of beard floated into view as a pink skull turned to inspect a shelf the mans profile was revealed as he made a selection and extricated a tome arthur chess was this the lepidoptery section jeremy had never studied the fat mans guide had never been interested in expanding funnel vision sometimes it helped keep life manageable he watched arthur open the book lick his thumb turn a page arthur kept his head down began walking up the aisle as he read reversing direction head still down coming straight at jeremy to greet the pathologist would open the wormcan of obligatory conversation if jeremy left now quickly stealthily perhaps the old man wouldnt notice but if he did notice jeremy would earn the worst of both worlds forced to socialize and robbed of browsing time he decided to greet arthur hoping that the pathologist would be so engrossed in his butterfly book that the ensuing chat would be brief arthur gazed up before jeremy reached him the book in his arms was huge bound in cracked camel leather no winged creatures graced the densely printed pages jeremy read the title crimean battle strategy a compendium the tag on the nearest shelf said military history arthur smiled jeremy afternoon arthur no lunch today large breakfast said the pathologist patting his vest busy afternoon a bit of diversion seemed in order with what you do all day its a wonder you ever have an appetite lovely place this said the old man do you come here often from time to time mr renfrews quite the crosspatch but he leaves one alone and his prices are more than fair for all his purchases jeremy had never learned the proprietors name had never cared arthur had obtained the information because like most gregarious people he was excessively curious yet for all his sociability the old man had chosen to work among the dead jeremy said very fair prices nice seeing you arthur happy hunting he turned to leave would you have time for a drink said arthur alcoholic or otherwise sorry said jeremy tapping the coat cuff that concealed his wristwatch busy afternoon as well his next patient was in an hour and a half ah of course sorry then another time absolutely said jeremy later that evening walking to his car he noticed arthur in the doctors parking lot this is too much im being stalked but as with the bookstore encounter arthur had arrived first so that was ridiculous jeremy chided himself for selfimportance paranoias first cousin had he slipped that far he ducked behind a pylon and watched arthur unlock his car a black lincoln at least fifteen years old glossy paint shiny chrome kept up nicely like arthurs suit well used but quality jeremy envisioned arthurs home guessed the pathologist would inhabit one of the gracious old homes in queens arms on the north side a shabbyelegant stretch with harbor views yes qa was definitely arthur the house would be a victorian or a neogeorgian fusty and comfortable chocked with overstuffed sofas in faded fabrics stolid centenarian mahogany furniture layers of antimacassars doilies gimcracks a nice wet bar stocked with premium liquors pinned butterflies in ornate frames was the pathologist married had to be all that cheer bespoke a comfortable comforting routine definitely married jeremy decided happily for decades he conjured a softbusted birdvoiced bluehaired wife to dote on dear arthur he watched as the old man lowered his long frame into the lincoln when the big sedan started up with a sonorous rumble jeremy hurried to his own dusty nova he sat behind the wheel thinking of the comforts that awaited arthur homecooked food simple but filling a stiff drink to dilate the blood vessels and warm the imagination feet up warm smiles nurtured by routine jeremys gut knotted as the black car glided away two weeks to the day after the bookstore encounter a secondyear medical resident an adorable brunette named angela rios came on to jeremy he was rotating through the acute childrens ward accompanying the attending physician and house staff on pediatric rounds dr rios with whom hed exchanged pleasantries in the past hovered by his side and he smelled the shampoo in her long dark hair she had eyes the color of bittersweet chocolate a swan neck a delicate pointy chin under a soft wide mouth four cases were scheduled for discussion that morning an eightyearold girl with dermatomyositis a brittle adolescent diabetic a failure to thrive infant that one was probably child abuse and a precocious angry twelveyearold boy with a miniscule body shriveled by osteogenesis imperfecta the attending a softspoken man named miller summarized the basics on the crippled boy then arched an eyebrow toward jeremy jeremy talked to a sea of young baffled faces trying to humanize the boy his intellectual reach his rage the pain that would only intensify trying to get these new physicians to see the child as something other than a diagnosis but keeping it lowkey careful to avoid the holierthanthou virus that too often afflicted the mental health army despite his best efforts half the residents seemed bored the rest were feverishly attentive including angela rios who hadnt taken her eyes off jeremy when rounds ended she hung around and asked questions about the crippled boy simple things that jeremy was certain didnt puzzle her at all he answered her patiently her long dark hair was wavy and silky her complexion creamy those gorgeous eyes as warm as eyes could get only her voice detracted a bit chirpy too generous with final syllables maybe it was anxiety jeremy was in no mood for the mating game he complimented her questions flashed a professorial smile and walked away three hours later arthur chess showed up in his office i hope im not disturbing you oh you are you are jeremy had been working on the draft of a book chapter three years before hed been the behavioral researcher on a study of bubble children kids with advanced cancers treated in germfree plastic rooms to see if their weakened immune systems could be protected against infection the isolation posed a threat to young psyches and jeremys job had been to prevent and treat emotional breakdown at that hed been successful and several of the children had survived and thrived the principal researcher now the head of oncology had been after him to publish the data in book form and a medical publisher had expressed enthusiasm jeremy worked on the outline for seventeen months then sat down to draft an introduction over a years time he produced two pages now he pushed that pathetic output aside cleared charts and journals onto the chair that abutted his desk and said not at all arthur make yourself comfortable arthurs color was high and his white coat was buttoned up revealing an inch of pink shirt and a brown bow tie specked with tiny pink bumblebees so this is your lair such as it is jeremys designated space was a corner cutout at the end of a long dark corridor on a floor that housed nonclinicians biochemists biophysicists bioeverything except him the rest of psychiatry was a story above a single window looked out to an ashcolored air shaft this was an older part of the hospital and the walls were thick and clammy the biofolk kept to themselves footsteps in the hallways were infrequent his lair hed ended up there four months ago after a group of surgeons came by to measure psychiatrys space on the penthouse floor of the main hospital building less glamorous than it sounded the upper floor looked out to a heliport where emergency landings sometimes rendered therapy impossible any view of the city was blocked by massive heating and airconditioning units and pigeons enjoyed crapping on the windows from time to time jeremy had seen rats scampering along the roof gutters the day the surgeons came hed been trying to write and was rescued by their laughter he opened his door to find five dapper men and a matching woman wielding tape measures and hmming a month later psychiatry was ordered to relocate to a smaller suite no suite existed to accommodate the entire department a crisis of space was solved when an eightyyear emeritus analyst died and jeremy volunteered to go elsewhere this was shortly after jocelyn and isolation had been welcome jeremy never came to regret the decision he could come and go as he pleased and psychiatry was faithful about forwarding his daily mail the chemistry lab stink that permeated the building was all right nice said arthur very nice what is the solitude the old man blushed which i have violated whats up arthur i was thinking about that drink the one we discussed at renfrews shop yes said jeremy of course arthur reached under a coat flap and drew out a bulbous whitegold pocket watch its approaching six would now be a good time to refuse the old man now would be downright rude and simply postpone the inevitable on the bright side jeremy could use a drink he said sure arthur name the place the place was the bar of the excelsior a downtown hotel jeremy had passed the building many times a massive gray heap of gargoyled granite with too many rooms to ever fill but had never been inside he parked in the humid subterranean lot rode the elevator to street level and crossed a cavernous beaux arts lobby the space was well past its prime as was most of downtown disconsolate men working on commission sat in frayed plush chairs and smoked and waited for something to happen a few women with overdeveloped calves walked the room maybe hookers maybe just women traveling alone the bar was a windowless burnished mahogany fistula that relied upon weak bulbs and tall mirrors for life jeremy and arthur had taken separate cars because each planned to head home after the tête à tête jeremy had driven quickly but arthur had gotten there first the pathologist looked tweedy and relaxed in a corner booth the waiter who approached them was portly and militaristic and older than arthur and jeremy sensed that he knew the pathologist he had nothing upon which to base the assumption the man had uttered nothing of a familiar nature hadnt offered even a telling glance but jeremy couldnt shake the feeling that this was a favorite haunt of arthurs yet when arthur put in his order there was no the usual hans on the contrary the pathologist enunciated clearly careful to specify a boodles martini straight up two pearl onions the waiter turned to jeremy sir single malt ice on the side any particular brand sir macallan very good sir as he left arthur said very good the drinks came with stunning speed obviating painful small talk arthur savored his martini showing no inclination to do anything but drink so said jeremy arthur slid a pearl onion from a toothpick to his lips left the mucoid sphere there for several moments chewed swallowed i was wondering if you could clarify something for me jeremy whats that arthur your views psychologys views on violence specifically the genesis of very very bad behavior psychologys not monolithic said jeremy yes yes of course but surely there must be a body of data ill retrench whats your take on the issue jeremy sipped scotch let the subtle fire linger on his tongue youre asking me this because the question intrigues me said arthur for years ive dealt with the aftermath of death on a daily basis have spent most of my adult life with what remains when the soul flies the challenge for me is no longer to reduce the bodies i dissect to their biochemical components nor to ascertain cause of death if one excavates long enough one produces no the challenge is to comprehend the larger issues the old man finished his martini and motioned for another motioned at an empty bar no sign of the portly waiter but the man materialized moments later with another frosted shaker he glanced at the nearly empty tumbler of scotch sir jeremy shook his head and the waiter vanished humanity said arthur sipping the challenge is to maintain my humanity have i ever mentioned that i served a spell in the coroners office as if the two of them chatted regularly no said jeremy oh yes sometime after my discharge from the military where did you serve the panama canal said arthur medical officer at the locks i witnessed some gruesome accidents learned quite a bit about postmortem identification after that i did some other things but eventually the coroners seemed a fitting place he took several thoughtful swallows and the second martini was reduced by half but you switched to academia said jeremy oh yes it seemed the right thing to do the old man smiled now about my question whats your take on it very bad behavior the very worst jeremys stomach lurched on a purely academic level oh no said arthur academia is the refuge of those seeking to escape the big questions if its hard data youre after im after whatever you choose to offer because you speak your mind arthur finished his drink of course if im being offensive or intrusive violence said jeremy hed spent hours endless hours all those sleepless nights thinking about it from what ive gathered very very bad behavior is a combination of genes and environment like most everything else of consequence in human behavior a cocktail of nature and nurture jeremy nodded what are your thoughts about the concept of the bad seed said arthur the stuff of fiction said jeremy which isnt to say that serious violence doesnt manifest young show me a cruel bullying callous sixyearold and ill show you someone worth watching but even given nasty tendencies it takes a bad environment a rotten family to bring it out callous youve treated children like that a few sixyearold potential felons jeremy considered his answer sixyearolds who gave me pause psychologists are notoriously bad at predicting violence or anything else but you have seen youngsters who alarm you yes what do you tell their parents the parents are almost always part of the problem ive seen fathers who took great joy when their sons brutalized other children preaching restraint in the presence of strangers saying the right things but their smiles give them away eventually it takes time to understand a family for all intents and purposes families still exist in caves you have to be inside to read the writing on the wall arthur waved for a third drink no sign of intoxication in the old mans speech or demeanor just a slight increase in his high pink color at least jeremy mused a slip of his scalpel wouldnt kill anyone this time when the waiter said for you sir he ordered a second macallan finger food came unbeckoned with the drinks boiled shrimp with cocktail sauce fried zucchini spicy little sausages skewered by black plastic toothpicks thick potato chips that appeared homemade arthur hadnt ordered the hors doeuvres but he was unsurprised the two men nibbled and drank and jeremy felt warmth a lacquer of relaxation flow from his toes to his scalp when arthur said their smiles give them away jeremy was momentarily confused then he reminded himself those obnoxious pathogenic dads hed been talking about he said do as i say not as i do it never works interesting said arthur not counterintuitive but interesting so its all about families thats what ive seen interesting arthur repeated then he changed the subject to butterflies specimens hed come across while serving in panama offduty forays into the jungles of costa rica weather that had one drenched in sweat even as one showered the old man drank and fooled with his bumblebee bow tie and ate skewered sausages and a dreamy look came into his eyes as he embarked upon a story a patient hed seen back in panama a young officer in the corps of engineers whod returned from a jungle hike felt an itch under his left shoulder blade reached back and fingered a slight swelling and believed himself bitten hed thought nothing of it until a day later when the swelling had tripled in size but still said arthur he didnt come in for examination no fever no other discomfort the old machismo you know on the second day the pain arrived wonderful messenger pain teaches us all sorts of lessons about our bodies this pain was electric or so the fellow described it a highvoltage electric shock running continuously through his torso as if hed been hooked up to a live circuit by the time i saw him he was deathly pallid and shaking and in quite a bit of agony and the swelling had trebled yet again furthermore arthur leaned forward the lad was certain there was something moving within he selected a potato chip slid it between his lips chewed deliberately dusted crumbs from his beard and continued my assumption upon hearing that motion was crepitus fluid buildup secondary to infection nothing alarming on the face of it but the poor lad removed his shirt and as i observed the mass i became intrigued arthur licked salt from his lips in the dim light of the bar his eyes were the color of fine jade the swelling was huge jeremy highly discolored the beginnings of necrosis had set in black flesh somewhat bubal so one had to consider plague but there was no serious probability of plague the corps had cleaned the canal zone quite thoroughly still medicine is predicated on surprise thats the fun of it and i knew i had to culture the mass in preparation i palpated the wretch could barely contain himself from screaming and as i did i noticed that there did indeed seem to be some sort of independent movement beneath the skin unlike any crepitus id ever seen another potato chip a slow sip of martini arthur sat back again jeremy had moved forward on his seat he relaxed consciously waited for the punch line arthur ate and drank looked quite content the old bastard hadnt finished too drunk to continue jeremy fought the urge to say what happened then finally arthur drained his martini glass and gave a low sigh of contentment at that point rather than commence with the examination i sent the fellow for an x ray and the results were quite fascinating if inconclusive munch sip what did it show said jeremy a gelatinous mass of indeterminate origin said arthur a mass unlike any neoplasm or cystic formation id ever seen my reference books were of no help neither was the radiologist not the brightest fellow in the first place in any event i decided to cut the lad open but gingerly which was fortunate because i was able to preserve it intact arthur stared at the empty martini glass and smiled in reminiscence jeremy busied himself with the last drops of single malt unbuttoning his vest the pathologist shook his head in wonder infestation larval infestation the poor lad had been selected by a little known jungle beetle as the nutritional host for its new family an unusually petite ectoparasitoid of the adephaga family the insect is equipped with a set of biochemical tools that prove extremely useful to its survival its brown and unassuming and hence hard to spot and to the uninformed appears minimally threatening furthermore it exudes a chemical that repels predators and its excrement possesses anesthetic properties its modus is to deposit its feces on the victims skin which accomplishes the dual goal of relieving itself and numbing the host epidermis that allows for a swift clean incision large enough to accommodate an extravagantly curved ovipositor a beak if you will connected to the creatures reproductive tract that allows for rapid injection of eggs of even further interest is the fact that its the father beetle who accomplishes this i was reminded of all this by your mention of violenceenabling fathers smile a rueful glance at the empty glass arthur went on once his mates eggs have been fertilized the male takes it upon himself to assume full responsibility for the familys future he reenters the female extracts the eggs injects them into his own thorax and feeds the brood with his body tissue until a suitable host is found liberated man muttered jeremy quite arthur twirled his martini glass ate the pearl onion placed his large hands flat on the table what happened to the patient i scooped out the entire mass taking pains to do it cleanly thousands of larvae all quite alive thriving quite nicely thank you because of the high protein content of young american military musculature no lasting damage to the poor lieutenant other than a scar and some tenderness for several weeks and several months of rather disturbing dreams he applied for and received a discharge moved to cleveland or some such place the larvae didnt survive i tried to come up with substitute nutrition for the little devils agar gelatin beef broth bonemeal ground insect parts nothing worked the fascinating aspect of the case was that the very existence of this particular beetle had been under speculation for some time many entomologists believed it extinct a rather interesting case at least i thought so the male beetle said jeremy sins of the fathers arthur studied him gave a long slow nod yes you might say that jeremy and arthur left the bar together and parted at the hotels revolving brass doors jeremy was drunk needed to walk it off and he headed out to the street a light rain had fallen the sidewalks smelled of burnt copper the city glowed he walked to the fringes of downtown entered dark murderous avenues unmindful of his own safety feeling curiously uplifted fearless after drinking with the pathologist the gruesome story of the soldier with the larval hump cheered him when he finally drove home his head was clear and when he reached his small house he thought what a pathetic little place more than enough for someone like me jocelyns belongings had been packed up and shipped to the police four cartons shed brought so little doresh and hoker had stood around during the packing and doresh said mind if we luminol the bathroom its a chemical we spray and then we turn down the lights and if it glows theres blood finished jeremy go ahead not bothering to ask why the bathroom he knew the answer the bathroom was the place if you were going to they sprayed and found nothing uniformed officers carried the four cartons away it was only when theyd left that jeremy realized theyd taken something of his a framed snapshot that had sat on his bedroom dresser he and jocelyn walking along the harbor eating shrimp from a takeout stand a warm day but windy her head barely high enough to reach jeremys shoulder her blond hair all over the place masking half of jeremys face he phoned doresh asked for the picture back never received a reply he stripped naked dropped into bed figuring hed be up half the night instead he fell asleep readily but woke up in the earlymorning hours head pounding muscles aching brain clawed by images of voracious cannibal bugs stay out of my life old man arthur did shortly after drinks at the excelsior as jeremy tagged along during psych rounds he heard the page operator drone his name he straggled away from the mental health army phoned in picked up a page from dr angela rios over the past few weeks the beautiful young resident had tried to catch his eye during at least four chance walkbys in hospital corridors angela had a fine quick mind and a soft heart and she was as pretty as they came exactly the type of woman jeremy would go for if he was interested in a woman careful not to be hurtful hed smiled and walked on now this he answered the page and angela said im glad youre on service ive got a problem patient thirtysixyearold woman with lupus in apparent remission but now her blood works looking scary and we need a bone marrow aspiration leukemia hopefully not but her counts are off in an ominous way and id be derelict not to pursue it the problem is she has real difficulty with procedures scared out of her wits i offered to sedate her but she says no with the lupus receding shes worried about taking any drugs and messing up her system could you help me hypnotize her talk to her whatever calms her down i heard you do that sure said jeremy the first patient hed helped with a procedure had been a twelveyearold girl with a resected brain tumor a malignant glioma about to undergo a spinal tap the chief psychiatrist had given jeremys name to the neurosurgeon whod put in the consult and there was no turning back he showed up at the procedure room wondering what am i supposed to do found the girl in restraints kicking and screaming and foaming at the mouth it had been six months since the tumor had been shelled out of her skull and her hair had grown back as three inches of fuzz ink lines across her face and a yellowish tan said shed been radiated recently twelve years old and they were tying her up like a felon a frustrated secondyear resident had just ordered a gag he greeted jeremy with a furrowbrowed grunt jeremy said lets hold off on that and took the girls hand felt the shock of pain as her nails cut into his palm and drew blood looked into her panicpoisoned eyes tried not to wince as she shrieked nonononononononono sweat poured from his armpits his bowels shuddered and his equilibrium started to go he stood by the gurney frozen as the girls nails cut deeper she howled he swayed his left foot began to slide out from under blacking outoh shit the resident staring at him everyone staring at him he braced himself breathed deeply and he hoped inconspicuously the girl stopped screaming his colon felt ready to explode and his back had gone clammy but he smiled down at her called her honey because hed forgotten her name though theyd just been introduced and on top of that hed just read the damn chart she stared up at him oh lord trust the room fisheyed and shimmered and he felt his knees give way again drawing himself up he began talking to the nowsilent girl smiling and talking intoning droning uttering godknewwhatjibberish the girl commenced screaming again the resident said shit lets just do it hold on ordered jeremy the violence in his voice silenced the room the girl too he concentrated suppressed the shakes that threatened to betray him talked her through it within moments the girls eyes had shut and she was breathing slowly and able to nod when jeremy asked if she was ready the resident now looking offbalance himself did his thing with merciful skill extracted the lumbar puncture needle filled a vial full of golden spinal fluid and left the procedure room shaking his head the girl cried and that was okay that was good she had every right poor thing poor poor thing just a child jeremy stayed with her endured her whimpers stuck with her until she was ready to smile and he got her to do so his fullbody sweat was foulsmelling but no one seemed to notice later out in the hall one of the nurses cornered him and said that was amazing dr carrier angelas lupus patient was no screamer a wan pretty woman named marian boehmer she expressed her terror by going rigid and silent dead eyes lips folded inward in the wrong setting some nincompoop shrink mightve slapped her with a catatonia label angela moved away from her and gave jeremy room to work angelas silky hair was tied back and rubberbanded her makeup had been eaten up by stress and her skin bore a library pallor she looked as if she hadnt slept in a very long time here she is at her worst thought jeremy the way she looks on a bad morning and still pretty good the bone marrow aspiration kit lay unwrapped on a bedside tray chrome and glass and dagger points that horrible grinding thing used to puncture the sternum so that bloodforming cells could be sucked out in order to gain leverage the doctor loomed from above and leaned in hard put some muscle into it patients willing to talk about the procedure said it felt like being stabbed to death marian boehmers cheeks were clear of the wolfmask rash that signaled her immune system had gone awry if you got past the fear she really did look okay fairskinned and fairhaired a bit underweight nice features wedding band and a diamond chip on her ring finger where was the husband did that mean something his not being here everything means something at the moment so what this woman was going to have her breastbone punctured jeremy introduced himself smiled and talked and smiled and talked and held her hand and felt the familiar pangs of his own anxiety the tight chest the empathy sweat the twinges of vertigo no danger of embarrassing himself the horror of the first time had been his hazing by now he expected the fear welcomed it when he helped he suffered the key was to hide it the key to life was hiding it he stroked the womans hand chanced a gentle swipe of her brow and when she didnt recoil told her how well she was doing as he lapsed into the singsong seduction of hypnosis not a formal induction nothing that theatrically vulgar just a subtle gradual reach for the parasympathetic reaction that combined relaxation and concentration and slowed down mind and body transport yourself to a good place ms boehmer may i call you marian thank you marian thats good marian excellent marian what a great job marian and heres dr rios and yes yes just hold on good great terrific marian and there you go you did a great job its over and you did great during the procedure marian boehmer had wet herself and he pretended not to notice as the nurse wiped her thighs when he took hold of her hand again she said oh look at me im such a baby jeremy patted her hair gently youre a trouper if i was in trouble id want you on my team marian boehmer burst into tears i have two children she said im a very good mother jeremy stayed with her until the orderly came to wheel her back to her room as he opened the door he braced himself for a hallway conference with angela rios clinical chitchat that would inevitably wind its way toward social overture rios was lovely but he stepped out to the echoes of distant voices phones clinical footfalls page announcements rattling gurneys a single nurse sat charting at the nearest station ten yards away empty hallway no sign of angela on a rainy thursday evening just before seven on his way out of the hospital jeremy encountered the raincoated bulk of detective bob doresh doresh was hanging by the main elevators near the candy machines rubbing his heavy jaw and munching on something when he saw jeremy he pocketed a colorful wrapper and trotted over got a minute doc jeremy kept walking and motioned for doresh to accompany him howve you been doing doc all right and you me doresh seemed offended by the common courtesy as if his job gave him the right of total privacy ill ask the questions im fine doc he wiped a speck of chocolate from his lips and blinked several times well balanced and nourished so everythings copacetic with you im surviving well thats good said doresh especially considering the alternative they passed the marble wall engraved with the names of hospital benefactors pushed through the glass doors walked through the covered breezeway that led to the doctors parking lot the convenient lot after jocelyn thered been talk about moving the nurses closer but nothing had materialized doresh said nice to keep dry jeremy said whats up detective ill get right to the point doc this is going to sound like one of those movie cliches but where were you last night lets say between ten and midnight at home anyone with you no why just routine said doresh for a moment jeremy thought hed go along with the script then something snapped and he barked bullshit and moved well ahead of doresh the detective caught up chuckled loudly but there was no humor to the sound he emitted the warning growl of a big watchful dog those eyes regarding jeremy with what seemed like new respect or maybe it was contempt doresh said youre right its total bullshit im not going to waste my time driving over here and making small talk so tell me this is there any way you can verify being home by yourself last night it would help both of us if you could jeremy suppressed the reflexive whythehellshouldi not for an entire two hours there isnt i got home late around eightthirty took a walk in my neighborhood for an hour or so someone may have seen me but if they did i didnt notice after that i returned home showered had a drink scotch johnny walker if you care and called out for some dinner twentyfourhour pizza place i ordered a medium halfcheese halfmushrooms it was delivered around tenfifteen i gave the boy a fivedollar tip so hell probably remember i ate three slices of pizza the rest is in my refrigerator the scotch made my mouth dry and the pizza didnt help so i drank water three eightounce glasses i read the papers watched tv if youd like i can name the shows sure said doresh youre kidding anything but doc jeremy rattled off the list thats a lot of tv doc normally id be reading by candlelight said jeremy but i just finished the entire great books compendium and chaucer and shakespeare thought id give myself some downtime doresh studied him youve got a sense of humor i didnt see that before the situation didnt exactly warrant it idiot the doctors lot came into view and jeremy walked faster rain pebbled down on the roof of the breezeway poured down the sides like glycerine drapery doresh said whats the name of the pizza place jeremy told him who got killed who said spare me said jeremy i went through hell and you didnt make it any easier now youre still bugging me instead of finding out who killed jocelyn doreshs eyes narrowed and he moved in front of jeremy blocked jeremys progress making people feel good isnt my job fine so lets cut to the chase youre here because something happened something similar enough to jocelyn to want to take another look at me doreshs eyes dropped to the ground as if the truth disgraced him as if crime was a personal failure he said why not youll read about it in tomorrows paper yeah something very much like ms banks happened he drew the lapels of his raincoat tight across his chest but left the coat unbuttoned what happened was a woman a prostitute over in iron mount a girl known to the department for a while drugs soliciting the usual in that sense not like ms banks at all but the wounds jeremy said dear god doresh moved out of his way jeremy said iron mount thats not far from the shallows not far at all doc a prostitute you really think from time to time i do think said doresh he smiled at his own wit thats all doc have a nice day i left several messages for you detective a photo your guys took from my house yeah yeah evidence when will i get it back hard to say maybe never doreshs shrug was so casual jeremy fought not to hit him better get going doc have my work cut out for me that night doresh sat in jeremys dreams a raincoated buddha and the taste of slightly off greasy harbor shrimp bit his tongue in the morning he got up early and retrieved the newspaper the headlines were soaked with economic woe and the felonies of politics the clarions histrionic journalists exulting about warstobe injustice and indignity he found what he was looking for on page the womans name was tyrene mazursky polish surname notwithstanding shed been black fortyfive a drugaddicted streetwalker with the extensive police record doresh had cited also a mother of five iron mount was a scrofulous warren of misshapen streets and afterthought alleys as narrow as theyd been since the citys horseandcarriage slagandsmelt origins jeremy had been there exactly once a very long time ago as an intern doing a home visit on a kid everyone was sure was being abused drunken mother junkie father the fiveyearold boy barely in the first percentile of height and weight speech and vocabulary testing out as that of a twoyearold one happy family plus some unnamed addict pals living in a railroad flat above an auto body shop far from the waterfront but close enough to where the kauwagaheel river cut inland from the lake and swamp stench permeated the rotting plaster walls jeremy did his thing wrote it up so did a terrified social work intern but it turned out that despite their character flaws and bad habits the boys parents were doing a pretty good job of tending for the kid who had picked up a viral liver infection with ensuing bowel blockage that choked off his nutrients and retarded his growth surgery and iv antibiotics worked wonders counseling for the parents proved a good deal less miraculous and three weeks after the kids last surgical followup the family cut town iron mount due east from the shallows a place that made the shallows look like horse country he put down the paper forced coffee down his throat and thought about tyrene mazursky savaged the wounds five orphans he wondered how a black woman ended up with a polish name felt an inexorable sadness at the mysteries of tyrene mazurskys life all the mysteries of jocelyn hed never unravel the thought of her the goneness the day had barely broken but he had when he walked to his car the neighbor two doors down the romanian woman with the victimized eyes the one who rarely left her own place and couldnt see jeremys house for the hedges was standing by her front window watching had doresh been by asking questions mrs bekanescu was one of the few on the block who owned and didnt rent he waved at her and her curtains snapped shut his ability to unsettle someone this early felt perversely gratifying and he drove faster than usual switched on bright music when he got to his desk he threw off his coat organized some papers booted up his computer and spent the morning punching buttons and rechecking data tables and constructing pretty charts for his book he gave a try at the introduction but his mind impacted and the words crumbled he switched topics began an outline for the chapter hed have to write timespace disorientation secondary to pediatric gnotobiotic isolation the only analogues in the literature were studies of scientists stranded in the antarctic or some such hellhole jeremys mind wandered from bottomless glacial rifts to blue ice that could kill you if you kissed it to the hackneyed horror of falling endlessly a million ice violins scratching out a tundra symphony a hard confident knock on his door shook him upright and arthur chess stepped in beaming the pathologist made himself comfortable in an uncomfortable chair have you given any more thought to the question i posed the origin of evil said jeremy arthur turned one hand palmside up evil is a weighty word theologically burdened i believe wed settled upon very bad behavior we no i havent thought about it as i mentioned theres a database sparse but suggestive if youre really interested i am jeremy ill get you some references but the conclusions might be uncomfortable for whom an optimist said jeremy a humanist he waited to see if arthur would place himself in either category the pathologist smoothed his beard and said nothing jeremys desk clock ticked the hour the bottom line arthur is that certain people seem to be born with a hardwired propensity for impulsiveness of those a few turn to violence males mostly so testosterone may be part of it but theres more than hormones at work the significant variable seems to be low arousability slower than normal resting heart rates a cool nervous system preternatural calm said arthur as if hed heard it before you know the research arthur shook his head however what youre saying makes perfect sense a stranger to fear is a stranger to conscience thats one theory said jeremy fears a terrific teacher and those who dont learn from it miss out on valuable social lessons but theres another way to look at it adrenaline addiction a congenitally understimulated central nervous system leads to a need for progressively stronger thrills the everyday term is excitement junkies ive seen that in army snipers arthur agreed fellows who lived for the thrill registering heartbeats so slow one thought ones stethoscope was malfunctioning had one fellow could sit for hours at a time a veritable statue would you say then that military service is a form of sublimated criminality jeremy recalled arthurs own military history the old man had enjoyed the service thrillseeking by itself isnt the issue mountain climbers and sky divers are all hooked on the adrenaline high but most of them dont commit crimes its the combination of recklessness and cruelty that leads to your very very bad behavior and thats where environment comes in take a child with the biological markers expose him to abuse and neglect and youre likely to create a problem arthur smiled again a monster is that what you were going to say monsters said jeremy come in all forms he stood ill pull those references for you send them over by tomorrow a rude gesture but arthur was unfazed plinking a vest button he sprang to his feet with the vigor of a much younger man those same pale pink stains speckled the left cuff of his lab coat identical color different stains one more question if you dont mind whats that abuse neglect your assumption that those factors are environmental could it be that what you term family dysfunction is inherited as well violent parents passing on their proclivities toward their children back to the bad seed said jeremy another theologically loaded concept and as you said discouraging but are the data inconsistent with that notion the data are too muddy to prove anything arthur they merely suggest i see said arthur so you find it inconceivable that the totality of violence or even the majority is passed along in the nucleic acid sins of the fathers said jeremy your jungle beetle injecting his parasitical spawn nothings accidental with you is it dr chess arthur chuckled and crossed to the door well this has been illuminating thank you for your patience and anytime i can reciprocate please feel free he left and jeremy remained standing wondering if the old mans parting words were simple courtesy or did he really expect jeremy to drop in with a question what would he ever want from a pathologist his mind camerashuttered to jocelyns face what lay below her face wounds hed never seen but had imagined a rending of flesh that haunted him with its terrible ambiguity now tyrene mazursky there was nothing in common between a middleaged hooker and sweet jocelyn but the wounds enough in common to put doresh back on his trail his heart hammered as he punished himself with imagined horror arthur would be at home with all that would reduce it to cell biology and organ weight and chemical compounds arthur would deal with the stuff of screaming nightmares the way he waxed eloquent about carcinomas and sarcomas every tuesday morning avuncular manner easy smile perpetual coolness what was his resting pulse the questions he wanted to ask the old man stuck in his craw are we talking about this because you know what ive been through is this just morbid curiosity or do you have a point why hadnt he spoken up what do you want from me when his heart slowed jeremy went on the wards and comforted his patients he must have functioned adequately because eyes brightened a few smiles broke hands clutched his fingers and one teenage girl flirted with him harmlessly when he was alone charting the imprint the feel of every single patient remained with him as if he carried them around a mama kangaroo the flesh of the afflicted felt no different than anyone elses not until the terminal stages dying patients reacted in different ways some were gripped with lastminute bravura became garrulous told inappropriate jokes some reminisced endlessly or offered noble blessings to the acolytes who ringed their beds others simply faded but they had something in common something jeremy had yet to identify a person working the wards long enough could tell when death was imminent jeremy had never felt anything but a terrible fatigue when a patient left him he tried to imagine someone getting a thrill out of anothers death simply considering that possibility made his shoulders sag taking a break in the doctors dining room for coffee he spotted angela rios eating yogurt by herself walked up to her made small talk and asked her to dinner that night amazed at the calm voice that issued from his mouth feeling a smile curl around his lips as if his mouth was being manipulated by a ventriloquist as he made his play no good reason to ask her other than her beauty intelligence charm and the fact that she was obviously interested she said im sorry im on call too bad said jeremy could he have misread her that badly as he turned to leave she said im off tomorrow if thats convenient for you let me check my calendar jeremy pantomimed pageflipping the old selfdeprecating wit angela laughed easily lovely girl if i was interested tomorrow then he said meet you here if you dont mind said angela i could use some time to go home and freshen up im off at seven how about eightish she pulled out her residents spiral notebook scrawled ripped out the page and handed it to jeremy west broadhurst drive in mercy heights probably one of the old clapboard colonials converted to flats jeremys sad little bungalow was in the lady jane district a short walk from mercy heights boulevard were neighbors he told her his address oh she said im not home much the schedule you know her beeper went off she smiled apologetically jeremy said as if on cue as if she hung her stethoscope around her neck gathered her residents manual and her notebook and stood see you tomorrow she said eightish ill be ready her apartment was on the second floor of a gloomylooking threestory structure that shouted boardinghouse medicinal smells bittered the creaky hallway perhaps other interns and residents lived here and brought samples home the carpeting was tamped down brown and stale and two bicycles were chained to the oftpainted railing angela came to the door within seconds of jeremys ring shed tied back all that glorious dark hair and fashioned a tight braid that trailed down her back a soft white sweater caused jeremy to notice her breasts the sweater ended just above her waist and was bottomed by black cinchwaist slacks and black highheeled sandals she wore pearl earrings and a tiny ruby on a filamentthin gold chain unobtrusive makeup the tight hair accentuated the olive oval of her face her brown eyes were alive with interest her lips parted in a smile she smelled great ready as promised she shot out her hand and gave his a firm hard shake almost a military maneuver and jeremy suppressed a smile perhaps she sensed his amusement because she blushed eyed his topcoat is it really cold nippy im a sunshine baby always cold let me grab a wrap and were off he took her to a midpriced familyrun italian place on the better side of lady jane the gentrified side storefronts converted to softly lit pubs and bookstores and florists and fivetable restaurants vestiges of the old days were represented by the paintedover windows of vacuum cleaner repair shops immigrant tailors chinese laundries cutrate pharmacies the rain the clammy acid spatter that had hectored the city for four days running had ceased and the air was sweet and the streetlights beamed as if in gratitude jeremy rushed to open angelas door old habits the academy had pounded etiquette into him when she got out of the car she took his arm the feel the faint clawing of feminine fingers on his sleeve the hostess was the chefs wife she had bosoms you could rest a dictionary on and a commodious smile she seated them in a rear booth brought breadsticks and menus and a small dish of garlicscented olives perfect dating fare this was indeed a date what then genius angela ordered casually as if food wasnt the issue they talked easily for some reason perhaps it was her eagerness or the simplicity with which she conducted herself jeremy had guessed angela to be a high achiever of workingclass origins possibly the first of her family to go to college he was wrong on all accounts shed grown up sunny and comfortable on the west coast and both of her parents were physicians rheumatologist father dermatologist mother each a clinical professor at a firstrate med school her only sibling a younger brother was studying for a phd in particle physics scholarly bunch he said it wasnt really like that she said no pressure i mean actually i never wanted to be a doctor my freshman major was dance youve covered a bit of territory a bit her face grew old for half a moment as if to cover she ate a garlicolive what about you where are you from jeremy weighed his options there was the short answer the last city hed lived in the school from which hed graduated the artful digression to worktalk the long answer was an only child hed been five years old when mom and dad were killed in a twentycar new years eve auto pileup on a sleetslicked turnpike at the moment of fatal impact hed been sleeping at his maternal grandmothers house dreaming of the board game candy land he knew that because someone had told him and hed preserved it like a specimen but the rest of the preorphan years were a greasy blur nana had failed soon after and been sent to a home and he was raised by his fathers mother a bitterly altruistic woman who never recovered from the crushing responsibility after her fade to senility the boy then eight was taken in by a series of distant relatives followed by a sequence of foster homes none abusive or attentive then the basalt preparatory academy agreed to accept him as a charity case because members of its new board decided something socially conscious finally needed to be done his formative years the period psychoanalysts so absurdly term latency were filled with bunk beds drills a full menu of humiliation uncertainty for dessert jeremy turned inward bested the rich kids at the academic game despite the tutors that flocked to them like remora he graduated third in his class turned down the chance to go to west point entered college took five years to earn his baccalaureate because of having to work minimumwage night jobs another year tending bar and delivering groceries and tutoring dull rich children helped him save up some money after which he attended graduate school on full fellowship earning his phd hadnt been tough hed written his dissertation in three weeks back then writing had come easily then starving intern postdoc fellow the position at city central seven years on the wards jocelyn what he said was i grew up in the midwest ah here comes the food during dinner one of them jeremy wasnt sure who steered the conversation to hospital politics and he and angela talked shop when they returned to the car she took his arm back at her door she looked into his eyes rose on tiptoes kissed his cheek hard and retracted her head i had a great time drawing the boundary this far no farther fine with him he had no stomach for passion i did too he said have a good night angela flashed perfect white teeth clacked her purse open found her key and gave a tiny wave and was on the other side of the door before either of them was pressed to say more jeremy stood in the grubby hallway and waited until her footsteps faded before turning heel over the next three weeks angela and jeremy went out four times scheduling was a challenge twice angela had to cancel because of patient emergencies and a surprise request by the chief of medicine for jeremy to deliver a grand rounds on procedural anxiety caused him to offer apologies he needed the evening to prepare no problem she said and when jeremy delivered his talk she was sitting in the fifth row of the hospital auditorium afterward she winked at him and squeezed his hand and hurried off to join the other residents on morning rounds the next night they had their fifth date basic unimaginative stuff their time together no couplesbungeejumping no edgy concerts or performance art exhibits no long rides out of the city past the harbor and the western suburbs to the flat plains where the moon was huge and you could find a quiet place to park and consider infinity jeremy knew the plains well hed spent most of his life in the midwest but sometimes it still shocked him long ago before jocelyn when hed been simply lonely hed driven out to the plains often speeding alone on a soporific highway wondering how many flat miles youd have to travel before the earth shrugged itself a hillock their relationship grew in mundane soil a quintet of quiet dinners at five separate quiet serviceable restaurants two italian one spanish a quasifrench place that termed itself continental after angela let loose her affection for hunan cuisine jeremy found a bluelit chinese café that had gotten good reviews in the clarion more money than he was used to spending but the smile on her face made it worth it decent food earnest conversation a brushing of fingertips now and then very little in the way of flirtation or sexual suggestion so different from the way it had been with jocelyn jeremy knew comparisons were destructive but he didnt care comparison was what came naturally and he wasnt even sure he wanted a clear shot at something new jocelyn had been sex and perfume the perfume of sex the serpentine duet of tongues moist panties on their first date hips lifted a musky delta the gift proffered his first date with jocelyn had ended before dessert the frantic drive to her place ripping each others clothes off someone so petite but so strong her small hard body had slammed against jeremys with a force that thrilled him and left his bones bruised jocelyn had always left him breathless angela was polite on the second date she said i hope this doesnt sound rude but can i ask how old you are thirtytwo you look a lot younger not flattery the truth and offered as such jeremy had looked twelve at sixteen didnt need to shave until he entered college hed hated the reticence of his hormones all those girls he desired regarding him a kid by his thirties hed ended up with one of those smooth angular faces that resists aging his hair was fine and straight an unremarkable light brown and no bald spots or gray strands had intruded he wore it parted on the right and unless he used some kind of hair product it flopped over his forehead he believed his complexion to be sallow but women had told him he had great skin one a poet had taken to calling him byron and insisted that his unremarkable brown eyes were well beyond intense he was mediumsized medium weight not muscular wore d shoes and a regular suit to his mind about as average as you could be angela said i mean it you look really young i figured you had to be about that because you told me youve been on staff at central seven years but you could easily pass for my age or even younger which is guess two years post md means twentyeight twentyseven i skipped third grade same age as jocelyn he said im not surprised angela said i was just a precocious brat and began talking about the rigors of residency jeremy listened you never knew when professional training would come in handy the goodbye pattern begun on the first date continued walking angela to her door the silence the smile the outstretched hand then a hard defensive peck on the cheek and her claim a bit too emphatic of having had a wonderful time jeremy began wondering what she wanted after the fifth date both of them filled with chinese food she invited him into her compulsively neat but shabbily turnedout apartment showed him to a secondhand sofa that still smelled of disinfectant poured wine for both of them excused herself and slipped into the bathroom jeremy looked around angela had a good eye each component was cheap scarred and conspicuously temporary a sorry houseplant struggled for life on a chipped windowsill yet the composite was pleasing still he wondered two physician parents surely she could have afforded better she emerged from the bathroom wearing a long green robe silk or something like it sat next to him drank wine sidled closer dimmed the lights they began kissing deeply moments later her robe fell open and jeremy was inside her being there brought him no tremor of triumph on the contrary he felt a cold wave of letdown course through him she wasnt moving much didnt seem there he pumped away hard steady detached thinking irreverent thoughts maybe its the chinese food maybe after five dates she feels obligated jocelyn had been opening his eyes he looked down at her face what he could make out in the ashy darkness was serene lying back accepting him passively as he thrust himself into her her eyes were clamped shut would they flutter open sense his objectivity he decided to hell with it pleasure myself and forgot about her the next time he looked down her face had changed as if an internal switch had been flicked or shed decided to come alive was she just one of those women who needed time who the hell ever really knew about women now she flipped her head to the side grimaced began grinding back at him gripped him with heels and hands and bit his ear and quickened her breathing to a hoarse pant as she tightened her pelvic vise and held him fast jeremys objective disinterested hardon became something else completely as she cupped his balls and kissed him and cried out a shout a bellow of pleasure escaped from his mouth and he collapsed they both did lying on the stinking couch entwined later when thoughts of jocelyn crept into his head he shooed them away he drove home tingling below the waist it was only later hours later lying fetally in his own bed alone aware of every detail in the room that he allowed the twinges of guilt to temper his pleasure the day after making love to angela jeremy paged her and drew her away from the wards and took her to his office after locking the door he reached under her skirt and placed her hand upon him she whimpered and said really he rolled down her panty hose and her panties in one smooth swoop and they connected standing against the door intermittently aware of passing footsteps out in the corridor as she clung to him she said this is terrible should i stop stop and ill kill you they finished on the cold linoleum floor angela dusted off her white coat and straightened herself fluffed her hair and kissed him and said ive got patients her face grew sad guess what im on call for the next twentyfour poor thing said jeremy stroking her hair will you miss me sure she placed her hand on her skirt directly above the soft spot where hed just filled her will you do this to me again when im off call to you she grinned men do it to women thats what it is jeremy said again as in here here anywhere god i needed that put that way said jeremy twining her hair around his fingers you leave me no choice easing the schedule and all that she laughed touched his face was off alone jeremy tried to work on his sensory deprivation book chapter but got little done he went over to the doctors dining room for coffee white coats got it for free one of the few perks left and he took advantage of it often he knew he was swallowing way too much caffeine but why not what was there to be slow about the room was sparsely occupied just a few attendings taking time off between patients and one whose patients didnt talk back arthur chess sat alone at a corner table with a cup of tea and an unfurled newspaper jeremys pathway to the coffee urn took him right into arthurs sights but the pathologist gave no sign of recognition ignoring jeremy if he saw jeremy at all jeremy found a table at the opposite end of the dining room where he drank and found himself studying arthur now he saw why arthur hadnt noticed him the old man was busy observing the object of his fascination was a group of three physicians hunched over pie and coffee two tables over a trio of men engaged in what looked to be spirited academic discussion jeremy recognized one of them a cardiologist named mandel a good man if a bit distracted hed thrown a few consults jeremys way some illconceived all wellintentioned his back was to jeremy and he hunched forward paying close attention the other two men wore surgical greens one was tan maybe latino with dark wellgroomed hair and a barbered black mustache the other was white literally his long drawn face bore an indoor pallor jeremy had only seen in longterm patients clipped yellowish hair topped a domed cranium his nose was a beak and his cheeks were sunken he was doing all the talking moving his lips and gesturing with spidery hands that served a surgeon well mandel remained rapt the darkmustached mans attention seemed to flag as if he was putupon being there the pale man pulled a pen out of his pocket drew something on a napkin and gesticulated some more with those longfingered hands mandel nodded the pale man made a sawing motion and smiled mandel said something and the yellowhaired surgeon sketched some more words were exchanged all around arthur kept staring obviously some sort of technical demonstration why would arthur a delver into death a wielder of bone saws and carpentry tools find it fascinating the old curiosity kicking in that was probably it arthur was mentally voracious a true intellectual jeremy who read magazines in his spare time and rarely opened the classic psychology texts he collected felt shallow by comparison he wondered why the pathologist didnt get up and join the group an intrusion to be sure but arthur was an important man at central and his stature would have guaranteed a welcome then arthurs interest seemed to wane and he turned a page of his newspaper and jeremy wondered if hed been wrong perhaps arthur wasnt noticing the three men any more than hed noticed jeremy maybe the old man was caught up in some internal rapture butterflies predatory beetles the minutae of body fluids whatever and the cant of his big bald head toward the discussion had been a coincidence of angulation now the old mans eyes were glued to the paper all the better jeremy could drink his coffee in peace return to his office unmolested put his feet up on his desk and recall the wonders of making love to angela he allowed himself to wonder what the next time would be like men do it to women the pale man stopped waving his pen seemed to draw himself away from his demonstration stared across the room at jeremy intense stare or perhaps jeremy had imagined it because now the man was back to his lecture arthur stood folded his paper fixed the tilt of his bow tie headed straight for jeremys table big smile on the pink face how fortuitous he said i was just about to call you he took a seat at jeremys table unbuttoned his white coat stuffed the paper in his pocket his shirt was snowywhite piqué heavily starched with a high stiff collar the bow tie of the day was mint green a luxuriant silk specked with tiny gold fleurdelis i wondered he said and please dont think me forward i wondered if youd care to join me for supper this friday evening there are some people interesting people whom id like you to meet who im allowing myself to presume you might enjoy meeting friends of yours a group so to speak the old mans speech usually fluid had grown choppy arthur chess embarrassed perhaps to cover he smiled we meet from time to time to discuss matters of mutual interest medical matters said jeremy then he remembered arthurs persistent curiosity about very bad behavior had all that been a prelude to this a wide range of issues said arthur we aim for erudition but nothing ponderous jeremy the companys amiable the food is well prepared quite tasty really and we pour some fine spirits we sup late though i dont imagine that will be a problem for you how could arthur know of his insomnia whys that youre an energetic young man one of the pathologists big hands slapped the table so are we set jeremy said sorry fridays tough he didnt have to lie angelas oncall ended thursday night no date had been set for friday but there was no reason for her to turn him down i see well another time then arthur got to his feet no harm trying i didnt mean to put you on the spot if you change your mind feel free to let me know he placed a palm on jeremys shoulder weighty jeremy became aware of the pathologists bulk and strength will do thanks for thinking of me arthur i thought precisely of you arthurs hand remained on jeremys shoulder jeremy whiffed bay rum and strong tea and something acrid possibly formaldehyde im flattered said jeremy arthur said do consider this during times of abject disorder a good latenight supper can be most fortifying disorder said jeremy but the old man had already turned and left back in his office he failed to conjure anything to do with angela past or future the word caromed around his head disorder not mine the citys the worlds mine the old bastard was right what better description of a time when women were stalked and hunted and brought down like prey simply because they were women where men with low resting heart rates chose their victims with all the gravitas of grocery shoppers squeezing melons men who craved blood gas and terrorstruck eyes the confiscation of body juice the ultimate power monstermen who needed all that to get their own blood rushing disorder was the perfect description of a world where jocelyns death enlisted her in the same sorority as tyrene mazursky he hadnt been able to conjure angela but now jocelyns face flew into his head her laughter even at his lamest jokes the way she cared for her hopeless patients her pixie face when it flushed and compressed in the throes of pleasure when it had been really good for her the flush that rose from her pelvis to her chin then another kind of face also compressed no pleasure nausea coiled around jeremys gut he felt the urge to vomit grabbed his wastebasket and plunged his face into it all that came were dry heaves he sat low dangling the basket his head between his hands sweating panting monstermen creating human dross then other men coarse civil servants like hoker and doresh fashioned careers from the waste he managed to expunge a plug of mucus from his throat and throp it into the trash removing the plastic bag from the basket he took it to the mens room tossed it returned to his office locked the door and thumbed through his address book he found the number and punched it detective doresh answered homicide and jeremy said i was wondering why a black woman would have a name like mazursky whos dr carrier whats going on it just struck me as odd said jeremy it struck me as profoundly disordered then i thought maybe she used an alias because prostitutes do that ive seen it we treat them here at the hospital they come in for their stds sexually transmitted diseases and their nonspecific urinary tract infections malnutrition dental problems hepatitis c one woman will have five different charts we dont expect much in the way of reimbursement but we do try to bill the state because the administrators order us to but with prostitutes its mostly futile because of how rapidly they switch names they do it to fool the courts to conceal evidence of prior arrests so maybe thats what she did tyrene mazursky maybe theres more to her than one identity an alias said doresh enunciating slowly you dont think we thought of that i im sure you did it just occurred to me anything else occur to you doc just that silence anything else you want to tell me doc no thats it because im listening said the detective sorry if i bothered you said jeremy tyrene mazursky said doresh its funny you should mention her because i just got back her final autopsy report and have it here in front of me not pretty doc another extremely notpretty kind of a humptydumpty situation the detective let the message sink in no way to put her back together again another the same had happened to jocelyn it was the closest since the murder that hed come to being informed he nearly screamed out loud took a breath said thats horrible tyrene mazursky said doresh turns out she was married to a polish guy years ago commercial fisherman one of those guys who goes out on the lakes and seines and hauls in whatever comes up also he was part of those crews that go looking for submerged logs hundredyearold logs that fell off the barges fancy maple wood they use em for violins anyway this guy was a big drunk he died in a capsize a few winters ago left her with nothing even before that she was whoring a little what with him being gone all the time drinking away his wages after he died she got serious about her profession that is hearing tyrene mazurskys life reduced like that froze jeremys heart and his mouth his hands began to tremble he said poor woman sad story doresh agreed guess we both know about that huh have a nice day doc jeremy placed the phone in its cradle imagined tyrene mazursky working the docks waiting for her ship to come in jocelyn working the wards waiting to see jeremy that night men do it to women thats what it is he sat there bathed in sweat sourmouthed watching as evening darkened the air shaft outside his window finally he picked up the phone again and punched an extension chess boomed a familiar voice its me arthur turns out fridays fine late thursday jeremy found a handwritten message in his box forwardslanted script black ink on substantial blue rag paper the liquid elegance of a fountain pen dr c friday pm ill call with details ac on friday serious rain arrived frigid unannounced relentless as a military assault overtaxed storm drains backed up and some regions of the city were assailed by filth auto collisions played a drumbeat on tight urban skin the air smelled like mercurochrome the docks at the harbor grew slick with accumulated slaps of oily lake water boats rocked and sank and unshaven men in knit caps and waders retired to dark bars to drink themselves senseless jeremys car fishtailed all the way to the hospital angela phoned him at shifts end sounded exhausted rough day a bit rougher than usual she said but ill try to be sociable if i fall asleep you can prop me up im sorry jeremy told her something came up an evening with dr chess dr chess well then go of course hes brilliant whats the topic jeremy had hoped for disappointment something erudite he wasnt clear about the details have fun ill give it a shot why dont you call me when its over it could be late said jeremy dinner doesnt begin until half past nine i see how about saturday then im not back on until sunday morning okay said jeremy ill call you great jeremy saw his patients and filled the rest of the day with futile attempts at writing two hours were wasted in the hospital library running searches of behavioral and medical databases as he looked for backup articles he knew didnt exist rationalizing his folly by telling himself that scientific research moved at a quirky pace you could wake up one day and find out everything youd believed in was wrong but the facts hadnt altered in six months if he wanted to produce a book even a chapter hed have to go it alone when he returned to his office it was pm and his box was stuffed with mail he sifted through it found a handwritten note in the middle of the stack the same black cursive on blue paper dr c its best if i drive tonight ac he phoned arthurs office got no answer tramped over to the main building and down to the basement where the path lab was housed found the entire department locked up halls dim and silent but for the mechanical whine of arthritic elevators a few doors down the morgue was closed as well arthur had left had the old man forgotten jeremy climbed the stairs to the ground floor entered the cafeteria and poured the days eighth free cup of coffee he sat drinking slowly in the company of worried families sleepy interns jaded orderlies when he returned to his office arthur was waiting outside his door dressed in a black hooded slicker so long it nearly reached galoshencased shoes puddles spread beneath rubber soles the slicker was beaded with rain and arthurs nose was moist the old man had left the hospital and returned the hood covered arthurs face from eyebrow to lower lip a few white beard hairs straggled above the latex seam but the end result was neartotal concealment how fitting for a man of his profession thought jeremy the grim reaper cheers arthur said weve got ourselves a torrential situation i do hope youve come protected jeremy collected his briefcase and his trench coat arthur regarded the wrinkled khaki garment with what might have passed for parental concern hmm he said itll do said jeremy i suppose it will have to you dont object to my driving do you under the best of circumstances our destinations a bit out of the way tonight arthur shrugged the plastic hood rattled rain sprayed the reaper goes fishing thought jeremy then what would he use for bait the interior of arthurs lincoln was warm and sweetsmelling upholstered in a dove gray felt that jeremy had only seen in much older cars the engine started up with a purr and arthur backed out smoothly once they were out of the lot arthur sat up straight big hands resting lightly on the wheel eyes shifting from windshield to rearview glancing at both side mirrors then back on the road alert but that gave jeremy meager comfort the storm had reduced visibility to a few yards as far as he could tell arthur was driving blind the old man aimed the lincoln downtown but turned left just short of the high distant twinkles that meant skyscrapers jeremy tried to follow arthurs route but quickly lost it east north east again then a series of brief turns that addled jeremy completely arthur hummed as he drove when taillights flickered up ahead the old man seemed to use them as navigational aids when darkness dominated and the windshield was a matte black rectangle he seemed equally at ease raindrops pelted the lincolns roof a frantic steel drum concert arthur seemed unmindful kept humming relaxed more than that enjoying the impossible conditions as if the lincoln was set on a track and the drive was no more daunting than a bumpercar circuit jeremy looked around from what he could tell in the darkness the lincoln was spotless nothing on the backseat before theyd set out arthur had unlocked the trunk revealing freshly vacuumed gray carpeting an emergency kit and two umbrellas bracketed to the firewall hed deposited jeremys briefcase next to the kit closed the trunk gingerly hum hum hum jeremy felt himself nodding off when he jolted awake he checked his watch hed slept for just over a quarter hour good evening said arthur jovially the rain was coming harder jeremy said what part of town are we in seagate the docks my favorite part of town said arthur the vitality the sensory stimulation the working people the working people the spine of any civilization a moment later i come from a long line of working people mostly farmers where did you grow up jeremy the midwest not this city but not far jeremy named the town a mercantile community said arthur any farming in your background not for generations said jeremy a farm can be an educational place one learns about cycles life death everything that falls in between and of course the transitory nature of it all one of my fondest memories is helping to birth a calf a rather sanguinary process i was seven and terrified petrified of being swept away in some great flood of bovine issue my father insisted did that inspire you to become a doctor oh no said arthur if anything quite the opposite how so arthur half turned smiling the cow did it all by herself son i was made to feel quite redundant but you became a physician anyway arthur nodded just a few more blocks smells of fish fuel rust and creosote told jeremy the docks werent far but no water in sight just rows of stout windowless buildings stripped of architectural fancy arthur chess had driven to an oppressively narrow street lined with what appeared to be warehouses the rain turned the pavement to gelatin the lincolns headlights were pathetic amber smears that died before they hit the asphalt no stars no moon nothing to use as a navigational tool the force of the storm induced myopia the lincoln turned onto another unlit strip and reduced its speed jeremy saw no blocks no sidewalks just one plainfaced building after another a sanguinary process predatory bugs what did he really know about the old man what had he gotten himself into arthur continued a while longer glided to a gentle stop and brought the lincoln to a rest in front of an unmarked twostory cube all jeremy could make out were slab walls and a narrow door topped by a rollout awning under the awning a bulb in a frosted glass case cast a fan of light the illumination was of a hue jeremy had never seen before pale blue purpletinged clinical the moment arthur switched off the engine the door opened and a small man stepped under the awning the blue light reached his waistline below that he was dark nearly invisible the illusion was that of truncation the half mans arm extended an umbrella snapped open and he hurried to the rear of the lincoln arthur pushed a button the trunk popped and when the small man circled back to the drivers door he held a pair of umbrellas he held the door open for arthur stood on tiptoes to shield the much taller pathologist and got wet doing so after handing arthur an umbrella he came around and opened jeremys door up close jeremy saw that the man was closer to arthurs age than his own and no taller than fivefive thin dark hair parted and slicked topped a round puckered capuchin face of a type seen on some types of dwarfs bright black eyes picked up light from somewhere and sparked back at jeremy under the eyes a lipless smile the man wore a dark suit white shirt dark tie once again he stepped out into the downpour so that jeremy could benefit from his umbrella jeremy moved closer wanting to share but the little man stayed out of reach as they ran for the door when jeremy stepped into the pale blue light his eyes were assaulted by pupilpopping fluorescence a tall figure filled the doorway arthur was already inside the monkeyfaced little man waited until hed passed soaked but still smiling the three of them stood in a small white anteroom backed by a white door the ceiling was acoustical tile the bright light spewed from an industrial fixture that resembled an elongated waffle no furniture no odors no chill but for specks splotches and pools of gritty water dispersed on the black linoleum floor a thoroughly inorganic place laurent said arthur thank you for providing shelter of course doctor the little man took both umbrellas and placed them in a corner he took arthurs coat then turned to jeremy this is dr carrier laurent pleased to meet you doctor laurent extended his hand and jeremy shook what felt like a knob of knurled oak the others are here laurent told arthur his suit like arthurs was beautifully cut but of another era blueblack gabardine over a whiteonwhite shirt the shirts collar was fastened by a gold pin his tie was true black satin tiny narrow feet were encased in captipped black bluchers so highly polished the rainwater beaded on the leather and rolled to the floor lovely said arthur everything looks wonderful sir laurent turned back to jeremy his cheeks were flushed youre a lucky young man arthur pushed open the white door and held it as laurent scooted forward the panel closed behind jeremy with a swoosh and his eyes adjusted yet again dimmer light soft amber caressing light before him was a long hallway paneled in a golden birdseyed wood linenfold paneling handcarved was topped by notched edging beneath his feet was carpeting of a deeper gold plush as the seats of arthurs lincoln the ceiling was high domed plaster veneered with pale gold leaf jeremy thought a bird in a gilded cage laurent led them up the muffled corridor the air was warm sweet with rosewater the passageway terminated at massive double doors carved into the capstone were three letters in flowery script ccc the year three hundred something bygone and soviet was arthur an unregenerate communist the thought amused jeremy but before he could speculate further laurent had thrown both doors open he and arthur flanked the doorway arthurs long arm swooped theatrically after you my friend jeremy stared out at a beautiful space four faces stared back at him a quartet of smiles a different silence the sudden percussive hush of conversation brought to a sharp halt his nose filled with the aroma of roasted meat his eyes accommodated to yet another quality of light scores of chandelier bulbs dimmed low monumental chandelier a riot of crystal swags and pendants and orbs the fleshy smell was delicious jeremy stepped inside the room was over twenty feet high wide as a chateau ballroom long as a yacht like the corridor the walls were wood burled walnut the color of hot cocoa incandesced by layers of polish sectioned into octagonal panels and embroidered with boisserie where the massive chandelier wasnt crystal it was sterling silver the ceiling plaster was vaulted and embellished by swirls and medallions a dozen paintings pastoral scenes were suspended from wires hooked over stout crown moldings twin swinging doors backed the room and laurent disappeared through one of them between the doors a baronial sideboard fitted with brass mounts hosted a centerpiece teeming with white orchids under the chandelier was a mirrorpolished chippendale mahogany dining table trimmed in vanilla satinwood long enough to accommodate twenty but set for six half a dozen mirrored place settings one chair on each side of the table was empty arthur motioned jeremy to the left and took the facing chair on the right my friends our guest dr carrier a quartet of polite mumblings three men one woman one of the men was black he like the other males was dressed in a good suit and an eloquent necktie the woman wore a white knit dress and a string of spectacular purplish black pearls the size of concord grapes all four were elderly by his very presence jeremy was lowering the median age significantly wheres the childrens table he tried to take in as many details as possible without seeming rude the paintings appeared french all were housed in intricately carved frames and biased toward the saccharine lush forests honeyed sunlight gamboling fauns tenderbreasted vacanteyed women captured in stunned repose extra chairs upholstered in raspberry silk were positioned along the walls as were a quartet of smaller sideboards white marble columns supported exquisitely painted chinese vases decorative tables expertly situated were festooned with marquetry a glass étagère held jade carvings jeremy knew something about antiques his longsuffering paternal grandmother spent much of her pension on a few quality georgian pieces these looked better than anything gram had collected what had happened to grams pieces no one spoke the old people kept smiling at him he half expected a pat on the head smiling back he continued to take in details a bower of three dozen red roses adorned the table the mirrored place settings were glass hectagons bordered in platinum each hosted pure white bone china of a simple graceful design an assortment of heavy sterling utensils rubycolored linen napkins slipped into gilded rings cutcrystal glasses for water red and white wines and much taller longstemmed repoussé silver goblets with glass insets six settings five goblets to the right of jeremys plate was a simple champagne flute clunky cheap it could have come from a discount chain membership had its privileges arthur had begun to speak was gesticulating for emphasis indeed nice to infuse some new blood into our grayed gathering appreciative chuckles jeremy let me introduce this band of miscreants arthur indicated the farthest of the two people sitting on jeremys side of the table a whitebearded man with eyes so blue that even at a distance they sparked like gas jets professor norbert levy arthur named a prominent eastern university levy was ruddy heavy in the jowls with a full head of unruly wavy hair he wore a widelapeled charcoal tweed suit a tattersall buttondown shirt a butterscotch cravat tied in a beefy windsor knot professor said jeremy levy saluted and grinned professor emeritus in plain talk ive been put out to pasture arthur said norbert built their engineering department from scratch more like i scratched a few backs said levy the woman sitting between the engineer and jeremy placed a hand on her breast the black pearls clinked a sudden paradigm shift to modesty norbert i dont know if my heart can take the shock anything to keep you awake tina said norbert levy arthur said her eminence judge tina balleron formerly of the superior court and now of the golf course said the woman in a smoky voice she had the paperbag complexion and dangerously freckled hands to back up the assertion of eighteen holes a day was lean and strongboned with short wavy hair dyed champagne blond she wore no jewelry other than the pearls but they were enough shed probably been a stunner a few decades ago even now sagging wattled skin failed to obscure the determined line of her jaw she murmured rather than spoke and jeremy found that surprisingly seductive her eyes were clear dark amused superior court said professor emeritus norbert levy the question is superior to what is there an inferior court dear judge tina balleron made a low throaty sound given the quality of attorneys nowadays id say there are plenty arthur shifted his glance to his side of the table eyed the man farthest down edgar marquis no professional designation as if the name said it all marquis appeared to be the oldest of the group well into his eighties shrunken and hairless with blueveined papery skin he seemed nearly devoured by his clothing his face sat low on his shoulders pitched forward as if deprived of the support provided by a neck his upper lip protruded like that of a turtles beak the suit was a black silk shadow stripe satincovered buttons trimmed the sleeves jeremy had only seen those on tuxedos marquiss shirt was pearl gray his skinny tie the cheerful red of oxygenated blood an old dandy edgar marquis he also appeared to be asleep and jeremy began to glance away then marquis crooked a crescent of skin where his eyebrows shouldve been and winked edgar said tina balleron was a rare example of coherence and judgment at the aptly named foggy bottom the state department said arthur as if explaining to a schoolchild everyone smiled again including marquis not amusementletsgetcomfortable smiles all of them working at amiable theyre treating me thought jeremy with the edgy reverence reserved for a bright but unpredictable offspring as if im some kind of prize edgar marquis shifted in his chair dr carrier he said in a shockingly resonant voice im no longer bound to be diplomatic so forgive me if i occasionally lapse into reality as long as its occasional said jeremy aiming for banter wanting marquis wanting all of them to feel at ease marquis said definitely sir anything more than occasional reality would be oppressive words to live by said tina balleron tapping her silver goblet with long curving nails the man next to her the black man said the occasional brush with reality would be a step upward for mr average citizen he faced jeremy harry maynard obviously im slated for last back of the table too hmmph apparently some things never change tsk tsk said norbert levy beard splitting in a grin edgar marquis said a matter of social import has intruded upon our little conclave shall we establish a committee of inquiry what else said harry maynard i appoint myself de facto chairman youre all guilty as charged feel thoroughly chastened guilty of what said levy take your pick edgar marquis said all in favor say aye laughter all around there you go said judge balleron participatory democracy at its finest now behave yourself harry and well get to you in good time maynard wagged a finger lifes too short for good behavior he turned back to jeremy your training will do you well here pleased to meet you kid large and bulky in a navy suit baby blue shirt and teal blue tie he was probably the youngest midsixties or so his complexion was a couple of shades lighter than the walnut paneling ironfiling hair was cropped short and his toothbrush mustache was precisely as wide as his mouth arthur said last and never least is the inestimable harrison maynard he lives in a world of his own tina balleron said harry writes books used to said maynard to jeremy trashy stuff pseudononymous trashy stuff great fun ive mined the mother lode of estrogen tina balleron said harrison is a past practitioner of what used to be termed the romance novel countless women know him as amanda fontaine or chatelaine dumont or barbara kingsman or some other such vanillish alias hes a master of the crushed bodice god only knows how you did your research harry looking and listening said maynard so you say said the judge i think youve been a fly on too many walls harrison maynard smiled one does what one needs to do his eyes shifted to the rear of the dining room the right door had swung open and laurent emerged pushing a cart on wheels the monkeyfaced man had changed to a starched white serving jacket on the cart were six silver domes behind him marched a woman his size and age wearing a black shirtwaist dress and toting a magnum of wine her dark hair was drawn back in a bun her skin was the color of clotted cream and her eyes were toasted almonds tilted by the faintest trace of epicanthus eurasian jeremy decided as she drew near their eyes met across the table she smiled shyly and stopped at edgar marquiss seat at last food said the ancient diplomat im wasting away jeremy looked at marquiss shriveled frame and wondered how much of that was jest laurent let the cart come to rest at tina ballerons right smells delish said marquis alas ladies first ladies deserve to be first said the judge marquis groaned its times like these dear that one understands those poor wretches who opt for sexchange surgery wine sir said the eurasian servingwoman marquis looked up at her genevieve fill my cup to the brim genevieve poured a white wine and laurent served a first course of fish mousse quenelles in a peppery reduction with citrus overtones edgar marquis tasted licked his lips pronounced pike pike and turbot said arthur chess scallops and lobster roe in the sauce added norbert levy tina balleron said enough speculation and pressed a buzzer at her feet moments later laurent emerged madame composition sir whitefish turbot and gar gar said edgar marquis is basically pike i said harrison maynard am basically homo sapiens tina balleron said the sauce laurent king crab crawfish lemon grass a splash of anisette ground pepper just a touch of grapefruit zest delicious thank you as laurent left the judge raised her wineglass and the others followed suit no toast a moment of silence then crystal rims touched lips edgar marquis sipped faster than the others and genevieve was there as if by magic to refill his glass the wine was pale and crisp with a lemony nuance that harmonized with the delicate mousse the quenelle was so light it dissolved on jeremys tongue he found himself eating too quickly made a conscious effort to slow down take discreet bites chew inconspicuously but energetically a young gentleman doesnt gulp a young gentleman doesnt tell anyone when upperclassmen creep into his bunk at night jeremy drained his wineglass almost immediately his head began to swim hed had breakfast but no lunch and the fish mousse was substantial as crepe the wine had gone to his head laurent emerged again with a basket of flatbreads and slices of softer baked goods jeremy selected olive bread and something studded with sesame seeds a few seeds rolled onto his tie he flicked them off unreasonably embarrassed no one had noticed no one was paying attention to him period everyone concentrating on eating hed seen that before in old people knowing time was short and every pleasure needed to be savored jeremys forkful of buttery fish paused midair as he observed his companions listened to the clink of tines against china the barely audible samba of determined mastication so singleminded as if this could be their last meal will i be that way he wondered when the passage of time hits me hard arthur chess had labeled the group our grayed little assemblage but as jeremy looked around the table he saw alertness selfsatisfaction selfsustainment were these people looking back on lives well lived a blessing then he thought of jocelyn never afforded the luxury of a gradual fade tyrene mazursky he tried to salve the resultant flood of images with a greedy swallow of cool wine the moment it emptied his glass was refilled in the next chair over tina balleron glanced at him was he being indiscreet had he betrayed his feelings no shed returned to the food hed probably imagined it he drank too much and ate more bread cleaned his plate conversation resumed floated around him the old people talked steadily but at a leisurely pace no conflict nothing ponderous just several light glosses over the days headlines then norbert levy said something about a hydroelectric dam project slated for the next state over quoted facts and figures talked about the aswan disaster in egypt the futility of trying to conquer nature tina balleron cited a book shed read about the inevitability of mississippi floods harrison maynard pronounced the army corps of engineers frankenstein monsters in khaki and quoted jonathan swift to the effect that if one learned to plant two ears of corn where one had grown previously he had serviced mankind better than the entire race of politicians arthur chess said swift was one of the greatest thinkers of all time his take on immortality is near biblical in its acuity the pathologist went on to describe a visit to swifts grave in dublin then segued to the pleasures of the reading rooms at the libraries of trinity college edgar marquis said the irish were finally getting it right giving up on potatoes and embracing technology unlike other nationalities they know how to cook too norbert levy spoke of a fabulous meal at a familyrun restaurant in dublin harbor perfectly grilled black sole the irish would never deign to call it dover sole because they hate the english the husband the chef the wife the sommelier harrison maynard said what do the kids do bake doctors and lawyers said levy pity tina balleron turned to jeremy hows your fish dear wonderful im so glad the second course was a warm salad of pigeon breast and porcini mushrooms over field greens lubricated by a pancettalaced dressing another white wine was poured deeper in color woody and dry and fine and jeremy swallowed it with joy and worried giddily if hed pass out but he remained alert his system seemed to be absorbing the alcohol better the beautiful room was clearer brighter his taste buds were electric in anticipation of each new mouthful and his companions voices were as soothing as poultice arthur spoke of butterflies in australia edgar marquis opined that australia was the states in the fifties and new zealand was england in the forties three million people sixty million sheep and they dont let reptiles in harrison maynard described a spot in new zealand where one could peer down on the tasman sea and the south pacific simultaneously its the ultimate contrast the tasman roils constantly the south pacifics glass i found a crag where the gannet birds mate goldenheaded gulllike creatures theyre monogamous the mate dies they go into seclusion the crag reeked of frustration jeremy said not too adaptive five pairs of eyes aimed at him reproductionwise he said is there a population control issue good question said maynard i just assumed they were moral little buggers it is a good question said arthur tina balleron said it should be looked into the third course was a pale pink sorbet of a flavor jeremy couldnt identify accompanied by ice water as if sensing his curiosity norbert levy informed him blood orange and pomelo the latters a cousin to the grapefruit we seem to be in a citrus thing here larger than a grapefruit no said edgar marquis i believe in mexico they sell them at village markets huge misshapen things levy agreed to jeremy sweeter than grapefruit but unsuitable for commercial production because of a very low pulptorind ratio harrison maynard said expediency trumps virtue yet again said tina balleron arthur said how true he touched his bow tie everyone stared at their food silence as if all the energy had been sucked from the room jeremy turned to arthur for clarification the pathologist offered a long searching glance in response a sad glance well then said jeremy perhaps one should concentrate on virtue the silence stretched crushing silence arthur lowered his head plunged his spoon into his sorbet jeremy wasnt sure when it happened sometime during the meat course three meats arranged like corporeal jewelry along with braised root vegetables and haricots verte and toasted spinach complemented by a velvety burgundy jeremy once a hearty eater but of late poorly inclined toward pleasure had his plate filled with a medallion of rare beef slices of goose breast veal loin wrapped around a foie gras nugget laurent distributed the flesh while genevieve doled out the greens all of which fit handily on his plate jeremy noticed for the first time that the dinnerware was oversize closer to platters than chargers soft violin music streamed down from the ceiling had it been playing all along jeremy searched for the speakers and spotted eight of them positioned around the room nearly camouflaged by plasterwork a room put together with care and big money the old people ate with continued alacrity edgar marquis said genevieve be a dear and bring me the goose leg the woman left the room and returned shortly with a daunting cudgel of meat marquis lifted the leg with both hands attacked at the top and proceeded to gnaw his way down the limb jeremy tried not to stare no one else seemed to consider the behavior unusual marquis made slow but steady progress seemed no less shrunken for the accomplishment jeremy recalled something hed never really been conscious of knowing a joke some distant relative had tossed his way during a family gathering back when hed been part of a family somewhat how old had he been not much more than a toddler where do you put it kid got a hollow leg whod said it an uncle a cousin had he really been a ravenous child what had happened to his appetites where had his life gone next to him tina balleron fanned her napkin and dabbed daintily at her lips across the table arthur chess chewed away like a stud horse norbert levy said yum jeremy faced the food dug in it wasnt arthur who brought it up of that jeremy was nearly certain nearly because red wine and protein overload had pushed him to the brink of stupor who had it been maynard or possibly levy someone had raised the topic of criminal violence ah thought jeremy the punch line this is why theyve brought me here but no one consulted him not in the least they talked among themselves as if he werent there might as well seat me at the kids table he decided to withdraw into his own mental space but the old peoples voices were hard to ignore harrison maynard was saying punditry is nothing but fatuous prigs reciting the same nonsense so many times they come to believe it poverty causes crime hah he placed his knife down i wont bore you with yet another sad reminiscence of my wretched racismblighted brutally segregated youth but suffice it to say that no matter where you grow up it becomes apparent early who the bad guys are and thats a colorblind phenomenon villains stand out like boils on a supermodel tina balleron made an indexfinger gun and pointed it at no one in particular pardon dear said maynard bad guys and good guys harry very macho its rather louis lamour great writer said maynard great human being do you quibble with the concept i was a judge darling bad guys were my stockintrade its the alleged good guys im not sure of edgar marquis said i encountered a good deal of evil in the corridors of foreign service lying for fun and profit if you will at times venality seemed to be the departments primary product the profession attracts rapscallions maynard said ah the things they dont tell you in diplomat school oh yes said marquis mournfully as if it really troubled him dont fret edgar the same goes for academia said norbert levy i coped by ignoring the fools and concentrating on my work i suppose your work didnt afford you that privilege eddie the collaborative nature and all that how did you stand it for years i didnt lad my washington days were a torment i finally figured out the key was to avoid what passed for civilization i was offered a position in england the court of saint james as it were assistant to the harlot whod been appointed ambassador i couldnt imagine anything more repugnant than that particular amalgam of double talk and peerage i turned the job down doomed my future sought out remote outposts where i could be useful without succumbing to the culture of cravenness micronesia arthur explained to jeremy the first indication in a while that anyone was aware of his presence the smaller more obscure islands of micronesia and indonesia said marquis places where antibiotics and common sense could make a difference why eddie said judge balleron youre a social worker at heart the old man sighed there was a time when good deeds went unpunished another silence engulfed the room and once again jeremy thought they all looked sad theres some back story im not privy to something they share something theyre not going to explain because im temporary why am i here another attempt to catch arthurs eye was unsuccessful the pathologists eyes were back on his plate as he dissected his veal norbert levy said i think your point is welltaken harry there will always be bad guys among us and theyre not that hard to spot on the contrary theyre banal banal and cruel said harrison maynard entitlement callousness the inability to control ones drives jeremy heard himself speak up thats exactly what the data show mr maynard habitually violent criminals are impulsive and callous five sets of eyes upon him tina balleron said doctor are we talking about actual psychological data or mere supposition data case histories or group studies both conclusive or preliminary the womans murmur did nothing to blunt the force of her questions judges start out as lawyers jeremy imagined balleron crossexamining strong men and reducing them to whimpering sots preliminary but highly suggestive jeremy filled in details no one responded he went on elaborating quoting sources getting specific now they were interested he continued delivered a little speech found himself heating up having trouble separating the cold facts from the images that danced in his head humptydumpty situation science was woefully inadequate he felt a sob rising in his throat stopped said thats all arthur chess said fascinating absolutely fascinating harrison maynard nodded the others followed suit even tina balleron looked subdued i suppose ive learned something she said and for that i thank you dr jeremy carrier an awkward moment jeremy didnt know what to say edgar marquis said will anyone be offended if i call for the goose wing knock yourself out eddie said harrison maynard im calling for champagne this time a toast clean dry möet chandon bubbled in the repousse goblets the chill seeping through the glass insets frosting the silver the wine fizzed in jeremys cheap flute he took hold of the glass and raised it as arthur toasted to our articulate guest the others repeated it five smiles real smiles pure welcome the evening had gone well jeremy had done well he was sure of it he sipped his champagne thought hed never tasted anything quite so wonderful never before had he felt so accepted more small talk and sacher torte and cognac finished him off arthur chess said my friends wed best be going he got up from the table and jeremy staggered as he did the same tina balleron touched his elbow he mumbled im okay she said im sure you are but she kept her fingers on his sleeve until he stood it was well into the morning but the others remained in their seats jeremy circulated the table shaking hands offering thanks arthur came up to him escorted him out as though jeremy had lingered too long on the pleasantries genevieve was just outside the door with their coats and as jeremy passed under the capstone he glanced back at the triplet of cs carved into the wood the black lincoln was waiting at the curb engine running and genevieve stayed with them sticking especially close to jeremy once again he felt like a child cosseted not an unpleasant feeling he allowed genevieve to open his door she waited until hed latched his seat belt waved closed the door and stepped back into darkness the rain had let up replaced by a soupy fog that smelled of old wool jeremy was in no condition to drive wondered about arthur arthur sat upright both hands on the wheel looked fine the lincoln pulled away from the curb and glided arthur what does ccc stand for arthurs hesitation lasted long enough to make an impression just a little joke are you comfortable very good fine cuisine no excellent arthur smiled he drove without comment as jeremy alternated between nodding off and springing awake cracking the window a couple of inches helped a bit and by the time they approached the hospital jeremys brain had settled and his breathing was slow and easy arthur reached the doctors parking lot and drove through the nearly empty tier to jeremys car i do hope you had a good time said arthur it was great thanks your friends are interesting arthur didnt answer they seem said jeremy to have lived full lives pause they have how often do you meet another pause longer irregularly arthur touched his bow tie flicked a button and unlocked jeremys door avoiding eye contact he pulled out his pocket watch and consulted the dial curt dismissal jeremy said an interesting bunch arthur clicked the watch shut and stared straight ahead what had become of arthurs amiability jeremy had found the old mans gregariousness offputting but now maddeningly he missed it he wondered if hed given his little performance undue credit had his discourse been too longwinded boring offensive in some way did i screw up somehow why should i care unable to summon up apathy he hoped he hadnt blundered the lincoln idled and arthur stared out the windshield jeremy opened his door gave arthur one more chance the warmth of being part of something lingered in his belly suddenly inexplicably he wanted to be popular arthur kept staring straight ahead well said jeremy good night said arthur thanks again youre welcome said arthur and nothing more by the time he reached home jeremy had put arthurs strange sudden coolness aside there were worse things in life than social error when he crawled into bed his mind was empty and he slept like a corpse the cold light of morning and a hangover killed further introspection he popped aspirin hazarded a run in the icy air took a scalding shower called angela at home but got no answer it was saturday morning but patients depended on him and he suddenly felt like working he was at his desk by nine trying to ignore the grit in his eyelids and the throbbing in his temples his pathetic stab at the book chapter glared at him reproachfully he decided to do personal rounds earlier than usual see all his patients before lunch spend more time with each one of them hed dressed as he always did but felt rumpled and uncouth grabbing his white coat off the door hook he threw it on the coat was something he generally avoided wanting to separate himself from the physicians im the doctor who doesnt hurt you that helped with kids not that he saw many kids anymore too much pain some things he just couldnt handle adult patients didnt seem to care how you dressed as long as you avoided extremes of grooming and demeanor some were even comforted by the image the lab coat imparted clinical rites priestly vestments heres an expert if they only knew a few minor crises kept him working past noon and he stretched the day farther by extending his bedside contacts taking time to sit down with the nursing staff charting carefully with atypical legibility a pagemessage from angela said sorry about today got called in a major crisis arose just before three man with a gun near the obgyn clinic and the page operator was adamant that dr carrier was needed the threat turned out to be the husband of a hysterectomy patient whod been spotted by a nurse with a telltale bulge under his sweater and now sat alone and smoldering in a vacated waiting room security had been called the charge nurse informed jeremy the husband was an angry man hed always made her nervous hospital regulations said someone from mental health needed to be there and the department said he was next up the affair turned out to be sad rather than frightening against everyones advice jeremy entered the room before the guards arrived the man was unshaven redeyed and under the influence of depression jeremy sat down and talked to him and listened and when the man said whys everyone so nervous jeremy pointed to the bulge the man laughed and lifted his sweater and shirt underneath was a colostomy bag the man said they can frisk me if they want at their own fucking risk he laughed harder and jeremy joined in the two of them talked some more and the poor fellow got into topics hed never opened up about to anyone raged about his illness his wifes the prospect of childlessness there was plenty to be angry about after an hour he seemed calm but jeremy wouldnt have been surprised if next time he did show up armed when the two of them exited the room three members of the useless security detail the hospital employed were standing by trying to look competent jeremy said everythings under control you can go the biggest guard said now doc go the time he spent with the poor man cheered him someone elses problems hed snapped to attention like the faithful member of the mental health army he was any good soldier knew the key to efficient battle death of the individual in service of the greater good feeling noble and depersonalized he returned to his office angela had called thirty minutes earlier he paged her was transferred to thoracic medicine where a ward clerk told him dr rios had just been called to an emergency lung surgery that puzzled him angela was a medical resident not a cutter no doubt thered be an explanation he glanced at the sheaf of scolding papers left to collect his mail a hefty stack today he sorted through the usual memos solicitations announcements of conferences and symposia came to a large brown interoffice envelope at the bottom this one had been sent from the department of otolaryngology no name in the recipient blank hed last consulted on an ent case several months ago an inner ear tumor that had proved fatal wondered what they wanted now inside the envelope were photocopied pages that had nothing to do with ears noses or throats a seventeenyearold article reproduced from an ophthalmology journal ablation of corneal tissue using the co varipulsar generation laser scalpel the authors were a surgical team headquartered at the royal medical college of oslo an international team norwegian names russian names english names none of them meant a thing to jeremy obviously a mistake hed gotten someone elses mail not a rare occurrence for the parcels that zipped through the mail tubes veining the hospitals moldy walls perhaps some secretary had confused psychology with speech pathology he phoned otolaryngology and spoke to a male secretary who hadnt the faintest idea what he was talking about tossing the article in the trash he put aside the envelope for further use fiscal responsibility and all that financial affairs had issued yet another order to tighten up as he folded it something rattled inside something had wedged at the bottom and he pulled it out a small white index card a typed message for your interest he took another look at the envelope no name in the recipient blank this had to be a mistake he rarely saw eye patients couldnt recall one in ages the last he was fairly certain had been five years ago a blind woman whod decided to curl up and die after two months of psychotherapy jeremy believed hed helped her and no one had told him different no there could be no connection to this why in the world would he have an interest in lasers he retrieved the article from the wastebasket read it found it to be typical medical jargondygook stuffed with numbers and tables barely comprehensible he cut to the summary the main point was that seventeen years ago laser scalpels had been judged to be a good clean way to cut cutting techniques humptydumpty no that was silly if his mind hadnt been addled by the last nights booze and confusion and pontification about criminality hed never have stretched that far what a strange night in retrospect comic and surreal he smiled painfully remembering his acute bout of neediness why had he ever cared what a group of elderly eccentrics thought of him even if they asked him back he wouldnt accept tomorrow was tumor board he was curious how arthur would treat him then a thought occurred to him perhaps arthur had sent the article no the pathologist handwrote with a fountain pen used that heavy blue rag paper a traditional man an antiquarian as witnessed by the vintage suits the old car the quaint vocabulary a typed message on anything so mundane as an index card would be out of character unless arthur was being coy the obliqueness fit that would be just like the pathologist gregarious one day frosty the next a game player everything a puzzle was this a challenge to jeremy to figure out ablation of corneal tissue laser eye surgery had arthur assumed jeremy would share his eclectic interests the old man hopped around from butterflies to carcinomas to grand discussions of issues that matter so why not lasers still his approach to jeremy hadnt been scattershot on the contrary arthur had sought to find common ground between the two of them pathology and psychology converging sharing the cold black space where twisted minds brought about bloody deaths the roots of very very bad behavior arthur had had a very clear focus and jeremy had been right about his invitation to supper having something to do with that he recalled the pall that had set upon the room after someone the writer maynard he was pretty sure had said expediency trumps virtue yet again the woman judge balleron had added then the silence nothing weighty was being discussed something about fruit grapefruit those other things pomelos sweet taste but they shipped poorly yet for just a few moments the mood in the room had changed expediency trumps virtue what a strange bunch no point wasting any more time on them same for this laser scalpels just a postal snafu he was making too much of it filling his head with a flotsam of random thoughts because he was avoiding his chapter still his thoughts shifted back to arthur treating him coolly for no apparent reason rudely really a puzzle but not an important one jeremy folded the card into an airplane sailed it into the wastebasket followed up with a toss of article the envelope too fiscal responsibility be damned two paragraphs of chapter outline stared up at him from his desk time to put aside silly stuff confront his creative inadequacies it was pm and they were in angelas bed naked in the dark wideawake theyd been together nearly three hours angela had phoned just as jeremy was preparing to leave the hospital she said good i got you her voice was faint everything okay he said sure she said no im lying can we get together maybe a quick dinner then just hang out at my place sounds like a plan any dinner in particular how about that italian place over on hampshire sarnos its close and i need to move my legs sarnos it is on me no its my turn to pay you get no turn youre a starving resident deserve a free meal she laughed nicest sound hed heard all day they met at the hospital entrance and walked arm in arm to the restaurant angela wore a long navy blue coat her dark hair streamed over the fauxfur collar she looked waifish young worn and stared at her feet as if needing to orient herself the rain was light dissipating from their clothes almost instantly jeremy put his arm around her shoulder and her head dropped he kissed her hair if shed put on makeup it had faded long ago the shampoo shed used that morning was tinctured with operating room antisepsis within seconds she was leaning against him heavy for a woman so thin they moved slowly and awkwardly through the three dark blocks to the restaurant when sarnos neon sign the tricolor boot of italy came into view angela said jeremy im so tired she got down a third of a plate of pasta carbonara and half a glass of iced tea jeremy was back to his feeble appetite last nights gluttony seemed distant an aberration he picked at his ravioli managed to finish a glass of coarse chianti they bickered playfully over the check and angela finally allowed him to pay her beeper went off and she phoned in she returned to the table smiling that was marty bluestone another rii tomorrow nights his anniversary and he wants to take his wife out so he offered to finish my shift tonight im free till tomorrow beneath her blue coat she wore residents casuals sweater and jeans and tennis shoes relieved of the garment and her stethoscope she looked like a college kid on the phone you said everything wasnt okay i was just being a baby she said it was right after i got off shift tough day huh one of those couple of problem bleeds a few other bad surprises she gave her pasta another go gave up this morning i watched dr macintyre crack the chest of a woman whod never smoked her right lung was black as coal it looked like barbecue ash the left ones not much better i didnt have to be there but id done the intake and liked her and i wanted to see what really happens to my patients jeremy shes a really sweet kind woman used to be a nun served the poor now shes got nothing but agony to look forward to poor thing she came in thinking she had bronchitis or maybe a cold gone chronic i did the old blowtheball test and her lung capacity was the lowest ive ever seen its amazing she could stand on her feet i sent her straight to xray i started with her so i ended up with her it was the attendings job to give her the diagnosis but he punted to me too busy i sat down with her told her she needed to be opened up and why she didnt even blink just said thank you doctor for letting me know so kindly you mustve done a good job angelas eyes watered she wiped them reached for jeremys chianti may i ill order you a glass no lets share she sipped held the glass out they linked arms and jeremy drank hed seen that at a wedding an ethnic affair maybe a jewish wedding bride and groom entwined heady symbolism he said not a smoker any secondhand smoke her father said angela hes old sick with diabetes shes been taking care of him for twenty years in a tworoom apartment he chainsmokes and it circulates and she breathes it in he had a chest scan last year his sugars and his circulations shot but his lungs are as clear as bells sins of the fathers said jeremy without thinking guess so her voice was low and defeated she played with her fork jeremy wondered if hed come across glib he said youve earned some relaxation id be happy to provide aid and comfort sounds good lets go shed taken the bus to the hospital so jeremy drove her home during the ride she kept her hand on his thigh once at a red light she leaned over and kissed him deeply and he heard her purr when they got to her place the routine commenced she seated him on the ratty couch and disappeared into the bathroom to change into her green robe the struggling houseplant on her windowsill was gone the apartment was no less shabby for its absence the bathroom door opened and angela glided over the robe firmly cinched she sidled onto the couch lay with her head in his lap he touched her chin stroked her hair she said lets get into bed her bedroom was chilly when they drew the covers up around their necks she said dont take this the wrong way but i dont want to do it tonight i just want to be held the wrong way as if ive been leading you on you havent okay they lay on their backs holding hands angela said youre sure im positive its not that i dont want you i do physically i do i just mentally it wouldnt work okay no need to explain jeremy brought her hand to his lips she snuggled close and slid down so that her head rested in his lap jeremy heard her let out a low contented breath for some crazy reason the sound evoked judge tina ballerons murmuring voice an old woman but still alluring no not her specifically women the sounds they made the wonderful things they did jeremy preferred women to men always had a certain type of woman especially smart bookish tending toward reticence vulnerable jocelyn had been none of that and yet he bent low cradled angelas head kissed her brow she shifted position reached down youre interested physically only bull im offended that you would think me so crass she laughed and moved back to eye level they began kissing stayed with it for a long time no groping no tongue duels just whispery grazes of lip upon lip angela said oh boy what just oh boy you make me happy im glad do i make you happy sure are you what do you mean are you happy its hard to tell you dont say much she said in general i like that my dad and my brother are talky guys great guys but overpoweringly verbal whenever my brother was home from college i was relegated to bystander what about your mother she just leaves the room being a doctor she can be as busy as shed like the convenient patient call said jeremy you know of such things huh so tell me why are you reluctant to talk about yourself its a boring story let me be the judge of that jeremy didnt answer angelas windows were covered by cheap shades moonlight transformed them to oversize sheets of parchment somewhere out on the street a radio was playing scratchy rock music a toostrong bass angela said ive upset you not at all i dont want to be nosy but we have been intimate youre right said jeremy what do you want to know where you were born what your familys like i dont have a family none at all not really he told her why kept talking starting with the accident being shunted from place to place the feelings of being alone feelings hed never put into words not during his training analysis not during clinical supervision or pillowtalk ventures with other women not with jocelyn he realized with a shock how little he and jocelyn had talked he finished breathless convinced opening up had been a grave mistake a nice wholesome girl from a welltodo intact family a clan of confident professionals would be put off by his rootlessness the sadness of it all people talk about sharing but you cant share the past or anything else of consequence he was reflecting upon what that implied for his chosen profession when angela sat up and cradled him and stroked his hair and played with his ears thats the whole sordid tale he said she placed one of his hands on her breast dont take this the wrong way but i changed my mind about what not doing it later when she began to yawn jeremy said ill let you sleep sorry im so bushed she squeezed him hard do you want to stay the night id better not he said you havent yet i suppose theres a reason im a restless sleeper dont want to disturb you youve got a long day ahead of you what with taking that guys shift yes she said guess so simultaneously they said the schedule when she walked him to the door she said so how was that dinner with dr chess not much of anything was it a medical thing no he said more of a general thing believe me its not worth getting into he left her rooming house got into his nova and started up the engine when his headlights went on so did those of another car behind him midway down the block when he pulled from the curb the other car followed suit driving in the same direction what the hell is this jeremy sped up the other car behind him didnt a big suv from the height of the headlights when he turned left on saint francis avenue it continued straight so much for high intrigue ive got to get hold of myself he said aloud no matter what those old fools think about reality i need some arthur wasnt at tumor board another pathologist presided an associate professor named barnard singh bright and turbaned and dressed in a perfect gray suit he got right to business flashing slides of a synovial sarcoma gentian violet stain turned the specimens beautiful jeremy asked the radiotherapist next to him wheres dr chess and received a shrug he sat through the hour restless and despite himself curious he called arthurs office extension heard the phone ring went up to see his patients and tried three hours later not knowing what hed say if arthur picked up just saying hi old chap harumph pshaw howre the old ccc chumskys no answer then he thought what if somethings happened to him despite his outward robustness arthur was an old man and the way he packed away alcohol and cholesterol perhaps hed had a heart attack and lay untended on the floor of his lab or worse jeremy pictured the pathologists long frame stretched out surrounded by jars of floating viscera skeletal specimens bodies in various states of dissection sterile tools laid out in preparation for human carpentry laser scalpel an expensive gizmo would there be any reason for a pathologist to invest in one he hurried to the main wing took the stairs down to the basement once again arthurs office door was closed and no one responded to jeremys knock the morgue sat at the far end of the hall and its door was open the sleepylooking attendant at the front desk was doing paperwork no he hadnt seen dr chess today had no idea where he was was he here yesterday uh no i dont think so jeremy backtracked to the pathology office on the opposite end and around a bend a chubby woman in her forties sat sentry hi she said can i help you doctor im looking for dr chess hes out is he okay why wouldnt he be i just wondered said jeremy he wasnt at tumor board and ive never known him to miss one well she said hes as fine as he could possibly be i believe hes taken some time off vacation its not like that said the receptionist jeremys puzzled look made her smile she said you dont know him well do you how long have you been attending tb a year ah she said well dr chess isnt really on staff anymore not officially anyway she cupped her hand around her mouth and whispered he doesnt get paid hes volunteering his time said jeremy you could call it that but that really doesnt describe it she lowered her voice even further forcing jeremy to lean in close he doesnt do autopsies anymore or analyze specimens doesnt do much at all except tumor board but hes such a brilliant man has given so much to this hospital that they allow him to keep his office do any research he wants to do its not a secret but we dont publicize it either for dr chesss sake its not like hes deadweight or anything hes a major asset to this department because of his reputation in fact ill have you know he turned this department into what it is her voice had risen indignant protective hes brilliant jeremy agreed and that seemed to mollify her thats why we dont talk about his employment status as far as everyones concerned hes a fullfledged member welcome here whenever he wants and his running tb is a big help everyone says hes got an encyclopedic memory and of course hes available when the younger pathologists have questions for him which they frequently do they have tremendous respect for him everyone does hes a beacon in his field yes he is said jeremy so youre saying he just decided not to come in its happened before why all the questions dr carrier dr chess and i had dinner a couple of nights ago he seemed a little shaky the receptionists hand flew to her mouth oh my i certainly hope hes all right i probably overstated he just seemed a little tired less energetic than what weve come to expect from him thats why when he didnt show up this morning for tb i got a little concerned who ran board this morning dr singh let me call him she punched her phone dr singh its emily sorry to disturb you but ive got dr carrier here asking about dr chess carrier from she inspected jeremys badge psychiatry he had dinner with dr chess last night thought dr chess looked a wee bit tired he wants to make sure dr chess is okay whats that all right ill tell him thanks dr singh she placed the phone in its cradle dr singh says dr chess called him last night to inform him hed be taking additional time off and wouldnt be making board dr singh said he sounded fine great thats good to know thanks jeremy turned to leave its so nice she said the way he does that does what dr chess the way he gets people to care about him the dear her phone rang and she picked it up and got involved in a conversation with someone named janine whod just had a baby and wasnt that great and she was sure he was cute just the cutest when could she stop by with the baby gift shed bought thecutestlittlebootieandjammy set the psychiatry secretary phoned jeremy and said youre requested on six west it was wednesday well past his latenight supper with the old eccentrics and but for occasional surreal remembrances the experience had been expunged from his head arthur chess was out of his head as well he couldnt believe hed actually cared about the old mans wellbeing over the past few days hed seen angela once half an hour for coffee and handholding before she rushed off during that time she talked more about her lung cancer patient who was not doing well and said for the rest of my chest rotation ill be shifting from lung to heart that should be good absence makes the lungs grow fonder ouch she said sorry no i like it another side of you what side is that regular not so composed happens all the time he said well i havent seen it before i like it she squeezed his hand left to talk to dying people he said who requested me the psych secretary said dr dirgrove dont know him well thats what it says here dirgrove hes a surgeon a redundancy six was a surgical ward he wants you to evaluate a preop patient for what thats all ive got dr carrier he asked for me personally sure did guess youre famous he found dirgrove in scrubs charting in the six west physicians room the pale blond man hed seen demonstrating some sort of technique in the dining room to mandel the cardiologist and the dark mustachioed surgeon the trio jeremy had believed arthur to be observing only to have arthur shift his attention to the daily paper and ask jeremy to supper seated dirgrove had appeared tall on his feet he was of medium height no larger than jeremy and ten pounds lighter one of those rangy men who seems to be moving even while standing still he greeted jeremy with a warm smile and a hearty handshake dr carrier great to meet you thanks so much for coming im ted the photo on his badge was a good likeness a rarity a thumbnail shot of dirgrove smiling just as he was now tm dirgrove md attending cardiac surgery jeremy what can i do for you dirgrove put the chart aside leaned against the desk rubbed one paper slipper against the other his eyes were deep blue thatched with laugh lines clear earnest tired faint yellowgray stubble dotted his angular face hands pinkened by frequent washing fluttered restlessly his surgical scrubs were wine red jeremy found himself thinking the better to hide the blood im slated to operate on a young woman with a ventricular septal defect on the face of it routine dirgrove smiled you know what they say routine is when its happening to someone else anyway this girl worries me shes highly anxious we cutters generally dont pay much attention to that kind of thing but ive learned to be a bit more careful careful about anxiety said jeremy about the whole mindbody connection dirgove tented his spidery fingers hed indulged in a beautiful manicure but the rest of him seemed put together casually short spiky uneven haircut and the scrubs were wrinkled careless shaving had left a grid of longer pale hairs at the juncture of his jaw and neck a guy like me can do all the right things technically but if the minds not cooperating it can be a problem youre concerned about an anxiety attack during surgery about any significant sympathetic nervous system reaction even with the premedication ive seen it happen patients who are ostensibly out and you cut them open and for some reason their adrenaline kicks in and their sns spikes and their blood pressure goes through the roof when the anesthesiologist has his hands full i cant do my job optimally thats why i play mellow music in my or and everyone shuts up my instinct on this girl is she needs calming down ive heard youre the man for that so if you dont mind could you see her the familys got good insurance what can you tell me about her dirgrove rummaged in a pile of charts found one flipped it open passed it to jeremy and crossed to the door everything you need to know is in here thanks and id appreciate if youd do it asap were scheduled for tomorrow first thing in the am so if you think we need a delay try to let me know by pm a brief wink and he was off merilee saunders the chart had lots to say about her congenital heart defect and her familys ability to pay excellent private insurance indeed but nothing about her psyche none of the nurses had recorded any untoward anxiety and dirgroves only assertion to that effect was a neatly printed addendum to yesterdays notes poss hi anx call psych jeremy went to see her dirgrove hadnt told her about the consult she was a chubby young woman with grainy skin and unruly dark hair tied up in a knot her hospital gown had bunched around her shoulders and she lay propped uncomfortably coalnugget eyes aimed at jeremy the moment he entered the room and she glared but said nothing cheap silver rings banded eight of her fingers three pierces in one ear four in the other a tiny rosy dot above her left nostril said shed changed her mind about the nose stud the chart said she was twenty years old but the reading material on her bed table was all teen zines jeremy introduced himself and she frowned a shrink youre kidding what someone thinks im crazy not at all dr dirgrove would like you to be as calm as possible before the surgery and he thought i might be able to help you with that if he wants me to be calm he shouldnt cut me up jeremy pulled a chair up to her bed may i do i have a choice sure merilee saunders rolled her eyes what the hay park so he said surgery wasnt in your game plan she turned sharply regarded him as if his skull had split open and his brain had tumbled out sure she said its a fun thing for me i cant wait to be sliced what a rush has the reason for the surgery been explained to blahblah blahblah blahblah blahblah yeah freaky dirgrove told me the facts freaky said jeremy hes a stiff roboticon except when he wants to turn on the charm my mom loves him the chart said the saunders family was intact what about your dad said jeremy what about him does he like dr dirgrove sure why not merilee saunders looked over at the tv suspended from the wall the channels here suck home shopping and spanish crap and other crap true said jeremy were a bit behind the times the young woman shifted position under her covers dirgrove tell you im nuts not in the least he just wants to make sure youre in peak shape for maybe i am she said nuts so what and what does that have to do with getting my heart sliced open and why now all these years ive been fine and all of a sudden im twenty i dont have to do something i dont want to do if you have doubts about the look ive had this she patted her left breastsince i was born they tell me its a hole in my heart but i dont feel any different from anyone else not until some docko slips me the old steth and he hears it and everyone starts freaking out you feel fine so why should you it just doesnt feel right know what i mean i come into this shithole all okay and they poke me and jam crap in me and give me x rays and cat scans and all kinds of crap and now tomorrow im gonna wake up feeling like i got run over by a truck it doesnt make sense but try telling mom that shes only out for my best interests your mother my mother loves doctors said merilee especially the cute ones she thinks dirgroves cute i dont i think hes a stiff and since youre obviously going to ask about my dad lets just say he works like eight hundred hours a week pays the bills goes with the flow youre right said jeremy youre an adult and its your body were talking about so if you have serious reservations nah ill go with the flow too why not whats the worse that can happen i die she laughed jeremy started to speak but she waved him off dont think im gonna talk shrinky to hell with that even if i am nuts so what its not my brain were talking about its my heart sometimes there are things we can do to make the experience easier he said relaxation exercises i hate exercise this is more like meditation hypnosis she regarded jeremy through slitted eyes what you want to put me asleep and tell me my hearts okay and the hole closed up by itself if you can pull that off sure lets party sorry said jeremy thats a bit beyond my abilities then who the hell needs you said merilee saunders shaking her fingers as if discarding flecks of filth leave me alone im tired pt more angry than anx understands need for surgery intellec but not emot more discussion of procedure from dr dirgrove recommended pt refuses relaxtrng j carrier phd not one of his triumphs but later that day he picked up his voicemail messages and the third of a dozen said jeremy this is ted dirgrove you were a great help thanks another envelope arrived in the interoffice mail same source otolaryngology once again an unnamed recipient but it had ended up in jeremys stack this one was copied from a fiveyearold gynecology journal laser hysterectomy technique in the treatment of uterine lieomyomata endometriosis and pelvic adhesive inflammation optimally the patient should be positioned in the dorsal lithotomy posture with low stirrups prepped and draped another team of authors physicians and biomedical engineers americans working at a west coast university hospital construction of a bladder flap endoscopic kittner dissection of the broad ligaments jeremy slipped the article back in the envelope walked over to the psychiatry department and asked laura the secretary who disbursed the mail if she had any idea who had delivered the envelope it all comes in a batch from the mail room dr carrier laura was barely twenty just out of junior college still sufficiently green to hold the professional staff in awe this wasnt addressed to me he showed her so it had to be dropped off in person any idea how it got in my pile uhuh sorry when the batch gets here wheres it stored right here she pointed to a bin on the counter just to her left i go through it divide it by staff member and tie up each stack with a rubber band and a postit with your name on it then someone me or a clerk or a volunteer brings it around to each office yours we do last because youre on a different floor so once the batch is divided anyone could insert another envelope into any pile i guess so is something wrong dr carrier no just curious oh she said looking frightened have a nice day he barged in on the ent receptionist a young man beautifully dressed and groomed whose fingers flew over a computer keyboard may i help you he said without looking up same voice jeremy had spoken to when hed inquired about the first envelope jeremy said i have a question about this the young man stopped typing and jeremy handed him the envelope didnt you call me about this before that was the first this is the second so i dont think its an accident ive obviously been confused with someone else the young man inspected the photocopied article hmm well i didnt send it these envelopes get reused all the time i guess someones stockpiling ent envelopes the young man grinned thats because were so charming he tried to hand the article back all yours said jeremy the young man touched his hair first time anyones given me anything in a long long time but no thanks he placed the article on the counter jeremy took it now he wondered dissection of the broad ligaments jeremy returned to his office and called detective bob doresh this time he introduced himself he heard doresh sigh yes doc last time we spoke you called tyrene mazursky a humptydumpty situation and implied jocelyn had been the same i never implied doc i was fine detective lets not quibble ive got a question for you did the murders bear any signs of surgical skill was there any dissection doresh didnt answer detective i heard you doc now why would you be asking that an egg jeremy lied it breaks in clean pieces straight edges theres a certain precision to the destruction is that what you meant when you used the term humptydumpty or were you speaking in general terms doc i dont think im going to get into what i meant doreshs voice had grown soft and threatening nervous jeremy had definitely made him nervous as far as he was concerned that was answer enough all right then sorry for bothering you no bother said doresh we always like to hear from concerned citizens which is how you see yourself right no detective im more than that i loved jocelyn so you told me when we first met did i jeremy harbored only fuzzy memories of the initial encounter at the station small room big men bright lights everything moving at a methedrine pace sure said doresh in fact it was the first thing you said i love her okay said jeremy i thought that was interesting that thats the first thing youd say whys that its just not something ive heard before in that situation there you go said jeremy new experiences every day like a person with alzheimers said doresh thats the good part of the disease right you get to meet new people every day several moments passed doresh said youre not laughing tell me something funny and i will yeah youre right doc tasteless we tend to get that way dealing with the socalled dark side of life to alleviate the stress im sure you understand i do said jeremy thanks for your ms banks said doresh she worked with alzheimers patients all kinds of patients with whadyacallit cognitive problems thats right i hear some folks at the hospital make jokes about that call it the vegetable garden sounds like you guys arent that different than us people need to cope they do howre you coping doc you doing okay otherwise otherwise other than wondering about the evidence oh sure said jeremy lifes a blast he hung up sat there trembling was still unsteady when he walked to the box down the hall and collected his mail totally irrational calling doresh what could he have hoped to accomplish the second article had spooked him made it impossible for him to brush it off as a mail screwup but what if he was wrong and some fool had simply made the same mistake twice dissection even if someone was playing with his head there couldnt be any real connection to jocelyn could it be arthur jeremy entertained visions of the old man stockpiling interoffice envelopes and other hospital supplies in his musty old victorian house retired but hanging on hoarding was consistent with arthurs clothing his car his excessive reminiscences holding on to old things living in the past an inability to let go jeremy vowed to forget about him and the envelopes once and for all time to keep going on his book chapter which miraculously seemed to be falling into place since receiving the first laser article and realizing how poorly written it was how clunky and pompous most medical writing was hed decided he could do better hed written twenty good pages done a redraft felt satisfied he was on his way onward the book and angela theyd seen each other only twice during the last eight days made love on both occasions drunk wine talked for hours seemed to be moving toward that comfort two people experience when the chemistry quiets but doesnt vanish shoptalk with angela had cleared one thing up it was she whod given his name to dr ted dirgrove i was rotating through cardiothoracic and he gave us a terrific lecture on transmyocardial revascularization then he brought up the topic of anxiety as a surgical risk factor and i thought that was admirable for a cutter being concerned about anxiety most of those guys you cant get them to see beyond their scalpels dirgrove actually seems to realize theres a human being at the other end i mentioned the work you did the strides youd made relaxing anxious patients i gave the example of marian boehmer my lupus patient who incidentally is doing fine whatever that blood dysgrasia was it selflimited anyway dirgrove seemed very interested i hope you dont mind not at all said jeremy unfortunately i didnt help his patient much really said angela he said you did i think hes being kind maybe you had more of an effect than you figured jeremy thought about the brief encounter with the hostile merilee saunders and doubted hed accomplished anything other than to convert her anxiety to anger on the other hand that could sometimes be therapeutic if anger made the patient feel in charge reduced the panic that came from crushing vulnerability still it was hard to see the saunders girl as anything more than failed rapport how long had he been with her five ten minutes angela said dirgrove sounded pretty pleased he supposed she could be right thered been instances when patients got in touch years after treatment to thank him some were specific about what had helped things hed said or hadnt word choices and phraseologies that had proved crucial in tipping them over the therapeutic brink in every case the cure had been unintentional hed had no idea hed shot the magic bullet then there were the cases where hed drawn upon every technique in his shrinks arsenal and fallen flat on his face what did that say that he was a pawn not a king what a strange way to make a living i think said angela that you sometimes sell yourself short do you he kissed her nose i do she ran her fingers through his hair youre a nice woman sometimes i havent seen otherwise ha she said are you trying to scare me no she said suddenly serious she pressed her cheek close to his her breath was warm light alcoholically sweet id never do that id never do anything to put space between us tumor board was canceled for the week the following session arthur was back at the lectern running the show jeremy arrived late and had to sit at the rear the room was dark slides always slides and it stayed that way for most of the hour the old mans sonorous baritone rhapsodizing about mediastinal teratomas but when the lights went on arthur was gone and dr singh had taken his place explaining dr chess had to leave early for a prior engagement let us proceed the final ten minutes were taken up by a spirited debate about cell permeability jeremy had trouble staying awake managed to do so by scolding himself at least this is science not some randomized process where the socalled expert doesnt have a clue the next day the third envelope arrived jeremy had nearly finished a rough draft of his chapter and was feeling pretty flush the sight of otolaryngology in the sender slot froze his fingers on the keyboard he thought about throwing it out unopened couldnt resist temptation and tore the flap so hard the little metal clasp flew off no medical reprint inside instead jeremy extracted a newspaper clipping crumbling at the edges and browned with age no identifying marks the article had been trimmed well below the upper margin but the tone and the locale suggested a british tabloid vanished bridgets chum found murdered two years ago pretty bridget sapsted left a pub in broadstairs kent after a night of serving pints only to vanish despite extensive police inquiries the fate of the lovely lass was never discovered now a close friend of the pretty brunette has been murdered brutally and efforts are being made to learn if the fate of one girl is connected to that of the other the case took a grisly twist when early this morning the body of yr old suzie clevington was found by a man walking to work on the outskirts of broadstairs suzie and the vivacious bridget had been classmates at belvington school branchwillow kent and the two girls had remained fast friends with aspirations as a dancer suzie had spent some time in london and on the continent but had returned home recently to seek employment opportunities at this point said the principal investigator det insp nigel langdon we are treating these as independent incidents however should the facts warrant we will pursue them as related in response to rumours that the body had undergone horrible mutilation det insp langdon would say only that the police could not reveal all the details of the case in the interest of an efficient investigation suzie clevington was described by friends and family as an outgoing friendly and there the article ended cut off in midsentence laser scalpels female surgery a dead girl mutilation a humptydumpty situation this was not a postal screwup someone in the hospital wanting jeremy to know who could it be other than arthur he called arthurs office no answer was the old man still caught up in yesterdays prior engagement the exigent circumstance that had caused the pathologist to flee tumor board before the meeting had ended jeremy realized something all three envelopes had arrived during periods when arthur had been impossible to reach what was that an alibi for what slipping on his white coat he walked to the faculty office and lied to the secretary an exceptionally cheerful woman named anna colon with whom hed always gotten along about having bought a gift for dr chess and needing a home address i didnt know you two were friends anna said as she handed over the blackbound medical staff binder not thinking to ask if so why dont you know his address some people were blessed with a trusting nature jeremy often woke up in the middle of the night mistrusting his own existence he said were more like pupil and student dr chess has taught me a lot and i wanted to repay the favor well thats nice here you go not the victorian house in queens arms that jeremy had conjured an apartment in ash view the southern suburbs far from the water a good twenty miles out of the city wrong yet again everything about arthur seemed to be taking him by surprise or perhaps arthur had given him hints ash view had once been farmland and arthur had spoken fondly of agrarian roots birthing calves a sanguinary process the old man had grisly sensibilities did he sense that jeremy shared them because of jocelyn lately hed been thinking more about jocelyn he could talk to angela make love to angela but jocelyn so gone he needed to see the old man he hurried to the wards early saw his patients hoped hed shortchanged none of them because his mind was elsewhere people smiled at him familiar smiles grateful smiles a wife thanked him a daughter squeezed his hand and told him her mother looked forward to his visits he was the one doctor who didnt hurt her he couldnt be screwing up too badly fraud that he was tomorrow hed do better he drove his nova out of the doctors lot just after noon a rare dry day but a mournful one flyingsaucer rain clouds looming over the skyline blackening the roiling waters of the windwhipped lake the promised installment of another storm seemed to be bewitching motorists from the time jeremy got on the asa brander bridge until he exited onto an industrial road that fed to the southern turnpike he witnessed multiple driving aberrations near collisions and finally one accident that bred detours and congestion and foul tempers finally he squeezed onto the toll road battled traffic for miles before the midday commuter clog dropped off and he was sailing zipping through the flatlands hed consulted a map before setting out but nearly missed the obscure lefthand exit that took him past a cemetery big as a town middleclass shopping and several retirement communities each of them touting independent living had arthur opted for that canasta and bingo and accordion concerts he and the doting wife blending in a cheerfully colored sign said two miles to ash view the terrain stepped down a notch workingclass shopping gas stations tire dealers shacks whose scratchy lawns accommodated rusting autos a far cry from the splendor of ccc whatever that stood for jeremy passed a dairy queen and a dennys and three hamburger chains far cry from foie gras too independent living by day gourmandizing by night arthur chess was a man to be reckoned with ash view was empty land and stray dogs and scattered multiple dwellings arthurs address matched a large flatroofed frame house overlooking what had once been a wheatfield and was now just endless acres of grass the nearest landmark was a quarter mile north a dormant drivein theater with a chipped marquee the rain clouds turned the flatlands to shadowy moonscape jeremy parked and studied the building once elegant now shabby and subdivided not all that different from angelas place the old man lived in a rooming house had chosen to distance himself from the pleasures of the city and who knew what else a detached carriage house to the right of the main building had been converted to a fourcar garage four closed doors but no locks in sight jeremy got out lifted the lefthand door and found a nissan the next stall contained a ford falcon the third was empty and the last harbored arthurs black lincoln town car prior engagement the old man had cut out from tumor board early and simply gone home jeremy climbed the big houses cement steps read the names on the weathered brass mailbox a chess no degree listed lived in unit four the front door was etched glass a remnant of bygone glory jeremy opened it up the stairs and to the right the house smelled of corn and curdled milk and laundry detergent the stairway was steep guided by a spotless white wooden rail the walls were textured plaster the same white just as clean below jeremys feet were weathered pine boards under a welltrod blue carpet old wood but not a single squeak the building was maintained lovingly arthurs door was unidentified as such okay here we go jeremys knock was met with silence arthur he called no response louder rapping caused the door of the unit across the landing to crack as he repeated arthurs name and appended his own the crack widened and jeremy made eye contact with a single dark iris hi he said im dr carrier and im looking for dr chess the door opened on a short round sweetlooking woman in a pale yellow housedress she had white hair and dramatic russet brown eyebrows someone else of arthurs generation she held a flowered teacup in one hand and smiled at him her eyes were a darker brown as deep as brown can be without veering into black large hoop earrings tugged at her lobes like an old fortuneteller was the professor expecting you dear not exactly said jeremy i work at central hospital and theres a treatment issue to discuss an emergency not quite maam but an important issue oh and you came all the way out here how dedicated its such a fine hospital all my children were born there professor chess was a young man back then tall and handsome he had an excellent bedside manner she giggled of course i was young too he did a masterful job professor chess delivered your babies oh yes i know hes a pathologist now but back in those days he did all kinds of medicine what a wonderful man i was so pleased to find out wed be neighbors im afraid hes not in dear any idea where he went oh he travels all the time said the woman shall i tell him you were by doctor carrier so hes definitely traveling oh yes when professor chess travels i pick up his mail see to his messages she smiled shifted her teacup to her left hand and extended her right ramona purveyance jeremy crossed the landing her palm was soft slightly moist chubby fingers exerted no pressure he said he does like to travel ramona purveyance nodded with enthusiasm jeremy said i wonder how long hell be gone this time hard to say sometimes its a day sometimes its a week he sends me postcards where from everywhere come ill show them to you jeremy followed her into a compact apartment brightened by rear windows that afforded a view of the infinite grass a meadow really with just the faintest rise as it swooped toward the horizon a dozen or so ravens circled blending with the sooty sky only to dart out into the fissures of light that separated the storm clouds the effect was startling airborne static ramona purveyance said theyre always out there beautiful things despite their reputation what reputation is that you know like in the bible noah sent the raven out to seek peace but the raven failed it was the dove that brought back the olive branch nevertheless i consider them beautiful creatures not peaceful though sometimes we get cardinals lovely red things that they are the ravens scare them off she placed her teacup on a low glass coffee table waddled to a maple bureau opened a top drawer and said im pretty sure i put them in here jeremy looked around the flat the walls were painted green a hospital green and the furniture was newish and blond and inexpensive a couple of prints framed seascapes clipped from calendars were the sole art pieces no bricabrac no mementos none of the family history youd expect for an old woman but that was a foolish assumption a romanticized version of family life things fell apart or never took off what would he have to show when he was old ramona purveyance opened drawers closed them repeated the process said hmm the living room opened to a small spotless kitchen if the woman cooked her cuisine left no scent ah here we go she said in her hand was a sheaf of postcards bound by a wide red rubber band without hesitation she handed them to jeremy the first dozen or so were from overseas london paris constantinople stockholm munich the canal zone arthur revisiting his old military haunts brazil argentina the next batch were all american oregons crater lake new york city st louis los angeles bryce canyon santa fe new mexico beautiful pictures of familiar landmarks on one side the same message on the other in a familiar hand dear mrs p traveling and learning ac ramona purveyance said hes a dear to remember since ive known him hes lived here jeremy lied must be ten years she said five years after i arrived its a quiet place for some city people the adjustment is hard not for the professor he sold his big house and its contents and fit in quite beautifully the house in queens arms oh yes said ramona he showed me pictures a big old thing victorian something right finally mustve been a lovely place to live in she went on fine old furniture those pretty leaded glass windows but far too spacious for one person the professor told me hed knocked around there far too long well after he should have she flinched are you a pathologist as well dr carrier psychologist after he should have mrs purveyance the chocolate eyes remained steady after he realized how ill suited such a big place was for a person living alone being alone can be an adjustment have you ever lived alone doctor always ramona purveyance knitted her fingers and studied him a psychologist that must be quite interesting smiling but something in her tone told jeremy she couldnt have cared less he said professor chess and i discuss interesting clinical issues from time to time hes deeply interested in psychosocial topics of course he is she said the mans as curious as a child sometimes i see him out there she motioned out the window to the endless grass ravens had congregated near the horizon small and black as flyspecks he walks and explores kneels and peels back the grass looks for insects and whatnot sometimes he brings his metal detector and just goes clicking around sometimes he brings a garden spade and digs around has he ever found anything oh absolutely arrowheads old coins bottles once he found a pearl necklace that he gave to me small baroque pearls some were pitted but overall still lovely i gave the necklace to my granddaughter lucy shes just old enough to appreciate things of beauty the worlds a treasure trove if you know where to look she eyed the door would you like some tea no thanks id better be going dr carrier she said that term you usedpsychosocial what exactly does that mean she canted her head to one side a parody of coyness i do like to work on my vocabulary the interaction between psychology and social issues issues that confront society poverty crime violence professor chess is especially interested in criminal violence ramona purveyance looked down at her hands i see well ive got laundry to do shall i tell him you were by sure thanks said jeremy i guess we have no idea when hes coming back did he pack a large suitcase i wouldnt know sir said ramona retrieving her teacup the contents mustve been cold but she sipped slowly over the rim of the cup the dark eyes studied him no idea said jeremy he slipped a note under my door asking me to look after his mail last night he mustve done it late because i was up until eleven when i woke up at six he was gone the teacup lowered ramona purveyances expression was bland but her eyes were guarded jeremy smiled thats professor chess driving off on another adventure in that beautiful lincoln it is a lovely car isnt it he maintains it like a clock washing polishing vacuuming every week but no i wouldnt think hed take it when he travels he generally has a cab pick him up or he drives his other car and leaves it at the airport his other car his van she said hes got a ford van an old one but in perfect shape he told me he bought it at a city auction used to belong to the coroners office isnt that a bit delicious the old woman hugged herself professor chess assured me it had been cleaned out thoroughly they always are they said jeremy morgue things another giggle death things halfway back to the city the storm hit jeremy fishtailed for miles drove with a misted windshield felt his brakes lose confidence was nearly part of a sevencar pileup toward the end he gave himself over to the fates miraculously he arrived home in one piece and had a dinner of canned soup and toast and black coffee the following night he and angela finally stole away from the hospital and he took her to a higher grade of restaurant than ever before off hale boulevard on the north end because of the weather they rode in a taxi and jeremy supplied umbrellas for both of them a lesson from arthur the place was green suede walls granite banquettes starched linens the color of fresh butter on the way to their rear booth jeremy and angela passed an iced case of fish so fresh the creatures eyes stared back reproachfully another containing fatmarbled prime cuts of beef and pork pugnacious lobsters their pincers bound clawed the spotless sides of a tenfoot aquarium the savagery of good living jeremy had made a reservation two days before and gotten another resident to cover for angela a guy whod rotated through psych as an intern and sat in on a couple of jeremys lectures the ambience the food all that was great the planning was what impressed angela to the point of moist eyes she sat right up against him their thighs laminating after this how am i going to go back to residents fare ease into it said jeremy avoid undue sensory shock this is pretty shocking she said being treated like this ill bet youre no stranger to that why do you say that only daughter in a professional family something tells me youve experienced the finer things in life youre right she said they raised me with love gave me what i wanted always told me i could achieve anything i put my mind to by all accounts i should never lose confidence right but i do nearly every day this job all those people depending on me what if i misplace a decimal place on an order or fail to catch it when someone else does that actually happened to me when i was an intern some puffedup attending more concerned about billing than taking care of his patients dashed off an insulin scrip for a diabetic a hundred times too much we wouldve had a sudden death and everyone wouldve been puzzled you caught it said jeremy she nodded a china doll waitress brought complimentary melon liqueur in tiny green glasses and a lacquered tray of various fried things angela massaged her glass picked up a baby octopus muttered too cruel and placed it back on the plate so you saved a life good for you i almost didnt catch it jer the syringe was already loaded prepared by a nurse and i was supposed to give the shot and i just happened to glance down and read the order ill never forget the look on the patients face an old guy an old sturdy guy whod operated heavy machinery in his heyday and still liked to flirt he mustve seen my face realized how thrown i was he said everything okay girlie sure i said and i made a big show of inspecting the syringe then i lied told him something was wrong with the needle too many air bubbles we needed to get a fresh one i left him there tossed that damn syringe in the nearest biohazard bin called the head nurse over and showed her the order this was a smart woman an experienced woman she knew as much about dosages as most physicians she said oh my then she recovered and it was of course were not going to tell anyone are we and i said of course not she suggested i alter the original order to where it shouldve been and i did then i loaded up a new syringe went back in gave the poor patient his shot he smiled at me there you are i been missin you maybe you and i can go out some day honeybunch cut a rug i smiled back too shaken up to be offended and besides hes an old guy another generation how can you take offense i said well mr so and so you just never know and when i left i give my rear a little shake to cheer him up i know it was tacky but this guy almost died and i was almost the one who killed him he deserved a little joy no a little atonement from me too her lips shook lifting the tiny green glass she tossed back her drink jeremy said nothing to atone for youre the hero of the story pure luck so close since then ive been paranoid about dosages double and triplecheck everything maybe itll make me a better doctor you know the worst part of it the attending the idiot who couldnt keep his decimal places straight he never knew we protected him never told him so what does that make me a coconspirator if youd told him hed have denied it and youd have come out the worst for it i know i know angela said miserable this is some romantic evening im sorry jer jeremy nuzzled the warm sweet place behind her ear so smooth women so finely wrought she said youre a wonderful guy please lets keep this going a week later he received a postcard from oslo stunning photography some place called the vigeland sculpture gardens monumental carvings of hypermuscular figures displayed in a verdant parklike setting to jeremys eye the images were aggressively proletarianwagnerian on the back of the card was foreslanted writing in black fountain pen ink dear dr c traveling and learning ac the old guy picks up and leaves just like that and why not arthur was retired lived alone had no work obligations had downsized jeremy was certain the victorian had been abandoned for some reason other than arthurs sudden insight that the house was too large ramona purveyance knew the reason shed almost let it sliphed knocked around there too long after but when jeremy had pressed shed finessed had there been some tragedy in arthurs life some lifechanging event perhaps the old man had simply confronted one of lifes routine tragedies widowerhood loss of the doting wife jeremy had imagined that wouldve been more than enough to insult arthurs gregariousness leading him to seek his pleasures elsewhere late suppers with likeminded eccentrics jeremy placed the postcard in a desk drawer the next time he saw anna the faculty office secretary he thanked her for providing arthurs address told her arthur loved the gift was now traveling yes he does that she said sends me the prettiest postcards so considerate a good way to occupy oneself said jeremy what is travel what with his living alone and all that im sure youre right how long has he been single anna said ever since ive known him i believe hes always been single dr carrier confirmed bachelor and all that a pity wouldnt you say such a nice man living single meant you could hop to the airport charm the ticket agent board loosen your shoelaces nibble salted nuts down a martini with two pearl onions and settle back for the long flight if arthur was behind the interoffice envelopes hed sent jeremy two articles on laser surgery and left the country shortly after posting an old clipping about a missing english girl and her murdered chum at least jeremy had assumed the story was old because of the dry brown paper what was the point a crimehistory lesson wanting jeremy to ponder yet another example of very bad behavior wanting to lead jeremy somewhere if so the old man was being maddeningly oblique where was the clipping jeremy searched his desk remembered hed thrown it out what was the murdered girls name suzie something a surname beginning with c he struggled to retrieve the memory felt it evade him maddeningly a sour aftertaste lodged in the soft spongy tissue behind his tongue but the other name came to him unbidden the girl who had vanished an unusual namesapsted bridget sapsted he turned on his antiquated computer endured the squawks of his temperamental modem the hospital had converted to word processing years after every other health facility still refused to install an integrated system sat back and counted the dots in his acoustical tile ceiling until he finally connected to the internet he entered the missing girls name into a search engine heard the computer hum and snore and flatulate indatagestion three hits all from british tabloids the case wasnt ancient at all the acidlaced pulp paper had deteriorated quickly six years ago as the clipping had stated bridget sapsted had gone missing two years later bridget sapsted had been found dead the young womans skeletonized remains had been buried shallowly in a densely wooded area less than a quarter mile from those of her chum suzie clevington found three weeks after suzie nothing left but bones the coroner estimated that bridget sapsted had been interred for the full two years before being sniffed out by dogs finding suzie helped narrow the search said det insp nigel langdon we are now considering both young ladies the victims of the same killer for evidentiary reasons we are unable to divulge an explanation for that assumption at the present time jeremy plugged the policeman into several data banks only one hit for any nigel langdon and it had nothing to do with police work last year a man by that name had delivered a lecture on the cultivation of peonies to the millicent haverford memorial garden club kent same district had to be the same guy perhaps the det insp had also retired chosen quieter pursuits jeremy phoned overseas information was stalled by several false starts finally connected to the right english operator and obtained a listed number for a nigel langdon in broadstairs where the murdered girls had gone to school the time difference made it evening in england but still early enough for a polite call he punched in the number listened to the overseas squawk was momentarily stunned when a cheerful womans voice chirped hallo who is it then is mr langdon there please watching the telly who shall i say is calling dr carrier from the united states the states youre joking not at all is this mrs langdon last i checked no joke what then what kind of an american doctor are you a psychologist said jeremy im a friend of dr arthur chess are you now said the woman im sure thats good for him whoever he is so you think nige needs a headshrink nothing like that mrs langdon dr arthur chess professor chess is a renowned pathologist with an interest in one of mr langdons cases we are talking about detective inspector nigel langdon retired inspector nigeys well past all that ugly business its the murdered girls right has to be that as a matter of fact yes aha so whos the detective in this family the woman laughed how did you know said jeremy because its the only case niges been involved with any psychologist would be interested in had to be a crazy man it did but i shouldnt say more indiscreet and all that what do you and your professor friend want with nigey id just like to ask him a few questions you and everyone else theres been recent curiosity about the case not recent but after it happened when they found the second one bridget you couldnt keep this phone cold silence on the line the woman said thank goodness all thats passed so you want to talk to him eh i would appreciate it just for a i suppose it wouldnt hurt lately hes been complaining about boredom nige the mans voice was clogged as if hed stuffed his mouth full of eggs whats this he demanded something about suzie and bridget who are you whats this about jeremy spun a web about arthurs forensic skills erudite discussions between the two of them concerning important cases the old man asking jeremy to do psychosocial followup on cases he believed were yet unresolved well this is certainly buggerall unresolved grumbled nigel langdon never closed it surprised me at every turn what with two bodies i thought thered be more one of those serial things you know but that was it two bastard ravaged those poor girls and just stopped one of them had a boyfriend a bad lot served some time in broadmoor for assault i was certain hed be the one but he had an alibi locked up in broadmoor thats about as good as it gets wouldnt you say other than him nothing now good night ravaged said jeremy was there sexual assault i was speaking dramatically sir why should i tell you its a bit impertinent one more question inspector langdon please was there evidence of surgical precision to the murders silence what said langdon are you really asking just that were the bodies dissected with notable skill something that implied medical expertise whered you say you were from lad city central hospital jeremy rattled off the address told langdon hed be happy to give his number and langdon could call to verify langdon broke in why all this curiosity from city central hospital sir just what i said inspector intellectual curiosity and a deep concern on professor chesss part and mine about psychosocial issues the origins of violence have a case like it over there do you jeremy hesitated langdon said i give all the answers and you go dumb its possible inspector nothing decisive professor chess is a pathologist worked at the coroners office here he and i review cases youve never heard of professor chess chess as in the game exactly no cant say as i have hes worldrenowned said jeremy currently hes traveling in oslo too bad for him said langdon as an overgrown fishing village its not halfbad but those blokes sardines and oil is all theyre about which makes sense har used to eating their fishies oily and got themselves bloody rich on oil the norsers worse than the arabs all that money and they cant bring themselves to install indoor plumbing in their summer homes still walk around with rucksacks does that make sense to you rich men eschewing indoor plumbing a long speech langdons voice had risen anxiety and jeremy wondered if hed prattled to hide something youve been to oslo inspector been all kinds of places said langdon anyway i am going to cut you off now because youre bringing nasty stuff back into my life give me flowers i like flowers flowers dont rip each other apart for no good reason then disappear and never show their ugly psychopath faces again snorting once he cut the connection langdon had been to oslo and didnt want to talk about it jeremy thought about that decided there was nowhere else to take it that was that but it wasnt two days later he received an email from nigellfleuruklinknet ever the detective langdon had remembered jeremys name and that of the hospital traced his faculty account obtained his address dear dr jeremy carrier i fear i may have been unnecessarily curt with you during our recent phone chat perhaps i can be forgiven that curtness due to the unannounced nature of your call and the unpleasant subject matter foisted upon me by you during an otherwise restful evening however i do feel it incumbent upon me to pass along the following truths with regard to your inquiry about various aspects of cases we discussed that have passed from under my responsibility im afraid im not able to divulge details especially as said cases remain open the new man in charge of the clevingtonsapsted file is det insp michael b shreve however to my knowledge he is not actively investigating these cases as they have been deemed inactive pending new evidence none of which to my knowledge has surfaced therefore they are likely to remain closed however i have now passed along det insp shreves name to you and feel that with that action i have acquitted my responsibilities in this matter furthermore i doubt that det insp shreve would fancy discussing said case with nonpolice personnel however here is his phone number should you decide to persist best wishes nigel a langdon very definitely ret jeremy phoned michael b shreves office and was informed by an officious male officer that the detective inspector was on holiday until when until he returns sir when might that be im not at liberty to divulge personal details sir jeremy left his name and number and the fact that he was inquiring about suzie clevington and bridget sapsted if that rang a bell with mr officious he gave no indication is he in norway thank you sir good day sir something that had never happened before jeremy forgot to turn off his pager and it went off during a therapy session the patient was a thirtyyearold man named josh hammett an electrician undergoing a final set of skin grafts for deeptissue burns suffered last year when a stormsnapped power line had scythed across his chest and severed his left arm months after the amputation phantom pain had set in and when nothing else seemed to work the plastic surgeon put in a psych consult this was the sixth time jeremy had seen the young man josh had proved an excellent hypnotic subject responding readily even eagerly to jeremys suggestion that his arm had found a peaceful resting place now he reclined on a couch in the treatment room with jeremy hovering near his head breathing slowly regularly the innocent smile of a dreaming toddler spread across his lips the bleating at jeremys belt failed to rouse him deeply under jeremy switched off the beeper let him stay wherever he was for a longer while than usual finally brought him out gradually when the young man thanked him and told him he felt great really great fantastic actually jeremy turned it back on him you did all the work josh youre excellent at this think so doc definitely youre as good as it gets josh beamed i never thought it was something i could do doc tell the truth when you first mentioned it i thought it was boguspocus but that powerboard idea ended being a great idea the minute i visualize it all the circuits in place see all those lights blinking everything working real smooth i just go right under like that he snapped the fingers of his only hand today he went on i really got into it pictured i was fishing out off the sound hauling up pike and whitefish so many it was almost too much for the boat i tell you i could smell those guys frying in the pan set aside some for me you bet doc jeremy left the treatment room content angelas number on the beeper brought a smile to his face ive got half an hour she said when he reached her on the thoracic ward how about coffee and danish in the ddr im on my way when he got to the doctors dining room she was sitting at a table with ted dirgrove the heart surgeon coffee and a chocolate cruller sat in front of her nothing in front of dirgrove he was out of his crimson scrubs wore his white coat buttoned in the exposed v was the curve of a black tshirt very hip he got up as jeremy approached hey jeremy ted dirgrove turned to angela ill be doing it on thursday so if you want to watch no prob just let my secretary know thanks dr dirgrove dirgrove returned his attention to jeremy ive been meaning to call you about the saunders girl everything okay not quite said the surgeon his spider fingers flexed and his bony face turned rigid she died on the table god what happened dirgrove rubbed an eye probably a reaction to anesthesia one of those idiopathic things her vitals went haywire a peak just what i was worried about then a really deep trough everything just tanked at first i was sure it was a typical anesthesia screwup tube down the esophagus instead of the airway because all of a sudden her oxygenation just plummeted it stinks but it happens you spot it you fix it the gaspasser checked and everything was in place he just couldnt stop her from losing function id opened her retracted the sternum had just gotten to the heart dirgrove related the incident in a hollow voice as if projecting through a bamboo tube his eyes were weary but hed shaved closely this morning and looked well put together everything was rolling along fine then she was gone it just stinks jeremy thought of the chubby young woman with the multipierced ears and the unruly hair all that anger dirgrove picking her out as highrisk i come into this hellhole feeling fine and tomorrow im gonna wake up feeling like i got run over by a truck youre an adult and its your body so if you have serious reservations nah ill go with the flow whats the worse that can happen i die stinks bad said jeremy stinks to high hell dirgrove rolled his shoulders the autopsy results should come in shortly no sense dwelling he walked off poor man said angela poor patient said jeremy his tone was harsh and she blanched youre right im sorry im sorry said jeremy im on edge he sat down opposite her reached for her hand she offered her fingertips cold dry it took me by surprise when i didnt hear from him again i assumed terrible she said any other reason youre on edge too much work not enough play wish i could play with you but theyre exploiting me too he looked at her cruller she said take it im finished youre sure more than sure breaking off a piece he chewed swallowed i didnt mean to snap at you its okay he shouldnt have dropped it on you like that i guess i felt sorry for him because i identified with him losing a patient its what we all dread and sooner or later its going to happen ive lost a few already but i wasnt the attending they werent really my patients thats one good thing about what you do isnt it patients dont die not for the most part theres always suicide said jeremy yes of course what was i thinking she drew back her hand ran it through her hair her eyelids were heavy im not doing very well am i too much work not enough play i did love that dinner though that was a great escape i like the things you do for me jeremy her hand returned to his the entire hand her skin had warmed may i ask you something she said when it does happen a suicide or when a consult patient goes like this one how do you deal with it you convince yourself you did your best and move on basically what dirgrove said no sense dwelling basically said jeremy you cant be a robot but you cant bleed for everyone either so you learn to do that distance yourself you have to he said or you wither guess so want coffee no im fine jeremy got up poured himself a cup from the doctors urn and returned angela said the girl who died do you think there couldve been something to dirgroves worries what she scared herself to death nothing that pat yes i suppose that is what i mean could there be something unconscious going on is there a death force that grows in some people and takes them down causes their autonomic system to go haywire poisons their system with stress hormone isnt there some tribe in vietnam that has a high rate of sudden death nothings predictable is it you go through all that basic science in premed think youve got a handle on it then you see things patients coming in looking hopeless but they recover and walk out on their own two feet others who arent that sick end up on the wrong side of the m and m reports morbidity and mortality the righthand column reserved for deaths the m and ms were the purview of arthurs department the old man again let him stay in scandinavia consuming lutefisk and pornography and whatever else they produced there angela was saying what if the difference isnt what i do what if it comes down to psych factors or voodoo for all we know theres the equivalent of a psychic virus that colonizes our basic survival instincts and bends us to its will merilee saunders couldve felt it taking her over thats why she was nervous she smiled weird i am definitely sleepdeprived jeremy pictured merilees face angry taut with knowing what youre talking about he said is an autoimmune disorder of the soul angela stared at him what is it he said what you just said autoimmune disorder of the soul the way you phrase things i wish youd talk more i love listening to you he said nothing she squeezed his hand hard i mean it i could never put it that way psychic virus is pretty good no she said words arent my thing all through school i aced math and science but throw a threeparagraph essay at me and im lost her eyes looked feverish a faint sweat had broken out on her upper lip you okay he said tired thats all ill bet essays came easy for you he laughed you should only know he told her about his struggle to write the book youll do it she said youve been distracted by what you tell me he laughed again and ate the rest of the cruller jeremy you master words they dont master you words are all ive got ang youve got science backing you up for me its what i say and when i say it period at root its a primitive field she placed a cool finger on his lips and he smelled betadine and french soap the next time were together she said tell me more about yourself the next time was two days later at angelas apartment she was off call working mere fifteenhour days had somehow found time to fix a beefandbean casserole and a salad of baby greens they ate on the secondhand couch listening to music her taste was rock about ten years too current for jeremy for the first time he spent the night he did talk not about himself about angela telling her she was beautiful letting her know how she made him feel she kept her eyes on him until pleasure forced her to close them after they washed and dried the dishes they returned to the couch and entwined she clawed him wrapped around him like a crab engulfing its dinner and after it was over they stumbled to her bed and slept until daybreak he drove her to the hospital and dropped her off at the elevators after buying a newspaper in the gift shop he grabbed vending machine coffee and brought caffeine and the days tragedies to his office he flipped pages idly same old stuff then an item at the rear of the metro section stopped his breathing a woman had been murdered last night just east of iron mount not far from where tyrene mazursky had been savaged an unnamed woman her body had been left out in the open on a sand spit north of the harbor called saugatuck finger jeremy knew the place a boomerangshaped quarter mile of gritty silica surrounded on three sides by pines and spruce and dotted by the occasional rickety picnic table nothing to do there but kick sand and toe out into pebblebottomed lapping water that looked cleaner than it was sometimes a stink rose from the cove poor families could be seen picnicking on the spit during the friendly months when the sky turned to pigiron no one came an abandoned spot at night it would be ghostly the article offered no further details and made no attempt to connect the killing to tyrene mazursky humptydumpty on the beach jeremy fought the urge to call doresh he put the paper aside and tackled the nearly completed first draft of his chapter time to earn angelas praise hed thought of a few more research suppositions he wanted to add in the end the chapter had turned out nearly twice as long as hed intended hed known more than he thought he did knew nothing about the woman on saugatuck finger he said screw all that and wrote all morning the next day detective inspector michael shreve phoned him from england just as he was about to leave for lunch what time was it there pm shreve sounded alert sounded younger than nigel langdon and more levelheaded clear voice educated enunciation he returned jeremys greeting heartily good day to you too doctor thanks for calling back inspector not a chance i wouldnt sir a doctor from america calls me my curiosity gets the best of me why dont you tell me whats on your mind jeremy spun him the same tale hed offered langdon shreve said professor arthur chess you know him no but perhaps i should is he something on the order of your local sherlock holmes not quite said jeremy just a venerated doctor with a curious mind you work with him at city central hospital i see and professor chess spoke to you about our girls he sent me an old clipping of the case wed been talking about the origin of criminal violence i suppose it struck him as an example sent you said shreve hes traveling where to sir oslo ah said shreve not the worst time of year for the upper regions but not happy either theyd be getting a bit of daylight thats all like langdon shreve spoke about norway as if hed been there you know oslo inspector as a tourist this professor chess would you say his curiosity is focused on any specific aspect of our case as i said hes interested in the genesis of violence said jeremy he switched to a bald lie the question also came up about a surgical quality to the murders did it professor chess had this question yes whys that i couldnt say inspector he brought it up notated it on the clippingdear jeremy do you suppose this could be surgical ah what a tangled web we weave hmm said shreve a pathologist do you suppose he was relating our poor girls to a case of his not to my knowledge hes no longer a forensic pathologist but he was at one time years ago inspector we barely spoke before he left then i got the clipping inspector langdons name was in it so i phoned him out of curiosity he referred me to you and i did the same ive probably overreacted wasted your time im sorry sir from oslo said shreve as if he hadnt heard thats where the card came from yes it bore a picture of the vigeland sculpture gardens aha well sir as you know these cases remain open so im afraid i cant divulge any details however feel free to pass along the following to your professor we continue to seek a solution weve eliminated no one ill tell him as you wish doctor good talking to you both detectives had been to norway and now arthur was there norway had piqued shreves interest a northern link to killings in england to killings here jeremy remembered the authorship of the first laser scalpel article eye doctors from norway and russia and england americans in the second reprint hed tossed both he logged onto the ovid medical database strained to recall the exact title of the norwegian article but couldnt coming up with the date seventeen years ago helped somewhat and he ended up winnowing through three dozen citations until he found the right one seven authors three ophthalmologists from the royal medical college of oslo an equal number of moscowbased eye surgeons on sabbatical in the norwegian capital and a british physicist who worked for the manufacturer of the laser no names that meant anything to him he wrote them all on a card and filed it away no real reason except he was tired of retrieving lost information he spent the rest of the morning in psychiatry department meetings fatuous stuff the usual suspects droning he pretended to be awake shrugged off the invitation by three other shrinks to have lunch and returned to his office detective bob doresh was waiting outside his door hello doctor hello detective can i come in jeremy shoved the door open and allowed doreshs beefy body to pass doresh wore a grayblue raincoat and gave off a seawater odor his size made the office seem even smaller than it was he stood dangling thick arms until jeremy invited him to sit so doc howve things been going youre here because of the woman at saugatuck finger said jeremy another humptydumpty situation doresh eyed jeremys coffeemaker the scorched swill jeremy still brewed daily but rarely drank its stale but youre welcome to some detective thanks doresh stretched for a mug managed to fill it without getting up he drank grimaced put the mug down as advertised doc ever been out to the finger a few times said jeremy i drive out there occasionally during the summer pretty place not really if you look closely the filth in the water becomes obvious i grew up miles from water so im easy to please who was she another one said doresh a streetwalker the detective didnt answer jeremy said and youre here because your last call to me about the mazursky woman i could see youre really interested in all of this seeing as my partner and i havent exactly racked up any bigtime progress i thought maybe i could tap into some of your insights bravo jeremy loosened his tie what a sterling line of bullshit doresh crossed his legs and dangled a thick ankle and looked injured jeremy said for some unfathomable reason you consider me a suspect in all this if you want me to account for my whereabouts last night all i can tell you is i was home watching tv and sleeping alone this time i didnt have the foresight to call out for food so theres no delivery boy to verify my presence doctor i know you follow protocol doctors do too most of our cancer patients are treated by protocol but we leave room for creativity and so should you granted those close to the victim always fall under scrutiny so even though being put through the wringer on jocelyn made a hellish experience even worse i understand it but by now the other two killings prostitutes that would make no sense switching from a girlfriend to strangers it doesnt happen that way does it doresh picked up the mug stared into it transferred it to his other hand like you say doctor theres always room for creativity stick around long enough and everything happens he cupped a knee with his free palm and sat forward the question you asked me about surgical precision where did that really come from as i told you my humptydumpty remark right doresh smiled most of his teeth were white and even but a single corn yellow canine snaggled and caught on his upper lip he curled the purplish tissue back and the smile turned predatory now whos laying on the bullshit thats all it was said jeremy humptydumpty images i wish you hadnt told me bothered you did it i couldve done with not knowing overactive imagination doc jeremy didnt answer doresh said must be helpful for all that hypnotizing you do my wife tried that being hypnotized wanted to lose weight so her doctor sent her to some guy downtown did it help not one damn bit said doresh no matter i love her huge he put the mug down and used both hands to shape a wide hourglass you know what thats like loving a woman so bad you dont care what she looks like or does jeremys face went hot then cold he felt as if he were changing colors chameleonlike livid to pallid not blending in just the opposite betraying his vulnerability doresh was studying him serene jeremy breathed slowly deeply keeping his rage in his belly no way would he let this bastard in youre a romantic mr doresh do you buy your wife flowers are you good about remembering anniversaries do the two of you trade pet names now it was the detectives turn to color anything else said jeremy as a matter of fact said doresh i was wondering about dr chess hes your pal right he have theories about the cases so that was it detective inspector michael shreve ever the inquisitive detective ever the suspicious sonofabitch had gotten off the phone with him and worked feverishly at finding a colleague in this city on the trail of a psychopathic killer something jeremy had said or had failed to say had revved the englishmans suspicions and hed decided to check things out the surgical question had to be the surgical question meaning hed been right about the english murders or rather arthur had he said dr chess has a general interest in crime hes a pathologist used to work at the coroners office did he so what does he think insightwise that i couldnt tell you said jeremy hes traveling right now where norway pretty place said doresh him too ever been there said jeremy the detective snorted except for the army ive been out of the country exactly once four days in rome and that was years ago my wife likes to eat she came back all excited about learning to cook italian but its still pot roast and macaroni casserole doreshs domesticity set jeremys teeth on edge lucky man whered you serve in the army detective philippines how bout you any service you dont know why would i i figured youve checked me out thoroughly doreshs smile said jeremy had delusions of grandeur no service huh jeremy shook his head too bad said doresh you missed out no doubt the detective got to his feet i mean that in all seriousness doc service to your country anything you do for others is good for the soul then again you probably get that by working your hypnosis work whatever mentioning hypnosis more than once to let jeremy know he had checked him out games always games meanwhile women died this guy was useless jeremy got up doresh said relax dont bother seeing me out and anytime you have an idea doc feel free to call doreshs dropin left jeremy rattled he barges in and i feel like a suspect whats the matter with me maybe it was the woman on saugatuck finger no name tyrene mazursky had been named what did that mean old hat throwaway victims now they didnt even merit a name his breath quickened and his eyes hurt the walls of his office closed in on him he paged angela but she didnt answer tried it again thinking a second time meant dependence and was he ready for that still no answer so tired of going it alone the air shaft outside his window was black and all at once the window was wet and oily rain a hard dirty downpour spitting at the glass he threw on his coat left the hospital walked to the surly mutes bookstore by the time he got there his coat was soaked through his shoes sloshed and his hair was plastered to his skull no one else was out on the street no one stupid enough a latemodel station wagon was parked in front of the store white that made it easy to see the blackened windows rendered the shop nearly invisible in the gloom the door was open and he walked in no fat man at the desk no desk no bookshelves books nothing the lights were on but the space was empty save for a coat folded over a chair an unplugged cash register on the gray linoleum floor and a strawberry blond woman sweeping up she said you poor thing are you a customer i was you dont know im sorry i wish i had a towel or something dont know what the shops gone my father died jeremy groped for the fat mans name arthur had mentioned it renfrew finally some neurons were firing correctly mr renfrew died he said the woman leaned her broom against the wall and came forward she had a roundish pleasant face hips you could rest your hands on maternal breasts and curly shoulderlength hair of the prettiest shade jeremy had ever seen buttermilk complexion light freckles green eyes forty or so little makeup because she knew she was aging well her clothes were ill suited for janitorial work a wellcut mint green suit and matching shoes discreet gold necklace a diamondstudded wedding band the raincoat on the chair was camelcolored dry folded neatly im shirley renfrew depaul mr renfrews daughter she gazed around the empty shop its the end of an era im afraid yes it is jeremy introduced himself from the hospital she said lots of doctors and nurses came here dad created an institution back when the neighborhood was better you had all kinds of intellectuals dropping in writers poets people of artistic stature they werent loyal it was you hospital people who helped sustain dad during the last few years did you know that he studied medicine when he was young really for two years then he decided against it poetry was more to his liking he was a soft man raised me all by himself shirley renfrew depaul shoved a weak smile past her grief and jeremy pushed aside memories of the old grump whod never acknowledged him this was a great place mrs depaul and your father made a big impact when did he pass on just over a month ago hed had throat cancer years before he used to puff on a pipe nonstop they took out most of his palate and damaged his vocal cords but he beat the disease then his heart started to go bad and we knew it was only a matter of time my husband and i wanted him to come live with us but he refused insisted he wanted to be close to the shop palate surgery jeremy had attributed the fat mans mutism to general surliness with my track record ive got to stop assuming renfrew dying a month ago meant shortly after jeremys last visit the man had been terminal gave no indication shirley depauls smile failed and tears misted her eyes green irises deepened by the suit stunning really not a beautiful woman not by far she was barely handsome but jeremy was certain shed never lacked for male attention she said i hoped it would happen the way it did dad came into the shop on a monday sat down brewed his postum and drank it put his head down on the desk and never woke up he couldnt have scripted it better dying among the books he loved the last time jeremy had been here hed encountered arthur reading something on war strategy a couple of weeks later arthur had shown up at his office and turned on the charm as an old customer someone whod known renfrews name he mustve been aware of the booksellers passing yet hed never said anything he said he didnt suffer a blessing so was his life shirley depauls new smile flickered and faded for the most part she took a deep breath and eyed her broom dad adored everything to do with bookselling im an only child but not really this place was my sibling there were times when i considered it a rather daunting rival a high heel tapped the linoleum the buildings been sold a development firm they called a week after dad passed vultures i said they probably check death notices but my husband said why not deal with them what use do we have for it hes a dentist very practical we have six children and i barely have time to breathe we live far out past the county line it just wouldnt be practical so we sold they gave us a good price even after taxes no doubt theyll tear it down and put up something monstrous but its not about bricks and mortar is it dad put his soul into this place and now hes resting somewhere else absolutely said jeremy what happened to the books all sold was there an auction i wouldve tried to buy some there was no public sale doctor everything went to one buyer who she shook her head i cant say one of those tax things its all for the best i believe theyll be appreciated at least i hope so she wiped the corner of one eye anyway id best be finishing up though to tell you the truth i dont know why im cleaning up theyre going to tear it down anyway she returned to the broom stepped daintily to another corner and began striking the floor using broad hard strokes striking progressively harder whoosh whoosh flogging the linoleum floors jeremy left her and stepped out into the punishing rain he made it back to the hospital looking like a halfdrowned dog used a rear exit never guarded that brought him past a utility area and up the stairs to the main lobby past the marble donor wall names etched in beveled capitals he was in no mood to think about charity as he headed for the elevators he spotted angela and ted dirgrove whitecoated smiling walking down the corridor engaged in spirited discussion walking close to one another for a second their flanks brushed angela spotted him stopped waved gaily said something to dirgrove and came jeremys way she gave him a toohard kiss on the cheek jeremy looked for dirgrove but the surgeon had disappeared around a corner taking in his soaked clothes she said oh my god what happened to you didnt know enough to come in out of the rain she touched his wet hair linked her arm in his withdrew quickly from his sodden sleeve you really are soaked through she touched the tip of his nose im a physician so you need to listen to me though the research doesnt show any link between getting drenched and getting sick i feel obligated to warn you about this kind of thing thank you doctor jeremys voice sounded stale and angela looked at him curiously everything okay yup do you have a dry change once i get this off ill be fine jeremy peeled off the raincoat and held it at arms length water dripped on the floor of the lobby angela appraised him again i suppose youll survive she slipped her arm back in his and they continued toward the lifts as they rode up in an otherwise empty car jeremy said i paged you a couple of times i know she said i was in pulmonology conference dr van heusen was lecturing and he doesnt brook interruption i shouldve turned the darn thing off luckily it was on vibrate she grinned you know us girls and vibration when i got out i called you but you werent in your office whats up i just wondered if you had any free time oh she frowned no i dont i really dont its been a crazy day jer and bound to get crazier ive got over a dozen seriously sick patients then walkin clinic and with this weather well be sure to fill up with bronchitis and asthma and little kids barking with croup then its meetings meetings meetings and after that im on call the schedule sometimes i wonder she said sometimes baking cookies doesnt sound halfbad then again maybe not youve had my beefandbean casserole thats a good indication of my culinary skills jeremy knew a clever riposte was expected he was too damn tired to meet the challenge muttered domestic life wouldnt sustain you she drew back and looked at him is something wrong honey honey no he said forcing a smile sometimes baking cookies doesnt sound halfbad she laughed and rubbed his shoulder the elevator stopped at angelas floor and jeremy got out with her soon as i have time ill call you great as she turned to leave he said so ted dirgroves a new friend the ward was busy with foot traffic wheelchairs guided by deadeyed orderlies doctors reading charts as they strolled nurses darting between rooms angela stopped and swiveled quickly stepped closer to jeremy drew him away from the bustle into a corner her dark eyes had narrowed something is bothering you nothing forget it that was out of line jeremy im on pulmonology service and dirgroves a chest surgeon weve got cases in common and yes i have developed an interest in what he does not for myself id never want to be a cutter but i do want to be the best physician i can and as i told you that means really grasping what my patients go through their innards the total experience its not enough for me to dispense lung medication without having a feel for how a sick lung looks and reacts talking about a diseased heart is one thing watching it limp along struggling to pump is another she stopped waited giving off heat her color was high she usually ran on high gear but this was more jeremy said makes sense angela took hold of his hands and kissed his lips as they embraced the stethoscope around her neck bit into his sternum a few passersby stared most didnt jeremy tried to break the clinch but angela held fast not caring about the public display whispered in his ear youre jealous you have no reason to be but it touches me turns me on its lovely to be cared about im going to find time you bet on it one way or the other you bet on it he didnt hear from her that day or the next worked on the introduction to his book that had proved so daunting and made no more progress he searched the clarion for followup on the most recently murdered woman found nothing why should there be she didnt even merit a name no sense wasting ink at least thered been no more envelopes from ent no more postcards from arthur either maybe whatever had possessed the old man had passed when angela finally called on the third day her voice was hoarse enfeebled barely audible im sick she said the flu can you believe that all through my rotation on pediatrics i didnt catch any kiddie bugs and those little guys were contagious then they put me on lung service where the patients are on antibiotics and the rooms are as clean as you get around here and i come down with this crud you poor thing where are you home van heusen banished me from his service made a big snide joke about it no typhoid marys consorting with the ill and infirm made me feel like a pariah i should be grateful for the time off but i cant enjoy it too sick to read and the few stations my dinky little tv picks up are all garbage when did it start yesterday why didnt you call me then i was too wiped out even to talk slept all day and woke up feeling even more exhausted id love to see you now but no way i will not give you this do not come over ill be over tonight no she said i mean it im sure you do really jeremy then okay his second night sleeping at angelas it took her a long time to come to the door when jeremy saw her his heart melted she looked smaller stood hunched reaching for the doorjamb for support he guided her back to bed she was flushed dryskinned hot with fever a physician too foolish to keep up with fluids and analgesics he fed her tylenol held her in his arms pressed on her the hotandsour soup hed picked up at a chinese dive assured by the proprietress that the seasoning would kill germies and tea and silence she drifted in and out of sleep and he stripped down to his shorts and lay next to her on her lumpy narrow bed she kept him up most of the night hacking and sneezing and snoring one time she woke up and said youre going to get sick youve got to go he rubbed her back gently and soon she was snuffling again and he was staring into darkness an hour later she reached for him halfasleep found his arm trailed her fingers lower placed his hand upon her he felt the bouncy thatch of hair under cotton panties she pressed his hand down and he flattened his palm over her pubic bone mmm she mumbled kind of kind of what snore snore snore in the morning her fever broke and she awoke clammy teeth chattering covered to the neck by two blankets her long hair was mussed her eyes bleary and a trail of dried snot punctuated the space between her nose and her lip jeremy wiped her clean pressed a cool towel to her brow cradled her face in his hands brushed his lips against her cheek her breath was sour as spoiled milk her face mottled by tiny red dots pinpoint petechiae mementos of coughing spasms she looked like a stoned befuddled teenager and jeremy needed very badly to hold her by am shed sponged off and tied her hair back and was clearly coming out of the virus jeremy fixed her mint tea showered in her cracked tiled stall deodorized his pits with her rollon and got into yesterdays clothes he had patients scheduled from ten through two and hoped he wouldnt ripen throughout the day when he stepped back into her bedroom she said you look good i look terrible you are physically incapable of looking terrible she pouted such a nice man and now hes leaving me jeremy sat down on the bed i can stay a little longer thanks she said thats not really what i mean what i want to make love with you in here she patted her left breast but i cant down here its what you guys call what cognitive dissonance no he said just frustration heal up sweetheart theres plenty of time she sniffed reached for a tissue blew her nose so you say sometimes it doesnt feel like there is no it doesnt jeremys head filled with jocelyn her face her voice the way she held him did i say something wrong said angela of course not your face changed just for a second as if something had scared you nothing scared me he said let me get you more tea before i go he fixed her another pot heated up a can of tomato soup kissed her forehead now blessedly cool and drove to work feeling domestic with jocelyn hed never felt domestic the afternoons interoffice mail brought lots of nonsense and the fourth envelope from otolaryngology and via the us mail he received a postcard from arthur the article was ten years old taken from the journal of the american medical association physician suicide risk factors statistics recommendations for prevention sensible stuff but nothing jeremy hadnt heard before but that didnt matter did it this had nothing to do with education what it was about eluded him the picture on arthurs postcard was that of an eighteenthcentury kitchen filled with pottery and iron appliances the legend on the other side said le musée de loutil the museum of tools wyditjolivillage val doise familiar black ink cursive no surprise to the message dear dr c traveling and learning ac jeremy checked the postmark wyditjoli france three days ago arthur couldve returned to the states since then he phoned the old mans office no answer the pathology secretary said no he wont come in he called information and got a number for arthurs neighbor ramona purveyance of the nonstop good cheer and the yellow housecoat she picked up on the first ring and sounded overjoyed to hear from him how nice no hes not back yet ive got all his mail mostly solicitations but id never take it upon myself to throw anything out if you see him before i do say hello dr carrier im so jealous of what france he went to france sent me the loveliest postcard from there the museum of tools whats that jeremy repeated it oh no this is a beautiful picture of giverny monets flower gardens beautiful weeping willows and water and flowers too gorgeous to be real he knows i love flowers hes such a thoughtful man flowers for her tools for me tailoring the message what was the message it was unclear if arthur was in town when the first articles had arrived hed presided over tumor board the day before the clipping about the english girls had shown up but this one all indications were the old man was still abroad so whod sent the suicide article did arthur have a surrogate or had jeremy been wrong yet again and arthur had nothing to do with the ent envelopes could he be that wrong then what of the postcards coincidental arthur traveling being thoughtful sending pretty postcards to everyone flowers for mrs purveyance tools for me laser surgery on eyes laser surgery on women murdered women doctors killing themselves sculpture in norway norwegian authors of the first article russians americans tools in france no french authors when you looked at it coldly there was no rationale tying the medical reprints to the cards no reason they couldnt be connected either arthur and his damned curiosity death and violence and haute cuisine and paternally obsessed insects that burrowed under your skin a latenight supper so weird in retrospect that jeremy was beginning to doubt it had even occurred any way you looked at it the envelopes were a manipulation sending stuff to him but leaving his name off the envelopes someone taking the time to stash them in the rubberbound stack that sat atop the counter in psychiatry open season on his mail he phoned laura the young receptionist and asked her if shed noticed anyone near his stack uh no she said was i supposed to be looking or something not really dont worry about it it gets pretty busy around here dr carrier forget i asked she hung up and jeremy had visions of her reporting the exchange to family and friends working with those shrinks is weird crazier than the patients like theres this one guy obsessed with his mail which is what it had become an obsession and like any neurosis timewasting and energydepleting enough he was a busy guy patients to see a book to write but someone was definitely playing him if not arthur who arthur setting up expectations then dashing them yet again the old man had even scrambled jeremys intuition before meeting arthur jeremy had had faith in his ability to judge people to sum up predict all those tricks you convinced yourself you knew so that you could go from room to room and comfort the ill and the scared and the dying lately he had nothing to show for his efforts but a slew of bad guesses the doting wife living well haute cuisine turned out the old bastard roomed out in the flatlands surrounded by fastfood joints that first time at the bookstore assuming arthur would be reading a book on butterflies turned out hed been studying war strategy wheres the war old man at least hed been right about the house in queens arms decades off the mark but technically right a feeble vindication he was turning into wrong man he needed his intuition without it where would he be arthur had definitely led him up a path latenight supper fine wine haute cuisine the old eccentrics filling their geriatric guts all that good cheer then a curt dismissal now this postcards the old eccentrics had arthur appointed one of them to send the articles handed over a pile of ent envelopes to one of his pals and left instructions about mailing them in his absence why not the articles hadnt been posted from the outside simply dropped down the intrahospital tubes anyone could gain access to the system just waltz through the lobby find a mail drop and poof how did the tube system actually work he thumbed through his hospital directory and found the number for postal collection down on the subbasement a floor below pathology a deepvoiced man answered his call collection this is ernest washington mr washington this is dr carrier i was just wondering how mail got from the tubes to each department dr who carrier carrier washington repeated yeah i recognize the name first time anyones ever asked me that theres always a first dr carrier from psychiatry yeah thats it then this a prank not at all if you want to call me back my extension is i know what it is got it right here hold on jeremy carrier phd extension thats it its really you huh last time i checked washington chuckled okay okay sorry its just that no one ever asked me is this some kind of psychiatry experiment no sir just curiosity i was walking past a chute and realized ive worked here for years had no idea how my mail gets to me it must be quite a challenge for sure you dont have no idea said ernest washington were down here all day and no one ever sees us like invisible folk know what you mean washington harrumphed the systems divided up the us mail dont go through the tubes they bring it all in trucks once a day and it goes straight to our central clearing area right where i am we sort it and send it to you and the intrahospital mail that goes through the tubes the way it works is the tubes all lead to three collection bins all down here in the subb one on the north end of the building one on the south end and one right here in the middle my staff checks each bin out we do it regular so you doctors can have your important mail asap we sort it and send it on to your departments not once a day like the us postal service twice so you doctors can keep up with your important medical issues that clear it up for you crystal clear said jeremy does it matter where the mail comes from what do you mean if it comes from otolaryngology as opposed to lets say surgery is it handled differently nope said washington to us youre all the same any port of entry a sweet old person could slip an envelope down a chute and walk away and no one would notice or care a bomb could be dropped down the tubes then he realized hed been wasting his time and ernest washingtons the envelopes had found their way to him despite being unmarked that meant someone was getting to his mail between the time it arrived at washingtons dominion and ended up at his door someone in psychiatry or afterward he couldnt see anyone in the mental health army doing this a pleasant bland bunch the lot of them caring people nice vanilla nice he was happy to be housed away from them someone else knew he was an isolate was taking advantage of that who how he said out loud obsessed so this was what curiosity was all about it had been a long time since question marks had danced in his head then arthur chess the most inquisitive man jeremy had ever encountered had come along and now his own mind couldnt sit still contagious like a virus that made him think about poor angela he phoned her apartment got no answer probably sleeping good the suicide article and the postcard from the museum of tools stared up at him he found the drawer where hed tossed the card from oslo placed all of it in a folder that he labeled curiosity then he took pen in hand and composed a list alphabetizing because it blessed him with a sense of pseudocontrol tina balleron arthur chess norbert levy edgar marquis harrison maynard his first patient was scheduled soon half an hour and he had several more appointments after that meaning for the rest of the day hed stuff his ego in the closet and concentrate on others for thirty minutes hed indulge himself none of the ccc gourmets had listed phone numbers twenty minutes before he had to run jeremy scrambled to remember personal details harrison maynard had written romance novels under female pseudonyms no easy avenue of inquiry there the ancient edgar marquis was exstate department and had served on remote islands that too offered little promise norbert levy the engineer was emeritus at an eastern university a campus one thousand miles away and levy living here implied an appointment in name only if levy lived here no more assuming jeremy phoned the institution connected to the engineering department and asked for professor levy retired said the secretary quite a while back do you have a current address for him whats this about jeremy gave his name and the hospitals spun a tale about a biomechanical engineering convention wanting to invite levy okay said the secretary here it is levy took his mail at a post office box south of downtown not far from the seagate district where arthur had taken him for supper and confusion in a movie jeremy would rush over to stake out the mail drop in real life he had neither the time nor the ability nor a sane reason to do so sitting day and night waiting in the rain and what if through some quirk he encountered the whitebearded academic professor levy what a coincidence you wouldnt happen to be sending me weird stuff in hospital envelopes would you he needed to talk to someone look into their eyes read the nonverbal messages hed supposedly been trained to decode that left judge tina balleron formerly of superior court now of the golf course the womans gigantic black pearls said she was fixed financially perhaps the good life included country club golf the city hosted three clubs the haverford a relative upstart at sixty years old accepted selected minorities the shropshire and the fairview remained protestant and lilywhite was balleron a latin name he called the haverford first and asked for the judge the man who answered said i dont believe shes arrived yet this is dr carrier whens she due lets see shes scheduled to tee off at pm a doctor is the judge all right shes dandy said jeremy hanging up the man had made no inquiries about a husband or other family member assuming any trouble would be the judges did that mean tina balleron lived alone just like arthur just like jeremy so what no more assuming he saw his patients nonstop eschewed coffee or lunch or breaks hurried through his charts and kept his trench coat with him so hed be able to leave the hospital without returning to his office at twofifteen he drove city streets to hale boulevard continued on that sleek condominiumlined byway with its views of the lake and continued out to the northern countryside the scenic route opposite direction from the journey to arthurs rooming house in ash view this trip was upperlevel exurbia then equestrian estates and gentlemans farms the occasional riding academy a couple of boarding schools surrounded by obstructive greenery a mesh of finger lakes appeared the land between them sodden as rice paddies more empty meadows followed brightly painted signs advertised hundredacre parcels at pm jeremy was rolling up to the twentyfoot stone posts and iron gates of the haverford country club beyond the scrollwork was a sloping drive bordered by a low fieldstone ledge monumental trees sprouted on all sides a white guardhouse sat in the distance jeremy parked at the side of the road the sun was recalcitrant but that did little to ruin the scenery he rolled down his window and the air smelled sweet miles of barbered grass were too green and raininked tree trunks glistened like obsidian columns stalwart rhododendrons and courageous roses defied the season and tossed off arrogant color ferns dripped with promise and a few scarlet cardinals flitted in and out of the foliage no marauding ravens out here a sky that had gloomed the city managed to be pretty planes of polished silver striped with apricot deepening to crimson where the moisture refused to budge jeremy thought of a poster in one of his colleagues offices a psychologist named selig a kind smart man whod made a bundle in the stock market but continued to see patients because he enjoyed healing he drove an old honda to work kept a new bentley in the garage ive been poor and ive been rich rich is better jeremy wondered what it would be like to be rich hed treated enough wealthy depressives to know that money didnt buy you happiness could it do anything to blunt the misery when things went really bad he sat in his car eyes on the country clubs gates during a fourteenminute period five luxury cars arrived punched in at the call box and when the ironwork swung open cruised through confidently the sixth car was tina ballerons white cadillac and jeremy was waiting standing several feet in front of the gate when she pulled up not a new caddy five six years old with darktinted windows and chromed spoked wheels a thin red pinstripe bisected the robust chassis and a fresh wax job repelled moisture like arthurs lincoln beautifully maintained the dark windows were rolled up when they lowered jeremy noticed they were much thicker than usual a good half inch of convex glass hed expected tina balleron to be startled by his presence but her face was serene dr carrier your honor do you golf jeremy smiled not quite i was hoping to speak with you before you teed off she glanced at a diamond wristwatch no black pearls today a pink cameo on a gold chain diamond chip in the coral womans eyes one of tina ballerons silvernailed hands curled on the cadillacs padded steering wheel the other rested on a creamcolored ostrich handbag a long fur coat lay across the rear seat she said let me pull over she parked behind jeremys car he followed on foot heard a click that meant shed unlocked the doors and headed for the passenger door the passenger window lowered the same thick glass come in out of the cold jeremy when he opened the door he felt its extra weight the panel closed with the hiss of a bank vault an armored car he slid onto the passenger seat the cars interior was ruby red leather a tiny gold plaque on the glove compartment was inscribed to tina with all my love bob happy birthday an august date just over five years ago so there had been a husband maybe there still was the ostrich purse rested in tina ballerons sleek lap she wore a baby blue knit pantsuit and navy patent shoes her champagnetinted hair was freshly done the fur across the backseat was dyed mink a precise match to her coiffure a crystal bud vase bracketed between the windows on the drivers side held a single white rose so she said whats on your mind sorry to barge in like this but im looking for arthur i havent been able to reach him in nearly a week hes traveling i know that said jeremy hes been sending me postcards has he well thats good why is that tina balleron smiled arthurs fond of you jeremy its good when people express their fondness dont you think i suppose does he travel much from time to time jeremy my dear you cant have driven all the way out here to discuss arthurs travel habits whats really on your mind ive been getting other things in the mail the hospital mail things she said her fingers played with the clasp of the ostrichskin bag articles from medical journals on laser surgery then an account of a tenyearold murder in england and a piece on physician suicide he waited for her reaction she didnt offer one judge i assumed arthur was sending them to me because i couldnt think who else might be behind it but hes in europe so its not him and youre puzzled wouldnt you be and you drove all the way out here to indulge your puzzlement indulge same word hed used when rationalizing whats behind it said tina balleron stroking the bag that sounds as if you think its a plot of some sort i guess i do feel that way the articles arrive unannounced unexplained and i cant find any reason why id be the recipient its a little unnerving wouldnt you say tina balleron turned contemplative when she didnt speak jeremy said i assumed arthur was sending them because hes interested in violence from what i heard at supper you all are balleron unclasped the purse clicked it shut and you consider that an unusual interest violence lifeanddeath issues she said wouldnt they be core issues for any civilized person she waved a hand around the car pretty things are nice jeremy but in the end theyre all diversions from what important issues arthurs a man of substance and experience one lives a certain amount of time one experiences youre saying theres something in arthurs past that has given him dont worry about arthur my dear she reached over and rested her fingers atop jeremys sleeve stay on target whats the target thats up to you to find out really judge she hushed him with a finger on his lip angela had done the same thing be quiet little boy a mercedes pulled up to the gates its window rolled down and a wellfed male face smiled at the judge hank she said are you ready ready as ever teen see you on the green the mercedes rolled to the gates and the gates swung open automatically an unseen sentry up at the guardhouse knowing who belonged and who didnt balleron smiled at jeremy nice to see you again but im afraid im going to have to cut our little chat short tee time is sacred golfs less a game than a religion miss ones start and one incurs the wrath of ones cobelievers her hand left his wrist and lowered the sun visor on the inner side was a mirror and she checked her reflection opening the ostrich purse she pulled out a compact and began dusting her face fixing herself up for golf leaving the ostrich bag wide open and allowing jeremy to see what lay on top of the usual female stuff a shiny little automatic pistol tina balleron knew hed seen it she clicked open the door and said bye now judge balleron something was said that night expediency trumps virtue it caused the room to go silent silence can be a virtue in and of itself dear till the next time then she smiled and leaned over and kissed his cheek and clicked the door open jeremy got out of the cadillac and the white car rolled toward the gates of the country club she stopped down came the window by the way she said i inquired about those gannet birds the little monogamous thingies harrison told us about you suggested a population issue i cant find evidence of such she smiled up at jeremy he said okay maybe she said they just do the right thing she raised the window resumed driving jeremy stood there as the gates rolled open for her leaving him outside the outsider always the outsider he was back at his desk by fourthirty and collected his messages consult requests announcements of meetings some utter rubbish no postcards no otolaryngology envelopes but there wouldnt be too soon everything was paced he got back on the computer the clarion was your typical journalistic mediocrity but it did host an online archive that one could access for a fee jeremy surrendered a credit card number and logged in robert balleron pulled up five hits all four to five years old industrialist found slain in office some theorize balleron murder related to real estate success balleron murder remains a mystery balleron spouse a judge questioned police continue to probe balleron murder robert a balleron sixtynine had been murdered sixty miles away in greenwood an affluent bedroom community the paper hadnt covered the crime directly each piece came over the wire service jeremy pulled them up one by one the developer and real estate magnate had been found in the home office of his palatial tudor mansion slumped at an ornate desk dead of multiple gunshot wounds robert balleron had been politically active highly competitive confrontational when he felt his interests were being threatened a tough man but beyond reproach ethically somewhat of a prig actually with a history of leveling corruption charges at those he deemed deserving the crime scene details were thin no forced entry the houses alarm system had been switched off and the killer had apparently entered through the offices french doors after crossing the multiacre estate unnamed sources speculated that ballerons sharp tongue and aggressive business tactics had alienated the wrong person and suggestions of murderforhire were made but no followup to that theory was offered the victims wife superior court judge tina balleron had been out the night of the murder dining with friends and had come home to discover the body shed been questioned but a police spokesperson insisted shed not been considered a suspect jeremy plugged balleron murder into the archives got no more hits logging out of the newspaper file he tried several internet search engines and pulled up a solitary wireservice piece the archive had missed six months after the murder the police had come up with no leads and the case remained open he returned to the paper and scanned the next few years for anything on tina balleron zero a prominent woman like that a notable crime shed made a point of keeping out of the public eye he searched for homicides of other greenwood developers and found only an accidental death three years ago a builder of shopping malls named michael srivac had perished in a singlecar accident srivac merited a fourline obituary in lieu of flowers contributions should be sent to planned parenthood jeremy organized his thoughts robert balleron had been slain five years ago tina ballerons cadillac wasnt much older than that the developer had gifted his wife with an armored car shortly before his death knowing she was in danger shed survived and thrived stepping down from the bench moving to the city joining the haverford one good way to keep a low profile was to leave home pearls and fur and a gun in the purse the merriest of widows a strong woman who took care of herself jeremy thought of something the judge had said that afternoon one lives a certain amount of time one experiences maybe theyre just doing the right thing was tragic experience what the ccc people had in common crime victims all of them did that explain all the interest in the genesis of violence that fit with the pall that had followed maynards comment about expedience trumping virtue finally he sensed he was on to something heart pounding he plugged chess homicide into the archive found nothing the same for marquis homicide levy homicide pulled up the case of a missing washington intern but jeremy could find no connection to professor norbert switching back to the general databases proved no more successful wrong man maybe he should just start feeling comfortable with that the third postcard arrived three days later during that period jeremy had seen angela once for coffee and theyd shared a hurried dinner in the doctors dining room before she rushed back to oncall both times shed looked tired and talked of being worn down yet shed found time to observe two of dirgroves surgeries youre okay with that right why shouldnt i be hes all business jer i guess im feeling guilty overloading my already crazy schedule not having time for you i promise to be better when things ease up youre fine thats nice of you to say now you see that side of me what side driven obsessive my father always kidded me about it wheres the race princess she shot jeremy a wan smile intellectually i know hes right but the thing is i do feel theres a race against time against the time when your mind and body slow down and grind to a halt and you end up six feet under morbid huh maybe its too many hours on the wards said jeremy no ive always been this way if the assignment was to write a fivepage bio paper i handed in seven when the gym teacher said ten girl pushups i did boy pushups and struggled for twenty im sure part of its ocd when i was eight i went through a ritual phase checking my bedroom for an hour before id go to sleep lining up my shoes no one knew id let my mother put me to bed sneak out go through the entire rigamarole if something interrupted me i started from scratch howd you stop i told myself it was stupid and lay shaking under my covers until the urge passed for months i got the urge but i stuck to my guns when i was twelve i developed an ulcer the doctor and my parents insisted it was a bacterial infection they treated me with antibiotics and i got better but still now you know my whole sordid past any analysis doctor he shook his head really she insisted what do you think have you ever lost anyone close to you my grandma she said i was six and she was old and ill but we were close it shocked me the fact that id never see her again jeremy nodded she said so what youre saying is that loss was so profound that it traumatized me about death the essence the permanence and now i need to race through life like a headless chicken piling up experiences i was thinking more of an untimely death someone struck down prematurely but sure if your grandmothers passing was a shock it could influence you that way traumatic loss does that the goneness of it all the goneness she shook her head smiling you and words hows your writing by the way torturous itll work out angelas eyes grew distant maybe youre right i dont know she looked away lowered her voice premature death youve been through that what do you mean said jeremy louder than hed intended you know jeremy stared at her knew he was glaring but couldnt stop he said lets change the subject her face drained of color sure im sorry forget i mentioned it dont worry about it he said but his heart was pounding and he needed to get out of there as close as weve become there are places she cant go some things i will not share jeremy yes im sorry nothing to be sorry about ive got to go she said im not sure when im going to have free time are you on tonight no but i need to hit the sack early im still feeling kind of rundown maybe the flu hasnt left my system want me to walk you up to the ward no its okay take care of yourself you too the following afternoon she called to tell him shed been tied up in surgery planned to observe more ted dirgrove had performed a quintuple bypass the verb made jeremy think of a stage and a baton interesting he said amazing its something to see and the patient survived what do you mean the only patient dirgrove and i have in common didnt oh she sounded deflated yes that was bad i guess id better be going did i ever thank you for babying me through my flu more than once i wasnt sure if i did since i got back on service things got so hectic so quickly and i know we havent anyway thanks again for the soup and everything else that was beyond the call of duty her gratitude sounded formalized putting space between them who was he kidding hed done that the conversationkilling glower when all shed done was ask about still feeling rundown he said a little but better so the bypass was amazing really jer the human heart this little thing like a big plum like a skinless tomato what a gorgeous thing the way the chambers and valves work in concert its philharmonic while the arteries are being spliced in they keep the heart pumping artificially and its i keep thinking in orchestral terms that perfect balance the tempo uhoh i just got another page have to go the third postcard was from damascus syria a picture of the ancient casbah a shiny shot of jumbled stalls and their proprietors whiterobed men peddling brassware and carpets and dried nuts postmarked berlin aha aha what all jeremy could come up with was that arthurs wanderlust had its limits the old man was unwilling to forgo the creature comforts of the western world for a levantine jaunt but he wanted jeremy to think levantine damascus jeremy knew syria was a brutal dictatorship but beyond that the country and its ancient capital meant nothing to him oslo paris damascus oslo paris berlin damascus if this was a game he wasnt even on the playing field he stuck the postcard in the curiosity file had a second thought and pulled out the file and reviewed its contents and ended up with a crushing headache he popped aspirin took the risk of drinking his own lousy coffee by the end of the day alone with no chance of seeing angela with the prospect of his dark cold house in his immediate future he found himself hoping for another otolaryngology envelope anything to clear the haze he stopped by the psychiatry office to make sure no new mail had come through the office was closed nothing arrived in either of the next days deliveries same for the day after that suddenly life was too quiet the weekend rolled around angela was back on call and jeremy endured a solitary saturday doing crosswords pretending to be interested in sports smiling at mrs bekanescu when she stuck her head out to sweep her front porch receiving an ugly look in return what had doresh told her he read the entire sunday paper wondering if any details about the nameless woman on the finger would surface they didnt by sunday evening he was ready to climb the walls his beeper had been silent all weekend he phoned the page operator and asked if any calls had come through no doctor youre all clear he drove to the hospital anyway attacked his book introduction was astonished to find the words flowing he finished the damn thing by pm reread it made a few changes and packaged it to send to the head of oncology for review now what not long ago hed have cherished the solitude now he felt incomplete he logged on to the computer returned to the clarion archive activated his account and entered norbert levys name as a searchword not limited this time by homicide zero the same went for edgar marquis and not surprisingly the pseudonymprotected harrison maynard tina balleron had mentioned a couple of maynards aliases amanda fontaine barbara kingsman nothing under either nom de plume he gave up turned the computer off drove to the excelsior hotel made a beeline for the bar empty bar he had his pick of booths and chose the same one where he and arthur had drunk and talked and nibbled on hors doeuvres he ordered a double scotch the old waiter whod served them wasnt on duty the young man who brought his drink was blandfaced and cheerful and had a highstepping prancing walk that made jeremy think of a racehorse straining at the bit any particular brand sir nope same room same booth but nothing was the same jeremy sat there for a long time stretching out his refills in an attempt to simulate selfcontrol the young waiter was bored and took to reading the paper insipid music played in the background by the time jeremy finished his third scotch his body was buzzing no sadder place than sunday in a bigcity hotel this city prided itself on midwestern wholesomeness and sunday was family day even the lobby was deserted saurian salesmen departed to longsuffering wives hotel hookers doing whatever working girls did on sunday sometimes they died jeremy waved that away actually moved his hand to dispel the thought no one was around to notice the ticlike gesture and he repeated it amused like a naughty kid whod gotten away with something he called for still another drink filled his blood with alcohol drank himself rosy on some level a cutaneous level it was a pleasant experience but for the most part he felt detached living in someone elses skin on monday he woke up mean and logy and stiff and he wondered if hed caught angelas flu a brisk walk in the chilled air burned his chest and woke him up and by the time he drove to work he felt semicivilized stopping for coffee in the dining room he spotted ted dirgrove and another whitecoat engaged in what looked like tense conversation the same swarthy mustachioed man whod sat with the surgeon the first time jeremy had noticed him the two of them and the cardiologist mandel no reason to notice them now because the room was filled with whitecoats and dirgrove and his companion were off in a far corner but something about the heart surgeon angelas enthrallment with what dirgrove did he was jealous he filled a cup headed out of the room dirgrove and the other man hadnt budged their discussion looked tense something academic no this seemed personal their body postures were those of two dogs facing off then dirgrove smiled and so did the other man two dogs with their teeth bared even match the other doctor was dirgroves height had a similar slender build and like dirgrove his hair was closecropped but this curly cap was as dark as his mustache the dark man talked with his hands offered a parting shot and exited the dining room dirgrove stood there alone his hands clenched that cheered jeremy and he decided he was hungry and went back for a sweet roll he decided to sit down to eat dirgrove left a few moments later angela appeared in a group of residents chattering happy hyperactive all of them looking so young shed talked about feeling wornout but now she was the essence of vitality all of them were kids suddenly the eight years between angela and jeremy seemed a generation jocelyn had been angelas age but shed seemed more seasoned maybe it was the years shed put in as a nurse or the grunt jobs shed worked to put herself through nursing school angela anxious and driven despite a happy childhood her fathers princess might never get past the guilt of being wellborn jocelyns family was trailerpark poor and shed been on her own since adolescence shed appreciated everything a working girl no that sounded so wrong tears filled jeremys eyes he put his roll and his coffee aside hurried out careful to escape angelas notice the fourth envelope arrived finally tuesday morning stuck in the middle of a stack of ignorables jeremy had taken to cruising by the psychiatry office or sticking his head out of his door at random moments in hope of coming upon the anonymous mailer to no avail and it really didnt matter did it the medium was the message thin envelope thinner than usual inside was a single slip of paper upon which was typed a single line ethics of the fathers sforno e obviously some kind of reference an ancient text something buddhist italian he got on the computer and had his answer within moments religious but not buddhist ethics of the fathers was a volume a tractate from the jewish talmud the only one of sixtythree that didnt deal primarily with laws the bartletts of judaism one authority called it a compendium of morality opined another sforno was ovadiah sforno an italian rabbi and physician whod lived during the renaissance and was primarily known for his commentary on the bible hed also written a lesserknown companion to ethics of the fathers where would you find something like that maybe at renfrews back when the mute man had been alive he called two city libraries neither carried the book in any edition pulling out the phone book he looked up bookstores in the yellow pages he tried several sellers of new books and antiquarian tomes none of the proprietors had any idea what he was talking about a couple of stores advertised themselves as religious booksellers but religious turned out to be catholic and lutheran respectively the owner of the catholic bookstore said you might try kaplans wheres that fairfield avenue fairfield east of downtown thats it said the man what used to be the jewish neighborhood before they all moved out to the suburbs kaplans still there last i heard fairfield avenue was a brief drizzly ride from the hospital two lanes of sinuous potholed asphalt crowded with sootblackened prewar buildings nearly all the storefronts had been bricked over and the oncecommercial avenue was mostly urent storage facilities faded signs painted on grimy walls hinted at a previous life schimmels pickles shapiros fish market kosher butcher the bookstore was ten feet wide with flaking gold lettering that read books gifts and judaica above what jeremy assumed was the same legend in hebrew the glass was dark not blackened like renfrews but dimmed by what appeared to be unlit space closed the last holdout folding but when jeremy turned the brass doorknob it relented and he stepped into a tiny dim room no overhead lights an ambershaded copperbased lamp cast a cone of illumination on a battered oak desk the room shouldve smelled musty but didnt behind the desk sat a man elderly cleanshaven wearing a black suede skullcap over a head of bluntly cut gray hair an old man but a big man undiminished by time wideshouldered and heavyboned he sat with military posture wore a white shirt and dark tie and braided leather braces goldframed half glasses rested on a thin slender nose behind him was a glass case filled with a mix of objects silver cups and candelabras record albums festooned with stars of david uncle shimmy sings the zemiros childrens games what appeared to be plastic spinning tops velvet bags embroidered with more sixpointed stars below all that three shelves of books the man was tinkering with a black leather box attached to a series of matching straps and looked up yes do you have rabbi sfornos commentary on ethics of the fathers the man studied him you can get it over the internet id rather have it now eager to learn said the man its a very good commentary so ive heard how did you find me the catholic bookstore recommended you ah joe mcdowell he was always loyal the man smiled and stood at least sixthree his torso was huge and jeremy wondered how hed adjusted to the closetsize premises he extended a hand bernard kaplan jeremy carrier carrier is that french way back said jeremy then he blurted im not jewish kaplan smiled few people are excuse my curiosity but sfornos commentary is a rather esoteric request for anyone someone recommended it to me a doctor at central hospital where i work good hospital said kaplan all my children were born there none became doctors did dr chess deliver them chess no dont know him we used dr oppenheimer sigmund oppenheimer back then he was one of the few jewish doctors they allowed in the hospital was segregated not officially said kaplan but of course everything was some places still are the country clubs if it was only the country clubs no your hospital was not a citadel of tolerance during the early fifties there was some agitation about expelling the few jewish doctors on staff dr oppenheimer was the reason it didnt happen the man delivered so many babies that losing him wouldve slashed revenues too severely he delivered the mayors children and just about anyone elses who wanted the best golden hands it often comes down to dollars and cents said jeremy often it does and thats the point of the ethics of the fathers it shouldnt theres more to life than dollars and cents its a wonderful book my favorite quotation is the more meat the more worms meaning he who dies with the most toys simply has the most toys also who is happy he who is satisfied with what hes got if we could just realize that and i include myself anyway dr carrier i just happen to be carrying one copy of the sforno edition because i ordered it for a man who changed his mind and stuck me with it when he bought it at discount over the internet kaplan opened the glass case pulled out a paperback with dustyrose covers and handed it over jeremy read the title pirkeye peerkey said kaplan that means chapters in hebrew pirkei avos literally the chapters of the fathers who were the fathers not priests thats for sure kaplan chuckled his eyes were grayblue amused slightly bloodshot it doesnt mean father literally in hebrew the term also applies to scholars in our tradition when someone teaches you something important he becomes as valued as a parent feel free to inspect the book no ill take it said jeremy how much fifteen dollars for you twelve thats not necessary youre doing me a favor young man im not likely to sell it to anyone else no one comes here anymore im a relic and should be smart enough to engage in voluntary extinction but retirement means death and i like the old neighborhood this street the memories of the people i used to know i own this building and a few others on fairfield when i die my kids will sell everything and make out like bandits that caused jeremy to think of something did you know mr renfrew the used bookseller shadley renfrew said kaplan certainly a fine man ah you knew him because his shop was right near the hospital yes said jeremy i heard he passed on too bad he beat cancer then his heart gave out throat cancer said kaplan thats why he never spoke before the cancer he used to sing had a wonderful voice did he oh yes an irish tenor maybe he was lucky in what way enforced silence said kaplan perhaps it made him wiser thats something else youll find in there he tapped the book be cautious with your words lest they learn to lie here let me wrap it for you he reached into a drawer and drew out something shiny and orange and heres a hard candy to go with it elite from israel theyre very good i used to give it out to the kids when they came in youre the youngest person ive seen around here in ages so today youll be the lucky kid jeremy thanked him and paid for the book as he left the shop bernard kaplan said that customer could wait for his ethics im glad you couldnt on the way to the car jeremy popped the orange candy in his mouth and ground it to sweet citrus dust he opened the book while the novas engine idled the right side was hebrew the left english translation during the brief time hed been in the shop the temperature had dropped and the car had turned frigid still a good ways from winter but his windshield was coated with a gossamer layer of rime it could get like that because of the lake winds whipping across the water churning up the cold his first year at city central a storm from the north had plunged the mercury from forty above to forty below in two hours and the hospitals auxiliary generators had threatened to shut down no deaths the bottomliners claimed but jeremyd heard tales of respirators hesitating operating lights switching off midincision he switched on the heater reached to activate the wipers to clear the frost and thought better of it privacy was good time to soak up some ethics from the fathers from bernard kaplans quotations and the bartletts analogy hed expected a collection of homilies and the pages he flipped on the way to chapter five seemed consistent with that but chapter five paragraph was different a litany of punishments wreaked upon the world for a host of transgressions famine for failure to tithe a plague of wild beasts for vain oaths exile for idolatry section e read the sword of war comes to the world for the delay of justice rabbi ovadiah sfornos commentary backed that up with a citation from leviticus a sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant someone out to set things in order a covenant an agreement to set things straight by clearing up unsolved murders or committing new ones a cleansing plague viewed through the prism of vengeful justice the articles took on a different cast laser surgery on women newspaper accounts of two murdered women the laser a cleansing weapon a cleansing tool had some madman used an ancient text as rationale for his personal brand of justice or worse a fiend simply bragging jeremy flipped through the pink book and gazed uncomprehending at the hebrew letters could there be a jewish link to all this someone wanting him to think there was that brought to mind something hed read years ago in college about jack the ripper an abnormal psych professor straining for relevance had placed a truecrime account of the whitehall murders on his reading list claiming it illustrated sadistic psychopathy better than any textbook straining for relevance was generally a fools game and jeremy had considered the work yet more gratuitous dumbingdown lots of speculation theories that could never be proved or disproved pages of gory photos but one particular illustration came to mind now an etched reproduction of chalk graffiti scrawled on a black brick wall in londons east end a message left at the scene of a prostitute killing something about the juwes not being blamed for nothing the original writing had been sponged off and some police constable had jotted from memory the etcher had drawn upon his imagination the ripper had done his thing in a heavily jewish slum and the accepted interpretation of the scrawl was an attempt to cast blame upon an already distrusted ethnic group according to bernard kaplan central hospital had once been besmirched by antisemitism the murdered girls in the clipping had been english his head spinning jeremy closed the book and started the drive back to the hospital oslo paris damascus by way of berlin the syrian capital was sure to be a place hostile to jews and nowhere had jewhatred blossomed more fully than in germany was arthur guiding him in a certain direction arthur and others tina balleron hadnt been the least bit surprised to hear about the envelopes so maybe the articles werent correspondence from a killer but precisely what hed guessed initially one of arthurs surrogates doing the old mans bidding leading him to an ancient jewish book the only ccc member with a jewish surname was norbert levy and during jeremys initial search nothing had come up linking the engineering professor to any homicides maybe he just needed to dig deeper he pressed down on the gas pedal drove too quickly on streets slicked by oil and rain found his way to the doctors lot parked quickly bounding out of the car he hurried to his office a specific assignment that felt good hed barely hung his coat and booted up the computer when angela phoned i need to come over right now yes may i please are you okay i dont want to talk about it over the phone are you free please say you are i am said jeremy im coming now she burst in wearing a black blouse tucked into khakis and sneakers no coat or stethoscope her hair was tied back carelessly and loose strands flew out wildly her eyes were raw her cheeks tearstreaked what is it said jeremy she flashed a smile that sickened him pure defeat when the words came out her voice was strangled i am so so stupid dirgrove had hit on her hard it had just happened thirty minutes ago in the surgeons office shed been sitting shellshocked in the female residents locker room since then had finally garnered the energy to call jeremy dirgrove had set it up carefully inviting her over to discuss the aftereffects of coronary bypass surgery something you should know dr rios as a practicing physician when she showed up he greeted her warmly but with formality remained behind his desk and pointed to the journal articles hed laid out for her in a neat overlapping row bookmarks designated pages he deemed noteworthy when she sat down he began lecturing her about patient care then instructed her to have a look at one article in particular his tie was tightly knotted and he smelled freshly showered when angela began reading he came around from behind his desk made a show of smoothing the tailored white coats and freshly pressed scrubs that hung from a wooden rack next to a burbling saltwater aquarium then he moved behind her stood there as she read she was halfway through the methodology section when a hand alit on her shoulder that was the way she thought of it alighting like a bird no an even flimsier creature an insect a mayfly such a delicate touch those spidery fingers proximity added a new fragrance to the squeakyclean aroma a nice cologne something herbaceous masculine applied sparingly she could hear her own breathing but not his he kept talking his words blurred and all she could feel was the touch of his fingers drumming her shoulder slowly moving to the nape of her neck warm and dry confident it was that his confidence realizing how smug he felt that froze her she shrugged him off violently she thought but he didnt react except to lift the mayfly fingers she told herself to forget it keep reading for an obligatory interval then make some excuse and get out of there she heard him sigh regretful she hoped no harm no foul then the hand both hands returned got busy immediately before she realized what was happening one had slid down the front of her blouse wormed under her bra cupped her breast grabbed hold of a nipple and pinched it gently to erection the other stroked the nearly invisible down along her jawline as if sketching the contour as if drawing a preincision line she jumped up faced him he stood there hands at his side bent a knee because no gesture could be more casual than that i can make you very happy he said shed prepared an outraged retort her words died he smirked she croaked out how could you he said is that an objection or an inquiry about technique if its the latter id be happy to show you how i could he touched his crotch massaged himself showed off the obvious enthusiasm that tented his trousers she fled heard him laughing as she slammed his door report the bastard said jeremy squeezing the words out between clenched jaws fighting to keep his voice even she flew into his arms freed herself began circling the office stopping at the window she stared out at the air shaft threw up her hands oh shit she moaned i left my coat there and my scope im going to have to go back there no way ill get them for you no please i dont want a scene lets just forget it ill figure something out jeremy didnt answer angela said what why are you so quiet are you really able to forget it i dont know he should be reported angela what happens then his word against mine an rii against a tenured professor it could never be proved copping a feel ill be drawn into a huge mess things will never be the same for me here she pounded the windowsill with her fist damn him fuck him a sickly smile spread across her lips poor choice of words god jeremy how could i be so dumb she hurried to his patient chair and slumped down heavily my coat and my scope thats all i care about i just want never to see him again im off thoracic in two days anyway therell be no reason to see him what was i thinking im not going to be a cutter what possessed me to want to waste my time with him this isnt about you being dumb you wanted to be a better doctor you believed he wanted to teach you yes thats true her chest heaved but you knew better didnt you no he said i was just jealous she managed a half smile oh jer how could i have been so gullible would i have hung out with him if he looked like a troll if he hadnt paid attention to me singled me out from the other residents id like to think i wouldve i just wish i could be sure she doubled over in the chair when she looked up her eyes were heavy with guilt shed been attracted to dirgrove my jealousy wasnt baseless maybe my intuitions coming back he said it really doesnt matter what you thought or felt hes the offender he brought you in under false pretenses touched you abusively and when you let him know you werent interested he compounded the insult by grabbing his dick yes she said thats what it was gross and the way he smirked i can make you happy what macho bravado bs the idiots watched too many porno movies he was letting me know i was nothing to him that he was in charge but jeez how could i be so stupid you were caught off guard said jeremy it happens to all of us not to you ill bet youre so composed you think everything out choose your words before you speak your training all the people youve worked with you probably never get caught off guard a knock sounded on the door and angela jumped jeremy opened it a young man in orderlys yellows stood there holding a white coat and a stethoscope is there a dr rios here ill take those said jeremy sure doc dr dirgrove says you left them in his office he says to tell you hi jeremy closed the door angela said he knew exactly where id go jeremy said i guess its no secret thinking thats the point dirgrove had gotten a kick out of letting the two of them know he had them pegged this was all about power telling them who was in charge an errant memory flashed in his head last week leaving angelas house late at night hed believed someone had followed him in a car when the vehicle quickly went its own way hed dismissed it as paranoia now he wondered shortly after that dirgrove had asked for his help with merilee saunders dr sensitive worried about his patients anxiety or something else not bothering to inform the patient about the consult setting jeremy up for failure then the patient dies just one of those things informing jeremy via angela that hed done a great job when hed accomplished nothing playing with him one way or the other he sensed hed be dealing with dr theodore dirgrove he walked a very subdued angela back to the wards and told her hed stay late theyd have dinner in the cafeteria not the doctors dining room she said not tonight but eventually well go there too to hell with him if i get phobic will you do therapy with me rapid therapy he said youll be fine she kissed him full on the lips despite all you went through as a kid you grew into a prince cmon up to my place got a glass slipper for you i mean it im serious jeremy returned to his office remembering boarding school bunks hard and flat as slate the crispness of earlymorning reveille institutional food the knowing smiles of those who fit in back to the computer thered been nothing on norbert levy in the clarion archive so it was time to expand to the internet the first few citations jeremy found for the retired professor had to do with his scientific work levy had been instrumental in the development of ultrahighreliability capacitors for use in spacecraft ship gyroscopes and weapons systems but the hit that held jeremys attention longest was something else completely an account of an east coast symposium on the holocaust convened by a survivors group the rubric of the gathering was the complicity of nongerman europe swiss bankers hoarding stolen billions spanish and italian and scandinavian diplomats purchasing plundered artwork on the cheap french politicians claiming to have resisted the nazis when the facts revealed them to have been easy collaborators levy a holder of two doctorates in physics and engineering had become involved because of personal history his father oscar levy a prominent germanborn physicist had left the fatherland in when antisemitism at his university department led him to seek and receive a teaching post at oxford the following year levy his mother and two sisters were spirited to england and avoided the deportations that resulted in the deaths of their entire extended family the family home in berlin and its contents were confiscated by the nazis gone were generations of personal effects as well as a collection of egon schieles gustav klimts and other expressionist masterpieces those paintings now valued in the tens of millions had never been recovered most probably hoarded by some private collector norbert levy had chosen to address the symposium about morality the old professor hadnt been victimized by any single homicide his focus was on the worst of crimes jeremy found no fulltext account of the remarks but after considerable websurfing he managed to find a summary in a site called jewishworldnetcom noted scientist says intelligence has nothing to do with morality renowned physicist professor norbert levy delivered an address to the members of the committee on plundered art copa in which he criticized the continuing inertia of european governments and museums in owning up to complicity with nazi war crimes despite continued evidence that a substantial number of current european art holdings consist of treasures confiscated by hitlers ss very little has been done to locate stolen art or to compensate the original owners levys speech drew from a wide range of sources as he illustrated how some of the brightest minds of the most civilized nations in the world had stooped to barbarity with relative ease the awardwinning scientist in the past mentioned as a potential nobel nominee quoted the psychiatristnovelist walker percy to that effect you can get straight as but still flunk life intelligence is like fire levy went on to say you can burn down the house learn to cook or forge beautiful works of art in a kiln it comes down to personal morality and that quality is sorely lacking in a good deal of what passes for intelligent society the key to personal and national growth is combining moral training with intellectual rigor the thirst for justice trumps everything else though emphasizing that he was not a religious man levy stressed the influence jewish humanistic values had played in his upbringing and he drew upon scriptural texts citing calls for justice in the bible and in the talmudic tract ethics of the fathers jeremy searched for more on levys extracurricular activities but found nothing he plugged in edgar marquis minus the homicide limitation and came up empty again against all hope he tried harrison maynard the writer had hidden behind a pen name no reason to assume hed go public about anything but maynards name appeared on the tribute committee of an east coast dinner honoring the memory of martin luther king just a list with no links one of those isolated cyberscraps floating around the cosmos bereft of context martin luther king memorial dinner produced a single reference a recent affair in california and maynards name was nowhere to be found jeremy broadened the search to martin luther king memorial and came up with nearly three thousand hits he downloaded for nearly two hours before finding what he was looking for pages from a banquet journal photos of celebrated guests and benefactors and there was harrison maynard a trifle thinner his hair and mustache a bit less gray but otherwise the same man jeremy had supped with smiling and well fed and natty in a tuxedo next to him stood norbert levy also in formal wear the whitebearded physicist remained unidentified in the caption maynard was described as a former associate of dr king among the first to rush to the slain civil rights leaders side as he lay dying in a motel parking lot harrison maynard was now a major benefactor of humanitarian causes no mention was made of how hed made his money from the civil rights struggle to bodice rippers maynards philanthropy said hed maintained a focus on morality just like norbert levy now jeremy believed he was beginning to understand the old eccentrics maynard had fought for equality and watched his idol die violently levys extended family had been exterminated and his inheritance plundered tina balleron had lost her husband to violent crime victims all what about arthur and edgar marquis the ancient diplomat had alluded to witnessing too much duplicity in the foreign service his reason for ending a career rise by requesting transfer to obscure posts in micronesia and indonesia places he could do some good idealists all of them good food and wine notwithstanding they were all about justice their vision of justice and now he was being courted because of jocelyn he wanted to think it out more but evening had fallen and he was due to meet angela for a quick bite in the dining room in ten minutes before he left he looked up theodore dirgroves office in the attending staff roster the penthouse floor of the medical office building the space occupied by psychiatry until the cutters had deemed it theirs when psychiatry had occupied the premises it was just an upper floor dingily walled and floored now the carpeting was fresh and clean the walls wainscoted polished mahogany doors replaced white slabs dirgroves door was closed the surgeons name was mounted in confident gold letters jeremy stood in the hallway for several moments finally approached and knocked no answer he left to meet angela and encountered dirgrove as he got off the elevator dirgrove wore a wellcut black suit over a black turtleneck his nails were impeccable his lips compressed when he saw jeremy the two of them locked eyes dirgrove smiled but kept his distance jeremy smiled back and took a step forward putting so much intensity into the smile that his eyes burned dirgrove held his ground then he shrugged and laughed as if to say this is trivial jeremy said lose any other patients recently ted dirgroves lips dropped suddenly as if yanked down by fishhooks his long pale face turned deathly white as he walked away jeremy stayed and watched dirgroves hands kept clenching and unclenching spidery fingers fluttering wildly as if sparked by random synapses jumpy not good for a surgeon angela worked hard at finishing a third of her turkey sandwich there wasnt much time till she went back oncall jeremy picked at his meat loaf watched her push wilted lettuce around her plate she said im not very good company maybe i should just go stay a while his beeper went off angela laughed and said theres an omen for you he took the call in the doctors dining room now empty an oncologist named bill ramirez was phoning with an emergency a patient theyd both seen seven years ago a young man named doug vilardi with stage iii ewings sarcoma of the knee was back jeremy had counseled doug and the entire family shortly after diagnosis between the bad news debilitating treatment and losing a leg there was plenty to cry about but jeremy finally figured out that what really bothered the seventeenyearold was the prospect of sterility caused by radiotherapy touching optimism hed thought at the time the survival statistics for advanced ewings werent encouraging but hed gone along with the fantasy talked to ramirez about sperm donation prior to treatment learned it was feasible and helped set things up doug had lost his left leg but survived his cancer one of those bright spots that energize you no phantom pain no tortured aftermath hed started with crutches progressed to a cane adjusted beautifully to his prosthesis jeremy had heard from him last four years ago the kid was playing basketball with his plastic leg and learning to lay brick what now relapse he asked ramirez worse goddammit said the oncologist secondary cancer aml or possibly a newly converted cml im still waiting for pathology to clear it up either way its leukemia no doubt from the radiotherapy we gave him seven years ago oh no oh yes the good news kid is we nuked your solid tumor to oblivion the bad news is we nuked your hemopoietic system and gave you goddamn leukemia jesus him i could use said ramirez however given the fact that jesus didnt answer his page ill take you do me a favor jeremy make time to see him tonight soon as you can theyre all here him his parents his sister and get this to make matters even more pitiful a wife kid got married two years ago used the sperm we stored for him and now shes pregnant isnt life grand hes up on five west when the hell can you make it over soon as i finish dinner hope i didnt ruin your appetite he returned to the table angela hadnt taken a bite in his absence trouble she said not our trouble he sat down heavily ate a bit of meat loaf washed it down with coke tightened his tie and buttoned his white coat then he explained the situation to her she said that is beyond tragic helps put things in perspective my petty little issues being pettys a constitutional right he said i cant name the amendment but believe me its definitely right there in the bill of rights i see families falling apart after a traumatic diagnosis everyone working hard at concentrating on the big issues in a crisis thats fine but you cant live like that indefinitely eventually i get around to telling them when you start to be petty again youll know youre adjusting she placed her hand on his where is he on five five west you still on four uhhuh lets ride up together he dropped her off and continued up to the cancer ward entertaining fantasies of bypassing the ward and taking the passageway that connected to the medical office wing then jogging the stairs up to the penthouse level he had no idea what hed say or do if he ran into dirgrove again but he had a feeling hed pull it off well when the elevator door opened on five west he walked out looking to the most casual observer like a man with a mission what the hell would he say to doug vilardi and his family most likely hed keep his mouth shut and listen the virtue of silence ethics of the fathers at seventeen doug had been a tall gawky darkhaired kid not much of a student his best class metal shop since then hed put on weight lost some of the hair that had grown back after chemo stuck a diamond chip in his left ear grown a teacolored goatee and gotten a tattoo on his right forearm marika in blue script he looked like any regular guy who worked for a living except for the pallor that certain pallor that sheathed his skin and the jaundiced eyes that lit up as jeremy entered the room no family just doug in bed the prosthetic leg leaned in a corner he wore a hospital gown and bedsheets covered him from his waist down an iv had already been hooked up and every so often it clicked doc long time no see look what i did to myself being creative huh yeah life was getting too friggin boring doug laughed held out his hand for a soul shake muscles flexed and marika jumped as he held on to jeremys fingers its good to see you doc good to see you too doug cried jeremy sat down by the bed took hold of dougs hand again and held it bluecollar guy like this try it in any other situation and youd be cruising for a bruising seven years ago jeremy had done a lot of handholding doug stopped sobbing and said fuck thats exactly what i didnt wanna do i think said jeremy that you can be excused a little emotion yeah oh shit doc this reeks i got a baby coming what the fuck am i gonna do jeremy stayed with him for two hours mostly listening occasionally commiserating the parents stuck their heads in after the first hour saw jeremy smiled weakly and left a nurse came in and asked doug if he was experiencing pain a little in the bones nothing heavy he rubbed his ribs and his jaw the chart said his spleen was already enlarged maybe dangerously so dr ramirez says you can have percocet if you want what do you think doc jeremy said you know how you feel it wouldnt be chickenshit not hardly yeah then shoot me up doug smiled up at the nurse can i have some rum too or a beer she was a young one and she winked on your own time stud cool said doug maybe doc herell get me something refreshing aiding and abetting said the nurse everyone chuckled filling the time the nurse shot percocet into the iv line the drug had no clear effect for a while then doug said yeah its taking the edge off doc mind if i sleep the parents and the wife were waiting right outside the door marika short pretty with shaggy blond hair and stunned blue eyes her belly bore the swell of early pregnancy she looked around sixteen she didnt talk and neither did dougs father doug senior mrs vilardi talked for all of them and jeremy stayed with the family for another hour filled his ears with weeping stuffed his soul full of misery after that came the conference with bill ramirez another twenty minutes answering the reasonable caring questions of the night nurses thinking out plans to be made for future psychological support and finally charting when he finally stepped out into the hallway it was early morning and he could barely keep his eyes open he returned to his office to collect his raincoat and his briefcase considered another go at the computer thought better of it he drove home on autopilot passing the nowdark façade of the excelsior gliding through empty sepia streets unaware of the moon head blessedly free of thoughts and pictures stumbling into his house he managed to get out of his clothes before his feet gave way he was deeply asleep before he hit the pillow he overslept ate no breakfast dressed as if donning a costume his first appointment was doug vilardi at eleven the young man would be starting chemotherapy that afternoon if that and more radiation didnt bring about remission the only option was a bone marrow transplant and that meant transfer to another hospital fifty miles away the decision to opt for treatment could have been agonizing treatment had saved dougs life but it had also poisoned his bone marrow doug hadnt wavered what the fuck doc whatm i supposed to do curl up and die i got a baby coming not a particularly smart kid not sophisticated or articulate the challenge for jeremy had been helping him put his thoughts into words but once hed gotten there doug had sailed jeremys approach had been to ask about bricklaying you should see i built some walls man some serious walls me too know that cathedral st urbans over on the south end the rectory on the side the smaller building its all brick not like the church which is stone we repaired that my company and me had all these curves you look at it think howd they do that jeremy knew the cathedral had never noticed the rectory and it came out good better than good man it was beautiful everyone said so the priests all of em good for you it wasnt only me it was the whole crew i learned from those guys now we got newer guys and im teaching them i gotta get back to work if i dont work i feel doug threw up his hands jeremy nodded my moms scared of them treating me says they caused my new problem but what the fuck doc whatm i supposed to do jeremy drove to the hospital thinking about the young mans optimism probably something constitutional from what jeremy had seen a positive outlook had little to do with your actual life experiences some folks saw the donut others the holes that latenight supper said the old eccentrics were donut people survivors believing themselves worthy of linen and china and silver three meats foie gras petits fours the driest of champagnes the latenight supper had been the first fabulous meal jeremy had enjoyed in years where did he fit in the donuthole continuum observer ever the diarist when he got to his office a note from the head of oncology was in his box jc perused your chapter here are a few suggestions but all in all fine when can we look forward to a completed manuscript also in the box was a cardboard box stamped book rate and postmarked locally inside was a hardcover book bound in forest green cloth the blood runs cold serial killers and their crimes by colin pugh twelveyearold copyright british publishing house no jacket no details on the author inside the cover was a penciled price and black rubberstamped gothic lettering that read renfrews central book shop used antiquarian followed by the defunct stores address and phone number hed never thought of the place as having a name let alone a number could never recall hearing a phone ring as he browsed he dialed the seven digits got a disconnected message and felt comforted his name and hospital address were typed on the carton he checked inside for a card or message found none flipped the books pages nothing turning to the first chapter he began reading fifteen chapters fifteen killers hed heard of most of them vlad the impaler bluebeard the boston strangler ted bundy son of sam jack the ripper the chapter on the whitehall fiend confirmed jeremys graffiti recollection the exact wording of the chalked scrawl had been the juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing a few he hadnt peter kurten the dusseldorf monster herman mudge albert fish carl panzram he lapsed into skimming details of the outrages blurred and the perpetrators merged into one ghastly mass for all their grisly work murderous psychopaths were a boring bunch creatures of morbid habit forged from the same twisted mold the final chapter caught jeremys eye gerd dergraav the laser butcher dergraav was a norwegianborn physician the son of a german diplomat father stationed in oslo and a dentist mother who abandoned the family and moved to africa a brilliant student young gerd studied medicine and qualified as both an otolaryngolist and an ophthalmologist shifting interests yet again he served as a chief resident in obstetricsgynecology at the oslo institute for female medicine the war years were spent doing research in norway in he took an advanced fellowship in the treatment of obstetric tumors in paris his father died in fully certified in three subspecialties dergraav moved to his mothers home city berlin where he built a highly successful practice delivering babies and attending to the disorders of women his patients adored him because of his sensitivity and his willingness to listen all were unaware of the six hidden cameras in dergraavs examining room that allowed the doctor to amass a sixhundredreel library of naked women early details of dergraavs childhood were lacking and author pugh supplanted fact with freudian speculation one fact had been verified shortly after arriving in germany the urbane young doctor began picking up prostitutes and torturing them ample payments to the street women procured their silence so did the absence of scars dergraav had a brutes lust but a surgeons touch later interviews with the early victims revealed dergraavs penchant for humiliating his victims and a secret cache of videotapes from the doctors later years showed him whipping punching biting and jabbing with hypodermic needles over two hundred women he also enjoyed plunging their hands into icy water and compressing their limbs with bloodpressure cuffs then measuring time latency till pain sensation frequently dergraav filmed himself as well in closeup smiling subtly a handsome man pugh claimed though no photo confirmation was offered during the late fifties dergraav married an upperclass woman the daughter of a fellow physician and fathered a child shortly after bodies of prostitutes began showing up in the slums of berlin cut into pieces street gossip eventually led to attention being focused on dr dergraav questioned in his office the gynecologist professed surprise that the police would suspect him of anything sinister and he evinced no anxiety or guilt the detectives had trouble imagining the charming softspoken surgeon as the demon behind the horrific mutilations they were encountering more and more frequently dergraav was filed as a lowprobability suspect the prostitute butcherings continued on and off for nearly a decade the killers disdain for his victims intensified and he dehumanized them by mixing up body parts and combining them so that limbs and organs from several different women came to be found bagged together in plastic sacks and left in trash bins when forensic evidence from a victim in led the coroner to conclude that a laser had been used for dissection the police reviewed their notes and discovered dergraav traveled to paris yet again to learn how to use the stillexperimental instrument for eye surgery this seemed curious as dergraav wasnt an ophthalmologist and they questioned him again dergraav apprised them of his ophthalmologic training proved it with certificates and claimed he was thinking of switching back to his former subspecialty because of the promise offered by lasers for corneal ablation the police asked if they could search his office the doctors consent was needed no grounds for a warrant existed charmingly smilingly dergraav declined during the interview he laughed and told the investigators they couldnt be farther off the mark his use of the laser was limited to academics and the instrument was far too expensive for him to own furthermore his gynecologic specialty was the surgical treatment of vulvodynia vaginal pain he was a physician his mission in life was to alleviate agony not cause it the police left three days later dergraavs office suite and his home were emptied and padlocked and wiped clean of fingerprints the doctor and his family were gone dergraavs wife surfaced a year later in england then in new york where she professed ignorance of her husbands behavior and his whereabouts she sought and was granted a divorce from dergraav changed her name and was never heard from again colin pugh cited speculation that the doctor had been taken in by american officials as payback for wartime cooperation by dergraavs father the oslobased diplomat had deceived his nazi masters and passed crucial information to the allies however this remained rumor and subsequent sightings of gerd dergraav placed him far from the states in switzerland portugal morocco bahrain beirut syria and brazil the last two locales were verified some time during the early s dergraav slipped into rio de janeiro using a syrian passport issued in his own name and managed to obtain expedited brazilian citizenship remarried with a child he lived openly in rio purchasing a villa above ipanema beach and volunteering his services to a human rights group that offered free medical service to the slum dwellers of the citys fetid favillas dergraav swam sunbathed ate well argentinian beefsteak was his favorite and worked tirelessly without pay among the human rights workers and the favillitos he came to be known as the white angel a tribute to both his pale coloring and his pure soul during his known residence in rio that citys prostitutes began showing up dead and cut into pieces degraavs second reign of murder lasted another decade in the end he was snared by the most banal of circumstances the screams of a prostitute he was attempting to asphyxiate attracted a gang of hoodlums from the neighboring slum and dergraav fled into the night the thugs exploited the bound and gagged womans helplessness by gangraping her but they left her alive after some indecision she reported the doctor to the police dergraavs house was searched by rio detectives less concerned than their german counterparts with due process the cache of videotapes was found including one in which the doctor reduced a womans body to forty chunks using a laser scalpel in the film dergraav narrated as he mutilated describing the procedure just as he would a bona fide surgery also retrieved was a suede box filled with womens jewelry and a cache carved of rosewood rattling with vertebrae teeth and knucklebones imprisoned in salvador de bahia prison dergraav awaited trial for two years ever the charmer jailers brought him international newspapers literary magazines and scientific journals catered food was delivered citing worries about his cholesterol dergraav ate less beef more chicken rumor had it that money would soon exchange hands and the doctor would be deported under cover of night back to the middle east then german authorities learned of the arrest requested and received permission to extradite that process stretched on and dergraav could be seen sitting in the prisons courtyard relaxed dressed in tropical whites nuzzling with his wife playing with his child finally the german authorities got their way the day after the extradition certificate was drawn dergraav blocked the peephole in his cell with chewing gum ripped up his jailissue clothing knotted the strips into a rope and hung himself he was nearly sixty but had the appearance of a fortyyearold the jailer who discovered him remarked on the healthy peaceful appearance of the white angels corpse nearly seventeen years ago to the day gerd dergraavs ashes had been strewn at sea seventeen years ago jumpstarted jeremys memory the first laser article had been published that very year norwegian authors russians an englishman he rechecked the names no dergraav it was the date he was supposed to notice origins in oslo seventeen years ago a murderous doctor had hung himself laser surgery physician suicide oslo paris damascus by way of berlin gerd dergraav had been born and trained in the norwegian capital learned female surgery in france settled and tortured and murdered in berlin escaped to damascus arthur and surrogates had traced the laser butchers bloody swath how long before a postcard of rio arrived in the mail a pretty picture of sugarloaf or the white sands of ipanema or some other brazilian panorama dr c traveling and learning the cards had set up the pattern the articles had filled in blanks laser surgery on the eyes because dergraav had begun as an ophthalmologist before switching to ent the source of the envelopes lasers for female surgery to match dergraavs final career switch womens doctor womens killer where did the english girls fit in dergraav was long dead by the time of their murders why all this attention paid to someone whose ashes had dissolved in a warm welcoming ocean seventeen years ago then he remembered his night drinking with arthur collegial time in the excelsior bar that old man had been so intent on sharing telling that apparently pointless story predatory insects that burrowed under their victims skins in order to plant their parasitic spawn the moral he himself had drawn from the tale sins of the fathers arthurs pet topic the origins of very very bad behavior when gerd dergraav fled germany his wife escaped to the states changed her name disappeared into the great american freedom along with her son dergraav dirgrove arthur laying it out for him wanting jeremy to understand the son was here now jeremy knew that his initial instinct had been right that day in the dining room arthur had been studying dirgrove and for some time dirgrove had been studying jeremy watching following jeremy and angela such a sensitive guy always there to listen to a needy resident no doubt his patients loved him a nice case of genetic charm merilee saunderss mother had been smitten but merilee hadnt been taken in freaky dirgrove roboticon now merilee was dead did sensitive ted have a camera hidden in his office todays technology made that so much easier than in his fathers day everything miniaturized computerized getting rid of the daughter taking the mother the take was the core dirgrove had targeted angela because she was already seeing another man just as apes raided colonies of other apes murdered the males made off with the females some humans did the same thing under cover of war or religion or whatever dogma was at hand some humans needed no excuse a sickening realization hit jeremy sensitive ted and jocelyn putting a face on his lovers killer drove home the horror and suddenly jeremy was as wrenched and raw and overcome by weeping as the day hed found out a red film blanketed his vision and he lost balance had to struggle to remain on his feet he walked to the window threw it open on stale air shaft fumes stood there hearing the rattle of a generator snippets of human speech the wind heart tripping breath raspy swallowing the scream jocelyn taken from him because of him now dirgrove had turned his sights on angela he forced himself to stay calm reasoned it out still staring out at the air shaft killing and dissecting was latenight supper for a monster a nice girl like jocelyn as the main course street girls tossed in as snacks angela as dessert no the banquet would never end unless the diner choked he thought about dirgroves technique attracting angela with his sensitivity being different than the other surgeons the same ploy his father had used charming ted had been how old late twenties when his father hung himself the barest progress from adolescence to manhood an age of strong sexuality strong impulses well aware of his fathers impulses the origin of very very bad behavior a bright man a careful man hed set up the move on angela with surgical precision inviting her over for a medical lesson all the journals bookmarked laid out neatly on his desk angela ever the good student begins reading he steps behind her i can make you happy had all that just been a setup an appetizer for his ultimate plan had dirgrove set jocelyn up the same way shed never mentioned his name to jeremy but why would she a surgeon conferring with a nurse was the essence of usual would dirgrove have had anything to do with jocelyns neurology patients if one of them had developed heart problems sure was it possible that hed hit on jocelyn and shed chosen not to tell jeremy people talked about sharing but jocelyn had cared deeply about her patients a doctor pretending to do the same would have impressed her mightily angela was a highly intelligent woman and shed been fooled jocelyn for all her street smarts had been an innocent easy pickings a surgeon showing up late at night in the nurses lot waving smiling wouldnt have sparked any panic in jocelyn as always she was overconfident laughed off jeremys suggestions that she not walk to her car alone a weary whitecoated warrior dragging his way toward her after a tough day on the wards would have evoked sympathy from jocelyn he approaches her they chat he takes her the more he reasoned it out the more convinced he became that dirgrove had toyed with him too asking him to see merilee saunders but not telling merilee knowing jeremy would encounter anger resistance walk away feeling like a failure taunting him by telling him hed been a big help delivering the message through angela the referral had been a sham or something much worse was all dirgroves talk about the risk of an autonomic spike simply laying the groundwork for what he knew would happen in the or had merilee been frightened about her surgery because she sensed something about the surgeon hes a stiff except when he wants to turn on the charm my mom loves him dirgrove hadnt even bothered to inform jeremy about the or disaster had dropped the news in the cafeteria after finishing a chat with angela how had he managed it the merest flick of his wrist after hed flayed the chest sawed through bone exposed the pericardial sac dipped lustily in to take hold of the pulsating plum the skinless tomato that nourished merilees soul whats the worst that can happen i die jeremy was due to see doug vilardi in five minutes he took a detour to the ground floor of the office wing entered the attending staff office and asked the secretary for a look at his own curriculum vitae in the academic status file yours doctor i want to make sure youve got the most current version he was drymouthed felt shaky hoped he was coming across credible hoped she wouldnt take the trouble to remove his cv from the looseleaf binder but rather hand over the entire book here you go doctor yes he took the binder to a chair across the room sat down flipped to cardiothoracic surgery and when the secretary became involved in a personal phone call tore out theodore g dirgroves most current résumé folded it hastily and stuffed it in his pocket he hurried to the nearest mens room and locked himself in a stall the folded papers were burning a hole in his pocket and he ripped them free theodore gerd dirgrove born in berlin germany april a perfect match to colin pughs chronology of the laser butchers life marriage to an upperclass woman birth of a child during the late fifties dirgrove listed himself as growing up in baltimore attending college and medical school at an elite eastern university not the same ivycovered citadel where norbert levy had taught engineering and physics but one very much like it science awards graduation with high honors the usual hurdlejumps the bastard had published a fair number of academic papers in surgical journals angela had mentioned a lecture on revascularization of the heart and there it was one of dirgroves specialties endomyocardial laser channeling for revascularization perhaps thats what hed been demonstrating to mandel and the dark mustached man showing off his technique proud of his virtuosity with the instrument his father had wielded so creatively a humptydumpty situation jeremy scanned the résumé and something else caught his eye for the past six years dirgrove had spent his summers in london teaching bypass surgery at kings college of medicine six summers ago bridget sapsted had been abducted and murdered in kent a couple of hours drive from the city her skeleton retrieved two years later after her chum suzie had met the same fate dirgrove had been in england during both killings thats why jeremys question about surgical precision had seized the attention of detective inspector nigel langdon ret whod undoubtedly called his successor det insp michael shreve and shreve had taken the time to return jeremys call not to inform him to pump him then shreve tracked down and alerted his american counterpart bob doresh leading to doreshs showing up at jeremys office both langdon and shreve had been to oslo random travel or were the british investigators familiar with the details of gerd dergraavs swath of horror and aware of similarities to the kent murders and now a spate of american murders how much did doresh understand the man came across as cloddish but jeremy remembered his first impression he and his partner hoker eyes that didnt miss a thing but they were missing plenty now why do they still suspect me because bureaucracy trumps creativity and expediency trumps justice there was no point dealing with doresh or his ilk despite what jeremy knew the nightmare truths of which he was certain sharing with the mulish detective would be useless worse it would cast more suspicion on jeremy great theory doc so youre pretty interested in this gory stuff huh going through channels wasnt going to work he needed to be unfettered and that he realized with staggering clarity was the whole point of arthurs correspondence the messages the old man had sent directly and through his ccc pals the focus of the entire latenight supper tina ballerons suggestion that he stay on target think about the gannet birds simply doing the right thing evil happened and too often expediency did trump justice the law demanded evidence and due process but provided little to make things right husbands were murdered at their desks their killers never brought to justice men of spirit and peace were gunned down in greasy parking lots fortunes were plundered entire families entire races wiped out and no one paid the price a tiny blond beauty born to smile could be taken so easily you couldnt depend on others to fix things arthur had been certain jeremy would understand that because jeremy had been through it sitting in the toilet stall a wave of peace washed over him pathology and psychology were polar opposites but none of that mattered what counted was the ordeal the sword of war comes to the world for the delay of justice a twothousandyearold lesson from the fathers but it couldnt have been more timely a glance at his watch reproached him twicestricken doug vilardi was waiting for him another type of ordeal at least this pain was something jeremy had been trained to deal with words strategic pauses kindness in the eyes meaning it not enough not nearly enough here i come victims of the world god help all of us doug looked like a patient hooked up to his chemo drip still in good spirits and voluble but his facial muscles had slackened his prosthesis was covered in a vinyl case and lay on the floor jeremy sat down made small talk tried to edge him toward masonry doug shook off the distraction you know what bugs me doc two things first of all they let other guys get their chemo at home but me they want to keep cooped up here did you ask dr ramirez about that yeah my spleens fucked up theyll maybe have to take it out he grinned no heavy lifting i might explode make a big fucking mess the grin faded also my livers not primo see he tugged down an eyelid the sclera was greenish beige jeremy said no beer today too bad about that so howve you been you said two things were bothering you oh yeah number two everyones being too damn nice to me creeps me out like they think im gonna die or something i can write an order if youd like said jeremy everyone be obnoxious to doug the young man laughed yeah do that so youve been okay doc fine you look a little i dunno wiped out they working you too hard same old same old yeah no offense that crack about looking tired maybe its me maybe im not seeing things right fact is when i saw you yesterday after all those years im thinking this guy doesnt change it was like back then when i first met you i was a kid and you were a grownup and now im grownup and you havent really changed that much its like what life slows down when you get older is that what happens it can said jeremy guess it depends on how much fun youre having said doug what do you mean you know what they always say time goes fast when youre having fun my lifes been a blast zip zip zip one thing after the other fucking adventures one day im knocking up walls and then and now im having a baby he glanced at the butterfly needle embedded atop his hand i hope they hurry up with getting me better gotta get the fuck outta here got lots of things to do when he drifted off to sleep jeremy left the room and encountered dougs parents and wife that turned into another hour in the cafeteria where jeremy brought the three of them coffee and food they protested weakly thanked him profusely young marika barely spoke still stunned she avoided jeremys eyes when he tried to make contact doug vilardi sr spent most of his time putting on the good cheer that seemed to weary his wife but she rolled with it most of the hour was filled with small talk when jeremy got up to leave so did dougs mother she walked him out of the cafeteria said ive never met a doctor like you then she took jeremys face in both of her hands and kissed his forehead a maternal kiss it reminded jeremy of something that had happened to him a long time ago but he couldnt be sure he saw his other patients went to meet angela up on the chest ward where she was finishing her last day he found her in the company of three other residents on the way to some kind of meeting got her away from the group with a raised eyebrow and herded her into an empty nurses room how are you doing fine she bit her lip ive been going over what happened i think i overreacted you didnt said jeremy it happened and it was bad well thats not very comforting it happened angela of course it did i never doubted it did but i repeated it for emphasis he said because eventually you may start to doubt that it happened denials like that im denying her dark eyes flashed its not a putdown denials not weakness not neurotic its a fact of life a natural defense your mind and body will naturally want to protect themselves go with that you may surprise yourself by feeling happy dont fight that i may surprise myself she said whats that some sort of posthypnotic suggestion its a reasonable prediction im not close to happy sooner or later you will be the feelings will pass but it happened angela stared at him all this advice heres more said jeremy stay away from him hes very bad news what do you just stay away i wouldnt worry about that she said this morning he was rounding heading straight at me in the hall i held my ground and when he saw me he changed directions turned around and walked around to the other side took a circuitous route just to avoid me so you see hes worried about me if you knew lets keep it that way what are you saying jeremy you dont think i can handle him im sure you can just avoid him listen to me please he took hold of her shoulders drew her close this is scaring me a little good if youre careful theres nothing to be scared of promise me youll stay away from him and look out for yourself she pulled away from him jeremy youre really freaking me out what is going on hes a bad guy i cant say more what that heart patient who died did you learn something about that that may be part of it part of it god what is going on nothing he said you come in here with all these dire pronouncements and now youre holding back whats gotten into you youre off thoracic so it shouldnt be a problem just do your work and stay away from him he smiled dont take candy from strangers not funny she snapped you cant just do you think he said that i want to upset you no i dont know i wish i knew whats come over you why wont you tell me whats going on he thought about that because im not sure about dirgrove about everything hes done everything her eyes got hard this is about her jocelyn isnt it and dont close up the way you did when i hinted around about her the other day i know you went through hell know i can never really understand it but dont you think with whats happened to us with how close weve gotten so quickly that you could trust me enough to not throw up barriers jeremys head pounded he wanted to hold her kiss her drive her away its not a matter of closing up he said softly theres just nothing to talk about and this isnt the time nothing she said you go through something like that and nothing jeremy didnt answer she said thats the way it has to be huh for the time being okay she said youre the expert on human emotions ive got to go you pulled me away just as we were going to conference with the chief tropical pulmonary disease maybe ill take a rotation in some jungle clinic jeremys head filled with teeming squirming insects the jungle he said is an interesting place she gaped at him as if he was mad walked around him avoided touching him made it to the door and turned the knob hard he said when will you be free not for some time she said without looking back you know how it is the schedule he finished his charts talked to ramirez about doug vilardi and paged angela from a phone on five west no reply returning to his office he repeated the page his beeper remained silent he tried the nursing station on chest ward the residents locker room the house staff office zip two hours had passed since hed angered her and he found himself missing her being alone was different now no longer part of him a phantom limb you couldnt miss someone after two hours silly and even if angela shut him out for a while it was all for the better as long as she heeded him and stayed away from dirgrove he thought she would she was an extremely bright person a welladjusted person he thought of the obsessivecompulsive rituals to which shed confessed a driven woman all the better in the end good sense would prevail and shed stick with it besides he needed to be alone for a while had work to do night work jeremy avoided scrutiny by keeping odd hours and entering the hospital through another outofthe way rear door one on the basement level that led to a loading bay one of those forgotten places inevitable in a place as old and sprawling as city central same level as pathology and the morgue but the opposite wing here he passed laundry rooms boiler housing electrical entrails storage space for defunct medical charts the guts he liked that he kept to a schedule saw doug and his other patients at the assigned times but left the wards by the stairs rather than the elevators no coffee or meals in the ddr or the cafeteria when he was hungry which was infrequent he grabbed something at a fastfood stand his skin grew greasy but that was the price you paid once as he stuffed french fries down his gullet without tasting he thought a far cry from foie gras cheap food sat in his gut just dandy thank you perhaps hed never been destined for better he made sure to check his mail at days end but received no more cards from arthur no surprises in interoffice envelopes they know ive been educated sufficiently when he left the hospital he put the place out of his mind concentrating on night work driving cruising through the garbagestrewn alleys of iron mount past the pawnbrokers and bail bondsmen and rescue missions and discount clothing stalls that filled the slum a couple of times he headed out to saugatuck finger where he removed his shoes despite the frozen air and walked barefoot in the hard wet sand no remnants of the crime scene remained just beach and lake and gulls and ragged picnic tables behind the spit loomed the backdrop of big trees that would have served the killer so well both times he stayed for just a few moments studying the rippling murk of the water finding a dead crab here a stormbuffeted rock there when the rain came so cold it was a step away from sleet he allowed it to pummel his bare head sometimes he cruised the industrial stretch that separated the two kill spots and wondered where the next woman would be found driving openly with the novas radio blasting oldies thinking about terrible things after dark he took the scenic route north the same route that had led him to the gates of the haverford country club and the brief cool talk with tina balleron this time he stopped well before hale gave way to estate acreage at the far end of the boulevard where he motored slowly up chic elmshaded streets edged with bistros and boutiques and custom jewelers and graystone town houses until he found the kind of parking space he needed a spot that gave him a full close view of a particular creamcolored limestone highrise a postmodern thing with gratuitous trim a greencanopied awning a cobbled circular drive not one but two maroonliveried doormen one of the best addresses on hale a premium condo the place theodore g dirgrove md listed on his curriculum vitae under home address exactly the kind of sleek stylish building in which youd expect a successful surgeon to live with his wife and two children that had been a bit of a surprise dirgrove married with kids playing at domestic life then jeremy thought no its not of course hed play the game just as his father had done spouse patricia jennings dirgrove children brandon sonja sweet another surprise dirgrove drove a dull car a fiveyearold buick jeremy had expected something pricier something smooth and german wouldnt that have been a nice tribute to daddy once again dirgroves cleverness became apparent whod notice the grayish blue sedan nosing its way out of a darkened alley in a lowrent neighborhood when you knew what you were dealing with everything made sense clarity was a heady drug jeremy worked all day drove all night lived on insight convinced himself he rarely needed to eat or sleep the surgeon kept surgeons hours often leaving for work before am and not returning until well after dark on the third day of watching dirgrove took his family out to dinner and jeremy got a good look at the wife and kids as they piled into the buick patricia jennings dirgrove was short and pleasantlooking a brunette with a curly rather mannish hairdo good figure high energy nimble from the flash of face jeremy caught a determined woman she wore a black furcollared wrap and left it unbuttoned jeremy caught a glimpse of red knit pants and matching top one step above sweats dressing for comfort dirgrove hadnt changed out of the days suit and tie the children resembled patty as jeremy came to call her more than ted brandon was stocky with a mop of dark hair little sonja slightly fairer but with none of dirgroves nordic bone structure for their sake jeremy hoped the lack of resemblance to their father didnt end there cute kids he knew what was in store for them he followed them to dinner ted and patty chose a midpriced italian place ten blocks south where they were seated up front visible to the street behind a plateglass window decorated by ornate gold leaf lettering inside were wooden booths a brassrailed cappuccino bar a copper espresso machine jeremy parked around the corner and made his way past the restaurant on foot drawing the lapels of his raincoat around his face a newly purchased black fedora set low he strolled past the window eyes concealed by the hats brim bought a newspaper from a stand to look normal and repeated the pass back and forth three more times dirgrove never looked up from his lasagna the surgeon sat there bored all the smiling conversation between brandon and sonja and mom patty was attentive to the kids helped the little girl twirl spaghetti on her fork during his final pass jeremy saw her glance at her husband ted didnt notice he was staring off at the espresso machine family time when would he leave the comforts of hearth and home and do what really turned him on it happened on the fourth night a day full of surprises that morning jeremy received a postcard from rio beautiful bodies on a white sand brazilian beach he felt smart dr c traveling and learning ac so am i my friend as if that wasnt enough he received a call from edgar marquis at pm just before he was ready to embark on the nights surveillance dr carrier said the ancient diplomat im delivering a message from arthur oh yes hed like me to inform you that hes enjoying his vacation finding it quite educational he hopes youve been well thank you sir said jeremy well and busy ah said marquis thats good i imagine youd think so sir marquis cleared his throat well then thats all good evening whered he call from mr marquis he didnt say jeremy laughed youre not going to tell me a damn thing are you not even now now im on the job mr marquis no answer jeremy said just indulge me on one small detail ccc what does it stand for howd it get started what drew you together good food and wine dr carrier right said jeremy silence what was your ordeal mr marquis what lit the fire in your belly the merest hesitation chili peppers jeremy waited for more the cuisine of indonesia said marquis can be quite piquant i was educated there in matters of taste and reason so said jeremy thats the way its going to be the ancient man didnt respond mr marquis i dont imagine youd tell me when arthurs due back arthur makes his own schedule im sure he does goodbye sir doctor with regard to the origins of our little group suffice it to say that your participation would be considered harmonious in more ways than one would it oh yes consider it a case of the obvious obvious what obvious marquis repeated etched in stone no caller id to trace the bottomline people said anything beyond basic phone service was a frivolity as jeremy took the stairs down to the rear exit he digested what marquis had told him spicy food in indonesia i was educated there marquiss baptism of loss had taken place in that island nation one day if jeremy was sufficiently curious hed try to find out at the moment he had watching to do when he got to the rear exit he found it padlocked had someone gotten wise to him or was it just a quirk of competence on the part of the security guards he made his way back toward the hospital lobby pausing by the candy machine where hed spied bob doresh and buying himself a chocolatecovered coconut cluster hed never really liked candy even as a child hed never been tempted now he craved sugar chewing happily he neared the hospitals main entrance passed the donor wall etched in stone and there it was mr and mrs robert balleron founders donation ten years ago below that a more recent contribution founders level four years ago judge tina f balleron in loving memory of robert balleron the donor list wasnt alphabetized and that made it a bit more timeconsuming but jeremy found them all by the time the last speck of coconut had tumbled down his throat he was flushed with insight professor norbert levy in loving memory of his family four years ago mr harrison maynard in loving memory of his mother effie mae maynard and dr martin luther king same year ditto mr edgar molton marquis in loving memory of kurau village and arthur chess md in memory of sally chess susan chess and arthur chess junior arthur had lost his entire family too horrible to contemplate and jeremy couldnt afford that level of empathy right now jamming the candy wrapper into his pocket he retraced his steps through the lobby and headed for the development office development was institutional jargon for fundraising and jeremy recalled the place as staffed by slim chatty young women in designer suits and headed by a blowhard named albert trope it was pm a window of time remained dirgrove rarely got home before sixthirty seven nonmedical personnel tended to leave well before five so it was probably too late to catch the office open but he was here already the chatty young women had left but the door was open and a janitor a moroselooking slav probably one of the recent immigrants the hospital had taken to hiring because they knew nothing about labor laws was vacuuming the plush blue walltowall jeremy his professional staff badge in full view walked right past the man and over to a fauxregency bookshelf in a corner of the generous reception room good perfume remnants of the young women hung in the air the entire room was done up in highstyle pretense the place looked like a movie set of a french salon make the deeppocket crowd feel right at home the janitor ignored jeremy as he pawed through the case on the shelves were plasticcovered testimonials from satisfied patients photo albums of cute little kids cured at city central gushing accounts of celebrity visits along with the requisite photo ops and years and years of fundraising ephemera including journals of the hospitals biggest event the yearly gala ball jeremy had been to one gala two years ago asked to deliver a speech on humanism then leave before dinner he found the fouryearold edition in front was an explanation of several tiers of contribution within each tier names were listed alphabetically donor sponsor patron founder gold ribbon circle founder meant a twentythousanddollar pledge the ccc people had ponied up generously he found a picture of all of them together arthur at the center surrounded by balleron marquis maynard and levy ccc the city central club so this was where it had started five altruists convening for the common good finding common ground no doubt arthur charismatic gregarious curious arthur had played a pivotal role in drawing them together hed lost his family the man could be excused a bit of enthusiasm for camaraderie for justice you gutta go said the janitor hed switched off his vacuum cleaner and the waiting room was quiet sure thanks said jeremy good night the man grumbled and picked at his ear jeremy made it to hale boulevard by sixforty found a terrific observation spot and sat until nine when dirgrove finally showed up for three nights running dirgrove had stayed at home and jeremy kept his expectation low but when dirgrove left his buick in the circular drive and the doorman didnt park it he knew tonight would be different there you go ted make my life a little bit easier at elevenfifteen the surgeon emerged got his keys tipped the night doorman and drove off south toward iron mount straight into iron mount the rain had lifted and the streetwalkers were out in force bundled in fake furs and padded ski jackets short garb that allowed a clear view of shapely legs made longer by maliciously heeled shoes young legs old faces a highstepping prancing parade very little auto traffic no one but working girls willing to brave the cold dirgrove drove past them unmindful of jeremy trailing a block back the novas headlights switched off a stupid dangerous way to drive a couple of times jeremy narrowly missed hitting dopeblurred women who stepped off the curb his reward curses uplifted fingers but what was his choice worstcase scenario some cop would pull him over for a traffic violation not likely no patrol cars in sight too cold for the cops that made him realize something there was no police presence at all on these meanest of streets for all doreshs talk about working the killings these were throwaway women no one cared tyrene mazurskys name had made the paper but the following victim the woman left on the spit hadnt even merited that at this rate the next one wouldnt get a line of ink expediency trumps virtue dirgrove kept going at a moderate speed past coveys of hookers jeremy waited for him to choose his prey but the buick never slowed cut right through iron mount crossed under a land bridge passed a grid of shuttered commercial buildings and entered the neighboring district also lowrent jeremy wasnt sure if this area had a name not really a neighborhood just a dark uninhabited stretch of businesses closed for the night wholesalers and small factories no streetwalkers here no reason for there to be the nearest bar or strip joint or dope peddler was a good mile away deserted except for the woman who stepped out of the shadows and stood at the curb in front of a long stretch of chainlink fence she waited bobbed up and down on needle heels when the anonymous grayblue buick came to a halt she tossed her hair the prostitute got into dirgroves car and jeremy sat watching a hundred feet up his lights off same for his engine no exhaust or noise gave him away between him and the buick were two parked cars he opened his window stuck his head out a bit to get a better view cold air seared his lungs he suffered gladly his key remained in the ignition ready at any moment to follow the buick knowing he had to be there ifwhen things got ugly hell have to take her somewhere keep his car clean he needs space to work dissection some makeshift operatory in the bowels of the slums the buicks lights went off white smoke curled from its exhaust pipes then dissipated the car just sat there five minutes ten fifteen at twenty jeremy began to panic wondered if hed been horribly wrong what if dirgrove did use the car maybe thats why he drove an old one no too careless you could never get rid of the blood perhaps he anesthetized them in the car strangled them should he chance a closer look the clap of a car door closing broke into his thoughts the prostitute had gotten out was tugging at her clothing she waved at the buick and dirgrove drove away decision time follow the car or talk to the woman warn her yes hes a charming guy this time you got off easily the prostitute walked up the block heels clacking butt swaying long legs stiltlike she got into one of the parked cars a streetwalker with her own wheels that was a switch nice wheels a lexus one of the smaller models a light color shiny hubcaps maybe this one had no pimp kept all her earnings but working out here away from the motorcade of potential customers that cruised iron mount how lucrative could it be and why work a freezing street if you could afford a car like that unless this one went for quality not quantity men like dirgrove paying a premium for whatever it was she offered the lexus pulled away from the curb jeremy waited until shed made a right at the next corner before turning the ignition key she drove toward downtown checking her image in the rearview mirror talking on a cell phone once but otherwise driving carefully conventionally with no eye toward snagging any more business one good customer a night what did she do for him the lexus held its course neared the hospital district neared city central the prostitute drove to a quiet street around the corner from city central just yards from the nurses lot where jocelyn had been taken parking she switched off her headlights she stayed there for four minutes during which time jeremy saw her arms rise and a garment slip over her head then another piece of clothing something with long sleeves was rolled down in its place changing outfits when she was through she consulted the rearview again switched on a reading light not long enough for jeremy to get a good look at her but he could tell what she was doing touching up her lipstick then she was cruising again one block to the doctors lot into the lot jeremy followed okay now out in the open because this was a place he belonged so did she she slid a card into the slot and the gate opened they both parked the lexus was pale blue when she got out of the car he recognized her as a physician hed seen around but had never met an internist he was pretty sure had come on staff fairly recently midforties good figure pleasant but unremarkable face blond hair textured in an efficient bob she wore a kneelength charcoal wool skirt in place of the mini shed sported during her tryst with dirgrove the garment shed slipped over her head was a pink cashmere cowl neck sweater that she quickly concealed with a long gray herringbone coat with a black velvet collar spike heels had been replaced by sensible loafers she wore glasses when jeremy passed her on the way to the covered walkway she smiled at him and said brrr its chilly jeremy smiled back diamond wedding ring on her finger what was her name gwen something should he warn her or did other women need to be warned about her every two years a face book was issued to the medical staff jeremy had never found it necessary to consult his wasnt even sure hed kept it but he found it in a bottom drawer of his desk hundreds of faces but only percent were women so the tale was told soon enough gwynn alice hauser md internal medicine an assistant professor dr hauser had a secret life how far did it go over the next four days jeremy observed gwynn hauser on the wards and in the doctors dining room she made no contact at all with dirgrove generally took her meals alone or in the company of other women a cheerful sort prone to laughter and flamboyant gestures when she really got into a conversation she removed her eyeglasses and leaned forward listened actively as if what the person before her was saying was profound beyond belief one time she lunched with a tall dark handsome man in a blue doublebreasted suit and the square impassive face of a ceo wedding band on his hand too and he was openly affectionate with her the husband shes cheating on not a doctor some sort of financial type jeremy was willing to bet taking the time out to share a meal with his busy wife if he only knew how busy she was he encountered an internist hed worked with a man named jerry sallie and asked him if he knew gwynn hauser gwynn sure she make a move on you shes like that big tease im not sure shed come through said sallie at least not that ive heard shes married to a bank president has a sweet deal he lets her do what she wants shes a pretty good doc worlds biggest tease though nice legs huh friday night gwynn hauser left the hospital at seventhirty jeremy sitting low in his nova behind a pylon in the doctors lot waited as she drove away in her skycolored lexus dirgroves buick was still in place twenty minutes later the surgeon appeared at a near run jumped into the buick started the engine up with a roar and squealed out exact same block in the nameless industrial neighborhood dr gwynn hauser stepped out of the shadows just as she had the first time this time she had on an enormous white fur coat cloudwoman in spike heels someones vision of heaven when dirgrove pulled up she parted the coat revealed herself naked but for garters and stockings how could she stand the cold she couldnt shivered and drew the fur closed and jumped up and down pointing to the car let me in im freezing my ass off dirgrove did twentytwo minutes later they parted ways this time jeremy followed dirgrove the surgeon headed straight for his luxury condo on hale he stayed home all night family man when would he make his move doug vilardi looked bad some of the skin on his face and arms had sloughed an unexpected allergic reaction to chemo his white count remained way too high his spleen was engorged and his liver function had worsened in no shape to talk he remained awake and seemed to react well to jeremys presence jeremy sat there talked a bit found something on tv that caused the young man to smile recap of a weekold college football game once again jeremy took dougs slumber as his cue to leave and once again he encountered the family on the way out mrs vilardi and marika doug sr was at work they sat down in an empty waiting area the previous occupants had left behind a stack of interior design magazines and jeremy swept them aside this time marika talked about everything other than dougs illness what he liked to eat the dishes shed learned to cook from her motherinlaw how she was thinking of getting a puppy and did jeremy think that would be a good or a bad idea with a new baby coming the two women appeared close literally leaned against each other for support when jeremy asked about marikas family mrs vilardi answered for her they both passed on her poor mama was very young rosanna was one of my best friends a wonderful wonderful person when she got sick i used to take mari in to give her a quiet place to play because joe her dad was working and all she had was this aunt who was you know she smiled uneasily marika said i had a crazy aunt thats how doug came to know mari from my taking her in all the time then joe passed and it was convent boarding school but she came to visit all the time back then dougie wasnt interested in girls right honey she nudged marika the young woman said i was a skinny little stick with funny teeth and doug was into sports mrs vilardi said oh you were always a cutie to jeremy i always loved this one a real good girl tell the truth i thought shed be perfect for my other boy andy but you never know right baby you sure dont mom marikas eyes misted up dr carrier do you come from a big family excuse my getting personal and all but you just seem to have that warm heart pretty large said jeremy nice people i bet very nice ill come by later to see how hes doing he squeezed her hand then marikas and stood thanks as always doctor i didnt offend you did i by asking about your family not at all jeremy patted her shoulder for punctuation good she said because just for a second i thought you looked like i offended you im sure its me im probably seeing everything screwy going out of my head with all thats going on you know you need to rest said jeremy youre important to dougie doctor back the other time he always said you were the only one treated him like a human being he did agreed marika he told me that too jeremy smiled thats what he is a human being hes gonna be okay said mrs vilardi i can feel it as evening approached with just over an hour to go before he trailed ted dirgrove jeremy located angela through the house staff office shed rotated to endocrinology he went there and the charge nurse pointed to an examining room diabetic admitted for wound management she shouldnt be too long angela came out ten minutes later looking flustered hi im kind of tired take a break lets get some coffee ive already had my caffeine quotient it didnt help then have more he took her arm come on lets get you on a serious caf jag then what then i study you write it up publish a paper she tried not to smile failed okay but just for a few minutes instead of heading for the cafeteria he steered her to some vending machines on the next floor up the far end of the rehab ward inserted a dollar bill got both of them coffee that stuff she said its putrid dont think of it as a beverage its dope he guided her to a couple of hard orange chairs rehab was mostly a daytime thing and the ward was quiet i really am bushed she said and im nowhere near finished with my patients jeremy took her hand her skin was cool she looked away kept her fingers limp youre important to me he said i miss you and i know i screwed up i shouldnt have reacted the way i did im willing to talk about anything angela chewed her lip and stared down at her lap none of thats necessary jocelyns murder was worse than anything id ever imagined she was a big part of my life and losing her thinking about what she went through ripped chunks out of my heart i shouldve dealt with it sooner instead i let it fester cobblers kids going barefoot and all that angela raised her head tears flowed down her cheeks i shouldve understood i shouldnt have made demands no its good someones finally making demands on me ive been disconnected for a long time she drank coffee made a face it really is putrid her fingers tightened around jeremys i knew her not well but i knew her from when i rotated through neuro she was a sweet sweet girl one time i was charting and she was talking to another nurse about her boyfriend how great he was considerate caring how he always made her feel special the other nurse tried to make a joke out of it something like you know those shrinks they learn to be sensitive in school jocelyn wouldnt hear it cut her off said dont joke it away im serious im serious about him i remember thinking what kind of guy could inspire that i didnt know it was you even after we started going out i had no idea i just liked you because when you lectured to us you were so intense about what you did about bringing out the humanity in everyone thats the message i wanted to hear when i started my internship but seldom did it wasnt until after wed gone out a couple of times that someone one of the other riis told me you were jocelyns boyfriend i remember thinking uhoh this is going to be complicated but i liked you so oh jeremy im not good at this she put her head on his shoulder he said complicated how this it wont be a problem no taboos nothing offlimits if you want me to talk about jocelyn i will thats just it she said im not sure i want to you obviously loved her very deeply shes still a part of you and thats good if you could just dismiss her id be repulsed but the selfish part of me just doesnt know if i can deal with her memory hanging over us its like having a chaperone i know that sounds terrible but its hanging over me not us said jeremy shes gone shell be more gone in a month even more so in a year and one day i wont think about her much at all the backs of his eyes ached now his own tears had welled intellectually i know all that but my damn soul hasnt adjusted she dabbed at his eyes with her fingers i didnt know psychology believed in the soul it doesnt jeremy said itll take time theres no shortcut he looked at her angela kissed his forehead jeremy wrapped his arms around her she felt small he was about to lift her face for another kiss when a gangly teenage boy probably someones grandson came out of a patient room loped down toward the coffee machine saw them and grinned lewdly go dude the kid muttered plunking coins down the slot angela laughed in jeremys ear they moved to his office spent another quarter hour there sitting quietly angela in jeremys lap her head resting on his chest the portable radio jeremy rarely played was tuned to insipid stuff that billed itself as smooth jazz angelas breathing slowed and he wondered if shed fallen asleep when he lowered his head to look her eyes fluttered open and she said i really need to get back when they returned to endocrinology a prunefaced nurse said theres a catheter waiting for you dr rios and walked away jeremy said nothing like the old welcome wagon angela smiled grew serious time to do some plumbing jeremy thank you for taking the initiative i know it wasnt easy like i said youre important to me she played with her stethoscope kicked one shoe against the other a littlekid gesture that pinched jeremys chest youre important to me i wish we could spend some real time together but ill be on for the next two nights me too he said lets aim for lunch lets do that dude handholder by day selfdeluded voyeur by night for two evenings running theodore gerd dirgrove left the hospital drove straight home and stayed there both nights jeremy watched the creamcolored highrise until am alternating between sitting in his car and walking around the glossy neighborhood he no longer felt the cold some sort of internal oven was raging a good place to be spying the glut of cafés and highend cocktail lounges ensured a constant sprinkle of pedestrians that made his appearance less conspicuous the second night he patronized one of the lounges a place on hale called the pearl onion where martinis were the thing he hazarded one straight up mixed with boodles gin the eponymous vegetable a pair floating in the silky liquid arthurs mix one drink only chased by coffee he sat at a window booth that afforded him a view through lace curtains of dirgroves building fitting in enjoying the soft music real jazz the clink of glasses the eager conversation of goodlooking affluent singles at the bar hed made sure to dress well had taken to dressing better in general to meet the needs of the job donning his best sport coat and slacks and a lush black merinocashmere overcoat that hed bought in a deepdiscount sale years ago at llewellyns department store and had never worn sincesaving it for what hed even brought a crisp shirt to his office so he could change before he set out on his mission find me a windmill and ill tilt away that night dirgroves buick never reappeared the back of the building was an enclosed courtyard with only one way out of the subterranean parking lot so even if the surgeon had chosen to retrieve the car himself hed have to drive around in front ted was in for the night saving his energies jeremy voided the quarts of liquid hed ingested in the lounges mintyfresh mens room and drove home tomorrow night angela would be offcall and hed have to find an excuse not to see her was feigning illness the tactful choice no that would boomerang shed want to be with him dote on him hed think of something as he crawled into bed he thought martinis arthurs drink where was the old man what had happened to his family eight oclock he was back at his desk logging on to the clarion archive hed tried once before plugging in chess homicide but finding nothing wondering if he should dig deeper now he was better educated he set his parameters the pathology department secretary knew arthur only as a confirmed bachelor and shed worked at central for years no one jeremy had spoken to had ever talked of a marriage in the old mans life so arthur had been single for a long time the tragedy that had shredded his life had taken place decades ago someone besides the ccc people knew the truth arthurs neighbor ramona purveyance shed known him as a handsome young physician whod delivered her children before an open woman prone to chatter but when shed talked about arthur leaving his home in queens arms shed grown evasive knowing the ordeal that had transformed arthur from a liberator of squalling newborns to a surveyor of the dead leading arthur to a position at the coroners the remainder of his life nurtured by the cessation of life still the old man had hung on to the bricks and the mortar and the baseboards of his memories two children the doting wife jeremy had conjured that flip assessment seemed so cruel now arthur living with ghosts and yet he smiled and drank and enjoyed latenight suppers traveled and learned and taught suddenly jeremy was suffused with admiration for arthur but at the same time the thought of ending up like arthur scared him out of his wits he wrenched himself away from all that escaped to the cold comfort of calculation ramona purveyance was at least in her midsixties so her babies would most likely have been born anywhere between thirty and fortyfive years ago arthur was what seventy med school and army service wouldve made him close to thirty by the time he came to central to deliver babies jeremy chose forty years ago and plugged in chess homicides using the plural because thats what had happened the computer wasnt smart enough to show discretion perhaps thats why it had spat back his first search nothing how about chess family homicides good call thirtyseven years ago a strangely dry july three bodies found in wreckage of summer cabin an earlymorning arson fire in a cabin near lake oswagumi in the highland park resort area turned into a murder scene after three bodies were discovered in the charred ruins the remains have been identified as those of mrs sally chess a young matron and her two children susan and arthur chess jr arthur chess sr a physician at city central hospital was not present at the rental cabin when the blaze overtook the threeroom structure dr chess had been called to the hospital to perform an emergency caesarean section and claims to have stopped at a local tavern for a beer before driving the sixty miles back to highland park sheriffs investigators have reason to believe that mrs chess had been murdered and that the fire was set deliberately to conceal that crime both children likely perished in their sleep the investigators further state that while dr chess is being questioned he is not considered a suspect at this time the last sentence reminded jeremy of something else hed read recently the account of robert ballerons murder the judge had been questioned but police had insisted shed not been considered a suspect did that mean just the opposite tina and arthur knowing what it felt like to have your grief poisoned by suspicion poor tina poor arthur the old man had reached out for him and jeremy had played hardtoget no more he belonged still paying for archive time he looked up kurau village that produced only a single wireservice snippet dated fiftyone years ago cannibals rampant kurau an obscure island in the multithousand indonesian chain occupied by the japanese before the allied liberation and now contested territory claimed by several native tribes fell under the sway of yellowprimitivism as marauding gangs representing various factions rampaged through opposing villages with machetes and confiscated japanese army sabers dismembering and disemboweling and parading through the jungle with human heads impaled on stakes reports of bonfires suggest that cannibalism once a fixture in this part of the world has made an ugly comeback a smattering of american military and diplomatic personnel remains on the island in an attempt to administer the transition from occupation to local rule the state department has issued a travel advisory for all americans to avoid the region until calm is restored the phone rang bill ramirez said have any time to talk about doug vilardi sure hows he doing how about we talk in person pretend im a patient or something ramirez was at his office door five minutes later and out of breath hard to find you what your fellow therapists exiled you space problem i volunteered kind of gloomy said ramirez then again you have your privacy space problem oh yeah the cutters got your suite didnt they expediency trumps virtue pardon have a seat hows doug ramirez pulled up a chair not so great if his spleen doesnt get smaller well be taking it out could happen anytime were watching it the idiopathic reaction to chemos resolving whatever it was the oncologist slid low in the seat and stretched his legs his shirt was wrinkled sweat stains circled his armpits thats the thing about cases like this keep you humble always usually ramirez went on im able to tell myself im a hero cases like doug secondary disease you start thinking of yourself as the villain if you hadnt treated his ewings hed be dead no wife no baby on the way spoken like a true therapist yeah youre right i appreciate your saying so still it would be nice to not fuck anyone up become a poet ramirez smiled anyway thats not why im here pathologys still struggling to come up with a fix on the leukemia now theyre telling me it could be a mix of lymphatic and myelocytic or maybe neither something weird and undifferentiated could be acute and chronic at the same time the kids bone marrows a mess ive got the slides going out to la and boston because they see more than we do of these weird ones the key is to see what protocol he fits into but if he doesnt and we just wing it were lowering our chance of initial remission he took a deep breath mind if i have some of that coffee at your own risk said jeremy in that case forget it basically what i came to tell you is that theres a good chance our mr vilardis going to end up facing a bone marrow transplant we typed the whole family the mother was a little antsy but i just figured that for generalized anxiety turns out she and one of the brothers are excellent donors he frowned jeremy said another goodnews badnews situation you are a mind reader ramirez took a breath the bad news is dougs not his fathers biological son okay said jeremy youre not surprised i am but not wildly people are people gee said ramirez i wish you were my dad adolescence wouldve been a helluva lot easier okay so thats the big secret the question is what do we do about it nothing said jeremy plain and simple plain and simple youre right said ramirez i just wanted to hear it from you get some backup he got to his feet okay good thanks onward anything else bill thats not enough for one day jeremy smiled ramirez said im glad you confirmed my initial instincts dougs an adult has a right to his medical records but im going to destroy that part of the report just in case someone peeks he looked at jeremy jeremy said i back you up on that too its the best thing said ramirez i already did enough damage to the kid in the afternoon after jeremy had seen all his other patients he sat by dougs bedside no family members were around their usual arrival time was two hours later and jeremy had timed his visit carefully he didnt want to look into mrs vilardis eyes doug was sleeping with the tv on a sitcom blared smalltown life corny jokes hollywoods take on jovial halfwits playing to the laugh track jeremy kept the show on but lowered the volume concentrated on dougs swollen jaundiced face his big callused workingmans hands lying inert the laugh track began to grate on him and he switched off the set listened to the ticking gurgling chirping that confirmed the young mans viability doug didnt stir push past this my friend give me something to be inspired by do it jeremy cleared his next three evenings by lying feeding angela tales of looming deadlines for the book grinding pressure from the head of oncology topped by a severe case of writers block hed need to pull two or three allnighters maybe even four she said been there done it itll work out honey on the first day he spirited her away for an early dinner at sarnos concentrated on being attentive kept the conversation easy and light and flowing the everpresent horror track in his head washed by filthy violent images a mental cesspool that drained miles from the lovers face he showed angela by dinners end he figured hed pulled it off angela had loosened up was smiling laughing talking about patients and hospital bureaucracy by the time he dropped her back at endocrinology it was fivethirty and she was energized the next day she paged him to let him know that the chief resident had frowned on her cutting out early how about i write you a note he said angelas tummy was empty and she needed to eat if only she said howd it go on the book last night painfully stick with it i know youll do great thanks i dont have time anyway jer the endo attendings are mostly highpowered private practice brutes they work us like galley slaves so they can be home in time for dindin with the family so if i get to see you at all itll have to be lunch and tomorrow lunch is a lecture on growth hormone abuse the schedule ill let you know if things ease up sorry nothing to apologize for ang this too shall pass and ive got my own schedule now i know she said but right now it seems interminable okay gotta go miss you miss you too two more nights of dirgrove playing at family man or whatever he did once he was esconced in his limestone aerie one floor down from the penthouse jeremy knew because hed strolled by when the doorman had gone inside to take a package to a resident made his way into the marblewalled lobby and checked out the directory all those nice healthy potted palms when dirgrove walked through the door how far did he take the charade was dindin with the family part of the routine or did he lock himself straight off in his study did he pay token attention to brandon and sonja jeremys glimpse of the family at dinner said the bastard couldnt care less were he and patty still sleeping together poor woman that determined face the athletic carriage all the trappings of a fine life and it would be crashing down sooner or later jeremy was going to do his best to make it sooner on the third day doug vilardi was sent to the or for a splenectomy jeremy comforted the family but knew the young man wouldnt need him for at least twentyfour hours none of his other patients were in crisis several had been discharged and he was only called to one acute procedure a fifteenyearold burn patient a girl whod lost the skin on one thigh and was undergoing painful whirlpool baths to slosh loose dead dermis jeremy found out she liked playing tennis and had her imagine herself playing the french open the girl got through it her father a toughguy type some sort of executive said that was amazing jennifers amazing the guy shook his head man youre good now it was pm and he was free he desperately wanted to keep his head clear to save mental space for dirgrove his psychopathology his tools the woman who was certain to be his next target dirgrove worked later than usual not showing up at his car until shortly after pm when he left the doctors lot he turned south away from his home base on hale a first here we go a great night for watching the mercury had dropped even farther but the air had dried gotten thinner too as if some deity were sucking out all the unnecessary gases jeremy breathed heavily headily felt lighthearted sound seemed to be traveling faster and his car windows couldnt shut out the city din lights were brighter people walked faster every nocturnal detail stood out in relief no shortage of cars tonight urban motorists were out in force enjoying skidfree roads and clarity driving too fast euphorically everyone functioning at peak levels dirgrove headed toward the asa brander bridge the same route that had led jeremy to arthurs rooming house in ash view but instead of exiting on the industrial road and connecting to the turnpike the buick kept going toward the airport six more blocks then he turned right on a busy commercial street another two blocks and they were on airport boulevard and dirgrove had pulled in front of a motel red neon spaghetti spelled out the hideaway over a neon cutout of two overlapping hearts the motel advertised massage beds total privacy right out there on the busy boulevard and adult films on cable on one side of the building was a filling station the other hosted an unclaimedluggage resale store called travelaid farther down the block was an adult book and video store two liquor emporia a drivethrough hamburger joint mattress dance hall the rooms faced a motor court the entrance was doublewide jeremy parked across airport and crossed the boulevard on foot he stood at the front of the motel on the sidewalk at an angle where he could peer into the court and see the window marked office at his back traffic sped by overhead planes took off and landed no one walked the sidewalks the air stank of jet fuel the motel office windows werent draped and the room was brightly lit jeremys position afforded him a clear view of ted dirgrove checking in the surgeon appeared as relaxed as someone on a wholesome vacation jeremy noticed that he didnt sign in a regular dirgrove got his key made his way to a room on the east side of the motor court natty in a black coat and gray slacks whistling room jeremy returned to his car and continued to watch the hideaway from across the street hed dropped from sight just in time five minutes later gwynn hausers lexus swung into a space three over from the buick she got out didnt bother to look around walked jauntily toward the motor court swinging her purse shed capped her blond bob with a long black wig wore that full white fur coat jeremy had seen during her last tryst with dirgrove the motel entrance was better lit than the industrial stretch and even at this distance jeremy could see that the coat was a cheap fake spiky as magnetized iron filings cheap wig too not even close to human hair slumming he waited until shed been gone for ten minutes made his way over to the office and purchased a room at the halfday rate of fortyfour dollars the clerk was a reserved young man with oily black hair who barely looked up as he took jeremys cash nor did he react when jeremy stated his room preference number directly across from he made his way there sticking close to the building and staying out of the light that washed across the court closing the door he breathed in old sweat and shampoo and raspberryscented disinfectant he kept the lights off in the room but switched them on in the pathetic little bathroom just a fiberglass prefab really with a toilet screwed shakily into the floor and a molded shower barely large enough for a child the indirect illumination amplified his surroundings double bed with a mushy mattress and two pillows a coinfed vibrator gizmo on the nightstand a twelveinch tv bolted to the wall and topped by a payperview box the rooms single window was covered by an oilcloth shade by rolling it up an inch and pulling a chair to the front jeremy had a fine view of number lights on there for two full hours then off they went no one exited the room time passed ninethirty ten eleven at midnight jeremy was nearly out of his mind with boredom and wondering if dirgrove and hauser were in for the long haul he had his tv switched on most of the channels were fuzzy and he had no desire to call the front office and order a dirty movie settling for a televangelist broadcasting from a massive blond cathedral in nebraska he sat listening to tales of sin and redemption and knew he was wasting his time dirgrove would do no mischief tonight his girlfriend was keeping him busy unless their relationship had changed and no no way too careless not with gwynns car and his parked right out on the boulevard ted was a man of varied tastes theyd fallen asleep he was sure of it it was am and jeremyd had his fill of faith healing and exhortations to qualify as lambs of god by sending in cookiejar stashes spare change social security checks whatever led one to a state of grace you will know promised the graveyardshift preacher a skinny handsome type who looked like a frat boy you will feel it at gwynn hauser still bewigged and looking shaky left the room drawing her fake fur around her five minutes later dirgrove exited stared at the moon yawned trudged slowly to his car jeremy followed him back home to patty and the brood what would he tell her an emergency saving lives or had he gotten past the point where he had to tell her anything would she hear him smell him as he got between the sheets would the scent of another woman waft her way in the temperaturecontrolled atmosphere of their suretobestylish master suite poor woman jeremy made it to his own house just before four his block was dead and when he entered his empty bedroom it felt like the cell of a stranger dougs spleen was out he looked as if hed been hit by a train a catheter drained his urine his voice was thick slurred halting he said the funny thing is doc i actually feel better without that fucking spleen in me he had little to say after that jeremy had slept three hours and wasnt feeling creative he sat with the young man for a while offered smiles encouraging looks a couple of uncontroversial jokes doug said gotta get out of here in time for ice fishing you do that a lot every year with my dad mrs vilardi came into the room and said oh my baby fine mom yes yes i know you are suppressing tears she smiled at jeremy she had on a shapeless brown coat over a polyester sweater and heavyduty sweatpants on her feet were shiny brown leatherlook boots the sweater was green and red reindeer pranced along her ample bustline her hair was short permed mouse brown with gray peeking through her eyes sagged just another middleaged woman worn down by the years when she was young shed taken a lover and his seed had sprouted doug jeremy had never really looked at her before he said ill leave you guys now bye doc have a nice day dr carrier detective bob doresh stepped out of nowhere and waylaid him as he headed for the stairwell no elevator for you doc keeping fit busy last night doc what do you mean doreshs heavy face was grim his jaw muscles swelled we need to talk doc at my place ive got patients they can wait no they cant said jeremy if you want to talk well do it at my place doresh moved closer jeremys back was to the wall and for a moment he thought the detective would pin him the cleft in doreshs meaty chin quivered lord you could hide something in there this is a big deal to you doc where we talk its not a pissing contest detective im totally willing to cooperate with you though i cant imagine what the big issue is lets just do it here so i dont lose time the big issue said doresh he inched even closer jeremy smelled his breakfast bacon ive got a real big issue he placed a hand on his hip the blood left jeremys face in a rush another one thats impossible impossible doc doreshs eyes were on highbeam now impossible because the monster played with his girlfriend all night how could i be so wrong what i meant to say my first thought was not again so soon so much death its impossible to comprehend ah doreshs smile was sickening and you dont like that of course not of course not what the hell are you getting at detective movement up the hall caught jeremys eyes mrs vilardi left dougs room looked around spotted jeremy and waved she pantomimed drinking letting jeremy know she was getting herself coffee as if she needed his permission jeremy waved back doresh said a fan of yours what do you want with me lets get it over with fine said doresh how about we compromise not your place or my place gods place the hospital chapel the meditation room was situated off the main lobby just beyond the development office officially nondenominational not much more than an afterthought the room was three rows of blond ash pews over thin red carpeting plastic windows designed to look like stained glass a low sloping sparkleplaster ceiling the pews faced an aluminum crucifix bolted to the wall a bible sat on a lectern at the back next to a rack full of inspirational pamphlets donated by evangelical societies jeremy supposed the place was utilized from time to time but hed never seen anyone go in or out doresh entered as if hed been there before what this is supposed to encourage confession the detective strode to the front row removed his raincoat draped it over a pew sat down and tapped a space to his right beckoning jeremy to sit next to him now we pray together jeremy ignored the invitation and circled in front of doresh he faced the detective remained on his feet what can i do for you detective you can start by accounting for your whereabouts last night doctor what times the whole night i was out i know that doc you got home around four in the morning late for you youve been watching me did i say that no said jeremy of course you didnt stupid question if youd been watching me youd know i have nothing to do with it and neither does dirgrove shacked up in the room across the motor court wrong wrong wrong start accounting said doresh i left the hospital shortly after eight and checked into a motel near the airport around half an hour later the hideaway on airport boulevard i paid cash but the clerk may remember me because the place wasnt busy hes a young guy with dark hair greasy dark hair last night he was wearing a greenandwhitestriped shirt i didnt notice his pants i paid for half a day fortyfour dollars a motel thats right who were you with no one doreshs shrublike eyebrows rose he shifted his weight and the pew creaked you checked into a motel by yourself room i stayed there till around threeforty and as you know got home shortly before four if doresh or some other cop hadnt seen him who had had to be a neighbor and the only one who came to mind was mrs bekanescu a snoop by nature shed never liked him and hed seen lights on in her house well before sunrise sometimes she put food out for stray cats drew their mewling to the block while the sky was still dark whatever the reason shed been up had noticed his headlights and when doresh had come asking questions shed been more than happy to tell him how many neighbors had doresh spoken to did all of them believe him a dangerous man was that not the fact that they were transient renters why no one spoke to him doresh was staring at him not saying a word where and when did it happen said jeremy youre serious about wanting to know yes about checking into a hotbed joint by yourself i did it for the solitude you found solitude at a hotbed joint yes guy like you living by yourself whats wrong with your own house for solitude he smiled youve got plenty of solitude now doreshs tone challenged jeremy go ahead smartboy blow your stack jeremy shrugged sometimes a change of scenery helps helps what achieve peace of mind doreshs face turned the color of raw beef youd do well not to jerk me around ask the motel clerk ask the maid who cleaned room if the bed was ever slept in you didnt sleep there what the hell did you do sat on a chair thought watched tv religious shows mostly the one that sticks in my memory is a preacher from nebraska thadd bromley gabby fellow he wore a blue vneck sweater looked like a college boy and talked like a cowboy from the pledges that came in hes doing great i enjoyed hearing him tell me how to live my life jeremys eyes circled the chapel youre a religious guy said doresh i wish wish what religion would be a comfort id like to believe what stops you too many distractions who was she where did it happen doresh ignored him he turned away and light through a stainedplastic window rainbowed his face another humptydumpty situation said jeremy still no response is there anything else detective doresh crossed his legs what youre telling me is that from eightthirty to threeforty you were at a cockylocky dump all by your lonesome listening to the gospel thats some story why would i make something like that up thing is doc maybe the clerk can verify your checking in but i assume you didnt stop to say goodbye to him when you cut out so how the hell do i know you were there all night you couldve checked out any time thadd bromley said jeremy he was on late he quoted from acts he healed a girl on crutches and there were others i can probably remember some of their sermons i did doze briefly but for the most part i was up religious shows the hideaway doesnt offer a great selection of stations most of the reception was fuzzy i guess the religious channels broadcast with more power you rent any fuck movies no those places they have a great selection of fuck movies right thats the whole point of places like that except generally people bring a partner the detectives eyes were cold with contempt jeremy said no fuck movies check the payperview log bullshit snarled doresh what youre giving me is bullshit if i knew id need an alibi id have prepared one sweet all that nice sweet logic who got killed a woman doresh uncrossed his legs vacuum my car if youd like said jeremy confiscate my clothes come back to my house spray that luminol again look for fibers fluids whatever you want do it without a warrant i couldnt care less how about a polygraph sure no problem no strings attached keep your questions limited to my involvement in any murder what said doresh we cant ask you about religion is there anything else detective a polygraph said doresh course a guy like you master hypnotist and all that youd probably know ways to fake out the polygraph there are no tricks said jeremy successful faking involves having an abnormally cold personality or practicing on the machine for an extended period neither of which applies to me oh yeah sedation too you want to prescreen me for drugs go ahead cold personality huh id say youre a pretty cool fellow dr carrier even right after ms banks got butchered up when we hauled you into the station you were damned cool my partner and i were impressed guys girlfriend gets chopped up like that and hes gliding through the interview jeremy remembered that time as an endless nightmare he laughed so as not to hit the bastard something funny doc how far off base you are is funny if youre worried about trickery we can forget about the polygraph doresh gathered his coat and stood and came close his cleft chin pulsed and his barrel chest threatened to intrude upon jeremys torso no lets do it maybe tomorrow or the day after call me said jeremy ill look at my calendar and fit you in no tricks huh said doresh ive got none no surgical skills either detective and ive never been to england doresh blinked now why would i care about any of that jeremy shrugged and started to walk around the detective doresh blocked him feinted with his head a gamecock maneuver as if about to strike jeremy fell back reflexively lost his balance took hold of a pew doresh laughed and left the chapel jeremy waited until he was certain doresh wasnt coming back before locking the door to the chapel sinking into a rear pew and burying his face in his hands not dirgrove ive been wasting my time and now another woman always wrong always fucking wrong how could it be everything fit so elegantly tools lasers like father like son dirgrove a sexual predator manipulative definitely in england when the english girls were slaughtered and the english girls fit they had to thats why langdon and shreve had perked up their ears why shreve had called doresh and doresh had paid jeremy a visit ive never been to england why cant doresh see that the ass the polygraph would clear him everything they did would clear him but meanwhile more women wrong that meant arthur was wrong too the postcards the envelopes the entire fucking tutorial the old man had shoved in his arthur a terrible thought a horrific atheism seized him arthur surveyor of death connossieur of the grisly story game player par excellence arthur student of war strategy hed known for some time that the old man had been manipulating him but had endowed the gambit with noble intentions arthur enjoyed working with death used a morgue van for spare wheels the vehicle that had followed him had been large an suv hed thought but why not a van the man dissected dug with a garden spade no no way the pathologist was too old old men stripped of testosterone and dreams just didnt do things like that besides arthur had been on the other side of violence a victim the ordeal his family slaughtered an unsolved triple murder arthur with no alibi driving to the cabin at the time the fire was set arthur taking years to move out of the family home living with ghosts ghosts hed created no impossible intolerable the old man was eccentric but not a monster arthur being a monster would mean the other ccc people no they were victims all of them had endured their own ordeals nobility through suffering arthur was an odd man but a good man jeremys avatar guiding him toward inexorable truths and yet the old man had led him straight down the wrong path i couldnt have miscalculated that badly if i did im finding another line of work plumbing bricklaying motel clerk at a sleazy hotbed palace better yet ill ship out on one of those trawlers that hauls in crabs and bottom feeders and gasping whitefish like father why had arthur done this to him he sat up bared his face caught an eyeful of stained plastic then it hit him a seizure of boweltightening grandiose insight that made everything right he jumped to his feet ran toward the chapel door as he lunged for the lock his pager went off dr carrier this is nancy the charge nurse on four east ive got a patient here a mrs van alden one of dr schusters shes scheduled for an lp says you were supposed to be here ten minutes ago to help her through it were kind of waiting i got held up by an emergency ill be there right away good she looks pretty uptight he hurried to the elevators eyes downward wondering how am i going to fake it as he rode up to four he checked his appointment book nine more patients booked consecutively each one needy not counting doug and he knew hed be expected to check in on doug again christ the poor kid deserved it after his clinical duties were over a psychiatry case conference that he could skip but there was no avoiding the people who depended on him ten patients no breaks in between because hed compressed his schedule wanting more time for night work and now he was paying for it windmill work tilting with a broken lance the elevator door opened on ward noise mrs van alden needed him shed be okay hed help her through it hed get through the day somehow a pretty cool fellow right back in his office short of breath from running the sounds of the day pain cries weeping sighs of resignation gushes of gratitude buried deeply in some dark little crumblittered vest pocket of his brain he went straight for the book there it was lying atop the curiosity file the blood runs cold mr colin pugh exploiting very very bad behavior a book sold by renfrew of course had to be that made sense the world remained logical flipping feverishly to the final chapter he turned pages so quickly that the aciddamaged paper flaked and dust flew off in all directions there it was gerd degraav enters brazil using a syrian passport remarried with a child another son here arthur leading him that day in the cafeteria the other man the darkhaired surgeon with the mustache whod been sitting with dirgrove and mandel as arthur stared the man jeremy had seen arguing with dirgrove the two of them evenly matched same height same build teeth bared like fighting dogs a second son born in syria partmideastern partgerman the coloring fit it was the dark man not dirgrove whom arthur had focused on had to be had to be let me be right jeremy yanked open the bottom desk drawer grabbed the attending staff face book and began with the ds because like dirgrove this one had probably changed his name and hopefully like his half brother hed stayed alphabetically close he hadnt jeremy turned back to the as scanned every photo in the book his own image stared back at him blankly a picture taken shortly after jocelyn lord i look shellshocked the dark mustachioed doctor was nowhere to be found a whitecoat a surgeon but not on staff at city central mandel would know jeremy phoned the cardiologists office was informed dr mandel was on vacation where im not at liberty to say said the secretary this is dr carrier is it a patient emergency yes dr rhinegolds taking emergency call for dr mandel i need to speak with dr mandel personally im sorry please what i was about to say doctor was that even if i wanted to reach dr mandel i couldnt hes backpacking with his family out in colorado and doesnt have a phone he made a big point of that no phone for three days he really deserves to get away what hotel is he staying at doctor she said maybe i didnt make myself clear hes camping out in the middle of nowhere is there a physician in your department forty or so dark complexion dark mustache no she said are you all right dr carrier not knowing where else to go he phoned dirgroves office hey ted long time no see by the way whats the name of your homicidal sib and what did he do to irritate you the other day had the argument between dirgrove and his brother been about something of substance did dirgrove suspect the surgeons phone rang five times before jeremy was connected to voice mail dr theodore dirgrove is currently unavailable if this is a patient emergency please press gone for the day another meetup with dr gwynn hauser hauser she and dirgrove had spent six hours together at the motel that said their relationship was more than kinky roleplaying did it involve pillow talk he looked up hausers extension and when she picked up the phone he hung up and put on his white coat she shared an office suite with three other internists two floors below dirgroves penthouse spread jeremy crossed an empty reception area knocked on the door with her name on it and opened it as she said come in she was at her desk writing and looked up smiling she removed her glasses and put down her pen my parking lot friend i was wondering when youd show up lashes batted her blond bob vibrated as she tilted her face toward jeremy hed come in smiling wanting to put her at ease but this much ease rattled him she wheeled back in her desk chair offered him a full view of long legs crossing she wore a red wool dress and fleshtone stockings great legs up close she looked her age but it didnt matter this one poured out hormones jeremy closed the door you were expecting me she said is it my imagination or have you been checking me out first that time in the lot and then various places around the hospital she winked hey im an observant gal ive noticed you noticing me i even looked you up jeremy carrier from the shrink department jeremy smiled she said chemistry when its there its there true he said sitting down opposite her desk so jeremy what service can i provide psychiatry i need information her face slackened confused about teds brother ted back went the glasses her legs uncrossed and she sat stiffly ted dirgrove the surgeon no need to be coy gwynn she pointed to the door i think youd better leave now i like the coat said jeremy the big white fuzzy one just the right combination of chic and cheap what is it polyester like the black wig the color drained from gwynn hausers face fuck you get the fuck out of here jeremy crossed his legs tell you what ill send the pictures simultaneously one set to your husband the other to patty dirgrove youre insane what pictures the hideaway motel room yesterday eightthirty to threeforty long date mustve been fun gwynn hausers mouth dropped open youre really insane maybe said jeremy however the state of my mental health neednt affect the quality of your life whats that a threat you think you can march in here and threaten me and bully me are you out of your she reached for her phone but didnt dial all i want is the information about why you dont need to know what has he done youre assuming hes done something said jeremy youre not surprised that hed do something hauser replaced the phone in its cradle the tendons of her hands were bowstring tight jeremy watched as she pushed sheets of paper into a sixinch pile that she interposed between herself and jeremy pathetic barrier she knew it her eyes were bright with confusion and fear i dont know enough to be surprised all i know is what ted tells me she tried a littlegirl pout smiled when jeremy remained stoic she snarled asshole you dont have any pictures how could you have pictures are you willing to bet on that said jeremy sounding cool the cool fellow surfacing despite all the noise in his head what do you want tell me about him what about him for starters his name you dont even know his are you out of your his name is graves augusto graves hes part south american augie hes not teds full brother hes a half brother theyre not close they grew up separately ted wants nothing to do with him they had a big fight years ago and ted thought he was free of him but then augie showed up he works here hes here temporarily oneyear research grant in obgyn some corporate grant teds convinced he obtained it just to make trouble for him a temporary appointment would account for no photo in the face book jeremy said research in laser surgery her pretty blue eyes widened you didnt know his name but you know that what the hells going on wheres gravess home base the west coast seattle i think one of the big academic hospitals there and england cambridge he travels all over the world lecturing hes a genius full professor by thirtyfive teds still an associate he hates him jealousy thats part of it but i believed ted when he says augies intent on outdoing him at every turn ted talks about him a lot gwynn hauser exhaled the topic comes up thorn in the side big thorn what did he do and why do you care youre assuming he did something bad youre here arent you jeremy remained silent therapists silence one of the few tricks in his puny arsenal aimed straight at her resistance she said ted says hes got a mean streak they didnt meet until ted was in college and augie was in high school teds father abandoned him and his mother married augies mother and lived in some arab country then south america later augie and his mother came to america and augie went to school there one day out of the clear blue he appeared at teds fraternity house introduced himself tried to insinuate himself into teds life ted didnt welcome the reunion hed never known about augie no one had ever mentioned another family he didnt know much about his father period all his mom said was that he was a doctor and had died doing research in the jungle somewhere research into what i have no idea said hauser no doubt something brilliant teds brilliant and so is augie thats part of the problem i assume they got it somewhere like father like son she nodded jeremy prompted her part of what problem two oversize brains two massive egos teds convinced augie went to med school only because he did and augie did outdo him got into the number one school while teds was ranked third plus augie received a full scholarship and enrolled under a double degree program mdphd all in five years whats his phd in bioengineering hes a laser honcho plus hes board certified in general surgery and obgyn even did some work in ophthalmology were talking major brainiac she managed a wry smile poor ted hes merely brilliant bioengineering jeremy flashed back to the curiosity file the second article laser surgery on women an american team from the west coast physicians and engineers arthur had led him straight hed missed the cue have you ever met him ive seen him around but only talked to him once last week as a matter of fact ted and i were lunching in the ddr and he waltzed over sat down with us she smiled the moment his butt touched the chair he was coming on to me nothing you could call him on subtly looks smiles hes a smooth one ted was not amused i told him not to worry the guys not my type why not too refined i like em a little ragged she cast a knowing glance at jeremy trying to take what belonged to his brother that explained the argument he said what about the mean streak gwynn hauser said ted never got specific he just said augie had been known to be cruel to do cruel things that augie made him nervous he didnt want him near his family or me i didnt press him for details another flutter of eyelash to be honest hearing ted go on about him bores me to tears playing nursie to his insecurities wasnt what id bargained for neurotic not ragged exactly give me raw misguided energy any day again her legs crossed to be honest im growing a wee bit tired of ted when push came to shove he turned out like all the others boring boring and a weenie he always needs propping up thinks hes a player but down deep hes just a family man who sneaks around jeremy said what else can you tell me about augie graves nothing she said her left hand grazed her right breast boy you really took over didnt you just burst in here like some visigoth and got me to do things i never thought id do color had returned to her face peach tones tinctured by flush she smiled exposed a row of pearly glistening teeth and to look at you youd never know it you could show me things couldnt you all part of the training said jeremy turning to leave maybe she said one day you can tell me more about it eightfifteen jeremy located augusto gravess office number by phoning the hospital operator she had no listing of any home address nor did dr graves carry a beeper no patients to see pure research gravess hospital base was the east wing of an auxiliary building across the street from the hospital a newer building set apart from the clinical world hushed space reserved for the laboratories of promising scientists a refuge where a brilliant cruel mind could run wild the hospital structure nearest to the nurses parking lot graves watching waiting seeing jocelyn walk to her car every day jocelyn happy after a days work happier yet to be going home to jeremy meetinggreeted by a goodlooking man in a white coat young nurse older doctor hospital hierarchy dictated respect his badge would have firmed it up md phd full professor when he spoke smooth urbane why would she have been suspicious gravess lab was on the ground floor and the door was open jeremy stood by the doorway and peered in large windows on the north wall afforded a clear view of the lot he entered the layout was nothing out of the ordinary just the usual mix of blacktopped tables and glistening glassware and hightech accoutrements jeremy recognized several lasers stationery and handheld devices arranged in a compulsive bank each one labeled and all tagged with do not touch stickers computers scanners printers a host of other equipment that meant nothing to him one wall had been given over to books basic science and surgery medical journals collected in openfaced boxes everything perfectly organized no chemical smells this was clean research graves wasnt there the only person in view was a woman in a navy blue housekeeping uniform sweeping the floor positioning chairs probably another eastern european immigrant going about her job with a resigned look on her dumpling face graves had created an office space in one corner of the lab his desk was wide substantial covered by a spotless sheet of glass bare except for a rosewood inout box both compartments contained neatly stacked documents jeremy hurried behind the desk tried the drawers all locked hey said the sweeper you kanna do dat jeremy began rifling through the contents of the inbox nothing he could use he moved on to the outbox hey said the woman before she could protest further he was out of there hot little hand clamped over his find subscription card for a magazinethe nation graves had opted for another year the card was preprinted with his new home address hale boulevard four blocks south of the highrise where his brother played at family man jeremy knew what hed find when he located the building an even better address than dirgroves creamcolored highrise graves the ultimate taker now jeremy was certain dirgrove had been interested in jocelyn perhaps it had ended at flirtation or jocelyn had enjoyed a fling with the surgeon before meeting jeremy nearly everything else hed imputed to dirgrove was wrong the man was an adulterer and an insecure skirtchaser but no more than that nothing nefarious about the consult on merilee saunders either dirgrove had been genuinely concerned about his patients reaction to surgery or hed been trying to impress angela with his sensitivity either way nothing untoward about merilees death before leaving the hospital jeremy had rushed back to the main building entered the medical library and located the m and m sheet on the young woman cerebral aneurysm a hidden little blood vessel in her brain had burst as dirgrove had said one of those things that happens but he had taunted jeremy sins of the father on a subtler level but that was of no concern now augusto graves was an heir of a different sort bought into the complete paternal endowment made things happen growing up in brazil graves had been well aware of his fathers crimes the circumstances surrounding his death jailhouse visit watching his father treated like a celebrity after degraavs suicide gravess mother had taken the boy to the states where graves thrived and twisted further a man who lusted and schemed and exulted in the capture of what belonged to others jocelyn had been chosen because dirgrove wanted her and graves had found out graves came on to gwynn hauser as well shed blown him off not her type thinking she was in control how little she understood angela dirgrove had concocted a smooth scheme to seduce her did graves know about that if so jeremy needed to let angela know his warnings about dirgrove had irritated her sorry hes not the threat but how to do it so she didnt think him mad it sounded nothing but mad jeremy came up with no answer he paged angela anyway the words would come they always did she didnt answer he tried again nothing maybe she was caught up in a procedure hed go up to endocrinology the ostensible reason letting her know hed be busy tonight then somehow hed work in the terrible truth when he got there an illtempered nurse told him you tell me where she is what do you mean she flaked on us disappeared poof a whole ward of patients and she just walks off without informing anyone talk about unprofessional ive informed the chief she was still griping when jeremy turned his back and ran back to the elevators a beautiful building white marble facing copper trim art deco angles a circular driveway more commodious than the one fronting dirgroves condo a copper fountain angels trumpeting spouted from the center of the drive tall spruces hugged the corners of the structure tivoli arms five stories taller than dirgroves highrise but only one doorman and when he finished helping a whitehaired couple into their limousine jeremy approached him hed changed into the spare shirt hed brought that morning had knotted his tie snugly slicked his hair washed his face he put authority into his walk and posture his black merinocashmere topcoat was open and he made sure the doorman caught a glimpse of the hospital badge clipped to his jacket lapel he must have looked right because the doorman smiled at him as if he belonged may i help you sir im dr carrier an associate of dr gravess from city central hospital is he in sure is got in an hour ago ill have someone ring you up cmon in out of the cold thanks the two of them entered the lobby and the doorman handed him off to the man behind the reception desk young fellow pleasant in a navy blazer with gold buttons buttondown shirt rep tie his wheatcolored hair was razor cut his gold name tag said k burnside he said one moment doctor and picked up the house phone held it to his ear finally put it down thats odd i know hes in how so i took his car and he hasnt called for it maybe he decided to get it himself hmm doubtful dr graves always has us bring his car around hold on ill check with the parking steward another phone call no doctor the cars still here nice wheels said jeremy guessing the porsche or the navigator both a navigator a big suv had followed him perfect for transport the young man grinned dr graves likes his cars im sorry is there some message i can leave for him no its personal jeremy leaned across the counter actually its a surprise mr burnside kelvin what kind of surprise can you be discreet kelvin all part of the job doctor okay but please keep this under wraps at least until it hits the papers our department was just informed that dr graves has won a prestigious award the dergraav for biomechanical research were talking bigtime couple notches below the nobel wow thats amazing kelvin burnside had been transformed into an awestruck teenager i was sent to get him and bring him back to the hospital the cover story im going to give him is some sort of emergency back at his lab then when i get him there theres a whole surprise party planned jeremy looked at his watch we timed it perfectly everyones waiting could you try his apartment again no problem kelvin dialed waited shook his head strange said jeremy he comes home doesnt answer maybe we should go up and make sure hes okay maybe you know theres somewhere else he might be down in the subsubbasement there are storage units there for the tenants some of our people hoard tons of stuff the units are big more like rooms some tenants lease them out but dr graves uses his a lot for what im not sure but hes always going in and out of there i joked with him about it once said whats going on down there doc scientific experiments he thought that was funny rolled his eyes and said something like you never know i was just kidding i knew he was a doctor but i had no idea he was a bigtime researcher now youre telling me about this award and im feeling a little stupid for that crack dont worry about it augie dr graves has a great sense of humor i think i will check out that storage room ill go look for you no reason for you to leave your post said jeremy i really want to surprise him my boss ordered me to surprise him the young man smiled uneasily ill be in and out kelvin dr graves will appreciate it like i said hes got a great sense of humor jeremy fingered his badge hoping to draw attention to that symbol of authority sure said the young man no prob a rear service elevator an unadorned clanky steel box with an accordion door took him down to subbasement c two floors beneath the parking garage hed expected a dungeon but stepped out into bright space two wings of storage units lined rough stone floors the walls were stone as well and bore the marks of handhewing each unit was numbered black iron numerals screwed into stout oak doors fashioned during a previous century overhead bulbs in bronze cages provided the light electrical conduits and plumbing pipes striped the arched ceiling the arches and the stone reminded jeremy of something a card arthur had sent him the bazaar in old damascus could arthur have been that prescient that scene implied bustle down here all was silent no windows no outside light cool and damp jeremy half expected a bat to whoosh out no sign of life not a rat not an insect not a single cobweb and when his fingers grazed the stone walls they came back free of dust even the floor was clean swept spotless fourstar cave pride of the demimonde augusto gravess unit was at the end of the lefthand wing last door to the right jeremy stopped put his head to the door heard nothing the heavy iron key for which hed bribed kelvin burnside twenty dollars oh you dont have to do that sir rested in his hand he inserted it in the bolt turned slowly pushed the door open an inch waited for a creak silence he touched the bolt felt grease the tivoli arms was all about perfection or dr graves had taken special precautions he pushed some more had to put a little muscle into it the oak was dense thick seasoned hard as rock six inches open a foot enough space to slip through at first hed thought hed made yet another mistake no light inside the unit no one there then he heard the sounds humming the snicksnick of metal on metal a low buzz like that of a very large bumblebee there was light a trapezoidal patch of light to the left hitting the wall at an acute angle he stepped closer and saw why deflected an lshaped drywall partition had been installed facing the door creating a tiny vestibule he inched past the wall was bathed in light more light than hed expected hot and white and piercing three halogen bulbs grafted into an overhead power line surgical light a cell ten by ten walls floor and ceiling of that same hewn rock down in the core of the city augusto graves stood at the far end of a table dressed in surgical greens his head was capped but he wore no face mask earphones from a walkman transmitted something into his head music from the looks of it graves swayed in time a syncopated beat a jolly beat graves was smiling faintly mustache tilting upward like the wings of a butterfly memories of brazil a pleasantlooking man innocuous scholarly reading glasses pushed low on his nose he didnt see jeremy too busy concentrating on the woman stretched out before him on a table not a surgical table just a wide slab door resting on three sawhorses the platform had been draped in white plastic at gravess right hand was a steel tray on a wheeled stand gleaming with instruments next to the tray a steel box on a similar stand its contents out of view an electrical cord trailed over the boxs lid and fed into a ceiling socket in the corner stood several bottles of distilled water a familysized container of bleach a spray can of room deodorizer fresh evergreen scent folded neatly in the opposite corner was a pile of clothing something dark and cotton a white bra and matching panties a fleshcolored wad panty hose rested on top no shoes the floor dipped to the left slanted toward a floor drain the shiny stainless drain cover looked new and the stone in which it set had been bleached a lighter gray the woman was slender naked her dark head to jeremy he viewed her upside down no marks on her but she wasnt moving and her color was too pale he knew that kind of pale graves had positioned himself at her feet was staring at her feet her long dark hair streamed over the edge of the table at the side nearest jeremy no movement from her chest so pale around her neck a faint pinkish ring wavy hair oh god angela graves touched the big toe of her left foot put his finger to his mouth and licked it reaching into the tray he extracted a scalpel and jeremy got ready to lunge but after examining the instrument graves put it down reached into the metal box and extracted what looked like an oversize metal pencil tapered at the point electrical cord attached to the butt end graves ran a finger up and down the rod pushed a button the bumblebee buzz returned graves stood there still swaying to the music staring at the laser he pushed another button and the rod grew a bright red eye by the time he turned to aim the laser at the woman jeremy was out from behind the partition and on him graves tumbled landed on his back but didnt make a sound instead he stared up at jeremy soft brown eyes his earphones had flown off and the portable cd player attached to them landed on the floor from the phones came a tinny samba graves stared at jeremy expressionless the man was somewhere else jeremy went for the laser graves waved the instrument managed to push another button a thin red beam shot out the devils scarlet eye weeping graves swung the beam toward jeremy jeremy kicked at the buzzing wand failed to make contact but his attack caused gravess hand to waver and the red beam nicked one of the sawhorses supporting the table sliced clean through it the table canted and the naked woman slipped to the floor and landed facedown with a thud ohgodangela jeremy threw himself at graves graves scooted away the laser wavered nicked stone threw off dust steadying his laser hand with the other graves gave a quizzical look took aim again as jeremy ran for cover jeremy tripped on angelas corpse icy flesh he fell on his face and rolled backward graves stood over him youve interrupted me he said without rancor his eyes were lucid focused nothing but intent he had beautiful skin the mustache glowed like sable soft sibilant voice gentle women would find it comforting he licked his lips this will hurt a bit hefted the laser a red dot appeared in the center of gravess forehead someone else with a laser no this was something quite different a lowtech situation thunder followed half a second later and blood trickled then gushed out of the blackedged hole in gravess brow not dead center a few millimeters to the right the frontal lobes as he bled graves stared blankly incredulous where has my personality gone the blood rush was followed by clots of graypink brain tissue pumping out piecemeal in oatmeallike chunks like swill from a suddenly unclogged drainage pipe graves shut his eyes fell to his knees went down the laser still buzzing had rolled out from between his fingers and landed on the floor the ruby beam arced toward the clothes in the corner set them on fire penetrated the clothes and continued into the stone wall where it sizzled sputtered died no not on its own a big hand had yanked out the cord the room went silent jeremy rushed to angela turned her over saw the face of a stranger detective bob doresh lifted him by the arm doctor doctor i never knew following you was going to be this interesting at midnight as he drove to the police station in an unmarked sedan that smelled of potato chips bob doresh said im a pretty good shot huh told you military service was useful wheres angela said jeremy still said doresh you never know how youre going to react when its real twentythree years ive been on the job and its the first time i had to fire the damn thing they say killing someone even when its righteous can be traumatic id have to say i feel pretty good right now think ill need help later doc wheres angela doresh had one hand on the wheel the other rested on the back of the seat he drove slowly with skill during the onslaught of officers crimescene techs and coroners examiners hed kept jeremy under wraps in the tivoli arms rest room a uniformed cop had stood watch mute as renfrew no one had talked to him i asked you something detective doresh said okay heres the situation with dr rios first things first shes safe been sitting in her own apartment with my partner steve hoker watching over her protective custody if you will you called her off the ward said jeremy thats the second thing doc my motivation steves and mine we pulled her out of the hospital because we wanted to talk to her about you we thought you were dangerous okay we were wrong but with the way youve been acting especially yesterday in the chapel he shrugged sitting in a motel room by yourself thats a little different wouldnt you say i mean i understand now you were watching that other guy but see it from my perspective you told her i was a murderous psychopath doresh touched his temple kept his foot light on the accelerator the night was crisp and bright and the unmarked cars heater was surprisingly efficient we were looking out for her best interest thanks doresh gave him a sidelong glance you being sarcastic no i mean it thanks you had her safety in mind thanks for protecting her okay youre welcome and excuse me for wondering about the sarcasm but lets face it you can get pretty sarcastic ive had my moments you have said doresh but no harm no foul it was never personal right in the end we were both on the same side true doresh smiled and his big chin jutted the difference being that i was doing my job and you were improvising am i supposed to apologize for that here we go again butting heads must be some sort of personality clash nah no apologies necessary you got a little carried away in the end it worked out fine better than fine hey doc your hands are shaking pretty bad when we get there let me fix you some coffee mines a helluva lot better than yours my partner steve hokers driving dr rios over to meet you i told him the situation she wont be scared of you she was scared huh the things i told her you kidding she was terrified and i make no apologies for that i had the game pretty well mapped out i just didnt know the players live and learn said jeremy you got it doc said doresh stop learning you might as well curl up and die visiting doctor tagged as serial killer exclusive to the clarion police have identified a seattlebased surgeon and medical researcher working at city central hospital on a oneyear fellowship as a serial murderer believed responsible for the deaths of at least five local women and a possible suspect in as many as three dozen other unsolved murders around the world augusto omar graves holder of both a medical degree and a phd in biomedical engineering and an acknowledged expert on laser technology and surgery was shot dead by police thursday evening in the subterranean storage locker of his luxurious hale boulevard condominium graves believed to have been born in syria and raised in brazil and the united states was found in the company of his fifth victims corpse according to the coroner that woman kristina schnurr a recent immigrant from poland whod worked as a housekeeper at the hospital had been strangled schnurr and graves had been seen talking the day of the murder and it is believed graves lured schnurr on a date strangled her in his car and hid her body in the condominiums parking garage he then drove the car back to the buildings entrance so that a doorman would see him enter alone graves managed to transport schnurrs corpse two floors down to the storage locker a dank cellarlike space that he had converted into a dissection chamber gravess other local victims include a nurse from city central jocelyn lee banks murdered six months ago and formerly thought to have been carjacked from a hospital parking lot police now believe graves convinced her to go with him willingly under false pretenses in addition graves is the prime suspect in the deaths of three recently murdered prostitutes tyrene mazursky odelia tat and maisie donovan given the time span between the banks killing and those of the other victims as well as gravess frequent business trips there is reason to believe that he will be tied into murders in other cities graves has also been implicated in the mutilation slayings of at least two women murdered in kent england during periods when he was conducting research at a london think tank and writing about science for the guardian newspaper investigators from spain italy france and norway are reexamining unsolved murders involving surgical dissection that may have links to gravess methodology police chief arlo simmons cited numerous manhours and firstrate detective work as the factors that led to the discovery of gravess lair weve been interested in this individual for some time said chief simmons i regret that we werent able to save kristina schnurr however the death of this man can be truly said to have brought an end to a reign of terror three days after the death of augusto graves during one of several attempts to steal a moment with angela jeremys beeper went off seconds later so did hers they were in his office sitting on the floor greasy napkins in their laps takeout burgers in their hands a duet of squawks they cracked up first time theyd laughed since that night you first he said she called in diabetic coma on four east and another patient had reacted adversely to prednisone withdrawal she was needed stat she got to her feet gobbled a pickle slice wrapped her quartereaten lunch in its waxpaper jacket placed it on his desk he said take it with you not hungry ive noticed i think youve lost weight you havent exactly been gorging im fine so am i dude she slung her white coat over her shoulders

congratulations thanks cmere doc gimme a shake i wanna show you my grip doug thrust out his right hand the iv line looped and thrummed jeremy approached doug grabbed him squeezed hard impressive said jeremy sometimes said the young man i feel like i can climb walls the day arthur came to see jeremy the mail brought another surprise cheap white envelope official police correspondence stamped on the back inside were two squares of cardboard taped together jeremy cut the tape and extricated what was sandwiched within the snapshot of jocelyn and him her tiny frame made jeremy look like a large man both of them happy her blond hair windblown all over the place he remembered the strands had tickled him like crazy and shed gotten a kick out of that oh youre ticklish shed gone for his ribs grabbing with strong little fingers giggling like a kid so pleased with herself he stared at the photo for a long time placed it in an unmarked envelope set that in a lower drawer of his desk atop the curiosity file one of these days hed do something with it arthur had a tan the golden glow merged with his natural ruddiness turned the old mans skin into something luminous nearly eighty but the picture of vitality traveling and learning had served him well he found jeremy just as he had the first time sitting alone in the doctors dining room three pm an offhour for lunch jeremyd filled his days with patients just as he had since the night underground had eaten nothing earlier the room was empty arthur wore a beautiful royal blue pinstriped suit and a pink shirt with a contrasting white collar his bow tie was gold shantung a peacock blue handkerchief flowed from his breast pocket in one hand was a cup of tea a burnished leather briefcase dangled from the other a large case handstitched stamped with arthurs initials which jeremy had never seen before may i sit down sure arthur settled took time to dunk his tea bag stared straight into jeremys eyes how was your trip arthur excellent travel and learn thats what its all about you taught me plenty said jeremy the old man didnt answer why the need to be oblique arthur fair question my friend arthur sipped tea stroked his beard pushed the cup to the side there are multiple answers first off at the level of hypothesis one can never be sure i truly was learning second i felt i needed to pace things so as not to repel you admit it son if id laid everything out youd have thought me demented he smiled at jeremy jeremy shrugged third and this may offend you jeremy however i think a lot of you and would never dissemble certain things need to be striven for to be appreciated no gain without pain a cliché but no less valid for that you guided me with riddles and games for my own good exactly said the old man perfectly put jeremy had known this moment would arrive hed wondered how hed react weeks had gone by since the subterranean nightmare he rarely thought about it and the horror had faded to a macabre cartoon interestingly enough the latenight supper with arthur and his friends had surged in his memory grown clearer more real after supper he said you seemed to grow distant arthur nodded forgive me i was torn i knew what you were about to undergo i wondered some things need to be striven for now having asked arthur the question and receiving the answer he could only smile okay he said thats it said the old man youre satisfied about that i am i do have other questions since youve pledged not to dissemble fair enough was your familys killer ever found one way or the other tears sprang to arthurs eyes and that was answer enough for jeremy but the old man said never did any suspects arise one suspect said arthur a local handyman a clearly disturbed man later i was to find out hed spent time in an asylum id been concerned about him for some time was certain id seen him leering at my wife arthurs voice caught she was beautiful my sally men were always looking at her i have pictures in my apartment one day youll see them but this man what happened to him said jeremy nothing of a police nature son perhaps now with the technology we have he might have been arrested but back then the old man shook his head you just let it go at the time i was too weak to react everything id worked for taken just like that arthur sniffed blinked his beard trembled my children were sweet jeremy my wife was beautiful and my children were sweet he pulled out the blue pocket silk and patted his eyes im sorry said jeremy thank you arthur stuffed the silk back in his breast pocket perfect casual fold he said two months after my family was taken from me sixtythree days to be precise the handyman was brought to the emergency room here strangled bowel one of those things that just happens he was treated but to no avail his guts turned to gangrene and he was dead within three days i never saw him alive however i did have the opportunity to assist at the autopsy rotting from within appropriate arthurs hand reached across the table and took hold of jeremys sleeves it felt right the fact that hed been taken that way seemed the most fitting thing in the world it wasnt until years later when i met others in my situation that i realized the grand truth expediency trumps virtue said jeremy virtue is divine but not limited to god its something he shares with us something we need to use judiciously the sword of war comes to the world for the delay of justice said jeremy disorder arthur withdrew his hand his glorious tan had been leached of its glow he looked old may i get you some tea arthur please jeremy brought him a cup watched him drink do you have energy for more arthur nodded i want to know about edgar i know about kurau but not edgars personal involvement was it simply a political matter arthur closed his eyes opened them edgars story is his to tell what i can tell you is that edgar invested his personal resources to build a clinic for sick children on the island babies and toddlers who might otherwise have perished antisepsis and proper medication welltrained native nurses edgar put all that together the riots destroyed everything he reached down for his briefcase jeremy said when we share with god it sometimes gets messy michael srivac for example he was a building contractor in robert ballerons town fierce competitor to balleron no one was arrested for ballerons murder but several months later srivac died in a singlecar accident freakish accident from what i can gather the brakes on his car just gave out and the car had been serviced two days before that is no surprise said arthur during world war ii more military planes crashed shortly after major maintenance checks than at any other time youre saying that one god did all by himself tinas story is hers to tell said jeremy the same goes for shadley renfrew right his wife was murdered thirtytwo years ago the evidence pointed to her surprising a burglar a known criminal was suspected a cat burglar but he was never brought to trial due to insufficient evidence six months later his body washed up on the north shore shadley was a remarkable man said arthur voluminous memory fine eye for detail wonderful irish tenor he raised his daughter all by himself she told me i walked into the shop just as she was closing it down i assume the books are being well cared for arthur nodded reached again for his case drew out a black velvet box and placed it in front of jeremy a gift a minor token of our appreciation our being the city central club renfrew was a member wasnt he his passing left an empty chair arthur smiled before jeremy could say more the old man was up briefcase in hand striding away a bounce in his step jeremy opened the box the interior was white satin over a compartment formed to cradle its contents a repousse silver goblet jeremy removed the cup weighty inside was a note fine blue rag paper folded once familiar writing in black fountain pen ink to a young scholar and gentleman with gratitude admiration and earnest hopes that youll consider this humble proposition one soul passes another enters life is fleeting brutish ecstatic mundane let us punctuate our brief sojourn with fine food warming libations and the sparkling camaraderie of souls in synchrony fondly the central conspiracy club okay hed been close youll like them said angela youre sure its what you want its exactly what i want sunday one in the afternoon rampaging blizzards were rumored to be racing down from canada but the air ever perverse had warmed they were lunching at a place near the harbor fried seafood and coleslaw and beer nice view of the lake just far enough to obscure the oily film on the water from their table the water was gods own mirror the publicity surrounding augusto gravess crimes his relationship to central city and to ted dirgrove had thrown the hospitals front office into a tailspin dirgrove had taken an extended leave of absence the charming young women at development sat idly the inept security guards contended with reporters jeremy exploited the turmoil by demanding and receiving two months paid vacation dates of his choosing he planned to leave soon once all the police business was cleared away once his patients were sufficiently taken care of hed also insisted on ten paid days off for angela with no downside to her residency rating he would have tried for more but she said i really do need to be here the schedule which was fine hed have some time to himself maybe travel learn the first ten days the best days would be spent with angela away from emergencies and memories and the pain of others in his heart he felt it would take them to another level angela was thrilled at the prospect today shed surprised him with a plan theyd fly out to california rent a car a convertible drive up the coast just drive anywhere the sun was out then the tentative addon maybe we can spend the last couple of days with my family i want them to meet you theyll adore you youre pretty sure of that hundred and fifty percent sure because i adore you and im their princesswhocandonowrong you have that kind of power oh yeah scary said jeremy very she smiled light bounced off the lake and filtered through the waves of her hair beautiful girl here can you handle all that power tough guy yeah they were sitting across from one another too far jeremy got up moved his chair next to hers she bussed his cheek he stroked the back of her neck and she said this is so good they sat that way looking out at the water holding hands thinking separate
