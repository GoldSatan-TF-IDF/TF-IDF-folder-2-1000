chapter one a violent crime billy ray cobb sat on the back of the pickup drinking a beer watching his friend pete willard take his turn with the black girl she was ten and small for her age she did not look at the man on top of her he was breathing hard and swearing he was hurting her when he finished he hit her in the mouth and laughed and the other man laughed too then they laughed harder and rolled around the grass by the pickup screaming like two crazy men the girl lay in a pool of blood and beer later willard asked what billy ray planned to do now that they had finished with her billy ray said they should kill her are you going to do it asked willard cobb hesitated no ill let you do it willard said it wasnt my idea youre the one whos good at killing niggers you do it he thought for a minute while he finished a beer lets throw her off a bridge good idea very good idea said billy ray they drove past lake chatulla a large manmade mudhole in the far southwest corner of ford county looking for a place to throw out their unwanted passenger at each bridge they approached they saw blacks fishing in the muddy water cobb was getting desperate by now he turned off into a side road and stopped the pickup they threw her into the long grass at the edge of the woods carl lee hailey did not hurry home when he got the phone call gwen was easily excited and she had called him at work before when she thought the children had been kidnapped he only became anxious when he turned into his yard and saw the police car parked next to the house as he opened the front door he wondered where tony and the boys were then he heard gwen crying to his right in the small livingroom he saw a crowd around a small figure the child was covered with towels and surrounded by crying relatives as he went closer the crying stopped and they moved back carl lee hailey asked what had happened no one answered only gwen stayed by the girl holding her hand he knelt beside the sofa and touched the girls shoulder he spoke to his daughter and she tried to smile both her eyes were swollen shut and bleeding carl lee stood and turned to the crowd and demanded to know what had happened he asked for the third time the deputy willie hastings one of gwens cousins stepped forward and told carl lee that some people were fishing down by the river when they saw tonya lying in the middle of the road she told them her daddys name and they brought her home what happened willie carl lee shouted as he stared at the deputy hastings spoke slowly looking out of the window while he repeated what tonya had told her mother about the white men and their pickup and the rope and the trees and being hurt when they got on her hastings stopped when he heard the sound of the approaching ambulance carl lee walked out of the house with his daughter in his arms he whispered gently to her the tears rolling down his face he walked to the back of the ambulance and stepped inside the doctor closed the door and carefully took her from him ozzie walls was the only black sheriff in mississippi he was proud of this especially since ford county was percent white and the other black sheriffs had been from much blacker counties he arrested billy ray cobb and willard in hueys a bar on highway near the lake outside town they had been there all evening drinking whiskey and telling everybody about the good time they had been having bad news travels fast and the story had soon reached the sheriff ozzie was smiling when he walked to the table where cobb was sitting with willard and two others im sorry sir but we dont allow niggers in here said cobb and the four started to laugh ozzie continued to smile when the laughing stopped ozzie said you boys having a good time billy ray we were looks like it i hate to interrupt your conversation but you and mr willard need to come with me wherere we going willard asked for a ride i aint moving said cobb willard stared desperately at cobb cobb drank his beer and said i aint going to jail ozzies deputy passed the sheriff the longest blackest police stick ever used in ford county ozzie struck the center of the table sending beer and cans in all directions willard sat up as if he had been hit he put his wrists together and held them out for deputy looney he was dragged outside and thrown into a police car cobb did not move ozzie took him by the hair and lifted him from his chair then pushed his face into the floor he put a knee into his back slid his stick under his throat and pulled upward while pushing down on the knee cobb stopped moving when he couldnt breathe any more he was no trouble after that ozzie dragged cobb by the hair across the dance floor out of the door across the yard and threw him into the back seat with willard jake brigance woke at am as usual rolled out of bed and went downstairs to make coffee for his wife carla she was still asleep he had to be at the coffee shop at am he had made many rules like this for himself he was ambitious but poor if he was going to be the most successful lawyer in the state he knew he would also have to be the hardest working he gave carla her coffee kissed his still sleeping fouryearold daughter goodbye and went out of the house the new red saab he drove had a lot in common with the beautiful nineteenth century house he had just left first they were the only ones of their kind in ford county second he owed the three local banks a lot of money for both of them there were good reasons why jake brigance worked so hard he heard about the rape of tonya hailey at the coffee shop as he was eating breakfast with tim nunley who worked at the local garage and bill and bert west who worked at the shoe factory north of town there were three deputies having breakfast at the next table and they asked him if he had defended billy ray cobb on a drugs case a few years ago no i didnt represent him i think he had a memphis lawyer jake replied whats he done we arrested him last night for rape rape yes him and pete willard who did they rape you remember that hailey nigger you looked after in that murder trial a few years ago lester hailey of course i remember you know his brother carl lee sure know him well i know all the haileys represented most of them well it was his little girl youre joking no suddenly jake didnt feel hungry any more he pushed his plate to one side he listened to the conversation change from fishing to japanese cars and back to fishing at three minutes before seven jake unlocked the front door to his office and turned on the lights his office was a twostory building in a row of twostory buildings overlooking the courthouse on the north side of the square just down from the coffee shop the building had been built by the wilbanks family back in the s when they owned most of ford county there had been a wilbanks practicing law in the building until when jakes employer lucien wilbanks had been thrown out of the legal profession for a series of offenses resulting from a serious drink problem lucien had been more hurt by this than anything that had happened to him in his troubled life he gave the keys of the office to jake and left town the firm was now jakes and though lucien had come back he had no involvement with it he spent most of his time up at the wilbanks place drinking whiskey and looking out over the garden carl lee had not been able to sleep at the hospital tonyas condition was serious but she was not going to die they had seen her at midnight after the doctor warned them that she looked bad she did gwen had kissed the little bandaged face while carl lee stood at the end of the bed unable to do anything but stare at the small figure surrounded by machines tubes and nurses the sheriff ozzie walls brought coffee and cakes at two in the morning and told carl lee all he knew about cobb and willard jake began to check his mail he heard his secretary ethel twitty come in at eightthirty as usual at around that time sheriff ozzie walls was typing up pete willards story of the rape ozzie had told willard what had happened to the last white man who had gone to the state jail at parchman about five years ago a young white man in helena county raped a black girl she was twelve they were waiting for him when he got to parchman knew he was coming on his first night about thirty blacks tied him over a big oil drum and climbed on the guards watched and laughed they hate rapists the other prisoners got him every night for three months and then they killed him after that willard seemed to want to help the sheriff as much as he could chapter two revenge jake was in court the next day to see billy ray and willard go before the local judge and to hear ozzie walls report of willards story carl lee was there too as soon as they had heard the judge say that the two men should be kept in jail carl lee and jake walked out of the courtroom and down to the first floor they stopped at the back door of the court they talked about tonya and carl lees family then carl lee told jake that his younger brother lester was coming down from chicago whats lester coming in for jake asked family business are you two planning something no he just wants to see tonya you two be careful thats easy for you to say jake i know youve got a little girl if she was lying up in the hospital beaten and raped what would you do jake looked through the window of the door and could not answer carl lee waited dont do anything stupid carl lee answer my question what would you do i dont know i dont know what id do let me ask you this if it was your little girl and if it was two niggers and you could get your hands on them what would you do kill them carl lee smiled then laughed im sure you would jake im sure you would then youd hire an expensive lawyer to say you were crazy just like you did when you defended lester as they came out of the courthouse jake told carl lee it had been different when lester was on trial there was no planning the man lester had killed had attacked him first carl lee looked back up at the stairs is this how theyll come into the courtroom he asked without looking at jake who those boys yes most of the time they take them up those stairs its quicker and safer they can park right outside the door here are you ready to defend another member of my family dont do it carl lee its not worth it what if youre found guilty and they give you the electric chair what about your children wholl look after them i have no choice jake ill never sleep till those two are dead i owe it to my little girl i owe it to myself and i owe it to my people itll be done they opened the doors and walked down to washington street opposite jakes office they shook hands jake promised to stop at the hospital the next day to see gwen and the family one more thing jake will you meet me at the jail when they arrest me jake nodded before he thought about what carl lee was saying carl lee smiled and walked down the sidewalk to his pickup carl lees younger brother lester drove from chicago to clanton in his new cadillac it was late wednesday night when he arrived at the hospital he found some of his cousins reading magazines in the secondfloor waiting room when he saw carl lee he pulled him close and held him tightly they had not seen each other since the christmas holidays when half the blacks in chicago traveled home to mississippi and alabama how is she lester asked better much better might go home this weekend lester felt his breathing get easier when he had left chicago eleven hours earlier he had thought she was near death he lit a cigarette under the no smoking sign and stared at his big brother you ok carl lee nodded he looked down the hall come outside he said ive got some things to ask you the ford county courthouse opened at am and closed at pm every day except friday when it closed at fourthirty at fourthirty on friday carl lee was hiding in a firstfloor toilet he sat and listened quietly for an hour no one silence he walked through the wide dark hall to the back doors and looked through the window there was no one around he listened for a while no one he started to study the building he pretended to be on trial he put his hands behind him and walked the thirty feet to the stairs up the stairs ten steps then a turn to the left just like lester said he had a good memory and lesters time in the army had made him good at giving directions carl lee studied the courthouse for over an hour up and down up and down he followed the movements that would be made by the men who had raped his daughter he followed them in his mind room by room he sat in the judges chair and looked out over the court he sat in one of the comfortable chairs in the jury box he sat in the witness chair it was dark at seven oclock when carl lee hailey raised a window in the toilet and went quietly through the bushes and into the darkness getting the gun was no problem carl lee and lester just went to memphis met an old army friend of carl lees called cat bruster and asked for an m two hours later it was in the trunk of lesters cadillac the gun was the easy part what came next would be harder on may billy ray cobb and pete willard were brought back to the court to hear judge bullard tell them the date of their trial jake brigance had no reason to be in court but he still worried about carl lee as he worked in his office just before two oclock he went over to the window one more time and lit another cigarette the two rapists had just heard that they would be held in the county jail until the trial the crowd started to leave the courtroom but carl lees brother lester did not move he watched closely as the two white boys were taken through the door into the room behind the judges table when they were out of sight he placed his head in his hands and said a short prayer then he listened cobb went first down the stairs then willard then deputy looney ten steps down then turn right then ten steps to the first floor three other deputies waited outside by the police cars smoking and watching the reporters who had come to the court when cobb reached the second step from the floor with willard three steps behind and looney one step behind him a small door burst open and carl lee hailey jumped out from the darkness with the m in his hands holding the gun only one or two feet from the men who had raped his daughter he opened fire the loud rapid gunfire shook the courthouse and broke the silence the rapists froze then screamed as they were hit cobb first in the stomach and chest then willard in the face neck and throat they tried to run back up the stairs but fell over each other as they slipped on their own blood deputy looney was hit in the leg but managed to get up the stairs into a back room from there he could hear the screams of cobb and willard and the crazy nigger laughing bullets continued to hit the walls of the narrow stairway and as he looked through the door looney could see blood and flesh sliding down the walls the enormous explosions of the m filled the courthouse through the gunfire and the sounds of the bullets hitting the walls of the stairway looney could still hear carl lees crazy laughter when carl lee stopped he threw the gun at the two bodies and ran into the toilet he went out through the window as he had done on that earlier evening onto the sidewalk then he walked to his pickup and drove home cobb or what was left of him stopped moving and lay against willard their blood mixed and ran down each step covering the foot of the stairway jake ran across the street to the back door of the courthouse one deputy was on the floor a gun in his hand shouting at the reporters who were trying to get in the other deputies looked out from behind the police cars jake ran to the front of the courthouse where more deputies were guarding the door and getting people out of the building jake pushed his way through the crowd and inside there he found ozzie walls directing people and shouting instructions to his men he called to jake and they walked down the hall to the back of the court where a half dozen deputies stood guns in hand looking silently at the stairway jake felt sick the front of willards head was missing cobb had taken most of the bullets in his back the thick smell of gunfire hung over the stairway jake youd better leave ozzie said without taking his eyes off the bodies why just leave why because weve got to take pictures and stuff and you dont need to be here ok but you dont question him without me there understand ozzie nodded the only vehicles outside the hailey house were gwens car carl lees pickup and the red cadillac from illinois ozzie expected no trouble as the police cars parked in a row across the front yard the deputies bent down behind the open doors watching as the sheriff walked alone to the house he stopped the front door opened slowly and the hailey family came out the two groups watched each other each waiting for the other to say or do something each wanting to avoid what had to happen ozzie kicked at some dirt on the path looking at the family then at his men finally he said youd better come with me carl lee looked at the sheriff but did not move gwen and the boy cried as lester took the girl from her daddy then carl lee knelt in front of the three boys and whispered to them again that he must leave but he wouldnt be gone long he held them close and they all cried and held on to him he turned and kissed his wife then walked down the steps to the sheriff chapter three afterward you can see him in a minute jake ozzie said after carl lee had been brought back to the sheriffs office thanks you sure he did it yes im sure he didnt say he did it no he didnt say anything i guess lester told him what to do half an hour later lawyer and client sat across the table and looked at each other carefully they smiled but neither spoke they had last talked five days before the day after the rape carl lee was not as troubled now his face was relaxed and his eyes were clear finally he said you didnt think id do it jake not really you did do it you know i did jake smiled nodded and crossed his arms how do you feel carl lee sat back in the folding chair well i feel better i dont feel good about the whole thing but then i dont feel good about what happened to my girl you know are you scared of what how about the electric chair no jake thats why ive got you i dont plan to go to the chair you helped lester now you can do it for me jake its not quite that easy carl lee you just dont shoot a person or two people tell the jury they needed to be killed and expect to walk out of the courtroom you did with lester but every case is different and the big difference here is that you killed two white boys and lester killed a nigger big difference you scared jake why should i be scared im not facing the electric chair you dont sound too confident you big stupid fool thought jake how could he be confident at a time like this sure he was confident before the killings but now it was different his client was facing the electric chair for a crime which everyone knew he did and that was only the beginning of his problems carl lee was a black who had killed two whites in a mainly white county rufus buckley would be the prosecutor and rufus would do everything he could to win it was personal between him and jake and there was going to be a problem about money jake hated to discuss professional costs but he knew he had to do it immediately clients wanted to know about his charges and most were shocked at how expensive the law could be after he had talked about carl lees family and how they were jake started to talk about preparing for the trial carl lee made it easy for him and asked how much all of that was going to cost jake looked at the file and the contract he had brought with him and thought desperately of a fair amount there were other lawyers out there who would take such a case for almost nothing nothing except publicity he thought about the land carl lee owned the job at the paper factory and his family and finally said ten thousand carl lee did not seem too worried though he said you charged lester five thousand they finally agreed on seven thousand five hundred after jake filled out the contract and carl lee signed carl lee asked jake how much would you charge a man with plenty of money fifty thousand fifty thousand are you serious yes man thats a lot of money did you ever get that much no but i havent seen too many people on trial for murder with that kind of money once he had finished talking with his client jake left the sheriffs office and walked toward the reporters with their microphones and cameras although he pretended he wanted to get away from them he stopped for enough time to stand in front of the cameras and answer ten or more questions ozzie and the deputies watched from inside jake loves cameras the sheriff said all lawyers do added one of the deputies after a cold supper jake and his wife sat at the front of their house and looked out at the garden they talked about the case jakes interview was too late for the early evening news so he and carla waited for the ten oclock program and there he was looking fit and handsome jake thought he looked great on tv and he was excited to be there he felt good he enjoyed the publicity and when carl lee hailey was found not guilty of the murder of the two white men who raped his daughter before an allwhite jury in rural mississippi whatre you smiling about asked carla nothing sure youre thinking about the trial and the cameras and the reporters and walking out of the courthouse with carl lee a free man reporters chasing you with the tv cameras everyone congratulating you i know exactly what youre thinking about then why did you ask to see if youd admit it ok i admit it this case could make me famous and make us a million dollars if you win next morning tuesday jake ate his usual breakfast at the coffee shop he noticed that some of the regular customers were quieter with him than normal but he hoped this would change when deputy looney was out of hospital looney was well liked by the other customers and jake knew that there were some who would not be happy about him defending carl lee he spent the rest of the morning making arrangements for the trial and talking to a tv reporter from memphis he went home feeling a lot happier on wednesday at am the two rapists were buried the minister struggled desperately for something comforting to say to the small crowd the service was short and with few tears afterward friends came to the cobbs house the men sat around in the back yard while the women looked after mrs cobb the men drank whiskey and talked about the good times when niggers knew their place then one cousin said he knew someone who used to be active in the ku klux klan and he might give him a call cobbs grandfather had been in the klan the cousin explained and when he and billy ray were children the old man told stories about hanging niggers in ford and tyler counties they should do the same thing the nigger had done maybe the klan would be interested in the courtroom the groups of blacks and whites sat opposite each other and watched the machinery of justice at work ozzie walls was the first witness he gave a clear report of what had happened when cobb and willard were killed and what had happened after he talked about the shooting the bodies the wounds the gun the fingerprints on the gun and the fingerprints of the defendant other witnesses followed and told how they had seen carl lee shoot the two men and walk out of the courthouse it was clear that he had killed the men who raped his daughter and jake did not ask any questions carl lee was handed to the sheriff to be held until the trial and everyone left the courtroom jake got ready to talk to the reporters who had already started to crowd around the courtroom doors later on wednesday night the doctors had to remove looneys leg below the knee they called ozzie at the jail and he told carl lee rufus buckley looked through the thursday morning papers and read with great interest the report of the previous days events in ford county he was delighted to see his name mentioned by the reporters and by mr brigance he didnt like brigance but he was glad jake used his name in front of the cameras and reporters for two days brigance and carl lee had had all the publicity it was time the prosecutor was mentioned rufus buckley was fortyone and very ambitious he wanted a big public position maybe even governor he had it all planned but he was not well known outside the district he needed to be seen and heard he needed publicity rufus needed more than anything else to win a big nasty well publicized murder trial on the same thursday morning jake was reading the same newspaper he was interrupted by his secretary ethel who came and stood in front of the big desk mr brigance my husband and i received a threatening phone call last night and ive just had the second one here at the office i dont like this jake pointed to a chair sit down ethel what did these people say they threatened me because i work for you said id be sorry because i worked for a nigger lover they threatened to harm you and your family too im just scared jake was worried too but did not show it to ethel he had called ozzie on wednesday and reported the calls to his own house he advised her to change her number but she did not want to do that she wanted him to stop defending carl lee jake refused and the conversation ended like so many conversations he had with ethel in disagreement an hour later ethel called him to say that lucien the man who had given jake the law business had asked jake to come to his house with some recent cases lucien came to the office or called once a month he read cases and kept up to date with developments in the law he had little else to do except drink his whiskey he looked forward to jakes monthly visits when he could hear about the world he used to work in and give advice to the only man who now listened to him the advice was in fact surprisingly good and jake could never understand how lucien knew so much later on thursday therefore jake parked the saab behind luciens old porsche walked up to the house and handed the cases to him lucien offered whiskey then wine then beer but jake did not accept any carla did not like drinking and lucien knew it congratulations for what jake asked for the hailey case why are you congratulating me i never had such a big case and i had some big ones what do you mean by big lots of publicity thats what makes a lawyer successful jake if youre unknown you dont eat when people get in trouble they call a lawyer and they call someone theyve heard of you must sell yourself to the public and youve got to try to get the trial moved to another county without enough blacks on the jury you wont have a chance this county is percent black every other county in the district is at least percent black van buren county is percent that means more black jurors if the trial is here theres a risk of an allwhite jury and believe me ive seen enough allwhite juries in this county at the very least you need one black jake felt that it was not going to be easy to get judge noose to move the trial and said so to lucien thats not a problem he replied the main thing is to ask then when they find that poor man guilty you can claim he did not have a fair trial because the judge refused to move so you dont feel too optimistic about carl lees chances lucien thought for a moment not really it will be difficult why looks like it was planned right yes im sure youll say he was insane i dont know you must said lucien there is no other possible defense you cant say it was an accident you cant say he shot those two boys with a machine gun in selfdefense can you no you wont tell the jury he was at home with his family of course not then what other defense do you have you must say he was crazy but lucien he was not insane and theres no way i can find a psychiatrist who will say he was he planned it every detail lucien smiled and took a drink thats why youre in trouble my boy but youre still lucky to have the case you really think so asked jake im serious its a lawyers dream win it and youre famous it could make you rich ill need your help youve got it i need something to do the next day friday lester came into jakes office and told him the family could only raise nine hundred dollars to pay for carl lees defense all of the banks in town had refused to lend money wonderful thought jake my family and my secretary are getting threatening phone calls my best friend tells me i cant win the case and now im only going to get nine hundred dollars for a case which is going to stop me doing any other work for weeks wonderful chapter four the klan before carl lee hailey could go on trial he had to go in front of a jury of citizens of ford county it was their job to decide if the two murders had happened and if it was reasonable for carl lee to stand trial this was the first opportunity for rufus buckley to get some of the publicity he wanted so much the grand jury made its decision there was a case against carl lee and he would have to stand trial for murder it was then rufus buckleys turn to stand on the front steps of the courthouse in the middle of a crowd of reporters and cameramen buckley had copies of the legal documents with carl lees name on he waved these in front of the cameras he talked like a priest in church saying how terrible it was for people to take the law into their own hands he praised the jury for the decision they had made he accused carl lee hailey of being a lawless man and said he wanted the trial to happen soon he guaranteed he would prove that carl lee hailey was guilty of murder he guaranteed carl lee hailey would die on the electric chair he was rude unpleasant selfimportant he was himself a few of the reporters left but he did not stop talking he told those who remained about his skill as a lawyer and his success as a prosecutor more reporters left more cameras were turned off he praised judge noose for his wisdom and fairness he praised the intelligence and good judgment of ford county jurors when he finished speaking there were no reporters left they had grown tired of him stump sisson was the ku klux klans leader in mississippi he had called the meeting at a small hut deep in the forest in nettles county two hundred and thirty miles south of ford county there were no special clothes or speeches the small group of klansmen discussed the events in ford county with freddie cobb brother of billy ray freddie had called a friend who had contacted stump to arrange the meeting whens the niggers trial im not sure cobb said i think itll probably be later in summer he was most worried he said by all the talk about the nigger saying he was insane and going free it wasnt right the nigger killed his brother in cold blood planned the shooting what could the klan do about it cobb complained that the niggers had so much protection these days that no one could do anything against them hell white people aint got a chance except for the klan who else will march and stand up for white people all the laws work to help the niggers thats why we called the klan what about your brother did he rape her were not sure probably not willard the other one said he did it but billy ray never did he always had plenty of women why would he rape a little nigger girl and if he did whats the big problem whos the niggers lawyer brigance a local boy in clanton young but pretty good he told some reporters the nigger would say he was insane and would go free whos the judge i dont know yet sisson and the klan members listened carefully to this mindless farmer they liked his complaints about the government but they had also read the papers and watched tv and they knew his brother had received justice but at the hands of a nigger it was unthinkable the case could be useful to them with the trial several months away there was time to plan they could march during the day around the courthouse in their klan uniform of tall hats and masks the press would love it hate them but love the arguments the anger and at night they could frighten people with their burning crosses and threatening phone calls there would also be violence they knew what the sight of the klan did to crowds of angry niggers ford county could be their playground for search and destroy hit and run they had time to organize and call in people from other states the hailey case could be used to bring together all the southern whites who still refused to accept the rights of blacks to a place in society mr cobb can you get us the names and addresses of the nigger his family his lawyer the judge and the jurors asked sisson cobb thought about this everybody except the jurors they arent been chosen yet whatre you thinking were not sure but the klan will most likely get involved we need to remind people were still here and this could be a good opportunity can i help cobb asked sure but youd need to be a member we aint got any klan up in clanton it stopped meeting a long time ago my grandfather used to be a member you mean the grandfather of this man was a klansman yes cobb answered proudly well then we must get involved buckleys four oclock press conference did not come on the early evening news jake laughed when first the national tv channels and then memphis then jackson then ripelo ended their broadcasts with no news about the hailey trial and no pictures of buckley on the screen at ten jake and his wife carla lay in the dark on the sofa waiting for the news finally there was buckley on the front steps waving papers and shouting while the reporter explained that this was rufus buckley the man who would prosecute carl lee hailey the camera was pointed at buckley for a few seconds and then the camera moved around the town square to give a wonderful view of the center of clanton it finally came back to the reporter for two sentences about a trial in late summer buckleys really horrible carla said and turned off the sound of the tv you know what i dislike most about your murder trials she kicked the cushions off the sofa with her thin brown almost perfect legs the blood the pain no she let her shoulderlength hair fall around her as she fell back on the sofa the loss of life no she was wearing one of his old shirts she began to play with the buttons the horrible possibility of an innocent man facing the electric chair no she unbuttoned the shirt the blue television screen was the only light in the room it was enough for jake to see her almost perfect arms reach out for him the emotion the desire thats more like it she said and slid an almost perfect brown leg up up up to the back of the sofa where it gently came to rest they moved closer to each other and she turned off the tv the room was warm and dark chapter five lawyers harry rex vonner was enormously fat he was a lawyer who specialized in cases where marriages had broken down nastily he could be just as nasty as his cases and his services were in great demand he could get you the children the house the farm the dog everything one wealthy farmer sent him a check each month so that the woman he was married to his fourth wife couldnt hire him for herself harry rex sent his criminal cases to jake and jake sent his nasty marriage problem cases to harry rex they were friends and they disliked other lawyers especially rufus buckley on tuesday morning harry rex came slowly up the stairs to jakes office the stairway shook as he climbed to the first floor he was breathing heavily as he entered the big room morning harry rex why dont you get a downstairs office he demanded between breaths you need the exercise if it werent for those stairs your weight would be over three hundred pounds thanks i just came from the courtroom noose wants you there at tenthirty if possible wants to talk about hailey with you and buckley agree the trial date he asked me to tell you good ill be there youll find buckley there too you should see him hes telling everyone about his big tv appearance last night but no one wants to talk about it hes like a child begging for attention be nice to him he may be your next governor not if he loses the hailey case and hes going to lose hailey jake well pick a good jury twelve good and faithful citizens then well buy them i didnt hear that it works every time a few minutes after tenthirty jake entered the judges office behind the courtroom and coolly shook hands with buckley and the other lawyers they had been waiting for him noose waved him toward a seat and sat behind the desk jake this will take just a few minutes i would like to see carl lee hailey in the morning at nine any problems with that no thatll be fine replied jake ok now lets discuss a trial date for mr hailey as you know the next term for the court here is in late august and im sure well be just as busy then because of the nature of this case and honestly because of the publicity i think it would be best if we had a trial as soon as is practical the sooner the better said buckley jake how long will you need to prepare for trial sixty days sixty days buckley repeated why so long jake ignored him he explained to the judge that they would be using an insanity defense and would need carl lee to be examined by a psychiatrist and that all this would take time buckley kept shouting that it was unnecessary relax rufus jake said calmly the cameras will be here in sixty days even ninety days they wont forget about you you can give interviews hold press conferences everything dont worry so much youll get your chance buckleys face went red he took three steps in jakes direction gentlemen please noose interrupted this is going to be a long emotional case i expect you to act like professionals now my diary is very full the only time i have is the week of july is that a problem jake smiled at buckley and looked at his own diary looks good to me after lunch jake visited his famous client in ozzies office at the jail he told him the trial was going to start on july thats two months away why so long we need the time itll take that long to find a psychiatrist wholl say you were crazy then buckley will send you to whitfield to be seen by the states psychiatrists and theyll all say you werent crazy it takes time no way to have it sooner we dont want it sooner and if i do jake studied him carefully whats the matter big man ive got to get out of here and fast i thought you said jail wasnt so bad it aint but i need to get home gwens got no money she cant find a job lesters in trouble with his wife and i hate to ask my family for help but they will help wont they a little theyve got their own problems youve got to get me out of here jake gwen he said had less than a hundred dollars she had to pay bills and they didnt have much food she had visited on sunday and cried for an hour her family could not help much maybe some vegetables from the garden and a few dollars for milk and eggs jake looked through his notes and waited for carl lee to ask for some of his money back most of his poorer clients did but the question did not come anything you want to ask carl lee yes what can i say tomorrow when i see the judge carl lee for the moment you dont say anything remember you paid me to do the talking on the sunday morning others were thinking about carl lee hailey and his family at black churches all over clanton the buckets and baskets and plates were passed and repassed and left at the front doors to collect money for the hailey family the people who had come to pray were asked to give generously to support carl lee and his family the reverend ollie agee had organized the collection in his church and other churches across town he was very pleased that the black people of clanton were giving so much another two sundays like this and the churches would be able to start a strong movement against the nigger haters of ford county there might even be enough money to pay for a new cadillac for some valuable church workers like the reverend ollie agee carl lee hailey gave the blacks really good reasons to work together jake soon discovered that carl lee was not the only one with problems the ku klux klan had decided that it was time to show him their feelings about niggerloving lawyers several hours before the sun rose on monday morning three klan members put up a wooden cross in the front yard of jakes house on adams street and set fire to it it was a warning this scares you doesnt it jake asked his wife as they stared out in horror at the burning cross if they can do this jake carla replied slowly why not the house no case is worth this youve got to stop chapter six professional witnesses jake had no intention of dropping the case first he had to find a psychiatrist they could afford he needed to talk to lucien two days after jake phoned him lucien called ethel he asked her to tell jake to come see him it was important he had a visitor that jake needed to meet dr wt bass was a retired psychiatrist from jackson his retirement had been for the same reasons that lucien was forbidden to practice law he had a liking for whiskey that was stronger than his liking for his profession the doctor and lucien sat outside the house waiting for jake to arrive what do you want me to do asked dr bass just say he was insane was he asked the doctor thats not important what is important to give the jury a reason to say carl lee was not guilty they wont care if hes crazy or not but theyll need some reason to let him go it would be nice to examine him you can hes at the jail just waiting for someone to talk to ill need to meet with him several times i know that and if i dont think he was insane at the time of the shooting then you wont be able to speak at the trial and get your name and picture in the paper and you wont be interviewed on tv bass finished one glass and poured another he was not happy about taking the case he didnt practice now and he was frightened of making a fool of himself he knew his weaknesses what about this he waved his drink at lucien you shouldnt drink so much lucien replied keeping the smile off his face with difficulty the doctor dropped his drink and exploded in laughter he rolled out of his chair holding his stomach helpless with laughter and now youre drunk lucien said as he went into the house for another bottle when jake arrived an hour later lucien and the doctor were asleep jake walked up the steps to the house and woke lucien jake my boy how are you fine lucien i see youre doing quite well he looked at the empty bottle and one not quite empty i wanted you to meet a man lucien said trying to sit up straight who is he our psychiatrist dr bass from jackson a good friend hell help us with hailey is he a good psychiatrist the best weve worked together on several insanity cases he drinks like a fish but never during a trial thats comforting he wants to meet hailey as soon as possible tomorrow if he can the one problem today was that no one could wake dr bass to arrange the meeting jake walked down the steps toward his car listening to his former boss laugh and curse and throw pieces of ice at dr wt bass psychiatrist witness for the defense deputy de wayne looney left the hospital that afternoon and drove his wife and three children to the jail where the sheriff the other deputies and a few friends waited with a cake and small gifts he would continue to work in the office and would keep his uniform and full salary two days later carl lee hailey was taken to meet dr wilbert rodeheaver the head psychiatrist at the state hospital dr rodeheaver had been appointed by the prosecutor to see if carl lee had been insane or not when he killed the men who raped his daughter and accidentally shot deputy looney chapter seven problems for jake several legal steps were still needed before carl lees trial first jake had to ask for the trial to be moved to another part of the state although he did not win this argument he felt ok he did a good job in court and looked a lot better than rufus buckley the prosecutor the problem was that the judge then decided that there was too much publicity about the case and told both lawyers they had to stop talking to journalists he did not want the trial to be held in the newspapers and on tv outside the courthouse it hurt to say no to the reporters they followed jake across washington street where he excused himself with a no comment and escaped into his office the loss of publicity hurt even more when ethel came in to tell him the firm had big money problems since the start of the hailey case he had seen no other clients and had not been chasing those who had failed to pay him look at these she said waving a handful of bills under his nose four thousand dollars how am i supposed to pay these how much is in the bank nineteen hundred dollars nothing came in this morning nothing not a penny after ethel had complained for another five minutes about how this case was ruining the business jake lost his temper shut up ethel just shut up if you cant take the pressure then leave if you cant keep your mouth shut then youre fired youd like to fire me wouldnt you maybe i would i dont care at the moment she was a strong hard woman fourteen years with lucien had done that to her but at the moment she was clearly very unhappy im sorry she said im just worried worried about what me and bud whats wrong with bud hes a very sick man i know that his blood pressure is getting worse especially after the phone calls hes scared were both scared how many phone calls several they threaten to burn our house or blow it up they always tell us they know where we live and if hailey goes free then theyll burn it down while were asleep jake found it difficult to be sympathetic to ethel there were other things on his mind his wife wanted him to drop this case he knew that the bank would not lend him any more money the ku klux klan were threatening both him and his secretary and now he could not talk to the newspapers and get the publicity he needed so badly the ford county ku klux klan had its first meeting at midnight on thursday july in a field in a forest somewhere in the northern part of the county the six new members stood nervously in front of the enormous burning cross and repeated strange words after the leader an armed guard stood quietly down the road sometimes looking at the ceremony but mainly watching for uninvited guests there were none at exactly midnight the six fell to their knees and closed their eyes as white cloths were placed over their heads they were klansmen now these six and among them was freddie cobb brother of the dead rapist a few hours later pirtle the deputy on night duty at the sheriffs office received a phone call the caller did not give a name but he said that the klan was planning to blow up jake brigances house that night pirtle woke the sheriff and within ten minutes of the call ozzie walls and two deputies were outside jakes house they checked that there was no one around then ozzie pressed the doorbell the wooden door opened and jake looked out at the sheriff he was wearing a nightshirt that fell just below his knees and he held a loaded gun in his right hand what is it ozzie he asked can i come in yes whats going on stay outside and wait for me ozzie told the deputies ozzie closed the front door behind them and turned off the light they sat in the dark livingroom overlooking the front yard ozzie told jake what the klan were planning to do and told him to get his wife and daughter out of town as soon as he could jake had never moved so fast in his life within fifteen minutes carla and their daughter were in the car and driving to a neighbors house ozzie jake and the deputies sat outside in the dark waiting for the klan to come they didnt have to wait long ozzie saw him first a man walking down the street in his hand he carried a box a suitcase of some sort ozzie took out his handgun and stick and watched the man walk directly toward him suddenly the figure ran across the yard next door and to the side of jakes house he carefully laid the small suitcase under jakes bedroom window as he turned to run ozzies police stick crashed across the side of his head tearing his right ear into two pieces he screamed and fell to the ground whats your name ozzie demanded the man said nothing i asked you a question ozzie said pirtle and nesbit stood beside him guns ready too frightened to speak or move i aint speaking came the reply ozzie raised the stick high over his head and brought it down on the mans right ankle they could all hear the bone crack he screamed and ozzie kicked him in the face he fell backward and his head hit the side of the house jake looked at the suitcase and then put his ear next to it he jumped back its ticking he said weakly ozzie bent over the man and laid the police stick softly against his nose ive got one more question before i break every bone in your body whats in the case no answer ozzie pulled back the stick and broke the mans other ankle whats in the case he shouted dynamite came the reply ozzie tied the man to a gas pipe next to the window he carefully lifted the suitcase by the handle and placed it neatly between the mans broken legs ozzie kicked both legs to spread them ozzie the deputies and jake backed away slowly and watched him the man began to cry i dont know how to stop it he said youd better learn fast jake said give me some light and i need both hands he said try it with one ozzie said they waited on the other side of the street saying little listening for any unusual noise after about fifteen minutes the man shouted and they ran back across the front yard the empty suitcase had been thrown a few feet away next to the man was a neat pile of twelve sticks of dynamite between his legs was a large roundfaced clock with wires connected to it ozzie bent down and removed the clock and the wires he did not touch the dynamite where are your friends no answer he took out his stick again and moved closer to the man im going to start breaking bones one at a time youd better start talking now where are your friends no answer ozzie stood and quickly looked around not at jake and the deputies but at the house next door seeing nothing he raised the stick the mans left arm was still tied to the gas pipe and ozzie hit him just above the elbow the man screamed and pulled to the left jake almost felt sorry for him where are they ozzie demanded no answer jake turned his head as the sheriff hit the man again where are they no answer ozzie raised the stick stop please stop the man shouted where are they down that way about two streets get the cars ozzie ordered two hours later jake was in the sheriffs office his wife and daughter were already on a plane to the town where carlas parents lived five hundred miles away carla had returned to the house to pack but had not spoken a word to him there was no doubt that she blamed him for the danger they had all been in jake was happy that his family was alive but still shook when he thought about what nearly happened he smiled at ozzie you play rough dont you only when i have to i didnt hear you object no i wanted to help what about his friend we found him sleeping in a red pickup about a half a mile from your house where is he hospital same room as the other my god ozzie did you break his legs too jake my friend he did not cooperate with the police we had to encourage him chapter eight the research assistant after talking with ozzie walls jake went to luciens house he was lonely and unhappy he had financial problems his wife and child had gone he had not slept for twentyfour hours when lucien offered him a beer he drank it quickly and accepted another and then another by the end of the afternoon he was drunk by the end of the evening he was unconscious the next day he woke with the worst headache he had ever had in his life he was not a man who drank a lot in fact the last time he had felt like this was when he was a law student he way the felt now reminded him of the many reasons why he did not like to drink later in the morning jake was sitting at his desk looking out at the courthouse he still had a bad headache and could not work now he had to start to prepare for the most important case of his life with no money in the bank a drunk law partner a drunk psychiatrist and this headache he was still sitting there when he heard someone knocking at the door downstairs he ignored it for fifteen minutes but whoever it was knew that he was there he walked to the window and looked out who is it he shouted at the street a woman stepped back from the sidewalk under the window and leaned on a black bmw parked next to the saab her hands were deep in the pockets of old wellfitting jeans the midday sun lit up her goldred hair are you jake brigance she asked yes what do you want i need to talk to you im very busy its very important i just need five minutes of your time jake unlocked the door she walked in and shook his hand im ellen roark he pointed to a seat by the door nice to meet you sit down jake sat on the edge of ethels desk one sound or two i beg your pardon she had a quick northeastern accent but you could also hear she had spent some time in the south is it rork or row ark roark thats rork in boston and row ark in mississippi mind if i call you ellen please do and can i call you jake yes please good i hadnt planned to call you mr

judge noose hates women lawyers so does every male lawyer in the south besides im not a lawyer im a law student ill let you explain that to him so ive got the job yes youve got the job i could use some free research these cases are complicated she gave a beautiful confident smile when do i start after he had shown her round the office it was time for lunch so jake took ellen roark with him to the coffee shop as they ate he looked across at her her face was gentle and pleasant with an easy smile she was not beautiful but she was intelligent and amazingly attractive for the first time in two days jake began to think he might live they talked about his plans for the defense jake asked her how she would do it well from what i hear our client carefully planned the killings and shot them in cold blood six days after the rape it sounds exactly like he knew what he was doing insanity is our only defense and it sounds impossible to prove are you familiar with the insanity defense jake asked yes do we have a psychiatrist we do and we dont hell say anything we want him to say that is if hes not drunk at the trial one of your more difficult jobs will be to make sure that he isnt it wont be easy believe me i love new experiences in the courtroom all right row ark take a pen your boss is now going to give you instructions she began making notes on the paper tablecloth chapter nine preparations in early july judge noose instructed jean the court clerk to contact one hundred and fifty voters as possible jury members the defense had asked for a large number from which to select the twelve and noose agreed jean and two deputy clerks spent saturday studying the list of voters selecting possible people noose also told jean that she must not give the list to anyone not even her old friend jake brigance this trial was too important to give the klan a chance to start frightening possible jurors or to let the lawyers start choosing the jurors before the day of jury selection however judge noose did not know about harry rex vonners ability to get hold of information at ten oclock the next day harry rex pushed open the door of jakes office and threw a copy of the jury list onto his desk dont ask he said beside each name he had made notes dont know hates niggers or works at the shoe factory probably against carl lee jake read each name slowly trying to remember faces or the kind of person they were there were only names no addresses ages jobs most of the names sounded white what do you think asked harry rex hard to tell mostly white but we expected that where did you get this i already said dont ask i know twentysix names thats the best i can do youre a true friend harry rex im a prince are you ready for the trial not yet but ive found a secret weapon what youll meet her later as they finished their conversation ellen roark came into the office good morning row ark jake said i want you to meet a good friend harry rex vonner harry rex shook her hand and looked her up and down he clearly thought she was very attractive nice to meet you what was your first name call her row ark jake said shell clerk here until the hailey trials finished thats nice said harry rex still looking at ellen not at jake harry rex is a local lawyer row ark and one of the many you cannot trust what did you hire a female law clerk for jake he asked row arks brilliant in criminal law like most thirdyear law students and shes very cheap do you have something against females sir ellen asked no maam i love females ive married four of them she looked at his big dirty shoes the cheap socks that had dropped around his ankles his dirty cotton trousers his old dark bluejacket his pink wool tie that fell a long way above his fat stomach and she said to jake i think hes sweet i might make you wife number five harry rex said the attraction is purely physical she said careful jake said theres been no sex in this office since lucien left hows the research there are dozens of insanity cases and theyre all very long ive done about half i planned to work on the others here harry rex moved toward the door nice meeting you row ark ill see you around thanks harry rex said jake see you soon three miles from jakes office was a small neat white country house where ethel and bud twitty had lived for almost forty years it was a pleasant house with pleasant memories of raising children who were now living in the north the house was quieter now bud hadnt worked for years not since his first illness in when he had had a heart attack followed by two more he knew that he would not live long and he had accepted the fact on monday night he sat on the front porch listening to the football game on the radio ethel was working in the kitchen toward the end of the ball game he heard a noise he turned the sound down on the radio probably just a dog then another noise he stood and looked toward the garden suddenly an enormous figure in black with red white and black war paint across his face jumped onto the porch and pulled bud to the ground buds shout for help was not heard in the kitchen another man joined the first one and they pulled the old man down the steps and into the garden one held him and the other hit him in the stomach and face within seconds he was unconscious ethel heard noises and ran through the front door she was caught by a third member of the gang who twisted her arm violently behind her and put his hand over her mouth she couldnt scream or talk or move and was held there watching the two men beat her husband on the sidewalk ten feet behind the violence stood three figures each wearing the white klan robes they came out of the darkness and watched the beating after an impossibly long horrible minute the beating slowed down enough said the white figure in the middle the men left and ethel ran down the steps and held her unconscious husband in her arms jake left the hospital after midnight bud was still alive but he had suffered another serious heart attack as well as the broken bones ethel had shouted and screamed at jake blaming him for everything you said there was no danger she screamed its all your fault jake had looked around the small waiting room at the friends and relatives all eyes were on him yes they seemed to say it was all his fault carl lee hailey and his wife were angry too gwen had no money to pay her bills and carl lee had no money to pay for his defense but they had heard that reverend agee had collected over six thousand dollars from black churchgoers to help carl lee why had they not received any of the money yet they demanded jake had arranged a meeting with reverend agee after gwen visited his office to ask for help with the bills she could no longer pay he had telephoned the reverend and asked him to come to his office to talk about the defense ozzie walls had brought carl lee across the square too reverend agee had tried to frighten carl lee to tell him he was ungrateful the church was keeping the money for any future defense ozzie helped the reverend to see that he was making a mistake i agree with carl lee and gwen reverend agee you aint done right and you know it that hurts ozzie coming from you it really hurts let me tell you whats going to hurt a lot more than that next sunday carl lee and i will be in your church carl lee will do the talking hell tell all your people that the money theyve given so generously has not left your pocket that gwen and the children are going to lose their house because youre keeping the money people gave hell tell them that you lied to them he may talk for an hour or so when hes finished ill say a few words ill tell them what a lying dishonest nigger you are ill tell them about the time you bought that stolen car in memphis for a hundred dollars and almost got sent to jail ill tell them about the money you get from the funeral business and reverend ill tell dont say it ozzie agee begged ill tell them a dirty little secret that only you and me and a certain woman of bad character know about when do you want the money as soon as you can get it carl lee demanded ozzie could be very persuasive sometimes the klan were also making preparations at around nine oclock that evening they met to discuss their next steps they would have a big march at the beginning of the trial and like jake had been able to get a copy of the list of possible jurors they planned to visit a few and make sure that they remembered their duty to protect the interests of the white race later that same evening at luciens house jake ellen harry rex and lucien sat round the table on the porch lucien at the head of the table went through the jury list commenting on every name he recognized he was drunker than normal chapter ten the jury during the seven days before the trial the people of clanton began to feel they were living in a foreign country first there were the bus loads of black people who arrived and set up a camp outside the courthouse their leader the reverend agee told the reporters that they would stay until justice was done and carl lee was freed the crowd began to shout free carl lee free carl lee after the blacks came the klan they arrived in groups of two and three and came from all over the state their leader stamp sisson was pleased he drank some whiskey as he checked their dress he was proud of his men and told them so this was the biggest meeting of its kind in years he said the march could be dangerous he explained niggers could march and scream all day long and no one cared but if whites tried to march it was dangerous the niggers could do what they liked but not white people few people in clanton had ever seen the klan march and as pm approached a great wave of excitement went around the square the shopkeepers and their customers came out to watch and a group of young blacks gathered under a large tree ozzie smelled trouble but they told him they had only come to watch and listen the klan moved slowly in their white robes and tall pointed masks stump walked proudly in front of his men leading them down the long sidewalk to the center of the square by the courthouse steps you niggers were not invited to this meeting stump screamed into the microphone pointing at the blacks on the grass this is a klan meeting not a meeting for niggers as he started to speak the black people who had gathered around the square started to shout free carl lee free carl lee shut up you wild niggers stump screamed back shut up you animals his men stood facing him with their backs to the screaming crowd ozzie and six deputies moved between the groups as the photographers and tv reporters moved in circles trying to record everything that was happening no one noticed a small window on the third floor of the courthouse it opened slowly and from the darkness a firebomb was thrown it landed perfectly at stumps feet and exploded immediately the klan leaders long white robe went up in flames stump sisson was having his five minutes of fame the violence which followed the firebomb was the worst there had ever been in the small town blacks and whites fought with their hands sticks and knives not stopping until ozzie walls and his deputies fired their guns in the air when things became quieter ozzie went to the town hall he asked the leader of the town council to contact the governor he wanted the national guard to be called in as sheriff he felt the situation was out of control and he needed the army to help keep order clanton had seen nothing like it before jake ellen roark harry rex and lucien spent the rest of the week preparing for the trial they had two main jobs the first was to find the people who would make the best jury for carl lee they studied the list of names again and again trying to decide which ones to choose they knew that buckley would look for an allwhite jury that would find carl lee guilty they needed to get some black people on the jury but they also knew it would be difficult because there were so few blacks in clanton the second job was to prepare carl lees insanity defense this was ellens responsibility by the end of the week jake knew the names and life histories of every person on the jury list and ellen had given him a thick file which contained everything he needed to present a strong insanity defense he knew that he should feel confident but he became more and more nervous as the first day of the trial came nearer maybe it was the burning crosses that the klan had put outside the houses of twenty of the people whose names were on the jury list maybe it was the late nights he was spending with lucien harry rex and ellen and the large amounts of alcohol they all seemed to be drinking maybe it was just the fact that this was the biggest most important trial he had ever worked on that he had very little money that his wife and daughter had had to leave town and that his wife was still not speaking to him on the morning of monday july the day they were going to choose the jury jake woke up in his office before the sun feeling terrible after another late night and too much whiskey harry rex came early with breakfast jake could not eat his so harry rex ate for the two of them ellen arrived a little later dressed in a dark gray suit harry rex told her that it was the first time she looked like a lawyer as the sun rose the national guard started to move around the court building soldiers stood at each corner of the courthouse square watching the groups of reporters black people and klan members who had started to arrive as soon as they saw the white masks the black people started to shout free carl lee free carl lee the klan replied by screaming back fry carl lee fry carl lee soldiers carrying guns ran across the square and stood between the two groups by the time the buses carrying the possible jury members arrived jake felt terrible when he was still a young lawyer lucien had told him to make friends with fear because it would never go away lucien had also said that the jury always listened to a lawyer who was brave enough to be himself jake knew about the fear but was not sure if he wanted to be himself his head ached too much how are you boss ellen asked ready i guess well leave in a minute there are some reporters waiting outside i told them you had dropped the case and left town wouldnt that be nice jury selection was a long and complicated process one hundred and fourteen people had been asked to do their duty as citizens the twenty who had had a burning cross in their yards were told that they need not stay that left ninetyfour names each lawyer then had the right to interview each juror buckley began with a list of a thousand questions when noose stopped him at five oclock he had still not finished he said he would finish in the morning the next day the sun rose quickly a morning mist hung over the ground wetting the boots of the soldiers outside the courthouse by the time breakfast was served the day was already hot and the soldiers had taken off their jackets and stood around in their pale green undershirts the black church leaders and their followers returned to their part of the square and the klansmen kept together on their side it was am of day two jake had a difficult job to do after buckleys threehour questioning the day before his first question showed that he wanted to simplify things ladies and gentlemen do any of you believe that the insanity defense should not be used in a murder trial the possible jurors looked at each other but no hands went up insanity insanity the seed had been planted if we prove that carl lee hailey was legally insane when he shot billy ray cobb and pete willard is there a person here who cannot find him not guilty the question was hard to follow that was the way jake wanted it again there were no hands a few wanted to answer but they were not sure how to jake looked at them carefully he knew that most of them were confused but he also knew that for this moment every possible juror was thinking about his client being insane he would leave them there thank you he said with all the charm he could manage i have no more questions buckley looked confused he stared at the judge is that all noose asked is that all mr brigance yes sir these citizens look fine to me jake said the group was not at all acceptable to jake too white too many women but there was no sense repeating the same questions buckley had asked now that the list of possible jurors had been agreed the next stage of jury selection could begin judge noose and the lawyers left the courtroom and sat at the table in the judges office noose looked at his numbered list and then looked at his lawyers gentlemen are you ready good since this is a murder case each of you has the right to refuse to accept twelve of the jurors mr buckley you must now give a list of twelve jurors to the defense please start with juror number one and refer to each juror only by number as they worked through the selection process it became clear that jakes worst fears were coming true buckley repeatedly suggested white jurors who were clearly against carl lee jake could not say no to them all twelve was the limit so he found himself accepting people he knew would be against his client and each time jake offered one of the few jurors he really wanted buckley refused him or her the numbers were on buckleys side for every juror that jake thought might be good for carl lee buckley had ten who would be against him when the last juror had been chosen judge noose and the lawyers returned to their places his honor called the names of the twelve and they slowly nervously made their way to the jury box ten women two men all white the blacks in the courtroom looked at each other in disbelief did you pick that jury carl lee asked jake stump sisson died on tuesday night at the burns hospital in memphis four people had now died as a result of the rape of tonya hailey cobb willard bud twitty and now sisson when the klan members met in the woods that evening they wanted revenge stump sisson would be remembered around midnight jake walked up and down his office and gave his opening speech for the hundredth time ellen listened she had listened objected criticized and argued for two hours she was tired now he did it perfectly when he finished they went to the window and watched the lights being held by the blacks sitting in the darkness of the square they could hear laughter from the card games in the soldiers tents there was no moon chapter elven the trial begins the bus arrived at the courthouse five minutes before nine the jurors looked out through darkened windows to see how many blacks and how many klansmen were waiting and how many national guard soldiers when judge noose was ready to start they were led into the courtroom and then into the jury box rufus buckley as prosecutor had the right to speak first and he clearly intended to enjoy every minute he started by thanking the jurors for being there as if they had a choice thought jake he said he was proud to be working with them in this most important case jake sat and listened it was all garbage and he had heard it before but it still annoyed him because the jury sometimes believed it then buckley started to talk about the rape and how terrible it was he said that he was a father too in fact he had a daughter the same age as tonya hailey but that no one could take the law into their own hands jake smiled quickly at ellen this was interesting buckley had chosen to talk about the rape instead of keeping it from the jury jake had been expecting a problem with buckley when it came to this topic normally it would not be accepted as evidence during a murder trial especially the more unpleasant details but now buckley had introduced the subject so he was not going to be able to object when jake told the jury about what the murdered men had done and how the rape had destroyed tonyas life and the life of carl lee hailey the next mistake that buckley made was to speak for too long although he had started with the jury on his side by the end they were bored and finding it difficult to stay awake jake was winning the first argument without saying a word jake had already planned a short opening speech and after buckleys effort he decided to make it even shorter he only spoke for fourteen minutes and the jury liked every word he began by talking about daughters and how special they are he told them about his own daughter and the special relationship that exists between father and daughter he started to tell them how he would feel if she was raped by two drunk drugged animals who tied her to a tree and objection shouted buckley sustained noose shouted back jake ignored the shouting and continued softly he asked the jury to try to imagine through the whole trial how they would feel if it was their daughter he asked them not to find carl lee guilty but to send him home to his family he didnt talk about insanity yet they knew it was coming he finished shortly after he started and left the jury with a strong sense of the difference between the two lawyers is that all noose asked in surprise well then mr buckley you may call your first witness the state calls nora cobb the mother of the murdered rapist sat in the witness box and listened to rufus buckley as he asked her where she lived and what had happened on the day her son billy ray cobb was killed as nora cobb told her stoiy she started to cry she was not a witness who could do much damage to carl lee and normally jake would not ask her any questions but then he saw an opportunity he could not miss he could wake up judge noose and start making the jury think about what people like billy ray cobb were really like he also felt that nora cobbs tears were the result of good acting not deep regret just a few questions jake said as he stood up mrs cobb is it true that your son sold drugs objection buckley shouted jumping to his feet the criminal record of the victim cannot be mentioned in court sustained mrs cobb wiped her eyes and started to cry harder you say your son was twentythree when he died in his twentythree years how many other children did he rape objection objection shouted buckley again waving his arms and looking desperately at judge noose sustained sustained mr brigance you cannot ask these questions mrs cobb burst into tears and the sound of her crying filled the shocked courtroom but jake had made his point the jury would now remember the sort of man billy ray cobb had been the next witness was earnestine willard the mother of the other victim she was less of an actress than mrs cobb but rufus buckley asked her the same questions he had asked the first witness and brought the same tears to her eyes when he had finished jake stood up mrs willard im jake brigance he stood in front of her and looked at her without pity how old was your son when he died twentyseven buckley pushed his chair from the table and sat on its edge ready to jump up noose removed his glasses and leaned forward during his twentyseven years how many other children did he rape buckley immediately shouted objection objection objection sustained sustained sustained the shouting frightened mrs willard and she cried louder but once again jake had made his point ozzie was the first state witness after lunch buckley questioned him first asking him to repeat exactly what had happened on the day of the murder he then showed ozzie the gun that carl lee had used and asked him to say if this was the one he had found near the bodies to finish he then brought out a set of color photographs of the murder victims some taken so close you could see how the bullets had broken through the skin and bone rufus buckley made the jury members look at each picture pointing out the horror of the way the two men had died he wanted them to remember the violence of what carl lee had done jake looked at his notes as he walked across the courtroom he had just a few questions for his friend sheriff did you put billy ray cobb and pete willard in jail yes i did answered the sheriff for what reason for the rape of tonya hailey and how old was she at the time of the rape she was ten is it true sheriff that pete willard signed a written document saying that he had raped tonya hailey objection objection your honor we cant discuss this case and mr brigance knows it ozzie had already said yes sustained please ignore the last question from mr brigance noose told the jury no further questions said jake the next two witnesses gave technical evidence to show that carl lee hailey had as everyone knew killed cobb and willard again buckley bored the jury by going into great detail and asking long and complicated questions the jury members were becoming increasingly tired of the sound of his voice when it was jakes turn to ask questions he said that he had none the second day of the trial started in the same way with the jurors in their seats by nine oclock rufus buckley brought in his next witness the doctor who had examined cobb and willards bodies again buckley talked too long and asked too many questions no one was denying that cobb and willard had been killed with an m or that carl lee had killed them so why spend so much time on it the jury members were bored and the judge spent a lot of time cleaning his glasses in order to stay awake once again when it came to jakes turn he looked at the judge and said i have no questions judge noose and the jurors all smiled it was becoming clear which lawyer they preferred but buckley still didnt seem to understand what he was doing wrong the last witness was officer de wayne looney buckley had chosen him to speak last as a way of reminding the jury of the damage carl lee had done looney walked into the courtroom with difficulty leaning on a stick buckley asked deputy looney his age where he worked and who he took to the courthouse on monday may he then asked what had happened when he had taken the men out of the court deputy looney described how he had led the prisoners out of the court and how suddenly carl lee had come out of a side room then what happened asked buckley when cobb was near to the foot of the stairs the shooting started i was waiting to go on down i didnt see anybody for a second then i saw mr hailey with the machine gun cobb was blown backward into willard and they both screamed and fell down trying to get back up to where i was yes sir please describe what you saw you could hear the bullets coming off the walls and hitting everywhere it was the loudest gun i ever heard what happened to you i never got down the stairs i think one of the bullets came off the wall and caught me in the leg and what happened to your leg they cut it off he answered softly just below the knee did you get a good look at the man with the gun yes sir it was mr hailey the man sitting over there that answer was a good place to stop asking questions but buckley then took out large plans of the courthouse and arranged them in front of the jury so that looney could walk around and show his bad leg jake rubbed his forehead and noose cleaned and recleaned his glasses the jurors moved around in their chairs buckley had lost them again any questions mr brigance noose asked at last just a few questions officer looney who was carl lee looking at when he was shooting those boys i think did he ever look at you i dont think so so he didnt aim the gun at you oh no sir he just aimed at those boys hit them too what did he do when he was shooting he just screamed and laughed like a crazy man it was the strangest thing i ever heard with all the noise the gun firing the bullets whistling the boys screaming as they got hit over all that noise i could hear him laughing that crazy laugh thats what ill always remember the answer was so perfect that jake had to fight off a smile he and looney had worked on it a hundred times and it was a thing of beauty every word was perfect jake looked through his notes and then looked up at the jurors they were all waiting for the next question jake wrote something down and then looked carefully at looney just to make the silence last a few more seconds now deputy looney carl lee hailey shot you in the leg yes sir he did do you think he meant to no sir it was an accident i do not want to see him punished for the shooting sir i have no bad feelings about the man i would do the same buckley dropped his pen and sat back in his chair he looked sadly at his star witness what do you mean by that jake asked i mean i dont blame him for what he did those boys raped his little girl ive got a little girl if somebody raped her id kill him just like carl lee did we should give him a prize do you want the jury to find carl lee guilty buckley jumped and shouted objection he cant ask that question no looney shouted i dont want him to be found guilty hes a hero dont answer mr looney noose said loudly dont answer hes a hero set him free looney shouted at buckley order order noose banged his table buckley was silent looney was silent jake walked to his chair and said he had no other questions looney smiled at the jury and walked slowly and painfully from the courtroom chapter twelve a crazy world jake awoke in the darkness to the sound of his doorbell he opened the front door in his nightshirt and found ozzie and deputy nesbit waiting for him what is it he asked as he opened the door theyre going to kill you today ozzie said who the klan how do you know the same man who told us about the dynamite he calls himself mickey mouse he telephoned yesterday and said youre the lucky man today is the big day thats why were here were coming to the office with you were staying with you all day at fivethirty they drove jake to his office and locked the door at eight a group of soldiers was waiting on the sidewalk harry rex and ellen watched from the second floor of the courthouse jake walked between ozzie and nesbit the three of them in the middle of the group of soldiers the klans man sat with his gun in his hands at a window in an old empty factory two blocks north and east of the square from his position he had a clear view of the back of the courthouse he sat in the darkness and aimed through a small opening knowing that no one in the world could see him another klan member waited in a pickup down the road the engine was running and the driver sat smoking waiting for the sound of the gun when he saw the group of soldiers move away from jakes office the gunman did not know what to do he could only see the top of jakes head in a sea of green army hats he could not be sure of hitting jake but the whiskey he had been drinking made him want some excitement he aimed and fired hoping for the best when they heard the sound of the gun the soldiers ran toward the courthouse pulling jake down with them one soldier screamed in pain holding his throat another shot then another hes hit someone shouted jake ran through the doors to the safety of the building he fell onto the floor and put his head in his hands ozzie stood next to him watching the soldiers through the door the gunman ran out of the factory and threw his weapon behind the back seat of the pickup the two men drove out of town they were going to a funeral in south mississippi the soldier had been standing by jakes left shoulder when he was hit this is kind of silly aint it he had just said to jake when the bullet shot through his throat he fell against jake holding his neck losing blood fast and screaming hes dead isnt he jake asked ozzie softly hes dead i know hes dead i heard his neck break they heard later that the soldier did not die but he was not going to be able to walk again jake managed with difficulty to persuade the judge that the trial could wait for another twenty four hours he stayed in the office with harry rex and ellen roark after he had phoned his wife to tell her he was unhurt he sat with his friends talking too much and drinking too much dr bass joined them later in the day and then lester hailey arrived with lucien lucien bought more drinks and by the end of the afternoon jake was drunk enough to fall asleep on the floor ellen slept on the sofa in jakes office when ellen woke up the room was dark and empty and smelled of alcohol she moved around carefully and found her boss peacefully sleeping on the floor in the conference room it was ten oclock she had slept five hours she could stay at luciens house but needed to change clothes she locked the front door and walked to her car ellen had almost arrived at oxford when she saw the blue lights behind her as usual she was driving at seventyfive miles an hour she parked at the side of the road got out of the car and waited for the police two men approached from the blue lights suddenly she was knocked to the ground a heavy blanket was thrown over her and both men held her down a rope was tied around her chest and waist she kicked and swore but could do little to help herself one of them removed her keys from the car and opened the trunk they threw her inside and banged it shut one of the men then took the blue lights off their car and drove away followed by the other in ellens bmw they found a side road and followed it deep into the woods then turned off the road into a small field where a large cross was being burned by a number of ku klux klan members the two men quickly put on their white robes and masks they pulled her out of the trunk and threw her to the ground they tied her arms and legs placed a cloth over her mouth and dragged her to a large pole a few feet from the cross they tied her to the pole with her back to the klan members the burning cross lit the field as the heat from the fire started to burn her she struggled with the ropes but she couldnt loosen them she started to make strange crying noises deep in her throat a masked figure left the others and approached her she could hear his footsteps and then felt his breath on her face you niggerlover he said in an educated midwestern voice he pulled the collar of her shirt and tore it from her back he pulled down the zipper on her skirt and then took out a large knife cut the skirt and underclothes from top to bottom and pulled them from around her she tried to kick but the heavy rope around her ankles held her feet to the pole see what happens to niggerlovers he said quietly how do you like it the fire was hot now her red hair was wet around her neck and shoulders one of the others handed the man a long whip he moved it up and down quickly making it crack then he walked backward carefully measuring the distance to the pole he brought the whip up in the air and aimed at her back but the tallest klan leader stepped forward and raised his hand to stop the arm from coming down nothing was said but the whip was put away the man walked back to her and cut her hair with his knife until the skin of her head could be seen ugly and bleeding she made quiet crying sounds but did not move the klan members moved away to their cars a can of gasoline was poured inside the bmw with massachusetts numbers and somebody threw a match the car burned very quickly when he was certain they were gone the man ozzie called mickey mouse came out from the bushes he untied her and carried her away from the field he tried to cover her with what was left of her clothes he then drove to oxford to a pay phone and called the county sheriff jake woke with another headache but he knew that he had to go to court and face the world again when he got into court judge noose asked him how he was feeling he said he felt better than the soldier who got hit jakes first witness was the psychiatrist dr wt bass jake was pleased that he did not look drunk he looked good in an expensive suit and white shirt he even sounded good as jake led him through a long series of questions about his qualifications and his experience as a psychiatrist then buckley got up to ask some questions he asked how many books dr bass had written none he asked how many hospitals he worked in none he asked how many patients the doctor saw a few as the questions continued dr bass began to look less good and jake felt more worried jake returned to the list of questions in his note book he asked dr bass when and how often he had examined carl lee hailey he asked about carl lees experience in vietnam and the effect it had had on him carl lee listened carefully the doctor was sounding good again jake then asked him about the rape and dr bass explained how carl lee had been unbalanced by the rape how he had stopped being himself then when he visited his daughter in hospital she told him how she had called for him in the woods she thought she saw him but he didnt come she continued calling but the men told her she had no father now dr bass then answered questions about the insanity defense and the mnaghten rule on which it was based bass explained that the rule went back to england in when daniel mnaghten tried to kill a politician called sir robert peel he did not succeed but accidentally shot and killed the politicians secretary during his trial it became clear that mnaghten was insane and the jury decided that he was not guilty by reason of insanity from this the mnaghten rule was made and it is still followed in england and sixteen us states what does the mnaghten rule really mean jake asked well its fairly simple to use insanity as a defense you must prove that the person did what he or she did because they had a mental disease or that they did not know the nature and quality of what they were doing can you simplify that yes if someone cannot tell the difference between right and wrong he or she is legally insane this is what happened to carl lee hailey after the rape he expected someone to kill the rapists he couldnt understand why it did not happen he didnt know what else to do he had to kill them jake let the jury think about these words now dr bass do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether carl lee hailey was able to know the difference between right and wrong when he shot these men i have and what is that opinion because of his mental condition he was unable to tell right from wrong thank you doctor jake picked up his note book and walked back to his seat he looked at lucien who was smiling and at the jury they were watching bass and thinking about what he had said wanda wornack a young kindlooking woman looked at jake and smiled it was the most positive signal he had received from the jury since the trial started pretty good carl lee said quietly judge noose asked buckley if he had any questions just a few buckley said as he walked to the front of the courtroom dr bass what is your full name jake froze there was something wrong about the question william tyler bass what name are you generally known by wt bass have you ever been known as tyler bass the medical witness hesitated no he said jake felt a sudden fear in his stomach the question could only mean trouble youre telling this jury that on october in dallas texas you were not found guilty of a crime under the name of tyler bass thats a lie bass said quietly are you sure its a lie buckley asked do you know a lie from the truth dr bass do you know the difference between right and wrong because dr bass ive got some photographs of you taken by the dallas police department on september when you were charged with the rape of a yearold girl the silence in the room was complete wt bass could only look at the ground he knew that there was nothing he could say no one would believe him we have no further questions for the defenses medical witness buckley said a speech was needed a brilliant emotional explanation that would touch the hearts of the jurors and make them cry with pity for bass and for carl lee but jake could think of nothing to say he wanted to be sick everything had fallen to pieces buckley had destroyed his medical witness and had destroyed the insanity defense he had tried to build and it was all jakes fault he thought he was so clever he thought he would win and he had chosen a medical witness who was a drunk and a rapist nothing could help carl lee now dr bass walked out of the courtroom but no one watched him go mr brigance you may call your next witness jake tried to stand up but his legs felt like water as he stood up ozzie came to his rescue the sheriff approached the clerk of the court and gave him a message the clerk handed this to the judge who read it and then looked up and said that the court would take a break for an hour he asked the lawyers to come to his office as soon as they were in the room ozzie turned and spoke to jake jake i have some bad news i got a call an hour ago from the sheriff of lafayette county your law clerk ellen roark is in hospital jake had thought that things could not get worse it seemed that they could what happened the klan got her last night somewhere between here and oxford they tied her to a tree how is she jake asked shell be ok what happened buckley asked we aint sure they stopped her car somehow and took her out in the woods cut her clothes off her and cut her hair shes got cuts on the head so they think she was beaten jake needed to be sick he couldnt speak the judge looked at him and said theyd better take a break until two oclock at the end of the afternoon jake walked slowly up the front steps to his office he wanted to kill wt bass to break the head of the socalled friend who had introduced him to the drunk psychiatrist lucien was there holding a drink they said nothing lucien looked away then he spoke in an unusually quiet voice you should know that according to bass the girl was seventeen and the daughter of a judge in dallas they fell in love but got caught on the judges sofa the judge had big political connections and got bass arrested for rape but they were in love so before he got put in prison he married her she had a perfect baby boy the first grandchild the judge dropped the rape charge and bass didnt have to go to prison lucien drank and watched the lights from the square what happened to the girl asked jake according to bass a week before he finished medical school his wife and the little boy were killed in a train accident in fort worth thats when he started drinking and stopped living jake looked out of the window there was nothing to say hows row ark lucien asked they say shell be ok i called her room and a nurse said she couldnt talk ill go over tomorrow i hope shes ok shes a fine girl said lucien i feel like its my fault lucien its not your fault its a crazy world jake full of crazy people right now i think half of them are in ford county jake stayed at the office that night talking to lucien he fell asleep on the sofa but was woken at midnight by deputy nesbit shouting get up jake youve got to go home its an emergency jake jumped to his feet and followed nesbit adams street was blocked by fireengines parked in front of jakes house the firefighters worked desperately directing jets of water at the center of the fire jake saw ozzie standing near a police car with the fire chief the fire was brilliant flames came from every window across the front of the house upstairs and down at the side of the house carlas car burned inside and out after watching for a minute or two as the water disappeared into the flames with no noticeable effect the fire chief said itll burn to the ground the klan had done a good job after bass and ellen roark jake thought he had hit the bottom now he began to think there was no bottom jake turned to deputy nesbit will you do something for me sure jake drive over to harry rexs and bring him back id hate him to miss this sure for two hours jake ozzie harry rex and nesbit sat on the police car and watched the fire burn it burned until morning as the sun began to appear jake thanked the firefighters he and harry rex walked through the back yard and looked at the damage oh well harry rex said its just a house would you call carla and tell her that no i think you should i think ill wait harry rex looked at his watch its about breakfast time isnt it its sunday morning harry rex nothings open ah jake im a professional i can find hot food at any time of any day the truck stop the truck stop ok and when we finish well go to oxford to check on row ark chapter thirteen the trial ends clanton returned to normal monday morning as the crowd of blacks and whites gathered in the square the soldiers were there to keep the peace the klan were louder than ever they had begun to think they might win and were pleased with the direct hit on jakes house jake felt lonely walking into the court without ellen he and harry rex had been to see her at the hospital and she was going to be ok she had been badly frightened but now she was angry and desperately wanted jake to win he did too but did not feel so confident he could still remember how sick he had felt and how he could not find anything to say when buckley had destroyed dr bass does the state have any final witness judge noose asked rufus buckley one witness your honor dr rodeheaver sat carefully in the witness chair and looked at the jury he looked like a real psychiatrist dark suit no cowboy boots buckley stood and smiled at the jury you are dr wilbert rodeheaver i am he replied buckley asked the doctor questions a million questions about his educational and professional background rodeheaver was confident relaxed prepared and he was used to being in the witness chair he gave good answers jake had no questions buckley then asked dr rodeheaver to describe his examination of carl lee hailey dr rodeheaver said that carl lee was fairly helpful and able to talk about his experience in vietnam and his family but said that he was unable to remember details of the day of the murder the doctor talked about the number of times he had met carl lee and the questions he had asked he said that it was his opinion that mr hailey had carefully planned what he did and he knew what he was doing did you know asked buckley that another psychiatrist a dr wt bass has told this jury that mr hailey was unable to recognize the difference between right and wrong and that he was insane when he murdered these two men yes i did know that do you agree with that opinion no i do not and i do not find it professionally acceptable mr hailey himself has said that he planned the murders by saying this he has shown that he was not insane he knew what he was doing and he knew right from wrong doctor what therefore is your medical opinion of the mental condition of mr hailey on the day he shot billy ray cobb peter willard and deputy dewayne looney his mental condition was normal and he could tell right from wrong thank you doctor i have no further questions any questions mr brigance noose asked a few questions your honor working from his notes jake asked dr rodeheaver a series of careful questions about the theory of psychiatry the doctor agreed that psychiatry could never be an exact science and that there would always be different opinions jake then asked how many cases dr rodeheaver had been a witness in he replied that this was the fortythird jake checked something in a file and looked at the doctor with a nasty little smile are you sure its not your fortysixth it could be yes im not certain the courtroom became still buckley looked up from his notes and watched his witness carefully fortysix times youve spoken for the state in insanity trials if you say so and fortysix times youve said that the defendant was not legally insane correct doctor im not sure well let me make it simple youve been a witness fortysix times and fortysix times it has been your opinion the defendant was not legally insane correct rodeheaver moved in his chair and for the first time looked uncomfortable im not sure youve never seen a legally insane defendant have you doctor of course i have good would you then please sir tell us the name of the defendant and where he was tried rodeheaver breathed deeply and looked at the ceiling jake looked across at the jurors they were awake and waiting for an answer i cant remember he finally said jake lifted a pile of papers and waved it at the witness is it possible doctor that the reason you cant remember is that in eleven years fortysix trials you have never spoken for the defendant i honestly cant remember can you honestly name us one trial in which you found the defendant to be legally insane im sure there are some yes or no doctor one trial the medical witness looked at buckley no my memory fails me i cannot jake walked slowly to the defense table and picked up a thick file dr rodeheaver do you remember being a witness in the trial of a man by the name of danny booker in mcmurphy county in december yes i remember that trial and you said that he was not legally insane didnt you that is correct do you remember how many psychiatrists spoke for him not exactly there were several there were three dr rodeheaver and they all said the man was legally insane how many other doctors agreed with you none if i remember correctly so it was three against one yes but what did the jury do doctor he was found not guilty by reason of insanity thank you now dr rodeheaver youre the head doctor at whitfield psychiatric hospital arent you yes and where is danny booker today rodeheaver looked desperately at buckley but then had to turn back to jake to answer the question he waited one second too long for the jury they were losing trust in him hes at whitfield isnt he jake asked i believe so rodeheaver said and is this man legally insane doctor i dont think so but you said in court that danny booker was not mad and understood what he was doing when he killed his wife the jury disagreed with you and found him not guilty and since that time he has been a patient in your hospital under your care and treated as a patient with a mental illness is that correct the jury could see that it was and jake then asked the doctor about five more cases four men and one woman in each one dr rodeheaver had said the person was not insane but in each case the jury had disagreed and now they were all in dr rodeheavers hospital jake asked how this was possible you just cant trust juries said the doctor without thinking jake looked at him with a sad smile then looked at the jury he folded his arms and allowed rodeheavers words to sink in he waited looking at the witness finally he turned to the judge i think weve heard enough from this witness your honor we have no more questions jake knew that he had destroyed buckleys medical witness there were no more witnesses it was time for the closing arguments jake talked directly to the jury he began with his biggest problem dr wt bass he apologized to the jury he asked them to believe that he would never use a man with a criminal record as a witness if he knew the facts he raised his hand and swore to them that he had not known he then asked them to think about what dr bass had said yes thirty years ago he had had sex with a girl under eighteen in texas does that mean he is lying now in this trial does that mean you cannot trust his professional opinion be fair to bass the psychiatrist forget bass the person and please be fair to his patient carl lee hailey he knew nothing of the doctors past then jake told them that the girl had become basss wife and had died with their child in a train crash mr buckley had not mentioned that he waited a moment and let them think about it and what about dr rodeheaver he asked maybe he had sex with a girl under eighteen once maybe he didnt does that make him a better or a worse psychiatrist the problem with dr rodeheaver is that although he is a highly trained doctor who treats thousands of people for all sorts of mental illnesses when crimes are involved he cannot recognize insanity they watched him listened to every word he was not loud and overconfident like buckley he was quiet he looked tired almost hurt jake asked the jury to forgive him for his lack of experience if he had made mistakes it was not his clients fault he talked about daughters he told the jury about his own daughter she was four almost five and she was the center of his world she was special she was a little girl and he had to protect her carl lee had a daughter her name was tonya he pointed to her on the front row next to her mother and brothers shes a beautiful little girl ten years old and now she can never have children she can never have a daughter objection buckley shouted sustained jake talked about rape and explained how rape is much worse than murder with murder the victim is gone and not forced to deal with what happened to her the family must deal with it but not the victim but rape is much worse the victim has a lifetime of trying to understand of asking questions and knowing the rapist may someday escape or be freed every hour of every day the victim thinks of the rape and asks herself a thousand questions she relives it step by step minute by minute and it hurts just as badly and if this happens to a child a tenyearold child imagine youre a parent how would you explain to your child why she was raped how would you explain why she cannot have children objection sustained please ignore that ladies and gentlemen what would you do asked jake what would a father do jake paused for a drink of water he changed direction now he stopped looking hurt he looked angry he talked about cobb and willard drug sellers and rapists was this country a better place without them certainly and deputy looney a man who had lost a leg thought so too he had said that they should thank carl lee for what he had done he was a hero he asked the jury to follow looneys wishes he became much quieter and said he was almost finished he wanted to leave them with one thought picture this if they could when she was lying there beaten covered in her own blood tied to two trees she had looked into the woods around her she wanted her daddy she thought he was coming but it was only a dream ladies and gentlemen he continued she needs him now as much as she needed him then please dont take him away shes waiting on the front row for her daddy let him go home to his family the courtroom was silent as jake sat down next to his client he looked at the jury and saw wanda wornack brush away a tear with her finger for the first time in two days he felt some hope at four oclock judge noose spoke to the jury he told them to get organized and get busy he told them they could discuss things until six maybe seven but if they could not make a decision he would ask them to meet again on tuesday morning they stood up and walked out no one expected a quick decision chapter fourteen guilty or not guilty the jury did not make a decision by seven oclock and judge noose instructed them to go back to their hotel and return to the court at am the next day jake went back to luciens house he had no home no wife no law clerk but at least he had some friends harry rex joined them and they sat on the porch drinking beer and eating fried potatoes they could only wait jake had done everything he could at am the next day the square in front of the courthouse was crowded again reverend agee led his people as they shouted louder and louder free carl lee free carl lee the klan shouted back fry carl lee but not as loudly as before there seemed to be fewer of them today and they did not seem so confident everyone had been talking about jakes final speech the jury arrived and began their discussion in the jury room jake and harry rex sat in the empty courtroom looking across at buckley by midday there was still no decision but the crowds outside the courthouse were getting bigger during lunch the ten thousand grew to fifteen thousand carl lee had been allowed to come into the courtroom and sit with tonya and the others at four oclock around the time when the jury had to report to the judge they walked to one of the tall windows at the front of the courtroom carl lee noticed a small handle he turned it and the windows swung open carl lee looked at the deputy beside him and stepped forward he held tonya in the air and watched the crowd they saw him they shouted his name and rushed to the building under him reverend agee led the marchers off the street and across the square a wave of black people pressed forward for a closer look at their man free carl lee free carl lee free carl lee he waved at his people below him he kissed his daughter and his sons he waved and told the children to wave too the crowd went wild judge noose asked to see the lawyers in his office he was worried buckley was angry and wanted a new trial he said that the jury could not make a fair decision with this crowd outside jake laughed at him and said that he had wanted the trial to be moved away from clanton it was too late now buckley then said that the jury should be moved to another place while they made up their minds jake brought out a pile of legal documents which showed that this could not be done they had to finish this business in clanton when the jury came in to report apart from the reporters the courtroom was solid black the klan had clearly decided it was not a good place to be the jurors looked tired and unhappy have you made a decision judge noose asked no sir replied the head of the jury do you think you will be able to make a decision if you have more time weve talked about that your honor and wed like to leave get a good nights rest and try again tomorrow were not ready to stop wednesday for the first time in weeks jake slept more than eight hours he had fallen asleep on the sofa in his office and he awoke at five to the sounds of the army getting ready for the worst he had rested but he could not stop thinking that this would probably be the big day he showered and shaved downstairs he then took a new shirt from its packet and dressed himself in luciens best dark blue suit it was too short and a bit loose but not a bad fit under the circumstances he thought about his house on adams street and how carla would feel for the first time in a week he went across to the coffee shop for breakfast the manager dell greeted him like a lost child and came and sat next to him at a corner table as the other customers arrived and saw him they stopped and shook his hand it was good to see him again they had missed him and they were on his side he looked thin dell said so he ordered most of the things on the menu it felt good to be there he stayed for an hour and talked to people then went across to his office there was nothing to do except wait he sat by the window drank coffee smoked a cigarette and watched the soldiers he thought about a quiet little southern law office with a secretary and clients waiting to see him of normal things like a family a home and church on sunday mornings maybe he should leave these big cases to others when the jury arrived at am as usual there were even more people than the day before the jurors could see nothing but a sea of black faces when their bus stopped outside the court they were scared in the jury room wanda wornack stood at the end of the table and nervously asked for attention i have a suggestion she said slowly that might help us decide this thing suddenly she had their complete attention i thought of something last night when i couldnt sleep and i want you to think about it too it may be painful it may make you search your heart and take a long look at your soul but ill ask you to do it anyway and if each of you will be honest with yourself i think we can finish before midday the only sounds came from the street below good this is what i want you to do i want you to pretend with me for a moment i want you to use your imaginations i want you to close your eyes and listen to my voice and nothing else they closed their eyes they were ready to try anything at around eleven oclock the phone rang in jakes office it rang again and lucien answered it he listened then put the phone down what is it harry rex demanded jake sat up and looked at lucien the moment had arrived the jury is ready oh my god jake said listen to me jake said lucien stay calm be careful what you say thats strange advice coming from you lucien jake replied ive learned a lot if you win be careful what you say to reporters make sure you thank the jury if you lose if you lose harry rex said run as fast as you can because those people out there will bring down the courthouse i feel weak said jake when jake entered the courtroom carl lee was already there sitting at the defense table gwen and lester had tears in their eyes the children were confused and scared judge noose came to his chair and sat down and the courtroom became totally silent there was no sound from the outside twenty thousand blacks knelt on the ground and prayed there was perfect silence inside the courtroom and out the door from the jury room opened and it seemed like an hour before the first juror came out with tears in her eyes jake dropped his head carl lee looked ahead at a painting on the wall above judge nooses seat the jurors slowly took their places they seemed scared most had been crying jake felt sick the head of the jury held a piece of paper ladies and gentlemen have you made your decision yes sir we have he answered quietly his voice shook as he spoke hand it to the clerk please she took it and handed it to his honor who studied it it is technically in order he finally said one juror was crying the only sound in the courtroom other jurors held handkerchiefs to their eyes the crying could mean only one thing to jake noose looked at carl lee will the defendant please rise jakes client stood up slowly jake closed his eyes and stopped breathing his hands shook and his stomach ached noose handed the paper back to the clerk of the court please read it madam clerk she unfolded it and faced the defendant on each of the charges against him we the jury find the defendant not guilty by reason of insanity the courtroom exploded carl lee turned and ran to where his children were sitting tonya and the boys reached forward and held him gwen screamed and burst into tears she buried her head in lesters arms people stood on the seats and shouted praise the lord jake felt nothing his only movement was a weak smile in the direction of the jury he wanted to cry but just sat at the defense table trying to smile unable to do anything else from the corner of his eye he could see buckley removing files and important looking papers and throwing them all into bags a boy ran between two deputies and out of the door shouting not guilty not guilty to the crowd waiting outside judge noose looked at the lawyers if there is nothing else this court will now close as i have heard nothing to say that mr hailey is now insane he is free to leave this court carl lee stood in the middle of his family they had their arms around him and everyone was crying and shouting praise the lord they gathered round jake and held him and said they loved him the reporters began firing questions at jake he held up his hands and said he would make no comments now but there would be a conference in his office at pm buckley left through a side door the jurors went back to the jury room to wait for the last bus ride to the hotel the reporters crowded round carl lee i just want to go home he said again and again i just want to go home after the dancing in the square outside the courthouse had ended after the thousands of happy supporters had all gone home jake harry rex and lucien went to luciens house and ate a mountain of pork and vegetables you look very silly harry rex said to jake shut up harry rex lucien said let him enjoy his finest hour hes enjoying it look at

got the chance and they voted on it all twelve said they would do the killing twelve to zero wanda said shed sit in that jury room until christmas before shed vote that carl lee was guilty and if they
