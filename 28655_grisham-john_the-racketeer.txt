john grisham the racketeer chapter i am a lawyer and i am in prison its a long story im fortythree years old and halfway through a tenyear sentence handed down by a weak and sanctimonious federal judge in washington dc all of my appeals have run their course and there is no procedure mechanism obscure statute technicality loophole or hail mary left in my thoroughly depleted arsenal i have nothing because i know the law i could do what some inmates do and clog up the courts with stacks of worthless motions and writs and other junk filings but none of this would help my cause nothing will help my cause the reality is that i have no hope of getting out for five more years save for a few lousy weeks chopped off at the end for good behavior and my behavior has been exemplary i shouldnt call myself a lawyer because technically i am not the virginia state bar swept in and yanked my license shortly after i was convicted the language is right there in black and whitea felony conviction equals disbarment i was stripped of my license and my disciplinary troubles were duly reported in the virginia lawyer register three of us were disbarred that month which is about average however in my little world i am known as a jailhouse lawyer and as such spend several hours each day helping my fellow inmates with their legal problems i study their appeals and file motions i prepare simple wills and an occasional land deed i review contracts for some of the whitecollar guys i have sued the government for legitimate complaints but never for ones i consider frivolous and there are a lot of divorces eight months and six days after i began my time i received a thick envelope prisoners crave mail but this was one package i could have done without it was from a law firm in fairfax virginia one that represented my wife who surprisingly wanted a divorce in a matter of weeks dionne had gone from being a supportive wife dug in for the long haul to a fleeing victim who desperately wanted out i couldnt believe it i read the papers in absolute shock my knees rubbery and my eyes wet and when i was afraid i might start crying i hustled back to my cell for some privacy there are a lot of tears in prison but they are always hidden when i left home bo was six years old he was our only child but we were planning more the math is easy and ive done it a million times hell be sixteen when i get out a fully grown teenager and i will have missed ten of the most precious years a father and son can have until they are about twelve years old little boys worship their fathers and believe they can do no wrong i coached bo in tball and youth soccer and he followed me around like a puppy we fished and camped and he sometimes went to my office with me on saturday mornings after a boysonly breakfast he was my world and trying to explain to him that i was going away for a long time broke both our hearts once behind bars i refused to allow him to visit me as much as i wanted to squeeze him i could not stand the thought of that little boy seeing his father incarcerated it is virtually impossible to fight a divorce when youre in prison and not getting out soon our assets never much to begin with were depleted after an eighteenmonth pounding by the federal government we had lost everything but our child and our commitment to each other the child was a rock the commitment bit the dust dionne made some beautiful promises about persevering and toughing it out but once i was gone reality set in she felt lonely and isolated in our small town people see me and they whisper she wrote in one of her first letters im so lonely she whined in another it wasnt long before the letters became noticeably shorter and further apart as did the visits dionne grew up in philadelphia and never warmed to life in the country when an uncle offered her a job she was suddenly in a hurry to go home she remarried two years ago and bo now eleven is being coached by another father my last twenty letters to my son went unanswered im sure he never saw them i often wonder if i will see him again i think i will make the effort though i vacillate on this how do you confront a child you love so much it hurts but who will not recognize you we are never going to live together again as a typical father and son would it be fair to bo to have his longlost father reappear and insist on becoming part of his life i have far too much time to think about this i am inmate number at the federal prison camp near frostburg maryland a camp is a lowsecurity facility for those of us who are deemed nonviolent and sentenced to ten years or less for reasons that were never made clear my first twentytwo months were spent at a mediumsecurity joint near louisville kentucky in the endless alphabet muck of bureauspeak it is known as an fcifederal correctional institutionand it was a far different place than my camp at frostburg an fci is for violent men sentenced to more than ten years life there is much tougher though i survived without being physically assaulted being a former marine helped immensely as far as prisons go a camp is a resort there are no walls fences razor wire or lookout towers and only a few guards with guns frostburg is relatively new and its facilities are nicer than most public high schools and why not in the united states we spend a year to incarcerate each prison inmate and to educate each elementary school student here we have counselors managers caseworkers nurses secretaries assistants of many varieties and dozens of administrators who would be hardpressed to truthfully explain how they fill their eight hours each day it is after all the federal government the employee parking lot near the front entrance is packed with nice cars and trucks there are six hundred inmates here at frostburg and with a few exceptions we are a wellbehaved group of men those with violent pasts have learned their lessons and appreciate their civilized surroundings those whove spent their lives in prison have finally found the best home many of these career boys do not want to leave they are thoroughly institutionalized and cannot function on the outside a warm bed three meals a day health carehow could they possibly top this out there on the streets im not implying this is a pleasant place it is not there are many men like me who never dreamed they would one day fall so hard men with professions careers businesses men with assets and nice families and countryclub memberships in my white gang there is carl an optometrist who tinkered too much with his medicare billings and kermit a land speculator who double and triple pledged the same properties to various banks and wesley a former pennsylvania state senator who took a bribe and mark a smalltown mortgage lender who cut some corners carl kermit wesley and mark all white average age of fiftyone all admit their guilt then theres me malcolm bannister black aged fortythree convicted of a crime i had no knowledge of committing at this moment at frostburg i happen to be the only black guy serving time for a whitecollar crime some distinction in my black gang the membership is not so clearly defined most are kids from the streets of dc and baltimore who were busted for drugrelated crimes and when they are paroled they will return to the streets with a percent chance of avoiding another conviction with no education no skills and a criminal record how are they supposed to succeed in reality there are no gangs in a federal camp and no violence if you fight or threaten someone theyll yank you out of here and send you to a place thats far worse there is a lot of bickering mainly over the television but i have yet to see someone throw a punch some of these guys have served time in state prisons and the stories they tell are horrifying no one wants to trade this place for another joint so we behave as we count the days for the whitecollar guys the punishment is humiliation and the loss of status standing a lifestyle for the black guys life in a camp is safer than where they came from and where theyre going their punishment is another notch on their criminal records another step in becoming career felons because of this i feel more white than black there are two other exlawyers here at frostburg ron napoli was a flamboyant criminal lawyer in philadelphia for many years until cocaine ruined him he specialized in drug law and represented many of the top dealers and traffickers in the midatlantic region from new jersey to the carolinas he preferred to get paid in cash and coke and eventually lost everything the irs nailed him for tax evasion and hes about halfway through a nineyear sentence rons not doing too well these days he seems depressed and will not under any circumstances exercise and try to take care of himself hes getting heavier slower crankier and sicker he used to tell fascinating stories about his clients and their adventures in narcotrafficking but now he just sits in the yard eating bag after bag of fritos and looking lost someone is sending him money and he spends most of it on junk food the third exlawyer is a washington shark named amos kapp a longtime insider and shifty operator who spent a career slinking around the edges of every major political scandal kapp and i were tried together convicted together and sentenced ten years apiece by the same judge there were eight defendantsseven from washington and me kapp has always been guilty of something and he was certainly guilty in the eyes of our jurors kapp though knew then and knows now that i had nothing to do with the conspiracy but he was too much of a coward and a crook to say anything violence is strictly prohibited at frostburg but give me five minutes with amos kapp and his neck would be broken he knows this and i suspect he told the warden a long time ago they keep him on the west campus as far away from my pod as possible of the three lawyers im the only one willing to help other inmates with their legal problems i enjoy the work its challenging and keeps me busy it also keeps my legal skills sharp though i doubt if i have much of a future as a lawyer i can apply for reinstatement to the bar when im out but that can be an arduous procedure the truth is i never made any money as a lawyer i was a smalltown practitioner black on top of that and few clients could pay a decent fee there were dozens of other lawyers packed along braddock street scrambling for the same clients the competition was rough im not sure what ill do when this is over but i have serious doubts about resuming a legal career ill be fortyeight single and in good health hopefully five years is an eternity every day i take a long walk alone on a dirt jogging trail that skirts the edges of the camp and follows the boundary or the line as it is known step over the line and youre considered an escapee in spite of being the site of a prison this is beautiful country with spectacular views as i walk and gaze at the rolling hills in the distance i fight the urge to just keep walking to step over the line there is no fence to stop me no guard to yell my name i could disappear into the dense woods then disappear forever i wish there was a wall one ten feet tall made of solid brick with coils of glistening razor wire along its top one that would keep me from gazing at the hills and dreaming of freedom this is a prison damn it we cant leave put up a wall and stop tempting us the temptation is always there and as much as i fight it i swear its getting stronger by the day chapter frostburg is a few miles west of the town of cumberland maryland in the middle of a sliver of land that is dwarfed by pennsylvania to the north and west virginia to the west and south looking at a map it is obvious this exiled part of the state was the result of a bad survey and shouldnt belong to maryland at all though its not clear who should have ownership i work in the library and on the wall above my little desk is a large map of america i spend too much time gazing at it daydreaming wondering how i came to be a federal prisoner in a remote part of farwestern maryland sixty miles south of here is the town of winchester virginia population twentyfive thousand the place of my birth childhood education career and eventually the fall i am told that little has changed there since i left the law firm of copeland amp reed is still doing business in the same storefront shop where i once worked its on braddock street in the old town next door to a diner the name painted in black on the window was once copeland reed amp bannister and it was the only allblack law firm within a hundred miles im told that mr copeland and mr reed are doing well certainly not prospering or getting rich but generating enough business to pay their two secretaries and the rent thats about all we did when i was a partner therejust manage to scrape by at the time of the fall i was having serious second thoughts about surviving in such a small town i am told that mr copeland and mr reed refuse to discuss me and my problems they came within an inch of being indicted too and their reputations were tarnished the us attorney who nailed me was blasting buckshot at anyone remotely connected to his grand conspiracy and he almost wiped out the entire firm my crime was picking the wrong client my two former partners have never committed a crime on so many levels i regret what has happened but the slander of their good names still keeps me awake they are both in their late sixties and in their younger days as lawyers they struggled not only with the challenge of keeping a smalltown general practice afloat but also fought some of the last battles of the jim crow era judges sometimes ignored them in court and ruled against them for no sound legal reason other lawyers were often rude and unprofessional the county bar association did not invite them to join clerks sometimes lost their filings allwhite juries did not believe them worst of all clients did not hire them black clients no white client would hire a black lawyer in the s in the south anyway and this still hasnt changed much but copeland amp reed nearly went under in its infancy because black folks thought the white lawyers were better hard work and a commitment to professionalism changed this but slowly winchester was not my first choice of places to have a career i went to law school at george mason in the dc suburbs of northern virginia the summer after my second year i got lucky and landed a clerkship with a giant firm on pennsylvania avenue near capitol hill it was one of those firms with a thousand lawyers offices around the world former senators on the letterhead bluechip clients and a frenetic pace that i thoroughly enjoyed the highlight was playing gofer in the trial of a former congressman our client who was accused of conspiring with his felonious brother to take kickbacks from a defense contractor the trial was a circus and i was thrilled to be so close to the center ring eleven years later i walked into the same courtroom in the e barrett prettyman us courthouse in downtown washington and suffered through a trial of my own i was one of seventeen clerks that summer the other sixteen all from topten law schools received job offers since i had put all my eggs in one basket i spent my third year of law school scrambling around dc knocking on doors finding none that were open at any given moment there must be several thousand unemployed lawyers pounding the pavement in dc and its easy to get lost in the desperation i eventually fanned out through the suburbs where the firms are much smaller and the jobs even scarcer finally i went home in defeat my dreams of bigleague glory were smashed mr copeland and mr reed did not have enough business and certainly could not afford a new associate but they had pity on me and cleared out an old storage room upstairs i worked as hard as possible though it was often a challenge to put in long hours with so few clients we got along smoothly and after five years they generously added my name to the partnership my income barely rose during my prosecution it was painful watching their good names get dragged through the mud and it was so senseless when i was on the ropes the lead fbi agent informed me that mr copeland and mr reed were going to be indicted if i didnt plead guilty and cooperate with the us attorney i thought it was a bluff but i had no way of knowing for sure i told him to go to hell luckily he was bluffing ive written them letters long weepy letters of apology and all that but they have not replied ive asked them to come visit so we can talk facetoface but they have not responded though my hometown is just sixty miles away i have only one regular visitor my father was one of the first black state troopers hired by the commonwealth of virginia for thirty years henry patrolled the roads and highways around winchester and he loved every minute of his job he loved the work itself the sense of authority and history the power to enforce the law and the compassion to help those in need he loved the uniform the patrol car everything but the pistol on his belt he was forced to remove it a few times but he never fired it he expected white folks to be resentful and he expected black folks to want leniency and he was determined to show complete fairness he was a tough cop who saw no gray areas in the law if an act wasnt legal then it was certainly illegal with no wiggle room and no time for technicalities from the moment i was indicted my father believed i was guilty of something forget the presumption of innocence forget my rants about being innocent as a proud career man he was thoroughly brainwashed by a lifetime of chasing those who broke the law and if the feds with their resources and great wisdom deemed me worthy of a onehundredpage indictment then they were right and i was wrong im sure he felt sympathy and im sure he prayed i would somehow get out of my mess but he had a difficult time conveying those feelings to me he was humiliated and he let me know it how could his lawyer son get himself so entangled with such a slimy bunch of crooks i have asked myself the same question a thousand times there is no good answer henry bannister barely finished high school and after a few minor scrapes with the law joined the marine corps at the age of nineteen the marines quickly turned him into a man a soldier who craved the discipline and took great pride in the uniform he did three tours in vietnam where he got shot and burned and briefly captured his medals are on the wall of his study in the small home where i was raised he lives there alone my mother was killed by a drunk driver two years before i was indicted henry travels to frostburg once a month for a onehour visit he is retired with little to do and he could visit once a week if he wanted but he does not there are so many cruel twists in a long prison term one is the feeling of being slowly forgotten by the world and by those you love and need the mail which arrived in bundles during the early months gradually trickled down to one or two letters a week friends and family members who once seemed eager to visit have not been seen in years my older brother marcus drops in twice a year to kill an hour updating me on his latest problems he has three teenagers all at various stages of juvenile delinquency plus a wife whos crazy i guess i have no problems after all in spite of his chaotic life i enjoy the visits marcus has been mimicking richard pryor his entire life and every word he utters is funny we usually laugh the entire hour as he rails against his children my younger sister ruby lives on the west coast and i see her once a year she dutifully writes me a letter every week and i treasure these i have a distant cousin who served seven years for armed robberyi was his lawyerand he comes to see me twice a year because i visited him when he was in prison after three years here i often go months without a visitor except for my father the bureau of prisons tries to place its inmates within five hundred miles of home im lucky in that winchester is so close but it might as well be a thousand miles away i have several childhood friends whove never made the drive and a few others whom i havent heard from in two years most of my former lawyer friends are too busy my running buddy in law school writes once every other month but cant quite squeeze in a visit he lives in washington a hundred fifty miles to the east where he claims to work seven days a week in a big law firm my best pal from the marine corps lives in pittsburgh two hours away and hes been to frostburg exactly once i suppose i should be thankful that my father makes the effort as always hes sitting alone in the small visiting room with a brown paper sack on the table in front of him its either cookies or brownies from my aunt racine his sister we shake hands but do not embracehenry bannister has never hugged another man in his life he looks me over to make sure i have not gained weight and as always quizzes me about my daily routine he has not gained a pound in forty years and can still fit into his marine uniform hes convinced that eating less means living longer and henrys afraid of dying young his father and grandfather dropped dead in their late fifties he walks five miles a day and thinks i should do the same i have accepted the fact that he will never stop telling me how to live my life incarcerated or not he taps the brown bag and says racine sent these please tell her i said thanks i say if hes so worried about my waistline why does he bring me a bag of fatty desserts every time he visits ill eat two or three and give the rest away you talked to marcus lately he asks no not in the past month why big trouble delmons got a girl pregnant hes fifteen shes fourteen he shakes his head and frowns delmon was an outlaw by the age of ten and the family has always expected him to pursue a life of crime your first greatgrandchild i say trying to be funny aint i proud a fourteenyearold white girl knocked up by a fifteenyearold idiot who happens to be named bannister we both dwell on this for some time our visits are often defined not by what is said but by what is kept deep inside my father is now sixtynine and instead of savoring his golden years he spends most of his time licking his wounds and feeling sorry for himself not that i blame him his dear wife of fortytwo years was taken away in a split second while he was lost in his grief we found out the fbi had an interest in me and its investigation soon snowballed my trial lasted for three weeks and my father was in the courtroom every day watching me stand before a judge and get sentenced to ten years in prison was heartbreaking then bo was taken away from both of us now marcuss children are old enough to inflict serious pain on their parents and extended family our family is due some good luck but that doesnt appear likely i talked to ruby last night he says shes doing well says hello says your last letter was quite funny please tell her the letters mean so much she has not missed a week in five years ruby is such a bright spot in our crumbling family shes a marriage counselor and her husband is a pediatrician they have three perfect kids who are kept away from their infamous uncle mal after a long pause i say thanks for the check as always he shrugs and says happy to help he sends every month and it is much appreciated it goes into my account and allows me to buy such necessities as pens writing tablets paperbacks and decent food most of those in my white gang get checks from home and virtually no one in my black gang gets a penny in prison you always know whos getting money youre almost halfway through he says im two weeks shy of five years i say i guess it flies by maybe on the outside i can assure you the clocks run much slower on this side of the wall still its hard to believe youve been in for five years it is indeed how do you survive for years in prison you dont think about years or months or weeks you think about todayhow to get through it how to survive it when you wake up tomorrow another day is behind you the days add up the weeks run together the months become years you realize how tough you are how you can function and survive because you have no choice any idea what youll do he asks i get this same question every month now as if my release were just around the corner patience i remind myself hes my father and hes here that counts for a lot not really its too far away id start thinking about it if i were you he says certain that he would know exactly what to do if he were in my shoes i just finished the third level of spanish i say with some pride in my brown gang there is a good friend marco who is an excellent language teacher drugs looks like well all be speaking spanish before long theyre taking over henry has little patience with immigrants anybody with an accent people from new york and new jersey anyone on welfare anyone unemployed and he thinks the homeless should be rounded up and placed in camps that would resemble in his view something worse than guantanamo we had harsh words a few years ago and he threatened to stop the visits bickering is a waste of time im not going to change him hes kind enough to drive over the least i can do is behave i am the convicted felon he is not hes the winner im the loser this seems important to henry though i dont know why maybe its because i had college and law school something he never dreamed of ill probably leave the country i say go somewhere where i can use the spanish somewhere like panama or costa rica warm weather beaches people with darker skin they dont care about criminal records or whos been to prison the grass is always greener huh yes dad when youre in prison every place has greener grass what am i supposed to do go back home maybe become an unlicensed paralegal doing research for some tiny firm that cant afford me maybe become a bail bondsman how about a private detective there are not a lot of options hes nodding along weve had this conversation at least a dozen times and you hate the government he says oh yes i hate the federal government the fbi the us attorneys the federal judges the fools who run the prisons there is so much of it i hate im sitting here doing ten years for a noncrime because a hotshot us attorney needed to jack up his kill quota and if the government can nail my ass for ten years with no evidence just think of all the possibilities now that i have the words convicted felon tattooed on my forehead im outta here pop just as soon as i can make the break hes nodding and smiling sure mal chapter given the importance of what they do and the controversies that often surround them and the violent people they sometimes confront it is remarkable that in the history of this country only four active federal judges have been murdered the honorable raymond fawcett has just become number five his body was found in the small basement of a lakeside cabin he had built and frequently used on weekends when he did not show up for a trial on monday morning his law clerks panicked and called the fbi in due course the agents found the crime scene the cabin was in a heavily wooded part of southwest virginia on the side of a mountain at the edge of a small pristine body of water known locally as lake higgins the lake is not found on most road maps there appeared to be no forced entry no fight or struggle nothing but two dead bodies bullet holes in both heads and an empty metal safe in the basement judge fawcett was found near the safe shot twice in the back of the head definitely an execution and there was a large pool of dried blood on the floor around him the first expert on the scene guessed that the judge had been dead for at least two days he had left the office around three on friday afternoon according to one of his law clerks with plans to drive straight to the cabin and spend the weekend hard at work there the other body was that of naomi clary a thirtyfouryearold divorced mother of two who had recently been hired by judge fawcett as a secretary the judge who was sixtysix and had five adult children was not divorced he and mrs fawcett had been living apart for several years though they were still seen together around roanoke when the occasion called for it it was common knowledge they had separated and because he was such a prominent man in town their living arrangements created some gossip both had confided in their children and in their friends that they simply did not have the stomach for a divorce mrs fawcett had the money judge fawcett had the status both seemed relatively content and both had promised no outside affairs the handshake deal provided they would proceed with the divorce if and when one of them met someone else evidently the judge had found someone to his liking almost immediately after ms clary was added to the payroll the rumors rippled through the courthouse that the judge was fooling around again a few on his staff knew that he had never been able to keep his pants on naomis body was found on a sofa near the spot where the judge was murdered she was naked with both ankles bound tightly together with silver duct tape she was lying on her back with both wrists taped together behind her she had been shot twice in the forehead her body was covered with small burn marks after a few hours of debate and analysis the chief investigators agreed that she had likely been tortured as a means of forcing fawcett to open the safe apparently it had worked the safe was empty its door left open not a shred of anything left behind the thief had cleaned it out then executed his victims judge fawcetts father had been a framing contractor and as a kid he tagged along always with a hammer he never stopped building thingsa new back porch a deck a storage shed when his children were small and his marriage was happy he had gutted and completely renovated a stately old home in central roanoke acting as the general contractor and spending every weekend on a ladder years later he renovated a loft apartment that became his love nest then his home to him the hammering sawing and sweating were therapy a mental and physical escape from a job filled with stress he had designed the aframe lake cabin and over a fouryear period had built most of it himself in the basement where he died there was a wall covered with fine cedar shelves all crammed with thick law books in the center though was a hidden door a set of shelves swung open and there perfectly hidden was the safe at the crime scene the safe had been rolled forward some three feet out of the wall and then cleaned out the safe was a metal and lead vault mounted on four fiveinch wheels it had been manufactured by the vulcan safe company of kenosha wisconsin and sold online to judge fawcett according to its specs it was fortysix inches in height thirtysix inches in width forty inches in depth offered nine cubic feet of storage weighed pounds retailed at and when properly sealed was fireproof waterproof and ostensibly burglarproof a keypad on the door required a sixdigit code for entry why a federal judge who earned a year needed such a secured and hidden container for his valuables was an immediate mystery to the fbi at the time of his death judge fawcett had in a personal checking account in a certificate of deposit earning less than percent a year in a bond fund and in a mutual fund that had underperformed the market for almost a decade he also had a k and the standard array of benefits for top federal officials with almost no debt his balance sheet was blandly impressive his real security was in his job since the constitution allowed him to serve until he died the salary would never stop mrs fawcetts family owned a trainload of bank stock but the judge had never been able to get near it now with the separation it was even further offlimits bottom line the judge was quite comfortable but far from rich and not the type who needed a hidden safe to protect his goodies what was in the safe or bluntly what got him killed interviews with family and friends would later reveal he had no expensive habits did not collect gold coins or rare diamonds or anything that needed such protection other than an impressive baseball card collection from his youth there was no evidence the judge had an interest in collecting anything the aframe was tucked away so deeply in the hills that it was nearly impossible to find a porch wrapped around the cabin and from any vantage point not another person vehicle cabin home shack or boat could be seen total isolation the judge stored a kayak and a canoe in the basement and he was known to spend hours on the lake fishing thinking and smoking cigars he was a quiet man not lonely and not shy but cerebral and serious it was painfully obvious to the fbi there would be no witnesses because there were no other human beings within miles the cabin was the perfect spot to kill someone and be far away before the crime was discovered from the moment they first arrived the investigators knew they were way behind on this one and for them things got worse there was not a single fingerprint footprint piece of fiber stray hair follicle or tire mark to help with the clues the cabin had no alarm system and certainly no surveillance cameras and why bother the nearest policeman was half an hour away and assuming he could even find the place what was he supposed to do when he got there any braindead burglar would be long gone for three days the investigators inspected every inch of the cabin and four acres around it and they found nothing the fact that the murderer was so careful and methodic did not help the mood of the team they were dealing with some real talent here a gifted killer who left no clues where were they supposed to start there was already pressure from justice in washington the director of the fbi was putting together a task force sort of a special ops unit to descend upon roanoke and solve the crime as expected the brutal murders of an adulterous judge and his young girlfriend were splendid gifts to the media and the tabloids when naomi clary was buried three days after her body was found the roanoke police used barricades to keep reporters and the curious away from the cemetery when raymond fawcett was memorialized the following day at a packed episcopal church a helicopter hovered above the building and drowned out the music the police chief an old friend of the judges was forced to send up his helicopter and shoo away the other one mrs fawcett was steadfast in the front row among her children and grandchildren refusing to shed a tear or look at his coffin many kind words were spoken about the judge but some people especially the men were thinking how did this old boy get such a young girlfriend when both were good and buried the attention quickly returned to the investigation the fbi would not say a word in public primarily because it had nothing to say at all a week after the bodies were found the only evidence on the table was the ballistics reports four bullets hollow points fired from acaliber handgun one of a million on the streets and now probably at the bottom of a large lake somewhere in the mountains of west virginia other motives were being analyzed in judge john wood was gunned down outside his home in san antonio his killer was a contract hit man hired by a powerful drug dealer who was about to be sentenced by judge wood who hated the drug trade and those who worked it with a nickname like maximum john the motive was fairly obvious in roanoke the fbi teams looked at every case criminal and civil on judge fawcetts docket and made a short list of potential suspects virtually all of whom were involved in the narcotics trade in judge richard daronco was shot and killed while doing yard work around his home in pelham new york the killer was the angry father of a woman who had just lost a case in the judges courtroom the father shot the judge then committed suicide in roanoke the fbi team scoured judge fawcetts files and interviewed his clerks there are always a few whack jobs filing crap in federal court and making outrageous demands and a list slowly came together names but no real suspects in judge robert smith vance was killed in his home in mountain brook alabama when he opened a package that contained a bomb they found his killer and eventually sent him to death row but his motive was never clear the prosecutors speculated he was angry over a recent decision by judge vance in roanoke the fbi interviewed hundreds of lawyers with cases presently before judge fawcett or in the recent past every lawyer has clients who are either crazy or mean enough to seek revenge and a few of these had passed through judge fawcetts courtroom they were tracked down interviewed and eliminated in january a month before the fawcett murder judge john roll was gunned down near tucson in the same mass killing that wounded congresswoman gabrielle giffords judge roll was in the wrong place at the wrong time and not the target his death was of no help to the fbi in roanoke with each passing day the trail grew colder with no witnesses no real crime scene evidence no mistake by the killer only a handful of useless tips and very few suspects from the judges dockets the investigation hit dead ends at every turn the big announcement of a reward did little to spark activity on the fbi hotlines chapter because frostburg is a camp and light on security we have more contact with the outside world than most prisoners our mail is always subject to being opened and read but this is rare we have limited access to email but not the internet there are dozens of phones and plenty of rules that govern their use but we can generally make all the collect calls we want cell phones are strictly prohibited we are allowed to buy subscriptions to dozens of magazines on an approved list several newspapers arrive promptly each morning and they are always available in a corner of the chow hall known as the coffee room it is there early one morning that i see the headline in the washington post federal judge murdered near roanoke i cannot hide a smile this is the moment for the past three years i have been obsessed with raymond fawcett i never met him never entered his courtroom never filed a lawsuit in his domainthe southern district of virginia virtually all of my practice was in state court i rarely ventured into the federal arena and when i did it was always in the northern district of virginia which includes everything from richmond north the southern district covers roanoke lynchburg and the massive sprawl of the virginia beachnorfolk metro area before fawcetts passing there were twelve federal judges working in the southern district and thirteen in the northern i have met several inmates here at frostburg who were sentenced by fawcett and without seeming too curious i quizzed them about him i did this under the guise of actually knowing the judge of having tried lawsuits in his court without exception these inmates loathed the man and felt as though he had gone overboard with their sentences he seemed to especially enjoy lecturing the whitecollar guys as he passed judgment and sent them away their sentencing hearings generally attracted more press and fawcett had a massive ego he went to duke as an undergrad and columbia for law school then worked at a wall street firm for a few years his wife and her money were from roanoke and they settled there when he was in his early thirties he joined the biggest law firm in town and quickly clawed his way to the top his fatherinlaw was a longtime benefactor to democratic politics and in president clinton appointed fawcett to a lifetime position on the u s district court for the southern district of virginia in the world of american law such an appointment carries tremendous prestige but not a lot of money at the time his new salary was a year about a cut in pay from what he was earning as a hardworking partner in a thriving law firm at fortyeight he became one of the youngest federal judges in the country and with five kids one of the most cashstrapped his fatherinlaw soon began supplementing his income and the pressure eased he once described his early years on the bench in a long interview in one of those legal periodicals that few people read i found it by chance in the prison library in a stack of magazines about to be discarded there are not too many books and magazines that escape my curious eyes often ill read five or six hours a day the computers here are desktops a few years outofdate and because of demand they take a beating however since i am the librarian and the computers are under my control i have plenty of access we have subscriptions to two digital legal research sites and i have used these to read every opinion published by the late honorable raymond fawcett something happened to him around the turn of the century the year during his first seven years on the bench he was a leftleaning protector of individual rights compassionate with the poor and troubled quick to slap the hands of law enforcement skeptical of big business and seemingly eager to chastise a wayward litigant with an extremely sharp pen within a year though something was changing his opinions were shorter not as well reasoned even nasty at times and he was definitely moving to the right in he was nominated by president clinton to fill a vacancy on the fourth circuit court of appeals in richmond such a move is the logical promotion for a talented district court judge or one with the right connections on the fourth circuit he would have been one of fifteen judges who considered nothing but cases on appeal the only rung higher than that is the us supreme court and it is not clear if fawcett had that ambition most federal judges do at one time or another bill clinton though was leaving office and under something of a cloud his nominations were stalled in the senate and when george w bush was elected fawcetts future remained in roanoke he was fiftyfive his children were already adults or in the process of leaving home perhaps he succumbed to a midlife crisis of sorts maybe his marriage was on the rocks his fatherinlaw had died and left him out of his will his former partners were getting rich while he toiled away at workers wages relatively speaking whatever the reason judge fawcett became a different man on the bench in criminal cases his sentencing became erratic and far less compassionate in civil cases he showed much less sympathy for the little guy and sided time and again with powerful interests judges often change as they mature but few turn as abruptly as raymond fawcett the biggest case of his career was a war over uranium mining that began in i was still a lawyer then and i knew the issues and basic details you couldnt avoid it there was a story in the newspapers virtually every day a rich vein of uranium ore runs through central and southern virginia because the mining of uranium is an environmental nightmare the state passed a law forbidding it naturally the landowners leaseholders and mining companies that control the deposits have long wanted to start digging and they spent millions lobbying lawmakers to lift the ban but the virginia general assembly resisted in a canadian company called armanna mines filed a lawsuit in the southern district of virginia attacking the ban as unconstitutional it was a frontal assault with no holds barred heavily financed and led by some of the most expensive legal talent money could buy as we soon learned armanna mines was a consortium of mining companies from the us australia and russia as well as canada an estimate of the potential value of the deposits in virginia alone ranged from to billion under the random selection process in effect at the time the case was assigned to a judge mckay of lynchburg who was eightyfour years old and suffering from dementia citing health reasons he passed next in line was raymond fawcett who had no valid reason to recuse himself the defendant was the commonwealth of virginia but many others soon joined in these included cities towns and counties situated on top of the deposits as well as a few landowners who wanted no part of the destruction the lawsuit became one huge sprawling mess of litigation with over a hundred lawyers involved judge fawcett denied the initial motions to dismiss and ordered extensive discovery before long he was devoting percent of his time to the lawsuit in the fbi entered my life and i lost interest in the mining case i suddenly had other more pressing matters to deal with my trial started in october in dc by then the armanna mines trial had been under way for a month in a crowded courtroom in roanoke at that point i could not have cared less what happened to the uranium after a threeweek trial i was convicted and given ten years after a tenweek trial judge fawcett ruled in favor of armanna mines there was no possible connection between the two trials or so i thought as i went away to prison soon though i met the man who would eventually kill judge fawcett i know the identity of the murderer and i know his motive motive is a baffling question for the fbi in the weeks after the murder the task force settles on the armanna mines litigation and interviews dozens of people connected to the trial a couple of radical environmental groups had sprung up and operated around the fringes of the litigation these had been closely monitored by the fbi at the time fawcett had received death threats and during the trial he had moved around with protection the threats were thoroughly investigated and found not to be credible but the bodyguards remained close by intimidation is an unlikely motive fawcett has made his decision and though his name is poison among the environmentalists he has done his damage his ruling was confirmed in by the fourth circuit and the case is now headed for the us supreme court pending the appeals the uranium has not been touched revenge is a motive though the fbi says nothing about it the words contract killing are being used by some reporters who apparently have nothing to base this on except for the professionalism of the killings given the crime scene and the empty safe that was so carefully hidden robbery seems the likelier motive i have a plan one i have been plotting for years now it is my only way out chapter every ablebodied federal inmate is required to have a job and the bureau of prisons controls the pay scale for the past two years i have been the librarian and for my labors i get thirty cents an hour about half of this money along with the checks from my father is subject to the inmate financial responsibility program the bureau of prisons takes the money and applies it to felony assessments fines and restitution along with my tenyear sentence i was ordered to pay about in various penalties at thirty cents an hour it will take the rest of this century and then some other jobs around here include cook dishwasher table wiper floor scrubber plumber electrician carpenter clerk orderly laundry worker painter gardener and teacher i consider myself lucky my job is one of the best and does not reduce me to cleaning up after people i occasionally teach a course in history for inmates pursuing their high school equivalency diplomas teaching pays thirtyfive cents an hour but i am not tempted by the higher wages i find it quite depressing because of the low levels of literacy among the prison populations blacks whites brownsit doesnt matter so many of these guys can barely read and write it makes you wonder whats happening in our educational system but im not here to fix the educational system nor the legal judicial or prison systems im here to survive one day at a time and in doing so maintain as much selfrespect and dignity as possible we are scum nobodies common criminals locked away from society and reminders of this are never far away a prison guard is called a correction officer or simply a co never refer to one as a guard no sir being a co is far superior its more of a title most cos are former cops or deputies or military types who didnt do too well in those jobs and now work in prison there are a few good ones but most are losers who are too stupid to realize they are losers and who are we to tell them they are vastly superior to us regardless of their stupidity and they enjoy reminding us of this they rotate cos to avoid one getting too close to an inmate i suppose this happens but one of the cardinal rules of inmate survival is to avoid your co as much as possible treat him with respect do exactly what he says cause him no trouble but above all try to avoid him my current co is not one of the better ones he is darrel marvin a thickchested potbellied white boy of no more than thirty who tries to swagger but has too much tonnage on his hips darrel is an ignorant racist who does not like me because i am black and i have two college degrees which is two more than he has a fierce internal battle rages every time im forced to suck up to this thug but i have no choice right now i need him good morning officer marvin i say with a fake smile as i stop him outside the chow hall what is it bannister he growls i hand over a sheet of paper an official request form he takes it and makes a pretense of reading it im tempted to help him with the longer words but bite my tongue i need to see the warden i say politely why do you want to see the warden he asks still trying to read the rather simple request my business with the warden is of no concern to the co or anyone else but to remind darrel of this would only cause trouble my grandmother is almost dead and i would like to go to her funeral its only sixty miles away when do you think she might die he asks such a clever smartass soon please officer marvin i have not seen her in years the warden does not approve crap like this bannister you should know this by now i know but the warden owes me a favor i gave him some legal advice a few months ago please just pass it along he folds the sheet of paper and stuffs it into a pocket all right but its a waste of time thanks both of my grandmothers died years ago nothing in prison is designed for the convenience of the prisoner the granting or denying of a simple request should take a few hours but that would be too easy four days pass before darrel informs me that i am to report to the wardens office at am tomorrow february another fake smile and i say thanks the warden is the king of this little empire with the expected ego of one who rules by edict or thinks he should these guys come and go and its impossible to understand the purpose of all the transfers again its not my job to reform our prison system so i dont worry about what happens in the administration building the current one is mr robert earl wade a career corrections man whos all business hes fresh off his second divorce and i did indeed explain to him some of the basics regarding maryland alimony law i enter his office he does not stand or offer a hand or extend any courtesy that might indicate respect he says hello bannister as he waves at an empty chair hello warden wade how have you been i ease into the chair im a free man bannister number two is history and ill never marry again nice to hear and glad to help with the warmup quickly over he shoves a notepad and says i cant let you guys go home for every funeral bannister you gotta understand this this is not about a funeral i say i have no grandmother what the hell are you keeping up with the murder investigation of judge fawcett down in roanoke he frowns and jerks his head back as if hes been insulted im here under false pretenses and somewhere deep in one of the countless federal manuals there must be a violation for this as he tries to react he shakes his head and repeats himself what the hell the murder of the federal judge its all over the press its hard to believe he could have missed the story of the murder but its also entirely possible just because i read several newspapers a day doesnt mean everyone does the federal judge he asks thats him they found him with his girlfriend in a lake cabin in southwest virginia both shot sure sure ive seen the stories whats this got to do with you hes ticked off because ive lied to him and hes trying to think of the appropriate punishment a supreme and mighty man like a warden cannot get himself used by an inmate robert earls eyes are darting around as he decides how to react to my trickery i need to sound as dramatic as possible because wade will probably laugh when i answer his question inmates have far too much spare time to develop intricate claims of their innocence or to cook up conspiracy theories involving unsolved crimes or to gather secrets that might be swapped for a sudden parole in short inmates are always scheming ways to get out and im sure robert earl has seen and heard it all i know who killed the judge i say as seriously as possible much to my relief he does not crack a smile he rocks back in his chair pulls at his chin and begins to nod and how did you come across this information he asks i met the killer in here or on the outside i cant say warden but im not bullshitting you based on what im reading in the press the fbi investigation isnt going anywhere and it wont my disciplinary record is without blemish i have never uttered a wrong word to a prison official i have never complained there is no contraband in my cell not even an extra packet of sugar from the chow hall i do not gamble or borrow money i have helped dozens of fellow inmates as well as a few civilians including the warden with their legal problems my library is kept in meticulous order the point beingfor an inmate i have credibility he leans forward on his elbows and exposes his yellow teeth he has dark circles under his eyes which are always moist the eyes of a drinker and let me guess bannister you would like to share this information with the fbi cut a deal and get out of prison right absolutely sir thats my plan finally the laugh a long highpitched cackle that in itself would be the source of much humor when he winds down he says when is your release five years oh so this is a helluva deal right just give them a name and trot right out of here five years ahead of schedule nothing is that simple what do you want me to do bannister he snarls the laughter long gone call the fbi and tell em i gotta guy who knows the killer and is ready to cut a deal theyre probably getting a hundred calls a day most from fruitcakes sniffing around for the reward money why would i risk my credibility playing that game because i know the truth and you know im not a fruitcake nor a bullshitter why dont you just write them a letter keep me out of it i will if thats what you want but youll be involved at some point because i swear im going to convince the fbi well cut our deal and ill say goodbye youll be here for the logistics he slumps back in his chair as if overwhelmed by the pressure of his office he picks his nose with a thumb you know bannister as of this morning i have men here at frostburg and you are the last one i would expect to sneak in my office with such a screwball idea the very last thank you dont mention it i lean forward and stare him in the eyes look warden i know what im talking about i know you cant trust an inmate but just hear me out i have some extremely valuable information and the fbi will be desperate to have it please call them i dont know bannister well both look like fools please i might think about it now shove off and tell officer marvin that i denied your request to go to the funeral yes sir and thanks my hunch is that the warden will not be able to resist a little excitement running a nosecurity camp filled with wellbehaved inmates is a dull job why not get involved in the most notorious murder investigation in the country i leave the administration building and head across the quad the central area of our camp on the west side are two dormitories that house men each and these are matched by identical buildings on the east side of the quad east campus and west campus as though one were strolling through a pleasant little college the cos have a break room near the chow hall and here i find dear officer marvin if i set foot inside the break room i would probably be shot or hanged the metal door is open though and i can see inside marvin is sprawled in a folding chair cup of coffee in one hand and a thick pastry in the other hes laughing along with two other cos if hooked by the necks and weighed together on meat scales the three would push a thousand pounds what do you want bannister darrel growls when he sees me just wanted to say thanks officer the warden said no but thanks anyway you got it bannister sorry about your grandmother and with that one of the guards kicks the door closed it slams hard in my face the metal crashes and vibrates and for a split second it shakes me to the core i have heard that sound before my arrest the downtown civic club met for lunch each wednesday at the historic george washington hotel a fiveminute walk from my office there were about seventyfive members and all but three were white on that day i happened to be the only black guy in attendance not that this was of any significance i was sitting at a long table choking down the usual rubber chicken and cold peas and shooting the bull with the mayor and a state farm agent we had covered the usual topicsthe weather and footballand we had touched lightly on politics but this was always done with great care it was a typical civic club lunchthirty minutes for the food followed by thirty minutes from a speaker who was usually not too exciting however on this memorable day i would not be allowed to hear the speech there was a commotion at the door of the banquet hall then suddenly a squad of heavily armed federal agents swarmed the room as if they were about to kill all of us a swat team in complete ninja attireblack uniforms thick vests serious firearms and those german combat helmets made famous by hitlers troops one of them yelled malcolm bannister i instinctively stood and mumbled what the hell at least five automatic rifles were instantly aimed at me hands up the fearless leader yelled and i raised my hands in a matter of seconds my hands were yanked down slapped together behind me and for the first time in my life i felt the indescribable pinch of thick cuffs on my wrists it is a horrible feeling and unforgettable i was shoved down the narrow aisle between the dining tables and hustled out of the room the last thing i heard was the mayor shouting this is an outrage needless to say the dramatic invasion put a damper on the rest of the civic club meeting with these paramilitary goons swarming around me i was taken through the lobby of the hotel and out the front door someone had graciously tipped off the local television station and a camera crew filmed away as i was shoved into the rear seat of a black chevrolet tahoe a goon on each side as we headed for the city jail i said is all of this really necessary the leader riding frontseat shotgun said just shut up without turning around well i really dont have to shut up i said you can arrest me but you cant make me shut up do you realize this just shut up the goon on my right placed the barrel of his rifle on my knee please move that gun would you i said but the gun did not move we drove on i said are you guys getting your rocks off on this must be terribly exciting to dash about like real tough guys roughing up innocent people sort of like the gestapo i said shut up and i said im not shutting up you got a warrant for my arrest i do let me see it ill show it to you at the jail for now just shut up why dont you shut up okay i could see a portion of his neck just under his german combat helmet and it was turning red as he fumed i took a deep breath and told myself to be cool the helmet i had worn the same type during my four years in the marines four years of active duty that included live combat in the first gulf war second regiment eighth battalion second division us marine corps we had been the first us troops to engage the iraqis in kuwait it wasnt much of a fight but i saw enough dead and wounded on both sides now i was surrounded by a bunch of toy soldiers whod never heard a shot fired in anger and couldnt run a mile without collapsing and they were the good guys when we arrived at the jail there was a photographer from the local newspaper my goons walked me slowly inside making sure i would be well photographed their version of the perp walk i would soon learn that another team of government thugs had raided the offices of copeland reed amp bannister at about the same time i was sitting down for lunch with my fellow civic club members with brilliant forethought and meticulous planning the joint strike force waited until the noon hour when the only person in the office was poor mrs henderson she reported that they stormed through the front door with guns drawn yelling cursing threatening they tossed a search warrant on her desk made her sit in a chair by the window promised to arrest her if she did little more than breathe then proceeded to ransack our modest suite of offices they hauled away all of the computers printers and several dozen boxes of files at some point mr copeland returned from lunch when he protested a gun was aimed at him and he took a seat beside a weeping mrs henderson my arrest was certainly a surprise i had been dealing with the fbi for over a year i had hired a lawyer and we had done everything possible to cooperate i had passed two polygraph examinations administered by the fbis own experts we had turned over all of the paperwork that i as a lawyer could ethically show anyone i had kept a lot of this from dionne but she knew i was worried sick i battled insomnia i struggled to eat when i had no appetite finally after almost twelve months of my living in fear and dreading the knock on the door the fbi informed my lawyer that the government no longer had any interest in me the government lied and not for the first or last time inside the jail a place i visited at least twice a week there was yet another squad of agents they wore navy parkas with fbi stamped in bold yellow lettering across the backs and they buzzed around with great purpose though i could not tell exactly what they were doing the local cops many of whom i knew well backed away and looked at me with confusion and pity was it really necessary to send two dozen federal agents to arrest me and confiscate my files i had just walked from my office to the george washington hotel any halfassed cop on his lunch break could have stopped me and made the arrest but that would take the joy out of what these vastly important people did for a living they led me to a small room sat me at a table removed the handcuffs and told me to wait a few minutes later a man in a dark suit entered the room and said im special agent don connor fbi a real pleasure i said he dropped some papers on the table in front of me and said this is the warrant for your arrest then he dropped a thick bunch of stapled papers and this is the indictment ill give you a few minutes to read it with that he turned and left the room slamming the door behind him as hard as possible it was a thick metal door and it crashed and vibrated and the sound rattled around the room for a few seconds a sound i will never forget chapter three days after my first meeting with warden wade i am summoned back to his office when i walk in he is alone on the phone engaged in an important conversation i stand awkwardly by the door waiting when he finishes his end of the chat with a rude thatll do he gets to his feet and says follow me we walk through a side door into an adjacent conference room painted in the typical government pale green and equipped with far more metal chairs than could ever be used an audit last year revealed that the bureau of prisons had purchased for administrative use four thousand chairs at per chair the same manufacturer sold the same chair at wholesale for i shouldnt care anymore but working for thirty cents an hour gives one a different perspective when it comes to handling money have a seat he says and i sit in one of the ugly and overpriced chairs he selects one across the table because there must always be a barrier between us i glance around and count twentytwo chairs let it go i called washington after you left the other day he says gravely as if he checks in with the white house on a regular basis the bureau advised me to use my own discretion i kicked it around for a few hours then got in touch with the fbi down in roanoke theyve sent two guys up theyre waiting down the hall i maintain a poker face though i am thrilled to hear this he points a finger at me and says im warning you bannister if this turns out to be a scam and i get embarrassed then ill do whatever i can to make your life miserable its not a scam warden i swear i dont know why i believe you you wont be sorry from his pocket he removes his reading glasses perches them halfway down his nose and looks at a slip of paper i spoke with assistant director victor westlake the guy in charge of the investigation hes sent two of his men to have a chat with you agent hanski and agent erardi i did not reveal your name so they know nothing thank you warden stay here he gently slaps the table gets to his feet and leaves the room as i wait and listen for approaching footsteps there is a sharp pain in my stomach if this doesnt work im here for five more years plus anything more they can possibly tack on special agent chris hanski is the senior guy about my age with a lot of gray hair agent alan erardi is his younger sidekick a newspaper article said there are now forty fbi agents working on the fawcett case and i assume these guys are pretty far down the chain of command this first meeting will be important as will all of them but theyve clearly sent a couple of foot soldiers to check me out the warden is not in the room i figure hes back in his office not far away with an ear stuck to the door they begin without using pens and notepads a clear sign they are here for a little amusement nothing serious i guess theyre not smart enough to realize ive spent hours across the table from fbi agents so you want to make a deal hanski says i know who killed judge fawcett and i know why if this information is of any value to the fbi then yes we might be able to make a deal youre assuming we dont already know hanski says im sure you dont if you did why would you be here we were told to be here because were checking every possible lead and we doubt seriously if this will lead anywhere try me they exchange cocky looks fun and games so you give us the name and what do you get in return i get out of prison and i get protection that simple no its actually very complicated this guy is a nasty character and he has friends who are even nastier plus im not willing to wait two years until hes convicted if i give you the name i get out now immediately what if hes not convicted thats your problem if you screw up the prosecution you cant blame me at this point erardi takes out his notepad uncaps a cheap pen and writes something down i have their attention they are still working much too hard to appear nonchalant but these guys are under pressure their little task force is scrambling because they have no credible leads according to the newspapers hanski continues what if you give us the wrong name lets say we go chasing after the wrong suspect meanwhile youre a free man ill never be a free man youll be out of prison and looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life weve never lost an informant in witness protection over eight thousand and counting thats what you advertise frankly im not too concerned with your track record or what didnt happen to the others im worried about my own skin there is a pause as erardi stops writing and decides to speak this guy sounds like hes in a gang of some sort maybe a drug dealer what else can you tell us nothing and ive told you nothing you can make all the wild guesses you want hanski smiles at nothing that is humorous i doubt if our boss will be too impressed with your scheme to get out of prison as of today weve had at least two other inmates contact us and claim to have valuable information of course they want out of prison too this is not unusual i have no way of knowing if this is true but it sounds believable the knot in my stomach has not gone away i shrug offer a smile tell myself to stay cool you guys can play it any way you want obviously youre in charge you can keep beating your heads against a wall you can waste time with these other inmates its up to you but when you want to know the name of the person who killed judge fawcett i can give it to you someone you met in prison erardi asks or maybe out of prison youll never know until we have a deal there is a long pause as they stare at me and i stare right back finally erardi closes his notepad and sticks his pen back in his pocket hanski says okay well go tell our boss you know where to find me several times a week i meet my white gang at the track and we walk in wide circles around a field used for soccer and flag football carl the optometrist will be out in a few months kermit the land speculator has two more years wesley the state senator should get out about the same time i do mark is the only one with his case still on appeal hes been here for eighteen months and says his lawyer is optimistic though he freely admits he falsified some mortgage documents we dont talk much about our crimes and this is usually true in prison who you were or what you did on the outside is not important and its also too painful to dwell on wesleys wife has just filed for divorce and hes taking it hard since ive been through it as has kermit we offer advice and try to cheer him up i would love to entertain them with the details of my visit from the fbi but this must be kept quiet if my plan works they will show up one day for a walk and ill be gone suddenly transferred to another camp for reasons they will never know chapter the fbis temporary headquarters for its fawcett task force was a warehouse in an industrial park near the roanoke regional airport when last occupied the space had been leased by a company that imported shrimp from central america and froze it for years almost immediately it was tagged the freezer it offered plenty of space seclusion and privacy away from the press carpenters hurriedly built walls and sectioned off rooms offices hallways and meeting places technicians from washington worked around the clock to install the latest hightech gear and gadgets for communication data and security trucks filled with rented furniture and equipment ran nonstop until the cccommand centerwas stuffed with more desks and tables than would ever be used a fleet of rented suvs filled the parking lot a catering service was hired to haul in three meals a day for the team which soon numbered close to seventyabout forty agents plus support staff there was no budget and no concern for costs the victim was after all a federal judge a lease was signed for six months but after three weeks of little progress there was a general mood among the feds that they might be there longer aside from a short list of randomly picked suspects all of whom were known to be violent and had appeared before fawcett in the past eighteen years there were no real leads a man named stacks had written the judge a threatening letter in from prison stacks was found working in a liquor store in panama city beach florida and had an alibi for the weekend the judge and ms clary were murdered stacks had not set foot in virginia in at least five years a narcotrafficker named ruiz had cursed his honor in spanish when given a twentyyear sentence in ruiz was still in a mediumsecurity prison but after a few days digging through his past the fbi decided his former cadre of coke runners were all either dead or in prison too one team methodically sifted through every case fawcett handled during his eighteen years on the bench he had been a workhorse handling cases each year both civil and criminal while the average for a federal judge is judge fawcett had sentenced approximately thirtyone hundred men and women to prison laboring under the admittedly shaky assumption that his killer was one of these a team burned hundreds of hours adding names to its list of possible suspects and then discarding them another team studied the cases both civil and criminal pending before the judge when he was murdered another team spent all of its time on the armanna mines litigation with particular attention paid to a couple of flaky environmental extremists who didnt like fawcett from the moment it got itself organized the freezer was a swarming hive of tension with urgent meetings frayed nerves dead ends by the hour careers on the line and someone always barking from washington the press called nonstop the bloggers were feeding the frenzy with creative and blatantly false rumors then an inmate named malcolm bannister entered the picture the task force was run by victor westlake a thirtyyear career agent who had a nice office with a nice view in the hoover building on pennsylvania avenue in washington however for almost three weeks now he had been holed up in a freshly painted room with no windows in the center of the cc it was by no means his first road trip westlake had made his name years earlier as a master organizer who could rush to the scene of the crime line up the troops handle a thousand details plan the attack and solve the crime he had once spent a year in a motel near buffalo stalking a genius who got his kicks sending parcel bombs to federal meat inspectors turned out to be the wrong genius but westlake did not make the mistake of arresting his prey two years later he nailed his bomber westlake was in his office standing as always behind his desk when agents hanski and erardi entered since their boss was standing they stood too he believed that it was unhealthy even deadly to sit for hours behind a desk okay im listening he barked snapping his fingers hanski quickly said guys name is malcolm bannister black male aged fortythree in for ten for rico violations federal court in dc former lawyer from winchester virginia says he can deliver the name of the killer along with his motive but of course he wants out of prison erardi added out immediately but also protection what a surprise a con wants out is he believable hanski shrugged for a con i suppose the warden says the guy is not a bullshitter record is squeakyclean says we should listen to the guy whatd he give you absolutely nothing the guy is pretty smart he might actually know something and if he does then this may be his only chance to walk westlake began to pace behind his desk across the slick concrete floor to one wall with fresh sawdust scattered in front of it he paced back to his desk what kind of lawyer was he criminal drug dealers hanski replied small town general practice some criminal experience not much trial work though a former marine as a former marine himself westlake liked this his military record four years honorable discharge fought in the first gulf war his father was a marine and a virginia state trooper what took him down youre not going to believe it barry the backhander westlake frowned and smiled at the same time come on seriously he handled some real estate transactions for barry and got caught up in the storm as youll recall the jury nailed them on rico and conspiracy charges i think there were eight of them tried at the same time bannister was a small fish who got caught in a wide net any connection to fawcett not yet we just got his name three hours ago you got a plan sort of hanski said if we assume bannister knows the killer then its safe to assume they met in prison doubtful that he would have met the guy on the quiet streets of winchester much more likely that their paths crossed in prison bannister has been in for five years with the first twentytwo months in louisville kentucky a mediumsecurity prison with a population of two thousand since then hes been at frostburg a camp with six hundred inmates thats a lot of people plus they come and go westlake said right so lets start at the logical place lets get his prison records the names of his cell mates maybe dorm mates well go to the two prisons talk to the wardens the unit managers the cos talk to anyone who might know something about bannister and his friends well begin collecting names and well see how many crossed paths with fawcett erardi added he says the killer has nasty friends thus the desire for protection sounds like a gang of some variety once we start adding names well concentrate on those with gang connections a pause then a doubtful westlake said and thats it its the best we can do for now westlake clicked his heels together arched his back gripped his hands behind his head and breathed deeply he stretched and breathed and stretched then said okay collect the prison records and get started how many hands do you need can you spare two men no but you can have them go get started barry the backhander the client i never met until they dragged us into federal court one gray morning and read the entire indictment aloud in a hamandegg storefront law office you learn the basics of many mundane legal tasks but its difficult to specialize i tried to avoid divorce and bankruptcy and i never liked real estate but to survive i often had to take who and what walked in the door oddly it would be real estate that brought about the fall the referral came from a law school pal who was working for a midsized firm in central dc the firm had a client who wished to purchase a hunting lodge in shenandoah county in the foothills of the allegheny mountains about an hour southwest of winchester the client desired great secrecy and demanded anonymity which should have been the first warning sign the purchase price was million and after some haggling i negotiated a flat fee of for copeland reed amp bannister to handle the transaction such a fee had never been seen by me or my partners and we were excited initially i set my other files aside and went to research the land records in shenandoah county the lodge was about twenty years old and had been built by some doctors who enjoyed grouse hunting but as happens with many such ventures the partners had reached a disagreement a serious one involving lawyers and lawsuits even a bankruptcy or two after a couple of weeks though i had things sorted out and delivering a clean title opinion to my still anonymous client would be no problem a closing date was set and i prepared all the necessary contracts and deeds there was a lot of paperwork but then again we were going to earn a rather fat fee the closing was delayed a month and i asked my law school pal for or half of the attorneys fees this was not uncommon and since i had invested a hundred hours at this point i wanted to get paid he called back to say the client would not agree no big deal i thought in a typical real estate transaction the attorneys are not paid until the closing takes place i was informed that my client a corporation had changed its name i redrafted the documents and waited the closing was again delayed and the sellers began threatening to walk away during this time i was vaguely aware of the name and reputation of a beltway operative by the name of barry rafko or more famously barry the backhander he was about fifty years old and for most of his adult life had been rummaging around dc looking for a lazy way to make a buck he had been a consultant a strategist an analyst a fundraiser and a spokesman and he had worked at the lower levels of a few election campaigns of congressmen and senators both democratic and republican didnt matter to barry if he was getting paid he could strategize and analyze from either side of the street he hit his stride though when he and a partner opened a lounge near the capitol barry hired some young hookers to tend bar in miniskirts and almost overnight the place became a favorite meat market for the legions of staffers who swarm the hill lowranking congressmen and midranking bureaucrats discovered the place and barry was on the map with his pockets full of cash his next venture was an upscale steak house two blocks from his lounge he catered to lobbyists and offered great steaks and wines at reasonable prices and before long senators were getting their preferred tables barry loved sports and bought lots of ticketsredskins capitals wizards georgetown hoyaswhich he gave away to his friends by this time he had founded his own governmental relations firm and it was growing rapidly he and his partner had a fight and barry bought his interest in their holdings alone wealthy and fueled by ambition barry set his sights on the top of his profession unrestrained by ethical considerations he became one of the most aggressive purveyors of influence in washington if a rich client wanted a new loophole in the tax code barry could hire someone to write it insert it convince his friends to support it and then do a masterful job of covering it up if a rich client needed to expand a factory back home barry could arrange a deal whereby the congressman would secure the earmark send the money home to the factory and pocket a sizable check for his reelection efforts everyone would be thrilled in his first brush with the law he was accused of slipping cash to a senior adviser to a us senator the charge didnt stick but the nickname did barry the backhander because he operated on the sleazier side of an often sleazy business barry knew the power of money and sex his yacht on the potomac became a notorious love boat famous for wild parties and plenty of young women he owned a golf course in south carolina where he took members of congress for long weekends usually without their wives for barry though the more powerful he became the more risks he was willing to take old friends drifted away frightened by troubles that seemed inevitable his name was mentioned in an ethics investigation in the house the washington post picked up his scent and barry rafko a man who had always craved attention was getting more than his share i had no idea no real way of knowing that the hunting lodge was one of his projects the corporate name changed again the paperwork was redone another closing was delayed then a new proposal my client wanted to lease the lodge for one year at the rate of a month with all rentals to be applied to the purchase price this led to a week of intense bickering but a deal was finally reached i reworked the contracts again and insisted my firm be paid half of our fee this was done and mr copeland and mr reed were somewhat relieved when the contracts were finally signed my client was an offshore company operating on the tiny island of st kitts and i still had no idea who was behind it the contracts were signed by an unseen corporate representative down there in the caribbean and shipped overnight to my office as per our agreement my client would wire into our law firm trust account the sum of and some change enough to cover the lease payments for the first two months plus the remainder of our fee plus some miscellaneous expenses i would in turn write a check to the sellers for each of the first two months then my client would replenish the account after twelve months of this the lease would be converted to a sale with our little firm due another sizable fee when the wired funds hit our bank the banker called to inform me that our trust account had just received million as opposed to i figured someone got carried away with the zeros plus there could be worse things than having far too much money in the bank but something didnt add up i tried to contact the shell company that was technically my client on st kitts but got the runaround i contacted the law school pal who had referred the case and he promised to look into the matter i distributed the first months rent and the attorneys fee to our firm and waited for instructions to wire out the excess days passed then weeks a month later the banker called to say that another million had just landed in our trust account by this time mr reed and mr copeland were deeply disturbed i instructed my banker to get rid of the moneywire it back to the source from whence it came and do so quickly he grappled with this for a couple of days only to find that the account in st kitts had been closed finally my law school pal emailed me instructions to wire half the money to an account in grand cayman and the other half to an account in panama as a smalltime lawyer i had zero experience wiring money to numbered accounts but a few moments of light google research revealed that i was walking blindly through some of the most notorious tax havens in the world i wished i had never agreed to work for the anonymous client in spite of the money the wire to panama bounced backsome million i yelled at my law school pal and he yelled at someone up the line the money stayed put for two months drawing interest though we could not ethically keep any of it ethics also required me to take all steps necessary to protect this unwanted money it was not mine and i certainly made no claim to it but nonetheless i had to safeguard it innocently or perhaps stupidly i had allowed the tainted money of barry the backhander to rest under the control of copeland reed amp bannister once he had possession of the hunting lodge barry did a quick renovation spruced it up a little built a spa and put in a heliport he leased a sikorsky s helicopter and it took about twenty minutes to haul ten of barrys best friends from dc to the hunting lodge on a typical friday afternoon several shuttles were made and the partying began by this time in his career he had cast aside most bureaucrats and lobbyists and concentrated primarily on congressmen and their chiefs of staff at the lodge everything was available great food and wine cuban cigars drugs thirtyyearold scotch and twentyyearold women an occasional grouse hunt got organized but the guests were usually more preoccupied with the stunning collection of tall blondes at their disposal the girl was from ukraine during the trialmy trialher handler said in thickly accented english that he had been paid cash for the girl who was taken to the hunting lodge and given a room the cash had been handed over by a thug who testified for the prosecution that he had been one of barrys many bagmen the girl died the autopsy revealed she had overdosed after a long night of partying with barry and his friends from washington there were rumors that she failed to wake up one morning while in bed with a us congressman though this could not be proven barry circled the wagons long before the authorities arrived on the scene whom the girl had slept with during her last night on earth would never be revealed a media storm erupted around barry his businesses his friends his jets yachts helicopters restaurants resorts and the width and depth of his sordid influence as the press stampeded to barry his cronies and clients sprinted away outraged members of congress chased down reporters and demanded hearings and investigations the story turned much worse when the girls mother was located in kiev she produced a birth certificate showing her late daughter to be only sixteen years old a sixteenyearold sex slave partying with members of congress at a hunting lodge in the allegheny mountains barely a twohour drive from the us capitol the original indictment ran on for a hundred pages and accused fourteen defendants of an astonishing variety of crimes i was one of the fourteen and my alleged crime had been what is commonly known as money laundering by allowing one of barry rafkos faceless corporations to park money in my firms trust account i had supposedly helped him take dirty cash he pilfered from clients scrub it up a bit offshore then turn it into a valuable assetthe hunting lodge i was also accused of helping barry hide money from the fbi the irs and others pretrial maneuvering eliminated some of the defendants several were allowed to peel off and either cooperate with the government or have their own separate trials my lawyer and i filed twentytwo motions from the day i was indicted until the day i went to trial and only one was granted and it was a useless win the department of justice through its fbi and us attorneys office in dc threw everything it had against barry rafko and his confederates including one congressman and one of his aides it didnt matter if a couple of us might be innocent nor did it matter that our version of the truth would be distorted by the government there i was sitting in a crowded courtroom with seven other defendants including the most nefarious political operative washington had produced in decades i was guilty all right guilty of stupidity for allowing myself to fall into such a mess after the jury was selected the us attorney offered me one last deal plead to one rico violation pay a fine of and serve two years once again i told him to go to hell i was innocent chapter mr victor westlake assistant director fbi hoover building please forward pennsylvania avenue washington dc dear mr westlake my name is malcolm bannister and i am an inmate at the federal prison camp at frostburg maryland on monday february i met with two of your agents investigating the murder of judge fawcettagents hanski and erardi nice guys and all but i got the feeling they were not too impressed with me and my story according to this mornings reports in the washington post new york times wall street journal and roanoke times you and your team are still chasing your tails and dont have much of a clue i have no way of knowing if you have a list of credible suspects but i can guarantee you the real killer is not on any list compiled by you and your team as i explained to hanski and erardi i know the identity of the killer and i know his motive in case hanski and erardi screwed up the details and by the way their note taking was not too impressive here is my idea of a deal i reveal the killer and you the government agree to my release from prison i will not consider some type of conditional suspension of my sentence i will not consider parole i walk out a free man with a new identity and protection by the guys on your side obviously such a deal will necessitate the involvement of the department of justice and the us attorneys offices in both the northern and the southern districts of virginia also i want the reward money to which i will be entitled according to the roanoke times this morning it has just been increased to please feel free to continue chasing your tails as a couple of former marines we really should talk you know where to find me sincerely malcolm bannister my celly is a nineteenyearold black kid from baltimore in for eight years for selling crack gerard is like a thousand other guys ive seen in the past five years a young black from the inner cities whose mother was a teenager when he was born and whose father was long gone he dropped out of school in the tenth grade and found a job as a dishwasher when his mother went to prison he moved in with his grandmother who was also raising a horde of cousins he started using crack then selling it in spite of a life on the streets gerard is a kindly soul with no mean streak he has no history of violence and no business wasting his life in prison hes one of a million young blacks being warehoused by the taxpayers were approaching million prisoners in this country by far the highest rate of incarceration in any semicivilized nation its not unusual to get a celly you really dont like i had one who required little sleep and he played his ipod throughout the night he had earphones which are required after pm but the volume was so high i could still hear the music it took me three months to get a transfer gerard though understands the rules he told me he once slept in an abandoned car for weeks and almost froze to death anything is better than that gerard and i begin each day at am when a buzzer wakes us we dress quickly in our prison work clothes careful to give each other as much space as our tenbytwelve cell will allow we make our bunks he has the top one and because of my seniority i have the bottom at we hustle over to the chow hall for breakfast the chow hall has invisible barriers that dictate where one sits and eats there is a section for the blacks one for the whites and one for the browns intermingling is frowned upon and almost never happens even though frostburg is a camp it is still a prison with a lot of stress one of the most important rules of etiquette is to respect each others space never cut in line never reach for anything if you want the salt and pepper ask someone to pass them please at louisville my prior home fights were not unusual in the chow hall and they were usually started when some jackass with sharp elbows infringed on someone elses space here though we eat slowly and with manners that are surprising for a bunch of convicted criminals out of our cramped cells we enjoy the wider spaces of the chow hall there is a lot of ribbing and crude jokes and talk of women ive known men who spent time in the hole or solitary confinement and the worst part of it is the lack of social interaction a few handle it well but most start cracking up after a few days even the worst loners and there are plenty of them in prison need people around them after breakfast gerard reports to work as a janitor scrubbing floors i have an hour of downtime before i report to the library and this is when i walk over to the coffee room and start reading newspapers again today there appears to be little progress in the fawcett investigation interestingly though his oldest son complained to a reporter from the post that the fbi is doing a lousy job of keeping the family updated no response from the fbi with each passing day the pressure mounts yesterday a reporter wrote that the fbi was interested in the former husband of naomi clary their divorce three years ago had been contentious with both parties accusing the other of adultery according to the reporter his sources were telling him the fbi had interrogated this exhusband at least twice the library is in an annex that also houses a small chapel and nurses station it is exactly forty feet long and thirty feet wide with four cubicles for privacy five desktop computers and three long tables where inmates are allowed to read write and do research there are also ten stacked tiers that hold at any given time about fifteen hundred books mostly hardbacks at frostburg we are allowed to keep up to ten paperbacks in our cells though virtually everyone has more an inmate may visit the library in his offhours and the rules are fairly flexible two books per week may be checked out and i spend half of my time keeping up with pastdue books i spend a fourth of my time as a jailhouse lawyer and today i have a new client roman comes to me from a small town in north carolina where he owned a pawnshop that specialized in fencing stolen goods guns primarily his suppliers were a couple of gangs of cokecrazed idiots who robbed fine homes in broad daylight possessing not the slightest hint of sophistication the thieves were caught in the act and within minutes were squealing on each other roman was soon dragged in and hit with all manner of federal violations he pleaded ignorance but it turns out his courtappointed lawyer was without a doubt the dumbest person in the courtroom i do not claim to be an expert on criminal law but any green firstyear law student could catalog the mistakes made by romans lawyer during the trial roman was convicted and sentenced to seven years and his case is now on appeal he hauls in his legal papers the same pile every inmate is allowed to keep in his cell and we go through them in my little office a cubicle littered with my personal stuff and offlimits to every other inmate roman will not shut up ranting about how bad his defense lawyer was and it doesnt take me long to agree iac ineffective assistance of counsel is a common complaint for those convicted at trial but its rarely grounds for an appellate reversal in nondeathpenalty cases im excited by the possibility of attacking the lousy performance of a lawyer whos still out there still making a living and pretending to be much better than he is i spend an hour with roman and we make an appointment for another meeting it was one of my early clients who told me about judge fawcett the man was desperate to get out of prison and he thought i could work miracles he knew precisely what was in the safe in the basement of that cabin and he was obsessed with getting his hands on it before it disappeared chapter im back in the wardens office and something is up hes wearing a dark suit starched white shirt paisley tie and his pointedtoe cowboy boots are fairly gleaming with fresh wax and polish hes still smug as ever but somewhat twitchy i dont know what you told them bannister hes saying but they like your story i hate to repeat myself but if this is your idea of a prank then youll pay dearly for it its not a prank sir i suspect the warden was eavesdropping next door and knows exactly what i told them they sent four agents here two days ago snooped all over the place wanted to know who you hung out with who you did legal work for who you played checkers with where you worked who you ate with who you showered with who you celled with and on and on i shower alone i guess theyre trying to figure out who your buddies are is that right i dont know sir but im not surprised i figured as much i knew the fbi was snooping around frostburg though i did not see the agents secrets are extremely hard to keep in prison especially when outsiders appear and start asking questions in my opinion and based on some experience it was a clumsy way to dig into my background well theyre back he says theyll be here at ten and they said it might take some time it is five minutes before am the same sharp pain hits my gut again and i try to breathe deeply without appearing obvious i shrug as if its no big deal whos coming i ask hell if i know seconds later his phone buzzes and his secretary relays a message were in the same room adjacent to the wardens office he of course is not present agents hanski and erardi are back along with a fierce young man named dunleavy an assistant us attorney from the southern district of virginia roanoke office im gathering steam gaining credibility and curiosity my little group of interrogators is looking more impressive though dunleavy is the youngest of the three he is a federal prosecutor and the other two are simply federal cops therefore dunleavy has seniority at this moment and seems rather full of himself not an unusual posture for a man in such a position he cant be more than five years out of law school and i assume hell do most of the talking obviously mr bannister he begins with an obnoxious condescending tone we wouldnt be here if we didnt have some interest in your little story little story what a prick can i call you malcolm he asks lets stick with mr bannister and mr dunleavy for now anyway i respond im an inmate and i havent been called mr bannister in years i kind of like the sound of it you got it he snaps then quickly reaches into a pocket he pulls out a slender recording device and places it on the table halfway between me on one side and the three of them on the other id like to record our conversation if thats okay and with that my cause takes a giant leap forward a week ago hanski and erardi were reluctant to remove their pens and take a few notes now the government wants to capture every word i shrug and say i dont care he flips a switch and says now you say you know who killed judge fawcett and you want to swap this information for a ticket out of here and once out you want our protection that the basic structure of the arrangement you got it i say mimicking his own words why should we believe you because i know the truth and because you guys are nowhere near it how do you know this i just do if you had a serious suspect you wouldnt be here talking to me are you in contact with the killer im not answering that question you gotta give us something mr bannister something that will make us feel better about this little deal of yours i wouldnt characterize it as little then well call it whatever you want why dont you explain it how do you see this big deal happening okay it has to be a secret highly confidential we have a written agreement approved by the us attorneys offices in both the northern district where i was prosecuted and sentenced and the southern district where this investigation is taking place judge slater who sentenced me will have to sign off on the agreement once weve agreed then ill give you the name of the killer you grab him investigate him and when the grand jury indicts him for the murder i will suddenly be transferred to another prison except i will not be serving any more time i leave here as though im being transferred but instead i go into your witness protection program my sentence will be commuted my record expunged my name changed and ill probably want some plastic surgery to alter my appearance ill get new papers new looks a nice federal job somewhere and to boot i get the reward money three stone faces stare at me dunleavy finally says is that all thats it and its not negotiable wow dunleavy mumbles as if in shock i guess youve had plenty of time to think about this far more than you what if youre wrong what if we pick up the wrong guy somehow get an indictment you walk then we cant prove a case thatll be your problem you screw up the prosecution then its your fault okay but once we have our man how much evidence will there be you have the entire federal government at your disposal certainly you guys can find enough evidence once you have the killer i cant do everything for you for drama dunleavy stands and stretches and paces to one end of the room as if tortured and deep in thought then he returns takes his seat glares at me i think were wasting our time here he says a bad bluff delivered lamely by a kid who has no business even being in the room hanski the veteran lowers his head slightly and blinks his eyes he cant believe how bad this guy is erardi never takes his eyes off me and i can sense the desperation i can also feel the tension between the fbi and the us attorneys office which is not at all unusual i slowly get to my feet and say youre right were wasting our time im not meeting with you again until you boys send in someone with more than peach fuzz ive given you my deal and the next time we chat i want mr victor westlake at the table along with one of your bosses mr dunleavy and if youre in the room then ill walk out with that i leave i glance back as i close the door and hanski is rubbing his temples theyll be back the meeting could have been scheduled to take place at the hoover building on pennsylvania avenue in washington victor westlake would have been happy to return home briefly see the boss check on his staff have a nice dinner with his family and so on however the director wanted to take a quick road trip he needed to get away from the building for a few hours so he loaded his entourage onto a sleek private jet one of four controlled by the fbi and took off for roanoke a fortyminute flight his name was george mctavey aged sixtyone a career man and not a political appointee though his politics currently had him in hot water with the president according to the relentless gossip inside the beltway mctavey was barely hanging on to his job the president wanted a new director of the fbi after fourteen years mctavey needed to go morale was low inside the hoover building so the gossip went in the past few months mctavey rarely passed up a chance to leave washington if only for a few hours and it was almost refreshing to focus on such an oldfashioned crime as murder he had been fighting terror for ten years now and there had yet to be even the slightest hint that fawcetts death was related to alqaeda or homegrown cells gone were the glory days of fighting organized crime and chasing counterfeiters in roanoke a black suv was waiting at the bottom of the jets staircase and mctavey and his team were rushed away as if snipers were watching and waiting a minute later they rolled to a stop outside the freezer and hustled inside a field visit by the director had two purposes the first was to raise the spirits of the task force and let them know that in spite of their lack of progress their work had the highest priority the second was to ratchet up the pressure after a quick tour of the makeshift facilities and a round of handshakes that would have impressed a politician director mctavey was led to the largest meeting room for the briefing he sat next to victor westlake an old friend and they munched on doughnuts as a senior investigator gave a windy summary of the latest which wasnt much at all mctavey didnt need to be briefed in person since the murder hed been talking to westlake at least twice a day lets talk about this bannister fellow mctavey said after half an hour of a dull narrative that was going nowhere another report was quickly passed around the table this is the latest westlake said we started with high school classmates then moved on to college and law school and there are no viable suspects no record of any friends or close acquaintances of no one really who ever crossed paths with judge fawcett no gang members or drug dealers or serious criminals next we tracked down as many of his former clients as possible though this was difficult because we cant get access to a lot of his old files again no one of interest there he did the smalltownlawyer gig for about ten years with two older africanamerican lawyers and it was a squeakyclean operation did he do business in judge fawcetts court mctavey asked theres no record of him handling a case there he didnt do much federal work and besides he was in the northern district of virginia its fair to say that mr bannister was not a widely soughtafter trial lawyer so you believe that whoever killed fawcett is someone mr bannister met in prison assuming of course we believe he knows the truth correct he served the first twentytwo months of his sentence in louisville kentucky a mediumsecurity facility with two thousand inmates he had three different cell mates and he worked in the laundry and the kitchen he also developed his skills as a jailhouse lawyer and actually helped at least five inmates get out of prison we have a list of about fifty men he probably knew fairly well but frankly its impossible to know everyone he came into contact with at louisville and the same at frostburg hes been there for the past three years and has served time with a thousand men how long is your list mctavey asked we have about names give or take but we dont feel too confident about most of these guys how many were sentenced by fawcett six so theres no clear suspect in bannisters prison history not yet but were still digging bear in mind this is our second theory the one that assumes whoever killed the judge was carrying a grudge because of a bad outcome in his court our first theory is that it was an oldfashioned murderrobbery do you have a third theory mctavey asked the jealous exhusband of the dead secretary westlake replied thats not credible right right do you have a fourth theory no not at this time director mctavey sipped his coffee and said this is really bad coffee two flunkies at the far end of the room bolted to attention and disappeared in search of something better sorry westlake said it was widely known that the director was a serious coffee man and to provide a brew that didnt measure up was an embarrassment and bannisters background again he asked ten years rico got caught up in the barry rafko mess a few years back though he wasnt a big player he had handled some land deals for barry and got himself convicted so he was not in bed with sixteenyearold girls oh no that was just our congressmen bannister appears to be a good guy former marine and all just picked the wrong client well was he guilty the jury felt so as did the judge you dont get ten years unless youve screwed up somewhere another cup of coffee was placed in front of the director who sniffed it then finally took a sip as everyone stopped breathing then another sip and everyone exhaled why do we believe bannister mctavey asked westlake quickly passed the buck hanski agent chris hanski was sitting on go he cleared his throat and dove in well im not sure we believe bannister but he makes a good impression ive interviewed him twice watched him carefully and ive seen no signs of deception hes bright shrewd and has nothing to gain by lying to us after five years in prison its quite possible he bumped into someone who wanted to knock off judge fawcett or to rob him and we really have no idea who this person might be right hanski looked at victor westlake who said as of today thats right but were still digging i dont like our chances of discovering the identity of the killer based on who mr bannister may have bumped into in prison mctavey said sounding perfectly logical we could be chasing dead ends for the next ten years whats the downside of cutting a deal with bannister look the guy is a whitecollar crook who has already served five years for criminal activity that seems rather harmless in the scheme of things dont you think so vic vic was nodding gravely mctavey pressed on so the guy gets out of prison its not as though were releasing a serial killer or a sexual predator if the guy is right then this case is solved and we can go home if the guy is conning us whats the big deal at that moment no one around the table could envision a big deal who will object to it mctavey asked the us attorneys office is not on board westlake said no surprise there mctavey said im meeting with the attorney general tomorrow afternoon i can neutralize the us attorney any other problems hanski cleared his throat again well sir mr bannister insists he will not give us the name until a federal judge signs an order of commutation im not sure how this will work but the commuting of his sentence will become automatic when the grand jury indicts our mystery guy mctavey brushed him off we got lawyers to handle all that does bannister have one not that i know of does he need one ill be happy to ask him hanski said lets get this deal done okay mctavey said impatiently theres a big upside and a small downside based on our progress so far were due for a break chapter a month has passed since the murders of judge fawcett and naomi clary newspaper reports of the investigation have become shorter and less frequent the fbi had no comment in the beginning and after a month of frantic work with nothing to show for it the task force seems to have vanished now in the past month an earthquake in bolivia a schoolyard shooting in kansas the overdose of one rap star and the detoxification of another have all conspired to divert our attention to more important matters this is all good news for me the investigation may appear quiet on the surface but internally the pressure grows my worst nightmare is a bold headline announcing the arrest of someone but that appears less and less likely the days pass and i wait patiently i see clients by appointment only i meet them at my cubicle in the library they haul in their legal papers a stack of assorted pleadings orders motions and rulings that as inmates we have the right to keep in our cells the cos cannot touch our legal papers for most of my clients two appointments will suffice to convince them that there is nothing to be done with their cases during the first appointment we review the basics and i go through their papers then ill spend a few hours doing research during the second appointment i usually deliver the bad news that theyre out of luck theres no loophole to save them in five years i have helped six inmates gain early release from prison needless to say this adds mightily to my reputation as a masterful jailhouse lawyer but i caution every new client that the odds are stacked heavily against him this is what i explain to young otis carter a twentythreeyearold father of two wholl spend the next fourteen months here at frostburg for a crime that should not have been a crime otis is a country boy a baptist with a deep faith a happily married electrician who still cannot believe hes in a federal prison he and his grandfather were indicted and charged with violating the civil war battlefield and artifact preservation act of as amended in and his grandfather aged seventyfour and suffering from emphysema is in a federal medical center in tennessee also serving fourteen months because of his medical condition he will cost the taxpayers about a month the carters were hunting for artifacts on their twohundredacre farm adjacent to the new market battlefield state historical park in the shenandoah valley less than an hour from my hometown of winchester the farm has been in the family for over a hundred years and from the time he could walk otis accompanied his grandfather as he went digging for civil war relics and souvenirs over the decades his family assembled an impressive collection of minie balls cannonballs canteens brass buttons pieces of uniforms a couple of battle flags and several dozen guns of all varieties this they had done legally it is illegal to remove artifacts and relics from a national historic landmark which is federal land and the carters were well aware of this law their private little museum in a converted hay barn was stocked with items they had found on their own property however in the civil war battlefield and artifact preservation act was amended again in response to efforts by preservationists to restrict development near battlefields some lastminute language was added to a onehundredpage amendment it became illegal to dig for relics within two miles of the borders of a national historic landmark regardless of whose land one happened to be digging on the carters were not informed of the new rules indeed the language was buried so deep in the amendment virtually no one knew about it over the years the federal agents had harassed otiss grandfather and accused him of digging on protected land they periodically stopped by his home and demanded to see his museum when the law changed they waited patiently until they caught otis and his grandfather scouring a wooded area of carter property with metal detectors the carters hired a lawyer who advised them to plead guilty criminal intent is no longer required for many federal crimes lack of knowledge is no defense as the victim of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico an often misguided and famously flexible federal law i am keenly interested in the proliferation of the federal criminal code now at twentyseven thousand pages and counting the constitution names only three federal offenses treason piracy and counterfeiting today there are over fortyfive hundred federal crimes and the number continues to grow as congress gets tougher on crime and federal prosecutors become more creative in finding ways to apply all their new laws otis could possibly attack the constitutionality of the amended law this would take several years of litigation and would drag on long after hes paroled and back home with his family as i explain this to him during our second meeting he seems to lose interest if he cant get out right now why bother but the case intrigues me we decide to discuss it later if my grand scheme falls flat i might take otiss case and fight all the way to the supreme court that will keep me busy for the next five years the supreme court has twice refused to consider my case though we couldnt prove it there was a strong feeling that my appeals were hurried through the system because of the governments enthusiasm in putting away barry rafko and his confederates me included i was convicted in november and sentenced two months later to ten years at my sentencing i was remanded which meant i was taken into custody a few lucky federal felons are allowed to selfsurrender or remain free until ordered to report to a facility they have time to prepare but most are not given this luxury my lawyer thought i would get five or six years barry the backhander the star defendant the target the colorful villain everyone enjoyed hating got twelve years surely i deserved less than half the time of that slimeball dionne my beautiful and loving and fiercely supportive wife was in the courtroom sitting bravely next to my humiliated father i was the only one of the eight sentenced that day and as i stood before judge slater with my lawyer to my right i had trouble breathing this cannot be happening i said to myself over and over as i took in the blurred images around me i dont deserve this i can explain i am not guilty slater scolded and preached and played for the press and i felt like a battered heavyweight in the fifteenth round sagging on the ropes covering my face waiting for the next shot to the face my knees were putty i was sweating when judge slater said ten years i heard a gasp behind me as dionne collapsed in tears as they led me away i glanced back for the last time ive seen this a hundred times in movies tv shows and in reallife court reportingthe last frantic farewell look of the condemned what do you think about as youre leaving the courtroom and youre not going home the truth is that nothing is clear there are too many random thoughts too much fear anger and raw emotion to understand what is happening dionne had both hands over her mouth in shock crying tears everywhere my father had his arm around her trying to console her that was the last thing i sawmy beautiful wife distraught and destroyed now shes married to someone else thanks to the federal government my jurors came from the district a few appeared bright and educated but most were not shall i say sophisticated after three days of deliberations they announced to the judge that they were making little progress and who could blame them by unloading a sizable chunk of the federal code the prosecutors had adopted the timeworn strategy of throwing as much mud as possible against the wall and hoping something would stick this overkill had turned what should have been a relatively easy case against barry rafko and the congressman into a legal quagmire i had spent countless hours working on my own defense and i couldnt understand all of the prosecutions theories from the beginning my lawyer had predicted a hung jury after four days of deliberations judge slater delivered what is commonly referred to in trial circles as the dynamite charge this is basically a demand that the jurors get back there and reach a verdict at all costs youre not going home until we have a verdict such a charge rarely works but i wasnt so lucky an hour later the exhausted and emotionally spent jurors returned with unanimous verdicts against all defendants on all counts it was obvious to me and many others that they did not understand most of the code sections and intricate theories used by the prosecution one of the jurors was later quoted as saying we just assumed they were guilty or else they wouldnt have been charged in the first place i used this quote in my appeals but it apparently went unheard i watched the jurors carefully throughout the trial and they were overwhelmed from the opening statements and why shouldnt they have been nine different lawyers gave their versions of what had happened the courtroom had to be redesigned and renovated to make room for all of the defendants and all their lawyers the trial was a spectacle a farce a ridiculous way to search for the truth but as i learned the truth was not important perhaps in another era a trial was an exercise in the presentation of facts the search for truth and the finding of justice now a trial is a contest in which one side will win and the other side will lose each side expects the other to bend the rules or to cheat so neither side plays fair the truth is lost in the melee two months later i returned to the courtroom for the sentencing my lawyer had requested that i be allowed to selfsurrender but judge slater was not impressed with our request after he gave me ten years he ordered me into remanded custody it is indeed remarkable that more federal judges are not shot for weeks afterward i conceived all manner of schemes to inflict a slow torturous death upon slater i was taken to the courtroom by the us marshals and led to a holding cell in the courthouse then to the dc jail where i was stripped searched given an orange jumpsuit and placed in a crowded cell with six other inmates there were only four cots the first night i sat on the concrete floor just me and my thin blanket with holes in it the jail was a noisy zoo overcrowded and understaffed and sleep was impossible i was too frightened and too stunned to close my eyes so i sat in a corner and listened to the yells and screams and threats until dawn i stayed there a week eating little sleeping little urinating in a filthy open toilet that didnt flush and was within ten feet of my cell mates at one time there were ten of us in the cell i never showered a bowel movement required an urgent plea to visit the shit room down the hall the transporting of federal prisoners is done by the us marshals and it is a nightmare prisoners of all security levels are lumped together with no regard for our crimes or the risks we might pose therefore we were all treated like savage murderers with every movement my hands were cuffed my ankles chained and i was attached to the inmate in front of me and the one behind the mood is nasty the marshals have one jobto move the inmates safely with no escapes the inmates many of them rookies like me are frightened frustrated and bewildered fourteen of us left dc on a bus an unmarked rig that had hauled schoolchildren decades earlier and headed south the handcuffs and chains were not removed a marshal with a shotgun sat in the front seat after four hours we stopped at a county jail in north carolina we were given a wet sandwich and allowed to urinate behind the bus still chained and bound the handcuffs and leg irons were never removed after two hours of waiting we left with three additional prisoners and headed west for the next six days we stopped at county jails in north carolina tennessee and alabama picking up prisoners occasionally dropping one off sleeping in a different cell each night the county jails were the worst tiny cramped cells with no heat airconditioning sunlight or suitable sanitation food that dogs would ignore little water bubbas for guards a much higher threat of violence local inmates who resented the intrusion of federal prisoners i could not believe conditions so deplorable existed in this country but i was naive as our journey continued and our moods soured there was a marked increase in the level of bitching on the bus this ceased when a veteran inmate explained the concept of diesel therapy complain or make trouble and the marshals will keep you on the bus for weeks and give you a free tour of dozens of county jails there was no hurry the marshals can transport prisoners during daylight hours only thus the distances tend to be short they had absolutely no interest in our comfort or privacy we eventually made it to a distribution center in atlanta a notoriously bad place where i was kept in solitary confinement for twentythree hours a day while my paperwork inched across someones desk in washington after three weeks of this i was losing my sanity nothing to read no one to chat with terrible food bad guards eventually we were reshackled and loaded onto another bus and driven to the atlanta airport where we boarded an unmarked cargo plane chained to a hard plastic bench and sitting knee to knee we flew to miami though we had no idea where we were headed one of the marshals kindly informed us in miami we picked up a few more then flew to new orleans where we sat in suffocating humidity for an hour as the marshals loaded on even more on the plane we were allowed to talk and the chatter was refreshing most of us had just endured days of solitary so we plunged into conversation this was not the first trip for some of the boys and they told other stories of being transported in chains courtesy of the federal government i began to hear descriptions of prison life at dark we arrived in oklahoma city where we were shuffled onto a bus and taken to another distribution center the place was not quite as bad as atlanta but by then i was thinking about suicide after five days in solitary confinement we were reshackled and taken back to the airport we flew into texas world capital of lethal injection and i daydreamed of seeing the needle stuck into my arm and floating away eight tough guys all hispanic boarded con air in dallas and we flew to little rock then memphis then cincinnati where my flying days ended i spent six nights in a tough city jail before a pair of marshals drove me to the prison in louisville kentucky louisville is five hundred miles from my hometown of winchester virginia had i been allowed to selfsurrender my father and i would have made the drive in about eight hours he would have dropped me off at the front gate and said goodbye fortyfour days twentysix of them in solitary too many stops to remember there is no logic in this system and no one cares no one is watching the real tragedy of the federal criminal system is not the absurdities it is the ruined and wasted lives congress demands long harsh sentences and for the violent thugs these are appropriate hardened criminals are locked away in us pens fortresses where gangs are rampant and murders are routine but the majority of federal prisoners are nonviolent and many are convicted of crimes that involved little if any criminal activity for the rest of my life i will be regarded as a criminal and i refuse to accept this i will have a life freed from my past and far away from the tentacles of the federal government chapter rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides the only mechanism for the commutation of a prison sentence its logic is brilliant and fits my situation perfectly if an inmate can solve another crime one that the feds have an interest in then the inmates sentence can be reduced of course this takes the cooperation of the investigating authoritiesfbi dea cia atf and so onand of the court from which the inmate was sentenced if all goes as planned i may soon have the privilege of seeing the honorable judge slater and it will be on my terms the feds are back the warden is much nicer to me these days he figures he has a prize that some big people desire and he needs to be in the thick of things i take a seat at his desk and he asks if i want coffee this offer is almost too surreal to comprehendthe almighty warden offering coffee to an inmate sure i say black he punches a button and relays our wishes to a secretary i notice hes wearing cuff links today a good sign got the big boys here today mal he informs me smugly as if hes coordinating all efforts to find the murderer since we are such good pals now hes using my first name until now its been bannister this and bannister that who i ask the director of the task force victor westlake from washington and a bunch of lawyers id say you have their attention i cannot keep from smiling but only for a second this guy who killed judge fawcett was he ever here at frostburg the warden asks sorry warden i cant answer that either here or louisville i take it maybe or maybe i knew him before prison he frowns and rubs his chin i see he mumbles the coffee arrives on a tray and for the first time in years i drink from a cup not made of plastic or paper we kill a few minutes talking about nothing at his secretary informs him through the intercom on his desk they are in place i follow him through the door and into the same conference room five men in the same dark suits same white shirts with buttondown collars same bland ties if i had seen them in a crowd from half a mile away i could have said yep feds we go through the usual stiff introductions and the warden reluctantly excuses himself i sit on one side of the table and my five new buddies sit on the other victor westlake is in the middle and to his right are agent hanski and a new face agent sasswater neither of these two will say a word to the left of westlake are the two assistant us attorneysmangrum from the southern district of virginia and craddock from the northern the rookie dunleavy got left behind thunderstorms had rolled through just after midnight and westlake begins by saying quite a storm last night huh i narrow my eyes and stare at him seriously you want to talk about the weather this really pisses him off but hes a pro a smile a grunt then no mr bannister im not here to talk about the weather my boss thinks we should make a deal with you so thats why im here great and yes it was quite a storm wed like to hear your terms i think you know them we use rule we sign an agreement all of us in which i give you the name of the man who killed judge fawcett you pick him up investigate him do your thing and when a federal grand jury indicts him i walk that very day i transfer out of frostburg and disappear into witness protection no more time no more criminal record no more malcolm bannister the deal is confidential locked away buried and signed by the attorney general the ag yes sir i dont trust you or anyone in this room i dont trust judge slater or any other federal judge prosecutor assistant prosecutor fbi agent or anybody else working for the federal government the paperwork must be perfect the deal unbreakable when the killer is indicted i walk period will you use an attorney no sir i can handle that fair enough mangrum suddenly produces a file and removes several copies of a document he slides one across the table and it comes to a rest in front of me in perfect position i glance at it and my heart begins to pound the heading is the same as all of the motions and orders filed in my case in the united states district court of washington dc united states of america versus malcolm w bannister in the center of the page in all caps are the words rule motion this is a proposed court order mangrum says its just a starting point but weve spent some time on it two days later i am placed in the rear seat of a ford suv and driven away from frostburg my first exit from the camp since the day i arrived three years earlier no leg chains today but my wrists are cuffed in front of me my two buddies are us marshals names withheld but they are nice enough after we get through the weather one of them asks if ive heard any good jokes lock away six hundred men and give them plenty of idle time and the jokes come in waves clean or dirty i ask though there are few clean jokes in prison oh dirty of course the driver says i tell a couple and get some good laughs as the miles fly by were on interstate zipping through hagerstown and the feeling of freedom is exhilarating in spite of the handcuffs i can almost taste the life out there i watch the traffic and dream of owning and driving a car again of going anywhere i see fastfood restaurants at the interchanges and i salivate at the thought of a burger and fries i see a couple walking hand in hand into a store and i can almost feel the touch of her flesh a beer sign in the window of a bar makes me thirsty a billboard advertising caribbean cruises takes me to another world i feel as if ive been locked up for a century we turn south on interstate and are soon in the washingtonbaltimore sprawl three hours after we leave frostburg we arrive in the basement of the federal courthouse in downtown dc inside the building the handcuffs are removed i proceed with one marshal in front of me the other behind the meeting takes place in the chambers of judge slater whos as prickly as ever and seems to have aged twenty years in the past five he considers me a criminal and barely acknowledges my presence fine i dont care it is evident that a lot of conversations have taken place between his office the us attorneys office the fbi and the attorney general of the united states at one point i count eleven people around the table the rule motion with the attached agreement has increased in size and runs for twentytwo pages i have read every word five times i even demanded some of my own language the agreement in short gives me everything i want freedom a new identity government protection and the reward money of after the usual throat clearing judge slater takes charge we will now go on the record he says and his court reporter begins her stenography even though this is a confidential matter and the courts order will be sealed i want a record of this hearing a pause as he shuffles papers this is a motion by the united states for rule relief bannister have you read this entire motion agreement and proposed order i have your honor and i believe you are an attorney or shall i say were an attorney thats correct your honor does the motion agreement and order meet your approval damn right it does old boy yes sir he goes around the table and asks the same questions its all a formality because everyone has already agreed and most important the attorney general has signed the agreement slater looks at me and says you understand mr bannister that if the name you provide does not lead to an indictment then the agreement is null and void after twelve months your sentence will not be commuted and you will serve the remaining time in full yes sir and that until there is an indictment you will remain in the custody of the bureau of prisons yes sir after more discussion about the terms of the agreement judge slater signs the order and the hearing is over he does not say farewell and i do not curse him the way id like to again its a miracle that more federal judges are not whacked i am swarmed by an entourage and led down the stairs to a room where more dark suits are waiting a video camera has been set up for my benefit and mr victor westlake is pacing i am asked to sit at the end of the table face the camera and offered something to drink its a very nervous bunch desperate to hear me utter the name chapter his name is quinn rucker black male aged thirtyeight from southwest dc convicted two years ago of distributing narcotics and sentenced to seven years i met him at frostburg he walked away about three months ago and has not been seen since he comes from a large family of drug dealers whove been active and successful for many years these are not street dealers by any means they are businessmen with contacts up and down the east coast they try to avoid violence but they are not afraid of it they are disciplined tough and resourceful several have gone to prison several have been killed to them thats just part of the overhead i pause take a breath the room is silent at least five of the dark suits are taking notes one has a laptop and has already pulled up the file on quinn rucker who had made several cuts and was on the fbis topfifty list of suspects primarily because of his time with me at frostburg and his escape from it as i said i met quinn at frostburg and we became friends like a lot of inmates he was convinced i could file a magic motion and get him out but not in his case he was not doing well in prison because frostburg was his first gig this happens to some of the new guys who have not seen other prisons they dont appreciate the camp atmosphere anyway as his time dragged on he got restless he couldnt imagine doing five more years he has a wife a couple of kids cash from the family business and a lot of insecurities he was convinced some of his cousins were moving in taking over his role stealing his share i listened to a lot of this but didnt swallow all of it these gang guys are generally full of crap and like to exaggerate their stories especially when it comes to money and violence but i liked quinn he was probably the best friend ive made yet in prison we never celled together but we were close do you know why he walked away victor westlake asks i think so quinn was selling pot and doing well he was also smoking a lot of it as you know the quickest way out of a federal camp is to get caught with drugs or alcohol strictly prohibited quinn got word through a snitch that the cos knew about his business and they were about to bust him hes extremely smart and savvy and he never kept the drugs in his cell like most of the guys who sell on the black market he hid his inventory in common areas the heat was on and he knew if he got caught hed be sent away to a tougher place so he walked im sure he didnt walk far probably had someone waiting close by do you know where he is now i nod take my time say he has a cousin dont know his name but he owns a couple of strip clubs in norfolk virginia near the naval base find the cousin and youll find quinn under what name i dont know but its not quinn rucker how do you know this sorry but thats none of your business at this point westlake nods at an agent by the door and he disappears the search is on lets talk about judge fawcett westlake says okay i reply i cannot count the number of times i have lived for this moment i have rehearsed this in the darkness of my cell when i couldnt sleep i have written it in narrative form then destroyed it i have said the words out loud while taking long lonely walks around the edges of frostburg its hard to believe this is finally happening a big part of his gangs business was running cocaine from miami to the major cities along the east coast primarily the southern legatlanta charleston raleigh charlotte richmond and so on interstate was the favored route because it is so heavily traveled but the gang used every state highway and county road on the map most of it was mule running they would pay a driver to rent a car and haul a trunkload of coke to a distribution center inpick a city the mule would make the drop then turn around and drive back to south florida according to quinn percent of the coke snorted in manhattan gets there in a car rented by a mule in miami and driven north as if on legitimate business detection is virtually impossible when mules are caught its because someone snitched anyway quinn had a nephew who was working his way up the ladder of the family business the kid was mule running and he got caught speeding on interstate just outside of roanoke he was in a rented avis van and said he was delivering antique furniture to a store in georgetown there was indeed furniture in the van but the real cargo was cocaine with a street value of million the state trooper was suspicious and called for a backup the nephew knew the rules and refused to allow a search of the van the second trooper was a rookie a real eager beaver and he began poking around the cargo bay of the van he had no warrant no probable cause and no permission to search when he found the cocaine he went ballistic and everything changed i pause and take a sip of water the agent with the laptop is pecking away no doubt sending directives all over the east coast what is the nephews name westlake asks i dont know but i dont think his last name was rucker within his family there are several last names and a fair number of aliases and so the nephews case was assigned to judge fawcett westlake asks prompting me along though no one seems to be in a hurry theyre hanging on every word and anxious to find quinn rucker but they want the whole story yes and quinn hired a big lawyer in roanoke one who assured him the search was blatantly unconstitutional if the search was thrown out by fawcett then so was the evidence no evidence no trial no conviction nothing somewhere in the process quinn learned that judge fawcett might look more favorably upon the nephews case if some cash could change hands serious cash according to quinn the deal was brokered by their lawyer and no i do not know the name of the lawyer how much cash westlake asks half a million this is met with great skepticism and i am not surprised i found it hard to believe too a federal judge taking a bribe but then i was also shocked when an fbi agent was caught spying for the russians i guess under the right circumstances a man will do just about anything lets stay on subject here westlake says irritated sure quinn and the family paid the bribe fawcett took the bribe the case crept along until one day when there was a hearing on the nephews motion to exclude the evidence that was seized during a bad search much to everyones surprise the judge ruled against the nephew in favor of the government and ordered a trial with no defense the jury found the kid guilty but the lawyer felt good about their chances on appeal the case is still rattling on appeal in the meantime the nephew is serving an eighteenyear sentence in alabama this is a nice story mr bannister westlake says but how do you know quinn rucker killed the judge because he told me he was going to do it out of revenge and to retrieve his money he talked about it often he knew exactly where the judge lived worked and liked to spend his weekends he suspected the money was hidden somewhere in the cabin and he firmly believed he wasnt the only one whod been ripped off by fawcett and because he told me mr westlake he will target me as soon as hes arrested i might walk out of prison but ill always look over my shoulder these people are very smartlook at your own investigation nothing not a clue they hold grudges and they are very patient quinn waited almost three years to kill the judge hell wait twenty years to get me if hes so smart why would he tell you all of this westlake asks simple like a lot of inmates quinn thought i could file some brilliant motion find a loophole and get him out of prison he said he would pay me said i would get half of whatever he took off judge fawcett ive heard this before and since i looked at quinns file and told him there was nothing i could do they have to believe im telling the truth if quinn rucker is not indicted then ill spend the next five years in prison were still on opposite sides me and them but were slowly reaching common ground chapter six hours later two black fbi agents paid the cover charge at the velvet club three blocks away from the norfolk naval base they were dressed like construction workers and mixed easily with the crowd which was half white half black half sailors and half civilians the dancers were also halfandhalf affirmative action all around two surveillance vans waited in the parking lot along with a dozen more agents quinn rucker had been spotted photographed and identified entering the club at he worked as a bartender and when he left his post at to go to the restroom he was followed inside the restroom the two agents confronted him after a brief discussion they agreed to leave through a rear door quinn understood the situation and made no sudden moves nor did he seem surprised as with many escapees the end of the run was in many ways a relief the dreams of freedom crumble under the challenges of living normally someone is always back there he was handcuffed and taken to the fbi office in norfolk in an interrogation room the two black agents served him coffee and began a friendly chat the crime was nothing more than an escape and he had no defense he was dead guilty and headed back to prison they asked quinn if he was willing to answer a few basic questions about his escape some three months earlier he said sure why not he volunteered that he had met an unnamed accomplice not far from the camp at frostburg and had been driven back to dc he hung around there for a few days but his presence was not well received escapees draw attention and his boys did not appreciate the possibility of the fbi poking around and looking for him he began muling cocaine from miami to atlanta but the work was slow he was damaged goods and his syndicate as he called it was wary of him he saw his wife and kids occasionally but knew the danger of getting too close to home he spent time with an old girlfriend in baltimore but she too was less than excited about his presence he drifted around picking up an occasional drug run then got lucky when his cousin gave him a job tending bar at the velvet club next door in a larger interrogation room two of the fbis veteran interrogators were listening to the conversation another team was upstairs waiting and listening if things went well it would be a long night for quinn things had to go well for the fbi with no physical evidence so far it was imperative that the interrogation produce some proof the fbi was worried though because they were dealing with a man whod been around the block a few times it was unlikely their suspect could be intimidated into saying much as soon as quinn was taken out the back door of the velvet club fbi agents cornered his cousin and demanded information the cousin knew the ropes and had little to say until he was threatened with charges for harboring a fugitive he had an impressive criminal record state charges and another indictment would likely send him back to the pen he preferred life on the outside and began singing quinn was living and working under the assumed name of jackie todd though his wages were being paid in cash and off the books the cousin led the fbi agents to a rundown trailer park a half mile away and showed them the furnished mobile home quinn was leasing month to month parked next to the trailer was a hummer h model with north carolina license plates the cousin explained that quinn preferred to walk to work and hide the hummer weather permitting within an hour the fbi had a search warrant for the trailer and the hummer which was towed to a police lot in norfolk opened and examined the main door of the mobile home was locked but flimsy one good jolt with a bat hammer and the agents were inside the place was remarkably neat and clean working with a purpose six agents combed the place from side to side twelve feet and from end to end fifty feet in the only bedroom between the mattress and the box spring they found quinns wallet keys and cell phone the wallet contained about in cash a fake north carolina drivers license and two prepaid visa credit cards valued at each the cell phone was of the disposable prepaid variety perfect for a man on the run under the bed the agents found a smith amp wesson shortbarrel caliber handgun loaded with hollowpoint bullets handling it carefully the agents immediately assumed it was the same handgun used to kill judge fawcett and naomi clary the key chain included a key to a ministorage unit two miles away in a drawer in the kitchen an agent found quinns home officea couple of manila files with scant paperwork one form though was a sixmonth lease agreement for a unit at macons ministorage signed by jackie todd the lead investigator called roanoke where a federal magistrate was on duty and a search warrant was emailed back to norfolk the file also included a north carolina car title issued to jackie todd for the hummer h no liens were noted thus it was safe to assume mr todd had paid in full on the spot either in cash or by check no checkbook or bank statements were found in the drawer none were expected a bill of sale for the vehicle revealed that it was purchased on february from a usedcar lot in roanoke february was two days after the bodies were found fresh search warrant in hand two agents entered jackie todds tiny unit at macons ministorage under the careful and suspecting gaze of mr macon himself concrete floor unpainted cinderblock walls a solitary lightbulb stuck in the ceiling there were five cardboard boxes stacked against one wall a quick look revealed some old clothes a pair of muddy combat boots a millimeter glock pistol with the registration number filed off and finally a metal box stuffed neatly with cash the agents took all five cardboard boxes thanked mr macon for his hospitality and hurried away simultaneously the name jackie r todd was being run through the national crime information center computer system there was a hit in roanoke virginia at midnight quinn was moved next door and introduced to special agents pankovits and delocke they began by explaining they were used by the fbi to interrogate escapees this was nothing more than a routine briefing a little factfinding probe that they always enjoyed because who wouldnt love to talk to an escapee and get all the details it was late and if quinn wanted to get some sleep in the county jail they would be happy to start first thing in the morning he declined and said he would like to get it over with sandwiches and soft drinks were brought in the mood was lighthearted and the agents were extremely cordial pankovits was white and delocke was black and quinn seemed to enjoy their company he nibbled on a hamandswiss while they told a story about an inmate whod spent twentyone years on the run the fbi sent them all the way to thailand to bring him home what great fun they asked about his escape and movements in the days that followed it questions and answers that had already been covered by his first interrogation quinn refused to identify his accomplice and gave them no names of anyone who had helped him along the way this was fine they did not press and seemed to have no interest in going after anyone else after an hour of friendly chitchat pankovits remembered that they had not read him his miranda rights there was no harm in this they said because his crime was obvious and he had not implicated himself in anything other than the escape no big deal but if he wanted to continue he would have to waive his rights this he did by signing a form by this time he was being called quinn and they were andy for pankovits and jesse for delocke they carefully reconstructed his movements over the past three months and quinn did a surprisingly thorough job of recalling dates places and events the agents were impressed and commended him on having such a fine memory they paid particular attention to his earnings all in cash of course but how much for each job so on the second run from miami to charleston pankovits said smiling at his notes the one a week after last new years quinn you got how much in cash i believe it was six thousand right right both agents scribbled furiously as if they believed every single word uttered by their subject quinn said hed been living and working in norfolk since midfebruary about a month he lived with his cousin and a couple of his girlfriends in a large apartment not far from the velvet club he was being paid in cash food drink sex and pot so quinn delocke said as he tallied up a pile of numbers looks to me as though youve earned about since you left frostburg all cash no taxes not bad for three months work i guess how much of this have you spent pankovits asked quinn shrugged as if it really didnt matter now i dont know most of it it takes a lot of money to move around when you were running the drugs from miami and back how did you rent cars delocke asked i didnt rent them someone else did gave me the keys my job was to drive carefully slowly and not get stopped by the cops fair enough and both agents happily concurred did you buy a vehicle pankovits asked without looking up from his note taking no quinn said with a smile silly question you cant buy a car when youre on the run and have no papers of course not at the freezer in roanoke victor westlake sat before a large screen frozen at the image of quinn rucker a hidden camera in the interrogation room was sending the video across the commonwealth to a makeshift room outfitted with an astonishing supply of gadgets and technology four other agents sat with westlake all staring at the eyes and expressions of mr rucker no way mumbled one of the other four this guys too smart for this he knows well find the trailer the wallet the fake id the hummer maybe not mumbled another right now its just an escape hes thinking we have no clue about the murder this is nothing serious i agree said another i think hes betting playing the odds he thinks he can survive a few questions then get hauled back to jail and then to prison hes thinking hell call his cousin at some point and tell him to grab everything wait and see said westlake lets see how he reacts when the first bomb hits at am quinn said can i use the restroom delocke stood and escorted him out of the room and down the hall another agent loitered about a show of force five minutes later quinn was back in his seat pankovits said its rather late quinn you want to check in at the jail and get some sleep we have plenty of time id rather be here than in the jail he said sadly how much more time you think ill get he asked delocke replied dont know quinn thats up to the us attorney bad part is that they wont send you back to a camp ever youre headed for a real prison you know jesse i sorta miss the camp wasnt so bad after all whyd you leave it stupid why because i could just walk away and nobody seemed to care we interview twentyfive guys a year who walk away from a federal camp stupid i think is the best word pankovits shuffled some papers and said now quinn i think weve got a handle on the time line here dates places movements cash earnings all of this will be included in your presentence report the good part is that you didnt do anything exceptionally bad over the past three months some drug running which of course will not help you but at least you didnt hurt anyone right right and this is the complete story right nothing left out youre telling us everything yep the two agents stiffened somewhat and frowned pankovits said what about roanoke quinn did you spend any time in roanoke quinn looked at the ceiling gave it a thought and said maybe i passed through once or twice but thats all are you sure about that yes im sure delocke opened a file scanned a sheet of paper and asked who is jackie todd quinns eyes closed as his mouth fell open slightly a soft guttural sound one from deep inside came out as if hed been struck somewhere below the belt his shoulders dropped if hed been white he would have turned pale dont know he finally said never met him delocke continued really well it looks like mr jackie r todd was arrested on tuesday night february at a bar in roanoke public drunk assault the police report says he got in a fight with some other drunks and spent the night in jail next morning he posted a cash bond of and walked out wasnt me is that so delocke slid across a sheet of paper and quinn slowly picked it up it was a mug shot clearly one of himself not much doubt about it quinn right quinn laid down the sheet of paper and said okay okay so i had an alias what was i supposed to do play hideandseek with my real name of course not quinn pankovits said but you lied to us didnt you youre not the first cops ive lied to lying to the fbi can get you five years okay i fibbed a little no surprise there but now we cant believe anything i guess well have to start over delocke said on february one jackie todd walked into a usedcar lot in roanoke and paid cash for a hummer h this ring a bell quinn no wasnt me didnt think so delocke slid across a copy of the bill of sale and youve never seen this before have you quinn looked at it and said no pankovits snapped come on quinn were not half as stupid as you think we are you were in roanoke on february went to the bar got in a fight went to jail bonded out the next morning went back to your motel room at the safe lodge back to the room you paid cash for got some more cash and bought yourself a hummer wheres the crime in paying cash for a vehicle none whatsoever pankovits said but you werent supposed to have that much cash at that point maybe i was wrong with some of the dates and some of the cash payments i cant remember everything do you remember where you bought the guns delocke asked what guns the smith amp wesson we found in your trailer and the glock millimeter we found in your storage unit about two hours ago stolen guns pankovits added helpfully more federal offenses quinn slowly locked his hands behind his head and stared at his knees a minute passed then another without blinking and without moving a muscle the two agents stared at quinn the room was silent still tense finally pankovits shuffled some papers and raised one he said the preliminary inventory shows a wallet with cash a fake drivers license from north carolina two prepaid visa cards a prepaid cell phone the aforementioned smith amp wesson a bill of sale and a title for the hummer a lease agreement for the ministorage unit an insurance certificate for the vehicle a box of bullets for the and a few other items all taken from the mobile home you were renting for a month from the ministorage unit we have inventoried some clothing the glock millimeter a pair of combat boots some other items and most important a metal box with in it cash all in bills quinn slowly folded his arms across his chest and stared at delocke who said we have all night quinn how about an explanation i guess the mule was busier than i remember there were a lot of trips to miami and back why didnt you tell us about all the trips like i said i cant remember everything when youre on the run like that you tend to forget things do you remember using either of the guns for anything quinn delocke asked no did you use the guns or do you just not remember using the guns i did not use the guns pankovits found another sheet of paper and studied it gravely you sure about that quinn this is a preliminary ballistics report quinn slowly pushed his chair back and got to his feet he stretched and walked a few steps to a corner maybe i need a lawyer chapter there was no ballistics report the smith amp wesson was at the fbi crime laboratory at quantico and would be analyzed as soon as the technicians arrived for work in about five hours the sheet of paper pankovits held like a weapon was a copy of some useless memo he and delocke had an entire repertoire of dirty tricks all approved by the us supreme court using them would depend on how far quinn allowed things to go the immediate problem was the lawyer comment if quinn had said clearly and unequivocally i want a lawyer or im not answering any more questions until i have a lawyer or something along those lines the interrogation would have ended immediately but he hedged and used the word maybe timing was crucial here to divert attention away from the issue of a lawyer the agents quickly changed the scenery delocke stood and said i need to take a leak pankovits said and i need more coffee how about you quinn no delocke slammed the door as he left pankovits stood and stretched his back it was almost am quinn had two brothers and two sisters ages twentyseven to fortytwo all at one point or another involved in the familys drugtrafficking syndicate one sister had eased out of the actual smuggling and selling but was still involved in various laundering operations the other had left the business moved away and tried to avoid the family altogether the youngest of the siblings was dee ray rucker a quiet young man who studied finance at georgetown and knew how to move money around he had one gun charge but nothing significant dee ray really didnt have the stomach for the fear and violence of the street life and tried to stay away from it he lived with his girlfriend in a modest condo near union station and it was there that the fbi found him shortly after midnight in bed unburdened by outstanding warrants or ongoing criminal investigations oblivious to what was happening to his dear brother quinn carefree and sleeping soundly he was taken into custody without resistance but with an enormous amount of bitching the squad of agents who snatched him offered little explanation at the fbi building on pennsylvania avenue he was hustled into a room where he was placed in a chair and surrounded by agents all wearing navy parkas with fbi in bright yellow the scene was photographed from several angles after an hour of sitting handcuffed and being told nothing he was removed from the room walked back to the van and driven home he was deposited at the curb without another word his girlfriend fetched him some pills and he eventually settled down he would call his lawyer in the morning and raise hell but the entire episode would soon be forgotten in the drug trade you dont expect happy endings when delocke returned from the restroom he held the door open for a moment a slender attractive secretary of some variety entered with a tray of drinks and cookies which she set on the edge of the table she smiled at quinn who was still standing in the corner too confused to acknowledge her after she left pankovits popped a can of red bull and poured it over ice you need a red bull quinn no he served them all night at the bar red bull and vodka but had never cared for the taste the break in the action gave him a moment to catch his breath and try to organize his thoughts should he continue or should he remain silent and insist on a lawyer his instincts were for the latter but he was extremely curious about how much the fbi knew he was reeling from what they had already discovered but how far could they go delocke fixed himself a red bull too over ice and munched on a cookie have a seat quinn he said waving him back to the table quinn took a few steps and sat down pankovits was already taking notes your older brother i believe they call him tall man is he still in the dc area whats he got to do with anything just filling in some gaps here quinn thats all i like to have all the facts or as many as possible have you seen much of tall man in the past three months no comment okay your younger brother dee ray is he still in the dc area i dont know where dee ray is have you seen much of dee ray in the past three months no comment did dee ray go to roanoke with you when you got arrested no comment was anyone with you when you got arrested in roanoke i was alone delocke exhaled in frustration pankovits sighed as if this were just another lie and they knew it i swear i was alone quinn said what were you doing in roanoke delocke asked business trafficking thats our business roanoke is part of our territory we had a situation there and i had to take care of it what kind of situation no comment pankovits took a long pull of his red bull and said you know quinn the problem we have right now is that we cant believe a word youre saying you lie we know you lie you even admit you lie we ask a question you give us a lie were getting nowhere quinn delocke chimed in what were you doing in roanoke quinn reached forward and took an oreo he pulled off the top licked the creme stared at delocke and finally said we had a mule down there who we suspected of being an informant we lost two shipments under strange circumstances and we figured things out i went to see the mule to kill him no we dont operate that way i couldnt find him he apparently got word and took off i went to a bar drank too much got in a fight had a bad night the next day a friend told me about a good deal on a hummer so i went to see it who was the friend no comment youre lying delocke said youre lying and we know youre lying youre not even a good liar quinn you know that whatever why did you title the hummer in north carolina pankovits asked because i was on the run remember i was an escapee trying not to leave a trail get it fellas fake id fake address fake everything who is jakeel staley delocke asked quinn hesitated for a second tried to shake it off and answered nonchalantly my nephew and where is he now federal pen somewhere im sure you guys know the answer alabama serving eighteen years pankovits said jakeel got busted near roanoke with a van full of cocaine right im sure you have the file did you try to help jakeel when both agents overreacted with feigned frustration both took a sip of red bull delocke reached for another oreo there were a dozen left on the platter and there was a pot full of coffee from the looks of things they planned to be there all night pankovits said come on quinn stop playing games weve established that jakeel was busted in roanoke lots of coke lots of years ahead in the pen and the question is whether or not you tried to help the boy sure hes part of the family part of the business and he got busted in the course of his employment the family always steps forward did you hire the lawyer i did how much did you pay the lawyer quinn thought for a moment then said i dont really remember it was a sackful of cash you paid the lawyer in cash thats what i just said nothing wrong with cash last time i checked we dont use bank accounts and credit cards and things the feds can follow just cash who gave you the cash to hire the lawyer no comment did you get the cash from dee ray no comment pankovits slowly reached for a thin file and removed a sheet of paper well dee ray says he gave you all the cash you would need in roanoke quinn shook his head and offered a nasty smile that said bullshit pankovits slid across an eightbyten color enlargement of a photograph of dee ray surrounded by fbi agents with his hands cuffed his mouth open and his face angry delocke explained we picked up dee ray in dc about an hour after we brought you in he likes to talk you know in fact he talks a lot more than you do quinn stared at the photo and was speechless the freezer four in the morning victor westlake stood again and walked around the room movement was needed to fight off sleep the other four agents were still awake their systems pumped with overthecounter amphetamines red bull and coffee damn these guys are slow one of them said theyre methodical another replied theyre wearing him down the fact that hes still talking after seven hours is incredible he doesnt want to go to the county jail cant blame him there i think hes still curious cat and mouse how much do we really know theyre not going to trick him hes too smart they know what theyre doing westlake said he sat down and poured another cup of coffee in norfolk pankovits poured a cup of coffee and asked who drove you to roanoke nobody i drove myself what kind of car i dont remember youre lying quinn someone drove you to roanoke the week before february there were two of you we have witnesses then your witnesses are lying youre lying everybodys lying you bought the hummer on february paid cash and there was no tradein how did you get to the usedcar lot that day when you bought the hummer who took you i dont remember so you dont remember who took you i dont remember anything i was hungover and still about half drunk come on quinn delocke said these lies are getting ridiculous what are you hiding if youre not hiding something then you wouldnt be lying so much what exactly do you want to know quinn asked hands in the air where did you get all that cash quinn im a drug dealer ive been a drug dealer most of my life ive spent time in prison because im a drug dealer we burn cash we eat cash dont you understand this pankovits was shaking his head but quinn according to your story you were not working much for the family after your escape they were afraid of you right am i right about this he asked looking at delocke who quickly confirmed that yes his partner was right about this delocke said the family shunned you so you began making runs down south and back you say you earned about which we now know is a lie because you spent on the hummer and we found in your storage unit pankovits said you came across some cash quinn what are you hiding nothing then why are you lying everybodys lying i thought we all agreed on that delocke tapped the table and said lets go back a few years quinn your nephew jakeel staley is in jail here in roanoke waiting on a trial you paid his lawyer some amount in cash for legal services right right was there more cash a little extra to help grease the system maybe a bribe so the court would go easy on the kid anything like that quinn no are you sure of course im sure come on quinn i paid the lawyer in cash i assumed he kept the money for his fee thats all i know who was the judge i dont remember does judge fawcett ring a bell quinn shrugged maybe did you ever go to court with jakeel i was there when he was sentenced to eighteen years were you surprised when he got eighteen years yes matter of fact i was he was supposed to get a lot less wasnt he according to his lawyer yes and you were in court so you could get a good look at judge fawcett right i was in court for my nephew thats all the tag team paused at the same moment delocke took a sip of his red bull pankovits said i need to go to the mens room you okay quinn quinn was pinching his forehead sure he replied get you something to drink how about a sprite you got it pankovits took his time quinn sipped his drink at the interrogation was resumed when delocke asked so quinn have you kept up with the news during the past three months read any newspapers surely youve been curious about your own escape and whether or not its made the news quinn said not really did you hear about judge fawcett nope what about him murdered shot twice in the back of the head no reaction from quinn no surprise no pity nothing you didnt know that quinn pankovits asked no two hollowpoint bullets fired from acaliber handgun identical to the one we found in your trailer preliminary ballistics report says theres a percent chance your gun was used to kill the judge quinn began smiling and nodding now i get it this is all about a dead judge you boys think i killed judge fawcett right thats right great so we have wasted what seven hours with this bullshit youre wasting my time your time dee rays time everybodys time i aint killed nobody have you ever been to ripplemead virginia population five hundred deep in the mountains west of roanoke no its the nearest town to a small lake where the judge was murdered there are no black people in ripplemead and when one shows up he gets noticed the day before the judge was murdered a black man matching your description was in town according to the owner of a gas station a positive id or just a wild guess something in between well show him a better photo of you tomorrow im sure you will and ill bet his memory improves greatly it usually does delocke said four miles west of ripplemead the world comes to an end the asphalt stops and a series of gravel roads disappear into the mountains theres an old country store called peacocks and mr peacock sees everything the day before the murder he says a black man stopped by asking for directions mr peacock cant remember the last time he saw a black man in his part of the world he gave a description matches you very well quinn shrugged and said im not that stupid really then why did you hang on to the smith amp wesson when we get the final ballistics report youre dead quinn the guns stolen okay stolen guns make the rounds i bought it from a pawnshop in lynchburg two weeks ago its probably changed hands a dozen times in the past year a good point and one they could not argue with at least not until the ballistics tests were completed when they had the proof though no jury would believe quinns story about a stolen gun pankovits said we found a pair of combat boots in your ministorage unit a cheap pair of fake army surplus canvas camouflage all that crap they are fairly new and have not been used that much why do you need combat boots quinn i have weak ankles nice how often do you wear them not often if theyre in storage i tried them they rubbed a blister i forgot about them whats the point the point is that they match a boot print we took from the soil not far from the cabin where judge fawcett was murdered pankovits said lying but doing so effectively a match quinn a match that puts you at the scene quinn dropped his chin and rubbed his eyes they were bloodshot and tired what time is it four fifty delocke replied i need some sleep well that might be difficult quinn we checked with the county jail and your cell is quite crowded eight men four bunks youll be lucky to get a spot on the floor i dont think i like that jail could we try another one sorry wait till you see death row quinn i aint going to death row because i didnt kill anybody pankovits said heres where we are quinn two witnesses put you in the vicinity at the time of the murder and the vicinity is not exactly a busy street corner you were there and you were noticed and remembered ballistics will nail your ass the boot print is icing on the cake thats the crime scene after the crime it gets even better or worse depending on ones perspective you were in roanoke the day after the bodies were found tuesday february by your own admission and by way of the citys jail records and court docket and suddenly you had a satchelful of cash you posted bond then paid for the hummer pissed away plenty more and when we finally catch you theres another stash hidden in a ministorage motive theres plenty of motive you had a deal with judge fawcett to rule in favor of jakeel staley you bribed him something like and after he took the cash he forgot about the deal he threw the book at jakeel and you vowed revenge eventually you got it unfortunately his secretary got in the way too delocke said a death penalty case quinn open and shut federal death penalty quinns eyes closed as his body shrank he began breathing rapidly as sweat formed above his eyebrows a minute passed then another the tough guy was gone his replacement said weakly you got the wrong guy pankovits laughed and delocke sneering said is that the best you can do you got the wrong guy quinn repeated but with even less conviction that sounds pretty lame quinn delocke said and itll sound even weaker in the courtroom quinn stared at his hands as another minute passed finally he said if you boys know so much what else do you want pankovits replied there are a few gaps did you act alone how did you open the safe why did you kill the secretary what happened to the rest of the money cant help you there i dont know nothing about it you know everything quinn and were not leaving until you fill in the gaps then i guess were going to be here for a long time quinn said he leaned forward placed his head on the table and said im taking a nap both agents stood and picked up their files and notepads well take a break quinn well be back in half an hour chapter though pleased with the progress of the interrogation victor westlake was worried there were no witnesses no ballistics report linking quinns to the crime scene no boot print and no simultaneous interrogation of dee ray there was motive if they believed malcolm bannisters story about the bribe the strongest evidence so far was the fact that quinn rucker was in roanoke the day after the bodies were found and that he had too much cash westlake and his team were exhausted from the allnighter and it was still dark outside they reloaded with coffee and took long walks around the freezer they occasionally checked on the screen for images of their suspect quinn was lying on the table but not sleeping at am pankovits and delocke returned to the interrogation room each had a tall glass with a refill of red bull and ice quinn got off the table and settled himself into his chair for another round pankovits went first just got off the phone with the us attorney quinn we briefed him on our progress here with you and he says his grand jury will convene tomorrow and hand down the indictment two counts of capital murder congratulations quinn replied i guess id better find me a lawyer sure but it might take more than one im not sure how much you understand about federal racketeering laws quinn but they can be brutal the us attorney will take the position that the murders of judge fawcett and his secretary were the actions of a gang a wellknown and wellorganized gang with you of course as the triggerman the indictment will include a lot of charges including capital murder but also bribery and most important it will name not only you but other nefarious characters such as tall man dee ray one of your sisters your cousin antoine beck and a couple dozen other relatives delocke added you guys can have your own wing on death row the ruckerbeck gang all lined up cell to cell just waiting for the needle delocke was smiling and pankovits was amused a couple of comedians quinn began scratching the side of his head and talking to the floor you know i wonder what my lawyer would say about this got me locked in this dark room no windows all night long started at what bout nine last night and here it is six in the morning nine straight hours of nonstop bullshit from you two accusing me of bribing a judge then killing a judge and now threatening me with death and not only my ass but my whole family as well you say you got witnesses out there all lined up and ready to testify and ballistics on a stolen gun and a boot print where some sumbitch stepped in mud and how am i supposed to know if youre telling the truth or lying your ass off because i wouldnt trust the fbi with anything never have never will lied to me the first time i got busted and sent away and i assume youre lying here tonight maybe i lied a little but can you honestly tell me right now that you aint lied to me tonight can you pankovits and delocke stared at him maybe it was fear or guilt maybe it was delirium whatever quinn was really talking we are telling the truth pankovits managed to say and chalk up another lie my lawyer will get to the bottom of this hell nail your ass in court expose you expose all your lies show me the boot print analysis now i want to see it were not authorized to show it to anyone pankovits said how convenient quinn leaned forward with an elbow on each knee his forehead almost touched the edge of the table and he kept talking to the floor what about the ballistics report can i see that were not authorized what a surprise my lawyerll get it whenever and wherever i get to see my lawyer ive asked for him all night and my rights have been violated you have not asked for your lawyer delocke said youve mentioned a lawyer in vague terms but you have not requested one and youve kept talking as if i had a choice either sit here and talk or go to the drunk tank with a bunch of winos ive been there before you know and i aint afraid of it its just part of the business you know you do the crime you do the time you know the rules when you get into the business you see all your friends and family shipped off but they come back you know you do your time and you get out or you escape delocke said that too pretty stupid i guess but i had to walk because you had to settle a score right quinn for two years in prison you thought about judge fawcett every day he took your money then he broke the deal in your business he had to go down right thats right quinn was rubbing his temples staring at his feet almost mumbling the agents took a deep breath and exchanged a quick smile finally the first hint of an admission pankovits rearranged some papers and said now quinn lets look at where we are youve just admitted judge fawcett had to go down is that right quinn quinn was still leaning on his elbows staring at the floor rocking now as if in a daze he did not respond delocke read from his legal pad and said according to my notes quinn i asked the question and i quote in your business he had to go down right and you replied thats right do you deny this quinn youre putting words in my mouth stop it pankovits jumped in okay quinn we need to inform you of some recent developments about two hours ago dee ray finally admitted he gave you the cash to pass along to judge fawcett and that he tall man and some of the others helped you plan the murder dee rays come clean and hes already got a dealno death penalty no capital murder we picked up tall man two hours ago and now were looking for one of your sisters this is getting ugly come on they dont know nothing of course they do and theyll be indicted with you tomorrow you cant do that man come on itll kill my mother poor womans seventy years old and got a bad heart you cant be messing with her like that then step up quinn pankovits said loudly take the heat you did the crime as you like to say now do the time no sense taking the rest of your family down with you step up and do what cut a deal give us the details and we lean on the us attorney to lay off your family pankovits said and theres something else delocke added if we do the right deal there will be no death penalty just life no parole seems the fawcett family does not believe in the death penalty nor do they want a long painful trial they want the case closed and the us attorney will respect their wishes according to him he will consider a plea agreement one that will save your life why should i believe you you dont have to quinn just wait a couple of days for the indictments to come down there could be as many as thirty people named for various charges quinn rucker stood slowly and stretched his hands as high as possible he took a few steps in one direction then another and began saying bannister bannister bannister beg your pardon quinn pankovits said bannister bannister bannister whos bannister delocke asked bannister is a rat quinn said bitterly scum an old friend in frostburg a crooked lawyer who claims hes innocent nothing but a rat dont pretend you dont know him because you wouldnt be here if he wasnt a rat never met the man pankovits said delocke was shaking his head no quinn sat down and thrust both elbows onto the table he was wideawake now his narrow eyes glaring at the two agents his thick hands rubbing each other so whats the deal he asked we cant make deals quinn but we can make things happen pankovits said for starters we call off the dogs in dc and your family and gang are left alone for now anyway the us attorney has been taking heat for five weeks ever since the murder and hes desperate for some good news he assures us and we can assure you that there will be no capital murder charge and that it will be a standalone indictment just you for the two killings plain and simple delocke said thats one half the other half is a video statement from you confessing to the crimes quinn wrapped his hands around his head and closed his eyes a minute passed as he fought himself i really want my lawyer he finally said through clenched teeth delocke replied you can do that quinn of course you can but dee ray and tall man are in custody right now singing like birds and things are only getting worse it might be a day or two before your lawyer can get down here you say the word and well turn your brothers loose and leave them alone quinn suddenly snapped and yelled all right all right what all right ill do it not so fast quinn pankovits said we need to go over a few things first lets review the facts put things in order set the stage make sure were all on the same page with the crime scene we need to make sure that all important details are included okay okay but can i have some breakfast sure quinn no problem we have all day chapter one of the few virtues of prison life is the gradual acquisition of patience nothing moves at a reasonable pace and you learn to ignore clocks tomorrow will come around soon enough surviving today is enough of a challenge after my quick trip to dc i roam around frostburg for a couple of days reminding myself that i have become a very patient person that the fbi will move quickly and regardless there is nothing more i can do much to my surprise and relief events unfold rapidly i do not expect the fbi to keep me in the loop so i have no way of knowing they have arrested quinn rucker and that he has confessed this news is delivered by the washington post on saturday march front page beneath the fold suspect arrested in murder of federal judge there is a large blackandwhite photo of quinn one of his mug shots and i stare into his eyes as i take a seat in the coffee room just after breakfast the article is rather light on facts but heavy on suspicion obviously all news is being parceled out by the fbi so theres not much detail the arrest in norfolk of an escaped felon one with a conviction for drug trafficking and a long history of gang involvement in the dc area there is no whiff of a motive no clue as to how the fbi decided quinn was their man and only a passing reference to a ballistics report most important the article states after waiving his miranda rights the suspect voluntarily underwent a lengthy interrogation and provided the fbi with a videotaped confession i met quinn rucker two years ago not long after he arrived at frostburg after he settled in he made his way to the library and asked me to review his sentencing order in prison you learn to make friends slowly with great caution because few people are genuine naturally the place is swarming with crooks cons and scam artists and everyone is looking out for his own skin with quinn though things were different he was instantly likeable and im not sure ive met another person with as much charisma and sincerity then the mood would swing and he would withdraw into himself and suffer through his dark days as he called them he could be cranky rude and harsh and the potential for violence was not far from the surface he would eat alone and speak to no one two days later he would be telling jokes over breakfast and challenging the serious players to a game of poker he could be loud and cocky then quiet and vulnerable as ive said there is no violence at frostburg the nearest thing to a fight ive seen was an episode in which a hillbilly we called skunk challenged quinn to a fistfight to settle a gambling dispute skunk was at least four inches shorter and thirty pounds lighter than quinn but the fight never happened quinn backed down and was humiliated two days later he showed me a homemade knife a shank that hed bought on the black market he planned to use it to slice skunks throat i talked him out of the killing though i wasnt convinced he was serious i spent a lot of time with quinn and we became friends he was convinced i could work some legal magic spring us both from prison and we would become partners of some sort he was tired of the family business and wanted to go straight there was a pot of gold waiting out there and judge fawcett was sitting on it henry bannister is waiting in the visitors room sitting sadly in a folding chair while a young mother and her three children squabble nearby the room will fill up as the morning goes on and henry prefers to get his visits over with earlier rather than later the rules allow a family member to sit and chat with an inmate from am to pm each saturday and sunday but one hour is enough for henry and for me as well if things go as planned and i have little reason to believe they will this could be my last visit with my father i may not see him again for years if ever but i cant discuss this i take the brown bag of cookies from aunt racine and nibble on one we talk about my brother marcus and his rotten children and my sister ruby and her perfect ones winchester averages one murder per year and the quota was filled last week when a husband arrived home early from work and saw a strange truck parked in his driveway he sneaked into his house and caught his wife with one of his acquaintances both enthusiastically violating their marriage vows the husband had picked up his shotgun and when the tomcat saw it he attempted to jump through an unopened bedroom window naked he didnt make it and gunfire followed henry thinks the guy might get off and relishes telling the story it seems the entire town is split between guilt and justifiable homicide i can almost hear the relentless gossip in the old town coffee shops i once visited he dwells on this story for a long time probably because we do not want to cover family issues but cover them we must he changes subjects and says looks like that little white girl is thinking about an abortion maybe i wont be a greatgrandfather after all delmon will do it again i say we always expect the worst out of the kid we need to get him sterilized hes too stupid to use condoms buy him some anyway you know marcus is too broke i only see the kid when he wants something hell ill probably get hit up for the abortion i think the girls trash while on the topic of money i cant help but think about the reward in the fawcett case a hundred and fifty thousand dollars cash ive never seen so much money before bo was born dionne and i realized one day we had saved we put half in a mutual fund and took a cruise with the remainder our frugal habits were soon forgotten and we never again had that kind of cash just before i was indicted we refinanced our house to squeeze out every last drop of equity the money went for legal fees ill be rich and on the run i remind myself not to get excited but its impossible henry needs a new left knee and we talk about this for some time hes always poked fun at old folks who dwell on their ailments but hes getting just as bad after an hour hes bored and ready to go i walk with him to the door and we shake hands stiffly as he leaves i wonder if i will ever see him again sunday no word from the fbi or anyone else i read four newspapers after breakfast and learn almost nothing new about quinn rucker and his arrest however there is one significant development according to the post the us attorney for the southern district of virginia will present the case to the grand jury tomorrow monday if the grand jury issues an indictment then in theory and by agreement i am supposed to become a free man there is a surprising amount of organized religion in prison as troubled men we seek solace peace comfort and guidance weve been humiliated humbled stripped bare of dignity family and assets and we have nothing left cast into hell we look upward for a way out there are a few muslims who pray five times a day and stick to themselves there is a selfappointed buddhist monk with a few followers no jews or mormons that i know of then there are us christians and this is where it gets complicated a catholic priest comes in twice a month for mass at eight on sunday mornings as soon as the catholics clear out of the small chapel a nondenominational service is held for those from mainline churchesmethodist baptist presbyterian and so on this is where i fit in on most sundays at am the white pentecostals gather for a rowdy service with loud music and even louder preaching along with healing and speaking in tongues this service is supposed to end at am but often runs longer as the spirit moves among the worshippers the black pentecostals get the chapel at am but sometimes must wait while the white ones simmer down ive heard stories of harsh words between the two groups but so far no fights have erupted in the chapel once they get the pulpit the black pentecostals keep it throughout the afternoon it would be wrong to get the impression that frostburg is filled with biblethumpers it is not its still a prison and the majority of my fellow inmates would not be caught dead in a church service as i leave the chapel after the nondenominational service a co finds me and says theyre looking for you in the admin building chapter agent hanski is waiting with a new player in my gamepat surhoff us marshal we make our introductions and gather around a small table not far down the hall from the wardens office he of course would never be seen on the premises on a sunday and who could blame him hanski whips out a document and slides it across heres the indictment he says came down late friday afternoon in roanoke still a secret but it will be released to the press first thing in the morning i hold it like a brick of gold and have trouble focusing on the words united states of america versus quinn al rucker its been stamped in the top right corner with last fridays date in blue ink the post said the grand jury meets in the morning i manage to say though its obvious whats already happened were playing the press hanski says smugly smug but a much nicer guy this time around our roles have changed dramatically once i had been a shiftyeyed con looking for a deal and probably scamming the system now though im the golden boy about to walk out of here and take some cash with me i shake my head and say im at a loss for words guys help me here hanski is ready to pounce heres what we have in mind mr bannister how about mal now i ask great im chris and hes pat got it the bureau of prisons has just reassigned you to the mediumsecurity joint at fort wayne indiana reason unknown or not given some type of rule violation that pissed off the big guys no visitors for six months solitary confinement anyone whos curious can find you online with the inmate locator service but theyll soon hit a brick wall after a couple of months in fort wayne youll be reassigned again the goal is to keep you moving throughout the system and buried in it im sure this will be quite easy for the bureau i say and they both laugh man have i changed teams or what in a few minutes well do the handcuff and anklechain routine for the last time and walk you out of here just like a normal transfer youll get in an unmarked van with pat and another marshal and theyll drive you west headed for fort wayne ill follow sixty miles down the road just this side of morgantown well stop at a motel where we have some rooms youll change clothes have some lunch and well talk about the future in a few minutes i say shocked thats the plan is there anything in your cell that you cannot live without yes i have some personal stuff paperwork and such okay well get the prison to box up everything tomorrow and well get it to you its best if you dont go back there if someone saw you gathering your things they might ask questions we dont want anyone here to know youre leaving until youre gone got it no farewells and all that crap okay okay for a second i think about my friends here at frostburg but quickly let it go this day is coming for all of them too and once youre free you dont look back i doubt seriously if friendships made in prison endure on the outside and in my case i will never be able to catch up with the old pals and reminisce i am about to become another person you have in your prison account well forward that to fort wayne and itll get lost in the system screwed once more by the federal government i say and again they think im funny any questions hanski asks sure how did you get him to confess hes too smart for that we were surprised frankly we used a couple of our veteran interrogators and they have their methods he mentioned a lawyer a couple of times but backed off he wanted to talk and he seemed overwhelmed by the fact that hed been caught not for the escape but for the murder he wanted to know how much we knew so we kept talking for ten hours through the night into the early morning he didnt want to leave and go to jail so he stayed in the room once he became convinced that we knew what we knew he broke down when we mentioned the possibility of his family being indicted along with most of his gang he wanted to cut a deal he eventually gave us everything and by everything you mean his story is basically what you told us he bribed judge fawcett with to save his nephew and the judge screwed him kept the money and nailed the kid in quinns world thats a crime that cannot be forgiven and must be avenged he stalked judge fawcett trailed him to his cabin broke in on the judge and his secretary and got his revenge how much of the money was left about half of it quinn claims he broke into the judges apartment in roanoke went through everything and couldnt find the money he suspected it was being kept somewhere else somewhere safer thats why he followed fawcett to the cabin he overpowered the judge on the front porch and got inside he wasnt sure the money was there but was determined to find its location he did some bad things to the secretary and convinced fawcett to find the money thus the hidden safe in quinns mind the money belonged to him and i guess he felt he had to kill them oh sure he couldnt leave two witnesses behind theres no remorse mal the judge had it coming the secretary just got in the way now hes facing two counts of capital murder so its a death penalty case most likely weve never executed anyone for killing a federal judge and wed love to make quinn rucker our first example did he mention my name i ask certain of the answer indeed he did he strongly suspects youre our source and hes probably plotting revenge thats why were here now ready to go i want to leave but not so fast quinn knows about rule in fact every federal inmate knows a lot about the rule you solve a crime on the outside and you get your sentence commuted plus he thinks im a brilliant lawyer he and his family will know that im out not in prison not in fort wayne or any other facility true but lets keep them guessing its also important for your family and friends to believe youre still locked up are you worried about my family i ask pat surhoff finally speaks on some level yes and we can provide protection for them if you so choose doing so will obviously disrupt their lives theyll never agree to it i reply my father would throw a punch if you mentioned it to him hes a retired state trooper whos certain he can take care of himself my son has a new father and a new life i cannot comprehend the phone call to dionne to inform her that bo might be in danger because of something ive done in prison and theres a part of me that does not believe quinn rucker would harm an innocent boy we can discuss it later if youd like surhoff says lets do that im having far too many random thoughts right now hanski says freedom awaits you mal lets get out of here i follow them down a hallway and to another building where three cos and the captain are waiting im handcuffed and shackled at the ankles then escorted down a sidewalk to a waiting van an uninformed bystander would think im being led to my execution a marshal named hitchcock is behind the wheel surhoff slides the door shut beside me and climbs into the front passenger seat away we go i refuse to look back for a parting shot of frostburg i have enough images to last for years i watch the countryside pass by and cannot suppress a smile a few minutes later we pull in to the parking lot of a shopping center surhoff jumps out opens the sliding door reaches over and unlocks the handcuffs then he frees my ankles congratulations he says warmly and i decide that i like this guy i hear the chains rattle for the last time and massage my wrists soon we accelerate onto interstate and head west its almost springtime and the rolling hills of far western maryland are showing signs of life the first few moments of freedom are almost overwhelming for five years i have dreamed of this day and it is exhilarating there are so many thoughts competing for attention i cant wait to choose my own clothing to put on a pair of jeans i cant wait to buy a car and drive anywhere i want i long for the feel of a womans body and for the taste of a steak and a cold beer i refuse to worry about the safety of my son and father they will not be harmed the marshals want to talk and so i listen pat surhoff is saying now mal you are no longer in the custody of anyone if you choose to enter the witness security program more commonly known as witness protection we the us marshals service will take care of you we provide for your security safety and health we will get you a new identity with authentic documentation you will receive financial assistance for housing living expenses and medical care well find you a job once youre up and running we dont monitor your daily activities but were always close by if you need us he sounds as though hes reading from a brochure but the words are music hitchcock chimes in weve had over eight thousand witnesses in the program and not a single one has ever been harmed i ask the obvious question where will i live its a big country mal hitchcock replies weve relocated witnesses a hundred miles from their homes and two thousand miles away distance is not that crucial but generally speaking the farther the better you like warm weather or snow mountains and lakes or sun and beaches big cities or small cities small towns are problematic and we recommend a place with a population of at least its easier to blend in surhoff adds and i get to choose i ask within reason yes hitchcock says let me think about it which i do for the next ten miles or so and not for the first time i have a pretty good idea of where im going and for what reasons i glance over my shoulder and see a familiar vehicle im assuming thats the fbi right behind us yes agent hanski and another guy surhoff says how long will they follow us theyll be gone in a few days i suppose surhoff says as he and hitchcock exchange looks they dont really know and im not going to press them i ask does the fbi routinely keep up with witnesses like me hitchcock replies it depends usually when a witness enters witness protection he has some unfinished business with the person or persons he snitched on so the witness may have to go back to court to testify in that case the fbi wants to keep up with the witness but they do it through us always through us over time though as the years go by the fbi sort of forgets about the witnesses pat changes the subject one of the first things you have to do is change your name legally of course we use a judge in fairfax county northern virginia who keeps the files locked its pretty routine but you need to select a new name its best if you keep the same initials and keep it simple for example mike barnes matt booth mark bridges mitch baldwin sounds like a bunch of white fraternity brothers yes it does but so does malcolm bannister thanks we ponder my new name for a few miles surhoff opens a laptop and pecks away he says in this country whats the most common surname beginning with the letter b baker hitchcock guesses thats number two bailey i guess thats number three bell is number four brooks number five the winner is brown with twice as many customers as baker in second place one of my favorite africanamerican writers is james baldwin i say ill take it okay surhoff says tapping keys first name how about max hitchcock nods his approval as surhoff enters the name max i like it hitchcock says as if sniffing a fine wine surhoff looks up and says there are about twentyfive max baldwins in the united states so it works fine a good solid name not too common not too exotic or weird i like it lets dress it up a bit middle name what works here max nothing works in the middle with max in front then i think of mr reed and mr copeland my two former partners and their tiny shop on braddock street in winchester copeland amp reed attorneys and counselors at law in their honor i select reed max reed baldwin surhoff says itll work now a little suffix to bring it to an end max junior the third the fourth shouldnt get too fancy here hitchcock is shaking his head no leave it alone he says almost under his breath i agree i say nothing on the end great so we have a name max r baldwin right max i guess let me mull it over for an hour or so i need to get used to it of course as unsettling as it is selecting a new name to be used for the rest of my life will be one of my easier decisions quite soon ill be confronted with choices far more difficulteyes nose lips chin home job family history and what kind of fictional childhood did i have where did i go to college and what did i study why am i single and have i been married children my mind is spinning chapter a few miles east of morgantown we exit the interstate and find the lot of a best western one of the olderstyle motels where you can park directly in front of your room men are waiting agents of some variety fbi i presume and as i slide out of the van wonderfully unshackled hanski rushes up and says room here is yours one of the unnamed agents unlocks the door and hands me the key inside there are two queensized beds and on one there is a selection of clothes hanski and surhoff close the door behind us i got your sizes from the prison hanski says waving an arm at my new wardrobe if you dont like it fine we can go shopping there are two white shirts and one of blue plaid all with buttondown collars two pairs of khakis and one pair of prewashed and faded jeans a brown leather belt a stack of boxers neatly folded two white tshirts several pairs of socks still in the wrappers a pair of brown moccasins that look presentable and the ugliest pair of black loafers ive ever seen overall not a bad start thanks i say hanski continues toothbrush toothpaste shaving stuff all in the bathroom theres a small gym bag over there anything else you need well run to the store you want some lunch not now i just want to be alone no problem mal its now max if you dont mind max baldwin surhoff added that was quick they leave and i lock the door i slowly strip out of the prison garbolive shirt and pants white socks black thicksoled laceup shoes and boxer shorts that are frayed and worn thin i put on a pair of the new boxers and a tshirt then crawl under the covers and stare at the ceiling for lunch we walk next door to a lowbudget seafood joint with a drivethrough and all the crab legs one can eat for its just hanski surhoff and i and we enjoy a long meal of mediocre seafood that is nonetheless delicious with the pressure off they actually crack jokes and comment on my wardrobe i return the insults by reminding them that im not a white frat boy like them and from now on ill buy my own clothes as the afternoon moves along they let me know that we have work to do a lot of decisions must be made we return to the motel to the room next to mine where one of the two beds is covered with files and papers hitchcock joins us so there are four in the room all supposedly working together though im skeptical i tell myself over and over that these guys are now on my side that the government is my protector and friend but i cannot fully accept this perhaps over time they can gain my trust but i doubt it the last time i spent hours with government agents i was promised i would not be prosecuted by now the new name has stuck and that decision is final hanski says max were leaving here in the morning and we need to decide where were going that will be determined by what changes in appearance you have in mind youve made it clear that you want your face altered which presents a challenge you mean with my testimony i ask yes ruckers trial could be six months from now or a year or he may plead guilty and not go to trial i say sure but lets assume he doesnt do that lets assume he goes to trial if you have the surgery now your new face will be on display when you testify if you wait until after the trial youll be much safer safer then but what about now i ask what about the next six months the rucker gang will come after me we know that theyre already thinking of ways and the sooner the better for them if they can get me before the trial then they rub out a valuable witness the next six months are the most dangerous so i want the surgery now immediately okay what about the trial come on chris there are ways to hide me you know that i can testify behind a screen or a veil its been done dont you watch television or movies this gets a chuckle here and there but the mood is pretty serious the thought of testifying against quinn rucker is terrifying but there are ways to protect me we did one last year hitchcock says a big drug trial in new jersey the informant looked nothing like his old self and we put a panel in front of the witness stand so only the judge and jury could see him we used a voicealtering device and the defendants had no idea who he was or what he looked like theyll certainly know who i am i say i just dont want them to see me all right hanski says its your decision then consider it final i say hanski pulls out his cell phone and heads for the door let me make some calls when hes out of the room surhoff says okay while hes doing that can we talk about a destination give us some guidance here max so we can get busy finding a place i say florida except for the marines ive lived my entire life in the hills and mountains i want a change of scenery beaches and views of the ocean a warmer climate i rattle this off as if ive spent hours contemplating it which in fact i have not south florida its too hot maybe pensacola or jacksonville up north where its a bit milder the marshals absorb this and i can see their minds racing surhoff begins hitting keys on his laptop looking for my new place in the sun i relax in a chair my bare feet on the bed and cannot help but relish where i am its almost pm sunday afternoons were the worst days at frostburg like most of the inmates i didnt work on the sabbath and often grew bored there were pickup basketball games and long walks on the jogging trail anything to stay busy visitation was over and those who had seen their families were usually subdued another week was beginning one just like the last one slowly the prison life is fading i know it will be impossible to forget but its time to start the process of putting it all behind me malcolm bannister is still an inmate somewhere but max baldwin is a free man with places to go and things to see after dark we drive into morgantown in search of a steak house along the way we pass a strip club nothing is said but i am sorely tempted i have not seen a naked woman in five years though ive certainly dreamed of them however im not sure gawking at a bunch of strippers will be that fulfilling at this point we find the restaurant thats been recommended and get a table just three old pals having a nice dinner hanski surhoff and i order the largest fillets on the menu and i wash mine down with three draft beers they stick with iced tea but i can tell they envy my drinks we turn in before ten but sleep is impossible i watch television for an hour something i did little of at frostburg at midnight i pick up the copy of the indictment hanski left behind and read every word there is no mention of a ballistics report or of any witnesses there is a lengthy narrative about the crime scene the bullet wounds causes of death the burn marks on naomi clarys body and the empty safe but no descriptions of physical evidence so far quinns confession is all they have that and the suspicion surrounding the cash in his possession an indictment can be amended by the prosecution at almost any time and this one needs some work it appears to be a rush job intended to turn down the heat i am not being critical its a gorgeous document chapter for stanley mumphrey the us attorney for the southern district the event would be the biggest moment yet in his brief career as a federal prosecutor on the job for two years now appointed by the president he had found it all rather mundane and though it was a fabulous addition to his resume it was somewhat unfulfilling until of course judge fawcett and ms clary were murdered instantly stanleys career had new meaning he had the hottest case in the country and like many us attorneys planned to make the most of it the gathering was advertised as a press conference though none of the authorities planned to answer any questions it was a show nothing more nothing less a carefully orchestrated act intended to feed some egos and let the public especially the potential jurors know that the feds had their man and his name was quinn al rucker by am the podium was covered with portable mikes all advertising the television and radio stations from whence they came the courtroom was packed with reporters of all stripes men with bulky cameras stepped on each other as they jockeyed for position all under the watchful eyes of courtroom deputies in the rule books and decisions that govern the practice and procedure of criminal law at both the state and the federal levels nowhere is it written that the announcement or handing down or delivering or issuance of an indictment must be publicized in fact almost none of them are they are formally registered with the clerk once the grand jury makes its decision and eventually served upon the defendant an indictment is only one side of the casethe prosecutions nothing contained within an indictment is evidence at trial the jury never sees it the grand jury that issues an indictment hears only one side of the case that presented by the government occasionally though an indictment is too hot too important just too damned much fun to be allowed to flow benignly through the system it must be publicized by those whove worked so hard to catch a criminal and who will bring him to justice stanley mumphrey did nothing to apprehend quinn rucker but he was certainly the man who would put him on trial in the federal pecking order the us attorney far outranks a mere fbi agent therefore the event belonged to stanley as was customary he would share reluctantly the spotlight with the fbi at a door opened beside the bench and a platoon of hardnosed men in black suits flooded the space behind the podium they jostled for position all with their hands cupped over their balls the arrangement here was crucial because the frame was only so wide standing at the podium side by side were stanley mumphrey and victor westlakehead prosecutor head cop behind them were fbi agents and assistant prosecutors inching together squeezing trying to find a good view of the cameras so the cameras could hopefully see them the lucky ones would listen intently to mr mumphrey and mr westlake and they would frown and act as if they had no clue there was a camera within two miles of the courthouse it was the same pathetic routine perfected by members of congress this morning we have an indictment in the murder case of judge raymond fawcett and ms naomi clary mumphrey said slowly his voice nervous and at least two octaves higher than normal hed been struggling in the courtroom losing the slam dunk cases he assigned to himself and the most common criticism was that he seemed jittery and out of place some felt that it was perhaps because he had spent so little time in the courtroom during his unremarkable tenyear career stanley picked up the indictment and held it higher as if those watching were now expected to read the print this indictment is for two counts of murder the defendant is one quinn al rucker and yes i fully expect to seek the death penalty in this case this last sentence was supposed to send ripples of drama through the crowd but stanleys timing was off drama came quickly though when an aide flashed a large blackandwhite photo of quinn on a screen finally the world saw the man who killed the judge and his secretary guilty reading shakily from his notes stanley gave the background on quinn and managed to convey the impression that quinn had escaped from prison for the sole purpose of exacting revenge against the judge at one point victor westlake standing sentrylike at his shoulder frowned and glanced down at his notes but stanley marched on almost blubbering about his beloved friend and mentor raymond fawcett how much the judge meant to him and so on his voice actually shook a bit when he tried to explain how honored he was to have the awesome responsibility of seeking justice for these gruesome murders it would have taken about two minutes to read the entire indictment then go home but no with a crowd like this and millions watching stanley found it necessary to ramble on and give a speech one about justice and the war on crime after several painful digressions he got back on track near the end when it was time to hand off he praised victor westlake and the entire federal bureau of investigation for its work work that was superhuman tireless and brilliant when he finally shut up westlake thanked him though it was unclear if he was thanking him for shutting up or for passing along so many compliments westlake was far more experienced in these productions than young stanley and he spoke for five minutes without saying anything he thanked his men said he was confident the case had been solved and wished the prosecution well when he finished and took a step back a reporter yelled a question westlake snapped no comment and indicated it was time to go stanley though wasnt ready to leave all those cameras for a second or two he smiled goofily at the crowd as if to say here i am then westlake whispered something to him thank you stanley said and backed away the event was over i watch the press conference in my best western room the thought crosses my mind that with stanley in charge quinn may have a fighting chance after all if the case goes to trial though stanley will likely step aside and allow one of his seasoned assistants to handle matters no doubt hell continue to work the media and begin plotting his run for a higher office but the serious trial work will be done by the pros depending on how long things are delayed stanley might even be out of a job he serves a fouryear term same as the president when a challenger captures the white house all us attorneys are terminated when the press conference is over and the cnn talking heads begin babbling i switch channels but find nothing of interest armed with the remote i have total control over the television i am adjusting to freedom with remarkable ease i can sleep until i wake up i can choose what i wear though the choices so far are limited most important there is no cell mate no one else to contend with in a tenbytwelve cube ive measured the motel room twiceapproximately sixteen feet wide and thirty feet long including the bathroom its a castle by midmorning were on the road going south now on interstate three hours later we arrive at the airport in charleston west virginia where we say farewell to agent chris hanski he wishes me well and i thank him for his courtesies pat surhoff and i board a commuter flight to charlotte north carolina i have no documentation but the marshals service and the airline speak in code i just follow pat and i have to admit im excited as i board the small plane the airport in charlotte is a large open modern place and i stand on a mezzanine for two hours and watch the people come and go i am one of them a free man and i will soon have the ability to walk to the counter and buy a ticket going anywhere at we board a nonstop flight to denver the code pulled off an upgrade and pat and i sit side by side in first class compliments of the taxpayers i have a beer and he has a ginger ale dinner is roasted chicken and gravy and i suppose most of the passengers eat it for sustenance for me its fine dining i have a glass of pinot noir my first sip of wine in many years victor westlake and his entourage left the press conference and drove four blocks to the downtown law office of jimmy lee arnold they presented themselves to the receptionist who was expecting them within minutes she led them down a narrow hall to a large conference room and offered coffee they thanked her and declined jimmy lee was a fixture in the roanoke criminal bar a twentyyear veteran of the drug and vice wars he had represented jakeel staley quinn ruckers nephew four years earlier like so many of the lone gunmen who labor near the fringes of the underworld jimmy lee was a character long gray hair cowboy boots rings on his fingers redframed reading glasses perched on his nose though he was suspicious of the fbi he welcomed them into his domain these were not the first agents to visit there had been many over the years so you got an indictment he said as soon as the introductions were over victor westlake gave a barebones summary of the case against quinn rucker you represented his nephew jakeel staley a few years back right thats right jimmy lee said but i never met quinn rucker im assuming the family or the gang hired you to represent the kid something like that it was a private contract not a court appointment who from the family did you deal with jimmy lees mood changed he reached into a coat pocket and withdrew a small recorder just to be safe he said as he pressed a button lets get this on the record there are three of you one of me i wanna make sure theres no misunderstanding of whats said any problems with this no westlake replied good now you asked me who i dealt with from the family when i was hired to represent jakeel staley right right well im not sure i can answer that client confidentiality and all why dont you tell me why youre interested in this sure quinn rucker gave a confession said he killed judge fawcett because the judge reneged on a bribe said he the gang paid cash to fawcett for a favorable ruling on the motion to suppress the search that yielded a vanload of coke westlake paused and watched jimmy lee carefully jimmy lees eyes yielded nothing he finally shrugged and said so so did you have any knowledge of this bribe if i knew about it then that would be a crime wouldnt it you think im stupid enough to admit to a crime im offended oh dont be offended mr arnold im not accusing you of anything did quinn rucker implicate me in the bribe hes been vague so far said only that a lawyer was the intermediary im sure this particular gang of thugs has access to a lot of lawyers indeed were you surprised when judge fawcett denied the motion to suppress jimmy lee smiled and rolled his eyes nothing surprises me anymore if you believe in the constitution then it was a bad search and the evidence kilos of pure coke should have been kicked out that would take some spine and you dont see much of that anymore especially in big drug busts it takes balls for a judge state or federal to exclude such wonderful evidence regardless of what the cops did to get it no i wasnt surprised how long did you practice in judge fawcetts courtroom since the day he was appointed twenty years ago i knew him well do you believe he would take a bribe a cash bribe for a favorable ruling and a lighter sentence jimmy lee crossed his legs hanging one ostrichskin boot on a knee and locked his hands together just below his gut he thought for a moment then said ive seen judges make some outrageous decisions but usually out of stupidity or laziness but no mr westlake i do not believe judge fawcett or any other state or federal judge within the commonwealth of virginia would take a bribe cash or otherwise i said nothing surprises me but i was wrong such a bribe would shock me would you say judge fawcett had a reputation for high integrity no i wouldnt say that he was okay his first few years on the bench then he changed and became a real hardass my clients have all been charged with crimes but theyre not all criminals fawcett didnt see it that way he was much too happy to send a guy away for twenty years he always sided with the prosecution and the cops and to me thats not integrity but he didnt take money not to my knowledge heres our quandary mr arnold if quinn rucker is telling the truth then how did he manage to get the money to fawcett heres a tough street kid from dc whos never met fawcett before there had to be an intermediary somewhere along the line im not saying its you and theres no suggestion that youre involved in his story but you know the system how did the change hands jimmy lee was shaking his head if the system involves bribery then i dont know how it works okay i resent the implication youre talking to the wrong man again im not implicating or accusing you of anything youre getting pretty damned close jimmy lee slowly got to his feet and reached for the recorder lets say this little meeting is over no need for that mr arnold jimmy lee picked up the recorder and returned it to a pocket its been a real pleasure he said as he yanked open the door and disappeared down the hall directly across church street dee ray rucker was entering another law office as victor westlake and his agents left jimmy lees quinn had been arrested the previous wednesday night and had spent the first ten hours of his captivity in the interrogation room after he confessed on camera he was finally taken to the norfolk city jail placed in solitary and slept for twelve straight hours he was not allowed to use the phone until saturday morning and it took most of the day to reach a family member who was willing to talk early saturday evening quinn was driven from norfolk to roanoke a fourandahalfhour journey once dee ray realized his older brother was in jail for killing a federal judge he scrambled to find a lawyer who would take the case several in dc and virginia declined by late sunday afternoon another roanoke character named dusty shiver had agreed to represent quinn through the initial stages of the prosecution but he reserved the right to step down if a trial became imminent for obvious reasons the local bar was more than a little nervous about representing a man charged with knocking off such an important part of the judiciary dusty shiver had once practiced law with jimmy lee arnold and they were cut from the same mold in law most partnerships large and small blow up usually over the issue of money jimmy lee got stiffed on a fee blamed his partners and moved across the street dusty had managed to spend an hour with quinn at the jail early monday morning before the indictment was announced he was surprised to learn his client had already confessed quinn was adamant that he was coerced tricked pressured threatened and that the confession was bogus he was claiming to be innocent after leaving the jail dusty stopped by the us attorneys office and picked up a copy of the indictment he was poring over it when his secretary buzzed in with the report that mr dee ray rucker had arrived of the two dusty with long gray hair faded jeans and a red leather vest looked more like a drug trafficker and dee ray in a zegna suit looked more like a lawyer they greeted each other cautiously in dustys cluttered office the first issue was the retainer and dee ray opened his prada attache and produced in cash which dusty counted and stuck in a drawer do you know hes already confessed dusty asked as he tucked the money away he what asked dee ray shocked yes hes confessed he says he signed a written statement admitting to the murders and supposedly theres also a video please tell me hes too smart for that hes too smart for that we never talk to cops never quinn would not voluntarily confess to anything even if he was dead guilty thats not our mo if a cop shows up we start calling lawyers he says the interrogation lasted all night long he waived his rights asked for a lawyer several times but the two fbi agents kept hammering away they tripped him up got him confused and he began hallucinating he couldnt shut up they said he was facing two counts of capital murder and that the entire family would be indicted since the killings were a part of gang business they lied to him and said they could help him if he cooperated that the family of judge fawcett was opposed to the death penalty and so on after hours of this they broke him and he gave them what they wanted says he doesnt remember all that happened he was too fatigued when he woke up and tried to recall what had happened it was all a dream a nightmare it took several hours before he realized what he had done but even now he cant remember everything dee ray listened too stunned to speak dusty continued he does remember the fbi agents telling him that they have a ballistics report that matches one of his guns to the crime scene and there is supposedly a boot print of some sort plus there are witnesses who place him in the vicinity at the time of the murders again some of this is vague when can you see the confession ill meet with the us attorney as soon as possible but nothing will happen fast it might be weeks before i see a written confession and the video as well as the other evidence they plan to use if he asked for a lawyer why didnt they stop the interrogation thats a great question usually though the cops will swear that the defendant waived his rights and did not ask for a lawyer his word against theirs in a case this important you can bet the fbi agents will swear to hell and back that quinn never mentioned a lawyer just like theyll swear they did not threaten him or lie to him or promise him a deal they got their confession now theyre trying to build a case with physical evidence if they find nothing then the confession is all they have is it enough oh yes i dont believe this quinns not stupid he would never agree to an interrogation has he ever killed anyone before not that i know of we have other people who do that sort of thing why did he escape from prison you ever been to prison no neither have i but i know lots of guys whove served time everybody wants out i suppose shiver said you ever heard of a guy named malcolm bannister no quinn says they served time together at frostburg and that hes the guy whos behind these accusations says he and bannister were friends and talked at length about judge fawcett and his dirty work hes really bitter at bannister when can i see my brother not until saturday regular visitation ill go back to the jail this afternoon with a copy of the indictment i can pass along any messages if youd like sure tell him to keep his mouth shut im afraid its too late for that chapter the details are vague and unlikely to become clearer pat surhoff is willing to tell me that the clinic is a part of the us army hospital at fort carson but that would be hard to deny he cautiously says that the clinic specializes in ramradical appearance modificationand is used by several agencies of the federal government the plastic surgeons are some of the best and have worked on a lot of faces that might otherwise get blown off if not radically modified i grill him just to watch him squirm but he does not divulge much else after my surgery i will convalesce here for two months before moving on my first appointment is with a therapist of some variety who wants to make sure im ready for the jolting experience of changing not only names but faces as well shes pleasant and thoughtful and i easily convince her that im eager to move on the second meeting is with two doctors both male and a female nurse the woman is needed for the feminine perspective of how i will look afterward it doesnt take me long to realize that these three are very good at what they do using sophisticated software they are able to take my face and make almost any change the eyes are crucial here they say more than once change the eyes and you change everything sharpen the nose a bit leave the lips alone some botox in the folds of the cheeks should work definitely shave the head and keep it that way for almost two hours we fiddle and tinker with the new face of max baldwin in the hands of less experienced surgeons this might be a gutwrenching experience for the past twentyfive years all of my adult life i have looked basically the same my face shaped by genetics weathered by the years and luckily unblemished by wounds or injuries its a nice solid face thats served me well and to suddenly ditch it forever is no small step my new friends say there is no need to change anything only a few ways to improve a nip here a tuck there a bit of tightening and straightening and voila a new version thats every bit as handsome and much safer i assure them im much more concerned with safety than vanity and they readily agree theyve heard this before i cannot help but wonder how many informants snitches and spies theyve worked on hundreds judging by their teamwork as my new look comes together on the large computer screen we have serious discussions about accessories and the three seem genuinely excited when a pair of round tortoiseshell glasses is placed on maxs face thats it the nurse says excitedly and i have to admit max looks a lot smarter and hipper we spend an entire half hour playing around with various mustache schemes before tossing the idea altogether we split on the idea of a beard then decide to just wait and see i promise not to shave for a week so well have a better idea because of the gravity of what were doing my little team is in no hurry we spend the entire morning redesigning max and when everyone is happy they print a highdefinition rendering of my new look i take it with me back to my room and tack it to the wall a nurse studies it and says she likes it i like her too but shes married and does not flirt if she only knew i pass the afternoon reading and walking around the unrestricted areas of the base its much like killing time at frostburg a place far away in both distance and memory i keep coming back to my room to the face on the wall a slick head slightly pointed nose slightly enhanced chin leaner cheeks no wrinkles and the eyes of someone new the middleaged puffiness is gone the eyelids are not quite as large most important max is staring through a pair of round designer frames and he looks pretty damned hip im assuming its just that easy that these doctors can deliver a face that looks exactly like max on the wall but even if they get close ill be pleased no one will recognize their new creation and thats all that matters im too close to judge whether ill look better before or after but the truth is that ill look good enough safety is indeed far more important than vanity at seven the next morning they prep me and roll me into a small operating room the anesthesiologist goes through his routine and i happily float away the operation lasts for five hours and is a great success according to the doctors they have no way of knowing because my face is wrapped like a mummys it will be weeks before the swelling is all gone and the new features take shape four days after he was indicted quinn rucker made his initial appearance in court for the occasion he was kept in the same orange jumpsuit hed been wearing since his arrival at the roanoke city jail he was handcuffed and chained to his waist and his ankles were bound and chained a bulletproof vest was strapped over his shoulders and around his midsection and no fewer than a dozen heavily armed guards agents and deputies escorted him out of the jail and into a bulletproof chevrolet suburban no threats had been made on his life and a secret route would be taken to the federal courthouse but the authorities were taking no chances inside the courtroom reporters and onlookers filled the seats long before ruckers scheduled appearance at am his arrest and indictment were big news with no intervening mass murder or celebrity breakup to steal his thunder outside the courtroom the bindings and armor were removed and quinn entered unshackled as the only participant in an orange jumpsuit and virtually the only black guy in the courtroom quinn certainly looked guilty he sat at a table with dusty shiver and one of his associates across the aisle stanley mumphrey and his brigade of assistants pushed files around with great importance as if preparing to argue before the supreme court out of respect to their fallen comrade the other eleven judges in the southern district had recused themselves from the case the initial appearance would be in front of ken konover a us magistrate who would look and act very much like a presiding judge konover took the bench and called things to order he rattled off a few preliminaries then asked if the defendant had read the indictment he has dusty responded and we waive a formal reading thank you replied konover seated in the first row behind the defense table was dee ray fashionably dressed as always and obviously concerned konover said does the defendant wish to enter a plea at this time on cue dusty stood and nodded at his client who likewise got to his feet awkwardly and said yes sir not guilty very well a plea of not guilty is hereby entered dusty and quinn sat down konover said i have here a motion to set bail mr shiver do you want to be heard on this his tone left no doubt that nothing dusty could say would persuade the court to grant a reasonable bail if any sensing the inevitable and wishing not to embarrass himself dusty said no your honor the motion speaks for itself mr mumphrey stanley stood and walked to the podium he cleared his throat and said your honor this defendant has been indicted for the murder of a federal judge the united states feels strongly that he should be held without bail i agree konover said quickly anything further mr mumphrey no sir not at this time mr shiver no your honor the defendant shall be remanded to the custody of the us marshals service konover tapped his gavel stood and left the bench the initial appearance lasted less than ten minutes dee ray had been in roanoke for three days and was tired of the place he leaned on dusty shiver who leaned on a friend at the jail and a quick meeting was arranged with the accused since visits with the family were on weekends only this one would take place off the record in a room used to test drunk drivers for blood alcohol content no record of it would ever be entered the brothers did not suspect anyone was listening the fbi recorded their conversation a portion of it being quinn im here because of malcolm bannister dee you understand what im saying dee ray i got it i got it and well deal with it later right now you gotta tell me what happened quinn nothin happened i didnt kill nobody they tricked me into the confession like i said i want something done about bannister dee ray hes in prison right quinn probably not knowing bannister he probably used rule to get out dee ray rule quinn everybody on the inside knows rule aint important now hes out and he needs to be found a long pause dee ray lot of time lot of money quinn look little brother dont tell me about time the fibbies got nothin on me i mean nothin that dont mean they cant nail my ass if this thing goes to trial in a year or so bannister might be their star witness hear what im sayin dee ray and whats he gonna say quinn hell say whatever it takes he dont care hes out man he cut the deal hell say we talked about judge fawcett back in prison thats what hell say dee ray did you another long pause quinn yeah we talked about him all the time we knew he kept cash a pause quinn you gotta get bannister dee ray okay dee ray okay let me talk to tall man chapter three weeks postsurgery and im climbing the walls the bandages are off and the stitches are gone but the swelling is taking forever i look in the mirror a hundred times a day waiting for things to improve waiting for max to emerge from the bruising and puffiness my surgical team stops by constantly to tell me how great i look but im sick of these people i cant chew cant eat cant walk for more than five minutes and so most of my time is spent rolling around in a wheelchair movements must be slow and calculated otherwise i could rip out some of the fine artwork that has gone into the face of max reed baldwin i count the days and often think im in prison again weeks pass and the swelling and bruising slowly go away is it possible to be in love with a woman youve never actually touched i have convinced myself the answer is yes her name is vanessa young and i met her at frostburg in the visitors room on a cold wintry saturday morning i shouldnt say that i met her but i saw her for the first time she was there visiting her brother a guy i knew and liked we met later during another visit but we couldnt touch i wrote her letters and she wrote a few back but it became painfully obvious at least to me that my infatuation with vanessa was not exactly a twoway street i cannot begin to contemplate the hours ive invested fantasizing about this woman over the past two years our lives have changed dramatically and now i am emboldened to contact her my new best friend pat surhoff informed me that i cannot write or receive letters while at fort carson but i write one anyway i work on it for days tweaking editing killing time i bare my soul to vanessa and practically beg her to see me ill find a way to mail it later surhoff is back to fetch me we leave fort carson in a hurry and drive to denver where we board a nonstop flight to atlanta i wear a baseball cap and big sunglasses and i do not catch a single curious glance i bitch about the seating arrangement were sitting side by side in coach not first class pat says congress is cutting budgets everywhere after a hearty lunch of raisins and cokes we get down to business he opens a delightful little file with all sorts of goodies a virginia court order changing my name to max reed baldwin a new social security card issued to the same guy a birth certificate proving i was born in memphis to parents ive never heard of and a florida drivers license with a fake photo taken from the computerized rendering my doctors and i concocted before the surgery it looks so real that not even i can tell its fake pat explains that ill get another in a month or so when my face finally comes together same for a passport we fill out applications for visa and american express cards at his suggestion ive been practicing a different handwriting one that resembles chicken scratch but is not much worse than the old one max signs a sixmonth lease for a onebedroom condo in neptune beach a few miles east of jacksonville and he applies for a checking account at suncoast bank pat tells me theres a branch office three blocks from the condo the reward money of will be wired into the account as soon as its up and running and from there i can do with it what i want because i will hit the ground with so much cash the powers that be feel as though i dont need much from them i really cant gripe about this he says the irs will grant me a waiver from any taxes on the money and provides the name of an accountant who knows both the irs code and whatever code the marshals use he hands me an envelope with in cash and says this should be enough to get me plugged in we talk about the ins and outs of leasing a car as opposed to buying one and he explains that a lease is easier and will help build a good credit rating he hands me a twopage summary of the life of max baldwin and it reads like an obituary parents siblings education employment history and im intrigued to know that ive spent most of my life in seattle and have been divorced twice no children im relocating to florida because its about as far away from wife number two as i can get its important for me to memorize this fiction and stick with the script i have an employment history all with government agencies and a credit score on the issue of employment i have two choices the first is that of a procurement officer at the mayport naval station a few miles north of neptune beach starting salary of two months of training required the second is that of an account manager for the veterans administration also at a year its best if i remain a federal employee at least for the first few years however pat stresses for the tenth time my life now belongs to me and i can do whatever i want the only boundaries are those dictated by my past just as i begin to feel somewhat overwhelmed he reaches into his briefcase and pulls out the toys the first is an apple ipad mine courtesy of the government and already registered to max as the librarian malcolm had access to computers but not the internet and i worked hard to keep my skills as fresh as possible but this thing blows me away we spend a full hour in an intense tutorial when im exhausted he pulls out an iphone its his not mine because ill have to select a service provider and buy my own phone but he walks me through this amazing device the flight is over before we can finish i find a computer store in the atlanta airport and i kill an hour browsing through the gadgets technology will be the key to my survival and i am determined to know the latest before we leave atlanta i mail the letter to vanessa young no return address we land in jacksonville at dark rent a car and drive thirty minutes to the beaches east of the city atlantic beach neptune beach jacksonville beach you cant tell where one ends and the other begins its a cool area with hundreds of neat cottages some residential some rentals and assorted small hotels and modern condos facing the ocean the raisins for lunch are long forgotten and we are starving we find a seafood place on a pedestrian mall a block from the water and devour oysters and shrimp its a young crowd at the bar lots of pretty girls with tanned legs and i cant help but stare so far everyone is white and i wonder if ill stand out the jacksonville metro area has a million people and percent of them are black so pat does not think my ethnicity will be a problem i attempt to explain what its like being black in a white world but realize again that some things cannot be fully covered over dinner if ever i change the subject and ask questions about the witness security program pat is based in virginia and will soon return home another marshal will become my contact my handler and this person will not in any way attempt to keep me under surveillance he or she will always be close by in case of problems or trouble typically my handler will have several other persons to monitor if there is a hint of something gone wrong i will be moved at once to another location but pat assures me this rarely happens what will it take for the bad guys to find me pat says he doesnt know because this has never happened i press him but surely youve had to relocate some people ive never been involved in a relocation but yes it has happened to my knowledge and ive been handling informants for ten years there has not been a serious threat against one but ive heard of a couple maybe three who became convinced they had been discovered they wanted to move so we swooped in and they vanished again for obvious reasons neither the law library nor the general library at frostburg offered books on witness protection so my knowledge is limited but i know the program has not been perfect so no problems whatsoever thats hard to believe i didnt say it was perfect theres a great story from thirty years ago a legend in the business we had a serious mafia informant who squealed on the family and took down some big bosses one of the fbis biggest grand slams ever this guy had a bullseye on him you could hit blindfolded we took him deep buried him and a few years passed he was a postal inspector in a town of fifty thousand perfect cover but he was a crook right a thug by birth and it was impossible for him to stay clean he opened a usedcar lot then another he got into the pawnshop business started fencing stolen goods and eventually found his way into the marijuana trade we knew who he was but the fbi did not when he got indicted he called his handler to come bail him out of jail the handler freaked out as did everyone along the ladder all the way up to the director of the fbi there was a mad scramble to get him out of jail and off to a new location jobs were threatened deals were cut judges were pleaded with and they eventually got his charges dismissed but it was a close call so dont start laundering money again he thinks his last comment is funny ive never laundered money i say without a smile sorry we finish dessert and head for my new home its on the seventh floor of a tower one of four in a cluster lined up along the beach with tennis courts and pools scattered below pat explains that most of the units are rentals but a few have permanent residents im here for six months and then its up to me its a onebedroom unit furnished with a kitchenden combo nice sofa and chairs nothing luxurious but not cheap either after hes gone i stand on my small balcony and stare at the moon over the ocean i breathe the salty air and listen to the waves gently roll ashore freedom is exhilarating and indescribable i forgot to close the curtains and i wake up to a blinding sun it is my first true morning as a liberated and unwatched person and i cant wait to feel sand between my toes there are a few early birds on the beach and i hustle down there my face partially hidden behind a cap and sunglasses no one notices no one cares people who roam aimlessly up and down beaches are lost in their own worlds and i am quickly getting lost in mine i have no family no job no responsibilities and no past max is starting a brandnew life pat surhoff retrieves me around noon and we have a sandwich for lunch then he drives me to the mayport naval station where i have an appointment with a doctor who knows the code the surgery is progressing nicely no complications whatsoever ill return in two weeks for another exam next we go to the suncoast bank branch near the condo and as we get close pat preps me for whats coming he will not go inside because its important for me to establish the account myself no one in the bank knows the code its strictly aboveboard for the time being max baldwin is semiretired not working and pondering a move to the area he wants to open a standard checking account no frills and so on and will put down cash as the initial deposit once the account is opened max will return to the bank and get the proper wiring instructions inside the bank i am routed to the lovely gretchen hiler a fortyish bleached blonde whos spent far too much time in the sun she has a small desk in a tight cubicle and no wedding ring she has no way of knowing that she is the first woman ive been truly alone with in over five years try as i do i cannot stop a lot of improper thoughts or maybe theyre just natural gretchen is a chatterbox and at this moment so am i we go through the paperwork quickly with me proudly giving a real address i put down a thousand in cash she fetches some temporary checks and promises more in the mail later when all business has ended we keep talking she gives me her card and is willing to help in any way i promise to call when i get a cell phone the bank needs a phone number i almost ask her to dinner primarily because im convinced she might say yes but i wisely let it pass there will be plenty of time for that later after im more comfortable and my face is easier to look at hopefully i proposed to dionne when i was twentyfour years old and from that moment until the day i was sentenced and taken into custody i was never unfaithful there was one near miss with the wife of an acquaintance but we both realized things would end badly as a smalltown lawyer i saw a lot of divorces and i was constantly amazed at the awful ways men could screw up their lives and families simply because they couldnt resist temptation a quickie then a casual fling then something more serious and before long they were in court getting their eyeballs clawed out and losing their kids along with their money the truth was i adored my wife and i was getting all the sex i wanted at home the other part of the truth was that i never fancied myself as a ladies man before dionne i had girlfriends and enjoyed my single days but i never hopped blindly from one bed to another now fortythree and single i have a hunch there are a lot of women around my age who are looking for companionship i can feel the urge but at the same time all movements must be calculated as i walk out of the bank i feel a sense of accomplishment i just pulled off the first little mission of my secret existence pat has been waiting in the car and when i get in he says well no problem what took so long the account manager is a cute girl and she threw herself at me has this always been a problem i wouldnt call it a problem but yes women are attracted to me ive always had to fight them off with a stick keep fighting its been the downfall of many men so youre an expert on women not at all where are we going now shopping i want some decent clothes we find a mens store and i spend upgrading my wardrobe once again pat waits in the car we agree that two men both in their early forties one white and the other black shopping together might raise an eyebrow or two my goal is to raise as few eyebrows as possible next he drops me off at a florida cellular office where i open an account and buy an iphone with it in my pocket i finally feel like a real american connected we spend the next two days running errands and getting max firmly established i write my first check to a carleasing agency and drive away in a used audi a convertible mine for the next twelve months at a pop and fully insured now that im mobile and now that pat and i are getting on each others nerves he starts talking about his exit im ready for the independence and hes ready to go home i visit gretchen again to check on the banks wiring instructions and explain to her that a substantial sum of money is on the way pat clears things with his higherups and the reward money is moved from some buried account to suncoast i assume that everybody involved in the wire transfer invokes all the standard precautions i have no way of knowing the wire is being watched chapter dusty shivers motion to suppress the confession was not at all unexpected it was lengthy well written well reasoned and backed up by a thirtypage affidavit signed by quinn rucker in which he fully recanted his confession three days after it was filed victor westlake and two of his agents met with stanley mumphrey and two of his assistants their goal was to plow through the motion and prepare responses to it neither mumphrey nor anyone else in his office was aware of the interrogation tactics used by agents pankovits and delocke nor did they know that westlake and four of his men had watched by closed circuit the tenhour marathon and had a tape of it this information would never be revealed to the us attorney thus it would never be known to the defense the judge or anyone else stanley had been fully briefed by his lieutenants and took control of the meeting he began by saying the first and most important issue is the allegation that the defendant wanted to talk to a lawyer westlake nodded to an agent who whipped out some papers westlake said we have here two affidavits from agents pankovits and delocke our two interrogators in which they respond to the allegations as you will see they say that the defendant mentioned a lawyer on a couple of occasions but never specifically demanded one he never stopped the interrogation he wanted to talk stanley and his men scanned the affidavits after a few minutes stanley said okay point number two the defendant claims he was repeatedly threatened with the death penalty by both agents if true this of course would be highly improper and would probably kill the confession westlake replied as he shook his head look at the bottom of page seven both affidavits the agents state under oath that they made no threats whatsoever these are very skilled interrogators stan and they know the rules as well as anybody stanley and his men flipped to page seven and read the text perfect whatever quinn claimed in his affidavit there were two fbi agents willing to tell what really happened stanley said looks good the third point is that the agents promised the defendant he would not be put on trial for capital murder page nine westlake said our agents know they do not have the authority to make deals only the us attorney can do that frankly i find such an allegation ludicrous rucker is a career thug he should know that prosecutors make deals not cops i agree stanley said quickly the next allegation is that the fbi agents threatened to prosecute other members of ruckers family dont they always say that stan they give a confession free and voluntarily then cant wait to tear it up and say they were threatened youve seen this many times of course stan had though he really had not westlake went on though i must say it wouldnt be a bad idea to round up all the ruckers and give em the needle westlakes men laughed stanleys men laughed a regular party what about the allegation that the interrogators were abusive and pushed the suspect past the point of exhaustion heres the truth stan westlake replied the agents repeatedly asked rucker if he wanted to stop and continue later he said no because he did not want to spend the night in the county jail we checked and the jail was packed badly overcrowded they informed rucker of this and he didnt want to go there this made perfect sense to stanley he said okay the next three items need to be addressed but i dont think well say much about them in our response there is the allegation that the fbi agents lied about having a ballistics report that linked the murders to the smith amp wesson handgun confiscated from the defendant unfortunately as we now know the ballistics excluded this weapon lying is permissible especially in a highlevel interrogation such as this stanley westlake said much like a wise old professor got that but just to satisfy my curiositydid your agents actually lie about this of course not no definitely not page twelve of their affidavits didnt think so what about this next allegationthat your agents lied about the existence of a crime scene boot print that matched some boots taken from the defendant not true stan the imagination of a desperate lawyer and his guilty client do you have a boot print westlake glanced at one of his agents as though there just might be a boot print that he had somehow forgotten the agent shook his head no westlake admitted theres no boot print and next we have the allegation that your agents lied about a couple of eyewitnesses the first supposedly saw the defendant in the town of ripplemead about the time of the killings any truth to this westlake shifted his weight from one ass cheek to the other and offered a condescending smile stan look im not sure you appreciate what it takes to break down a guilty suspect there are tricks okay and i get it and you have to instill fear to make the suspect think you have a lot more proof than maybe you actually have ive seen no report from such a witness and you will not he doesnt exist were on the same side here vic i just need to know the truth so we can respond to the motion to suppress understand i understand and the second witness the one at the country store near the cabin he doesnt exist either right right did the agents use any other tricks that i dont know about no westlake said but no one in the room believed him so to summarize our case against quinn rucker we have no eyewitnesses no ballistics no boot print no fingerprints no physical evidence of any kind correct westlake nodded slowly but said nothing we have a defendant who was in the roanoke area after the murders but no proof he was here beforehand right more nodding and our defendant was caught with more cash than one would normally carry around substantially more i would say westlake agreed but then mr rucker is a selfconfessed drug runner from a family notorious for trafficking so cash would not be a problem stanley shoved his legal pad away and rubbed his temples gentlemen we have a confession and nothing else if we lose the confession then mr rucker walks and theres no trial you cant lose the confession stan westlake said its unthinkable i have no plans to lose it but i can see the judge taking a dim view of the interrogation the length of it bothers me ten hours throughout the night an obviously fatigued suspect whos a seasoned crook and would probably want to see a lawyer two veteran interrogators who know all the tricks this might be a close call westlake listened with a smile and after a long pause said lets not forget our star witness stan malcolm bannister will testify that quinn rucker talked repeatedly of murdering judge fawcett he wanted revenge and he wanted his money back true and his testimony plus the confession will get a conviction but standing alone his testimony is not enough you dont sound too confident stan quite the contrary this is the murder of a federal judge i cannot imagine another federal judge showing any sympathy for quinn rucker well have the confession and we have malcolm bannister well get a conviction now youre talking by the way whats up with our boy bannister safe and sound buried deep by the us marshals where is he sorry stan some things we cannot talk about but have no worries hell be here when we need him chapter pat surhoffs replacement is diana tyler i meet them for lunch after a long morning at the hospital where i was examined and was told to return in a month ms tyler is a tall pretty woman of about fifty with a short haircut little makeup a navy blazer and no wedding band shes pleasant enough and over salads gives me her spiel she lives in the area and works with a few others who share my situation she is available and would like to have a chat by phone at least once a week she understands what im going through and says its natural to keep looking over my shoulder with time though those fears will go away and my life will become quite normal if i leave town and they stress this is something i can now do whenever i want she would like the details of my trip in advance they want to keep close tabs on me until long after i testify against quinn rucker and they persist in painting the picture of a safe and pleasant future that i will know one day when all of the initial hurdles have been cleared they mention the two job interviews and i throw a curve by explaining im not ready for employment with cash in the bank and unrestrained freedom im just not ready to start a new career i want to travel some take long drives and maybe go to europe traveling is fine they agree but the cover works best if i have a real job we decide to talk about it later this leads to a conversation about a passport and an updated drivers license another week and my face should be ready to be photographed and diana promises to arrange the documentation over coffee i give pat a letter to my father the return address is the federal correctional facility in fort wayne indiana he will send it to the prison there and someone will mail it to henry bannister in winchester virginia in the letter i explain to old henry that i screwed up at frostburg and have been busted back to a regular prison i am in solitary confinement and can have no visitors for at least three months i ask him to notify my sister ruby in california and my brother marcus in dc i tell him not to worry im fine and i have a plan to work my way back to frostburg pat and i say our farewells i thank him for his courtesies and professionalism and he wishes me well he assures me my new life will be rewarding and secure im not sure i believe this because im still looking over my shoulder i strongly suspect the fbi will monitor me for some time at least until the day when quinn rucker is convicted and sent away the truth is i cannot afford to trust anyone including pat surhoff diana tyler the us marshals service and the fbi there are a lot of shadows back there not to mention the bad guys if the government wants to watch me theres little i can do they can obtain court orders to snoop into my bank account to listen to my phone calls to monitor my credit card activity and to watch everything i do online i anticipate all of the above and my challenge in the near future is to deceive them without letting them know they are being deceived taking one of the two jobs would only allow them another opportunity to spy during the afternoon i open another checking account at atlantic trust and move from the suncoast account then i do the same thing at a third bank jacksonville savings in a day or two once the checks have cleared i will begin withdrawing cash as i putter around the neighborhood in my little audi i spend as much time looking in the mirror as i do watching the road its already a habit when i walk the beach i check out every face i see when i walk into a store i immediately find cover and watch the door i just came through i never eat in the same restaurant twice and i always find a table with a view of the parking lot i use the cell phone only for routine matters and i assume someone is listening i pay cash for a laptop set up three gmail accounts and do my browsing in internet cafes using their servers i begin experimenting with prepaid credit cards i buy at a walgreens pharmacy i install two hidden cameras in my condo just in case someone drops in while im away paranoia is the key here i convince myself someone is always watching and listening and as the days pass i fall deeper into my own little world of deception i call diana every other day with the latest news in my increasingly mundane life and she gives no hint of being suspicious but then she would not the lawyers name is murray huggins and his small yellow pages ad announces specialties in just about everything divorce real estate bankruptcy criminal matters and so forth pretty much the same hamandegg routine we followed at dear old copeland reed amp bannister his office is not far from my condo and one look suggests the laidback beach practice of a guy who comes in at nine and is on the golf course by three during our first appointment murray tells me his life story he had great success in a big law firm in tampa but burned out at the age of fifty and tried retirement he moved to atlantic beach got a divorce got bored and decided to hang out his shingle hes in his sixties now happy in his little office where he puts in a few hours here and there and chooses his clients carefully we go through my biography and i for the most part stick to the script a couple of exwives in seattle and so forth i add my own new wrinkle of being a fledgling screenwriter who is polishing up my first script with a lucky break here and there the script has been optioned by a small production company that does documentaries for various business reasons i need to establish a small front in florida for murray can build a few firewalls hell set up an llclimited liability companyin florida with m r baldwin as the sole owner the llc will then form a corporation in delaware with murray as the sole incorporator and me as the sole owner the registered address will be his office and my name will appear in none of the corporate documents he says i do this all the time florida attracts a lot of folks who are trying to start over if you say so murray i could do this myself online but its safer to route it through a lawyer the confidentiality is important i can pay murray to do things the shadows will never suspect and be unable to trace with his seasoned guidance skelter films comes to life two and a half months after the arrest of quinn rucker and two weeks after i move into my beachfront condo i am informed over coffee one morning by diana that the feds would like to have a meeting there are several reasons for this the most important being their desire to update me on their case and talk about the trial they want to plan my testimony i am certain they also want to get a good look at max baldwin who by the way is an improvement over malcolm bannister the swelling is gone the nose and chin are a bit sharper the eyes look much younger and the round red tortoiseshell glasses give the look of a pretty cool cerebral documentary filmmaker i shave my face once a week so there is always some stubble with just a touch of gray mixed in the slick scalp requires a razor every other day my cheeks are flatter primarily because i ate little during my recovery and ive lost weight i plan to keep it off all in all i look nothing like my former self and while this is often unsettling it is also comforting the suggestion is that i return to roanoke to meet with stanley mumphrey and his gang but i flatly say no diana assures me that the fbi and the us attorneys office do not know where im hiding and i pretend to believe this i do not want to meet them in florida after some haggling we agree to meet at a hotel in charleston south carolina diana books our tickets and we fly out of jacksonville on the same flight but nowhere close to each other from the moment we walk into the lobby of the hotel i know im being watched and probably photographed the fbi cant wait to see how i look i catch a couple of quick glances but keep moving after a sandwich in my room i meet diana in the hallway and we walk to a suite two floors above us it is well guarded by two thick boys in black suits who appear ready to begin firing away at the slightest provocation as a marshal diana has no role in the prosecution therefore she remains outside with the two dobermans while i enter and meet the gang stanley mumphrey has brought three of his assistants and their names are lost in the deluge of introductions my pal agent chris hanski is back no doubt to eyeball me for a good beforeandafter he has a sidekick name instantly forgotten as we awkwardly take seats around a small conference table i cant help but notice amid the pile of papers a couple of identical photos its malcolm bannister and these guys were looking at him now theyre gawking at max the transformation impresses them since hanski is the only one who actually met me before the change he goes first i gotta say max you look younger and fitter not sure youre that much cuter but all in all not a bad makeover hes jovial and this is supposed to break the ice that means so much i say with a fake smile stanley holds the copied photo and says not even close max no one would suspect you and malcolm are the same its pretty remarkable were all on the same team now so we banter back and forth like old friends but theres no foundation so the conversation begins to lag is there a trial date i ask and this changes the mood yes stanley says october in roanoke thats only four months away i reply seems pretty quick were pretty efficient in the southern district stanley says smugly the average is eight months from indictment to trial this case has a bit more pressure behind it whos the judge sam stillwater on loan from the northern district all of fawcetts colleagues in the southern recused themselves tell me about the trial i say stanley frowns as does the rest of the gang it might be rather brief max not a lot of witnesses not a lot of proof well establish rucker was in the vicinity at the time well prove he had a lot of cash when we caught him well go into the prosecution of his nephew the sentencing by judge fawcett maybe there was a revenge element at work stanley pauses here and i cant resist a jab pretty overwhelming stuff i say like a smartass no doubt then we have the confession which the defense has attacked we have a hearing next week before judge stillwater and we expect to win and keep the confession other than that max the star witness might just be you ive told you everything you know my testimony right right but we want to cover it again now that weve filled in a few gaps lets nail it down to perfection sure hows my buddy quinn holding up quinns not doing too well these days he doesnt like solitary confinement or the food the guards the rules says hes innocentwhat a surprise i think he misses the good life at the federal country club so do i this gets a light laugh or two his lawyer convinced the judge that quinn needed a psychiatric evaluation the doctor said he can stand trial but needs some antidepressants hes quite moody and often goes days without speaking to anyone that sounds like the quinn i knew does he mention me oh yes he doesnt like you either he suspects youre our informant and that youll testify against him at trial when do you have to submit your list of witnesses sixty days before the trial have you told quinns lawyer that i will testify no we do not divulge anything until forced to do so thats the way i remember it i say these guys forget that i was once on the receiving end of a federal prosecution with fbi agents sifting through every aspect of my life and a us attorneys office threatening to incarcerate not only me but my two innocent partners as well they think were pals now one big happy team walking lockstep toward another just verdict if i could i would knife them in the back and poison their case theythe federal governmenttook away five years of my life along with my son my wife and my career how dare they sit here as if were trusted partners we eventually get around to my testimony and spend a couple of hours in review this ground has been covered before and i find it tedious mumphreys chief assistant has a script a q ampa for me to study and i have to admit its pretty good nothing has been left out i try to visualize the surreal setting of my testimony i will be brought into the courtroom wearing a mask i will sit behind a panel or a partition of some manner that will prevent the lawyers the defendant and the spectators from seeing my face once the mask is removed i will look at the jurors the lawyers will pitch questions over the wall and i will answer my voice distorted quinn and his family and their thugs will be there straining for any hint of recognition theyll know its me of course but theyll never see my face as certain as it seems i seriously doubt if it will ever happen chapter diana calls with the news that she has in her possession my new florida drivers license and my new passport we meet for coffee at a waffle house and she hands them over i give her an itinerary with a lot of gaps in it taking a trip huh she says gazing at it yep i cant wait to try out the new passport the first three nights are in miami south beach beginning tonight im leaving and driving down as soon as my coffee cup is empty from there ill fly to jamaica for a week or so then to antigua and maybe trinidad ill call you at each stop ill leave my car at the miami airport so you can tell the fbi exactly where it is and while youre at it ask them to please leave me alone while i bounce around the caribbean leave you alone she asks feigning ignorance you heard me lets not play games here diana i may not be the most heavily protected witness in the country but im probably in the top three somebodys always watching theres one guy i call him crew cut who ive seen five times in the past two weeks hes not very good so please pass this along to the fibbies when you make your report six feet even pounds raybans blond goatee drives a cooper and sports a crew cut really really sloppy im surprised so is she she keeps her eyes on my itinerary and can think of nothing to say busted i pay for the coffee and hit the road interstate straight south for miles the weather is hot and muggy the traffic heavy and slow and i love every mile of the trip i stop frequently to refuel to stretch my legs and to watch for movements behind me i expect none since the fbi knows where im going they wont bother with a tail besides i assume there is a gps tracking monitor brilliantly hidden somewhere in my car seven hours later i stop in front of the blue moon hotel one of the many small renovated boutique hotels in the heart of the art deco district at south beach i get my briefcase and small bag from the trunk hand the keys to the valet and walk into a scene from miami vice ceiling fans turn slowly as guests in whitewicker chairs gossip and drink checking in sir the pretty girl asks yes max baldwin i reply and for some reason it is a proud moment i mighty max am drowning in more freedom than i can absorb at the moment plenty of cash fresh papers that are legit a convertible that will take me anywhereits almost overwhelming but i am jolted back to life when a tall tanned brunette strolls through the lobby her top is whats left of a string bikini and covers almost nothing her bottom is a sheer skirt that covers even less i hand over a visa card for the charges i could also use either cash or a prepaid credit card but since the fibbies know where im staying theres no need to be deceptive im sure the miami office has been notified and theres probably a set of eyes not too far away if i were really paranoid i could believe that the fbi has already been in my room and perhaps hidden a bug or two i get to my room see no bugs or spooks take a quick shower and change into shorts and sandals i go to the bar to check out the talent i eat alone in the hotel cafe and catch the eye of a fortyish woman who is dining with what appears to be a female friend later back in the bar i see her again and we introduce ourselves eva from puerto rico were having a drink when the band starts eva wants to dance and though its been years i hit the floor with all the energy i have around midnight eva and i make it to my room where we immediately undress and hop into bed i almost pray the fbi has the room wired for even the meekest of sounds if so eva and i give them an earful i hustle out of the cab at a curb on th avenue in downtown miami its am already hot and after a few minutes of brisk walking my shirt is sticking to my back i dont think im being followed but i duck and dart just the same the building is a squat fivestory box so ugly you cant believe someone paid an architect to design it but then i doubt if most of the tenants are cuttingedge companies one happens to be called corporate registry services or crs a name so bland and innocuous that no one would ever know the companys business and most people would not want to crs may be perfectly legitimate but it attracts a lot of clients who are not its an address a dropoff a front a phoneanswering service that a corporation can hire to buy some measure of authenticity since i have not called ahead i kill an hour waiting for an account representative loyd is his name and he eventually leads me back to a small stuffy office and offers me a chair across from his landfill of a desk we chat for a few minutes as he scans the questionnaire ive filled out what is skelter films he finally asks a documentary film production company who owns it me incorporated in delaware how many films have you made none just getting started what are the chances of skelter films being around two years from now slim he hears this shadiness all the time and it doesnt faze him sounds like a front thats pretty accurate we require an affidavit in which you swear under oath that your company will not be engaged in criminal activities i swear it will not hes heard this before too okay heres how we operate we provide skelter with a physical address here in this building when we get mail we forward it to wherever you say we provide a phone number and all incoming calls will be handled by a live voice wholl chirp whatever you want good morning skelter films how can i direct your call or something else you got partners no any employees fictional or otherwise ill have a few names all fictional no problem if the caller asks for one of these ghosts our girl will say whatever you want sorry hes filming on location or whatever you write the fiction and well deliver it as soon as we get a call we notify you what about a web site im not sure about this so i say not yet what are the pros loyd shifts weight and leans on his elbows okay lets say skelter is a legitimate company that will make lots of documentaries if so it will need a web site for all the usual reasonsmarketing information ego on the other hand lets pretend skelter is a real corporation but not a real film company maybe its trying to just give that impression for whatever reason a web site is a great way to bolster the image to sort of fudge on reality nothing illegal mind you but we can establish a web site with stock photos and biographies of your staff your films awards ongoing projects you name it how much ten grand im not sure i want or need to spend the money not at this point anyway let me ponder it i say and loyd shrugs how much for your basic registry services address phone fax and everything related is a month payable six months in advance you accept cash loyd smiles and says oh yes we prefer cash no surprise there i pay the money sign a contract sign the affidavit form promising to keep my activities legal and leave his office crs boasts of nine hundred satisfied clients and as i walk through the lobby i cant help but feel as though ive joined some manner of underworld filled with shell companies faceless crooks and foreign tax evaders what the hell after two more nights with eva she wants me to go home to puerto rico with her i promise to think about it then slip away from the blue moon and drive to the miami international airport where i park in longterm and shuttle to the terminals i pull out a credit card and my new passport and buy a oneway ticket to montego bay on air jamaica the plane is packed half darkskinned native jamaicans and half palewhite tourists headed for the sun before we take off the lovely attendants are serving rum punch the flight takes fortyfive minutes on the ground the customs agent takes far too long studying my passport and im starting to panic when he finally waves me through i find the bus to rum bay resort an allinclusive singlesonly fairly notorious stretch of topless beaches for three days i sit in the shade by the pool and ponder the meaning of life from jamaica i fly to antigua in the leeward islands of the eastern caribbean its a lovely island a hundred square miles with mountains and white beaches and dozens of resorts its also known as one of the worlds friendlier tax havens these days and this is one reason for my visit if i wanted nothing more than a good party i would have stayed in jamaica the capital is st johns a bustling town of thirty thousand situated on a deep harbor that attracts cruise ships i check into my room in a small inn on the edge of st johns with a beautiful view of the water boats and yachts its june the offseason and for a night i will eat like a king sleep until noon and relish the fact that no one knows who i am where i came from or anything about my past chapter the freezer had been dismantled a month earlier and victor westlake was settled back into his routine and office on the fourth floor of the hoover building in washington though the murders of judge fawcett and naomi clary were technically solved many doubts and questions remained the most pressing issue of course was the validity of quinn ruckers confession if the judge suppressed it the government would be left with little proof with which to go forward the murders were solved but the case was not closed at least in westlakes opinion he was still spending two hours each day dealing with it there was the daily report on the business of max baldwin his movements meetings phone calls internet activity et cetera so far max had done nothing to surprise them westlake did not like the trip to jamaica and beyond but there was nothing he could do about it they were watching as closely as possible there was the daily report on ruckers family the fbi had obtained court approval to monitor phone conversations of dee ray rucker sammy tall man rucker their sister lucinda and four relatives involved in the dc unit of their trafficking operation on wednesday june westlake was in a staff meeting when he was summoned to the phone it was urgent and within minutes he was in a conference room with technicians who were working quickly to prepare the audio one of them said the call came to dee rays cell phone last night at not sure where it came from but here it is the first voice is dee ray the second is sully we have not yet identified sully another technician said here it is dee ray yeah sully dee ray sully here dee ray what you got sully got the snitch man bannister dee ray no shit man sully no shit dee ray dee ray okay dont tell me how just tell me where sully well hes a beach bum now in florida name is max baldwin lives in a little condo in neptune beach east of jacksonville seems to have some money taking it easy you know the good life dee ray whats he look like sully a different dude lots of surgery but the same height down a few pounds same walk plus we got a fingerprint and a match dee ray a fingerprint sully our firm is good they followed him down the beach and saw him toss a water bottle in the trash they picked it up got a print dee ray that is good sully like i said what now dee ray sit tight let me sleep on it he aint going nowhere right sully no hes a happy boy dee ray beautiful westlake slowly fell into a chair slackjawed and pale too shaken to speak for a moment then get me twill a flunky disappeared and while he waited westlake rubbed his eyes and contemplated his next move twill the top assistant arrived in a rush and they listened to the tape again for westlake it was even more chilling the second time around how in the twill mumbled westlake was recovering call bratten at the marshals service bratten had surgery yesterday twill said newcombe is in charge then get newcombe on the phone we cant waste time here ive joined a gym and i spend an hour there each day around noon walking uphill on a treadmill and doing reps with light weights if i plan to spend so much time on the beach i need to look the part after some steam and a long shower i am dressing when the cell phone starts buzzing in the top of my locker its dear diana and an odd time for her to be calling hello i say quietly though the locker room is not busy we need to talk she says abruptly the firstever hint that something might be out of place about what not now there are two fbi agents in the parking lot in a maroon jeep cherokee parked next to your car theyll give you a ride and how exactly do you know where i am at this moment diana lets discuss it later i sit in a folding chair talk to me diana whats going on max im ten minutes away follow orders get in the jeep and ill tell you everything i know as soon as i see you lets not do it over the phone okay i finish dressing and try to act as calm as always i walk through the gym and smile at a yoga instructor ive been smiling at for a week now and make my way to the front door i glance outside and see the maroon jeep parked next to my car at this point its fairly obvious that something dreadful has happened so i swallow hard and step into the blinding midday sun the driver hops out and without a word opens a rear door i ride for seven minutes in complete silence until we park in the driveway of a quaint duplex cottage with a for rent sign in the front yard its a block from the ocean as soon as the engine is turned off both agents jump out and scan the periphery as if snipers might be up there just waiting the knot in my stomach feels like a bowling ball we make it inside without getting shot and diana is waiting nice place you have here i say its a safe house she replies oh okay and why are we hiding in a safe house in the middle of a perfectly fine day a grayhaired man enters from the kitchen and thrusts out a hand max im dan raynor us marshal supervisor for this area we shake hands like old friends and hes actually smiling as if were about to have a long lunch a real pleasure i say whats going on there are four of themraynor diana and the two nameless fbi agentsand for a few seconds theyre not sure of the protocol here whose territory whos included who stays and who leaves as ive already learned these crossagency turf fights can be confusing raynor does the talking max im afraid theres been a breach to put it bluntlyyour cover has been blown we have no idea how this happened i sit down and wipe my forehead who knows what i ask raynor says we dont know much but there are some folks flying in from washington right now they should be here in an hour or so evidently the fbi picked up something last night from a wiretap there was some chatter among the rucker family and the fbi heard it they know where i am they do they know exactly where youre living were very sorry about this max diana says and i glare at her and her stupidity as if i could strangle her gosh that means so much i say why dont you just shut up im sorry thats twice youve said that please dont say it again okay it means nothing its totally useless shes stung by my harshness but i really dont care my only concern right now is my own skin the four people staring at me along with their higherups and their entire government are all responsible for the breach would you like some coffee diana asks meekly no id like some heroin i say they find this funny but then we could all use a laugh coffee is poured and a platter of cookies makes the rounds we begin the process of waiting as surreal as it is i begin thinking about where to go next raynor says theyll get my car after dark theyre waiting on a black male agent from the orlando office who will be my double for the next day or so under no circumstances will i be allowed to return to my condo to live and we haggle about how to retrieve my sparse belongings the marshals service will take care of the lease and turn off the utilities raynor thinks ill need a different vehicle but i push back initially the fbi agents leave and return with sandwiches the clock seems to stop as the walls close in finally at mr victor westlake walks in the front door and says max im sorry i do not stand nor do i offer a hand to shake the sofa is all mine he has three other dark suits with him and they scramble for kitchen chairs and stools when everyone is introduced and seated westlake begins this is highly unusual max and i dont know what to say as of now we have no idea where the breach occurred and we may never find out just tell me what you do know i say westlake opens a file and pulls out some papers heres the transcript of a phone conversation we caught last night between dee ray rucker and someone named sully both were on cell phones dee ray was in dc sully made the call from somewhere around here i read the transcript while the rest of them hold their breath it takes a few seconds then i place it on the coffee table howd they do it i ask were still working on it one theory is that they used a private company to track you down we monitor a handful of firms that specialize in corporate espionage surveillance missing persons private snooping and the like these are exmilitary types exspies and im ashamed to say a few exfbi agents theyre good and they have the technology for the right fee they could gather a lot of information from where from the inside we dont know yet max if you did know you wouldnt tell me you would never admit it if the breach was caused by someone within the governmentthe fbi the marshals service the us attorneys office the department of justice the bureau of prisons hell knows who else how many people are plugged into this little secret mr westlake several dozen maybe more did the ruckers find me because they picked up my scent or did they follow the fbi because the fbi was following me i assure you there was no internal breach but you just said you dont know your assurances mean nothing at this point the only certainty right now is that everyone involved will cover their ass and point fingers starting right now i dont believe anything you say mr westlake you or anybody else you have to trust us max this situation is urgent perhaps lethal i trusted you until this morning and look where i am now theres no trust zero we have to protect you until the trial max you understand this after the trial we lose interest but until then we have to make sure youre safe thats why we tapped the phones we were monitoring the ruckers and we got lucky were on your side max sure there was a screwup somewhere and well find out what happened but youre sitting here in one piece because we were doing our jobs congratulations i say and go to the bathroom the real fight breaks out when i inform them im leaving witness protection dan raynor rants about how dangerous my life will be if i dont allow them to scoop me up and deposit me a thousand miles away under yet another name too bad ill take my chances hiding on my own westlake begs me to stay with them my testimony will be crucial at trial and without it there may be no conviction i remind him repeatedly that they have a confession and no federal judge is going to suppress it i promise ill show up for the trial i argue that my life will be safer when only i know where im hiding there are simply too many agents involved in protecting me raynor reminds me more than once that the marshals service has never lost an informant within its protection over eight thousand and counting and i repeatedly remind him someone will be the first casualty someone other than me the discussion is often heated but im not backing down and all they can do is argue they have no authority over me my sentence was commuted and im not on parole i agreed to testify and i plan to do so my agreement with the marshals service plainly states that i can leave witness protection anytime i want im leaving i declare and get to my feet will you be so kind as to drive me back to my car no one moves raynor asks what are your plans why would i share my plans with you what about the condo ill leave in a couple of days then its all yours so you are leaving the area diana asks i didnt say that i said im leaving the condo i look at westlake and say and please stop following me theres a good chance someone is watching you as you watch me give me a break here okay thats not true max you dont know whats true just stop following me okay of course he does not say yes his cheeks are red and hes really pissed but then again this is a man who usually gets his way i walk to the door yank it open and say if you wont give me a ride ill just walk take him back westlake says thanks i say over my shoulder and leave the cottage the last thing i hear is raynor calling out youre making a big mistake max i ride in the backseat of the jeep as the same two agents chauffeur me in silence in the parking lot outside the gym i get out and say nothing they drive away but i doubt they go far i get into my little audi put the top down and go for a drive along the beach on highway aa i refuse to look in the rearview mirror victor westlake returned to washington on a government jet when he arrived in his office after dark he was briefed on the news that judge sam stillwater had denied the defense motion to suppress the confession of quinn rucker while no great surprise it was still a relief he called stanley mumphrey in roanoke and congratulated him he did not inform the us attorney that their star witness was about to leave witness protection and disappear into the night chapter i sleep with a gun a beretta millimeter legally purchased by me and duly licensed by the state of florida i havent fired a weapon in twenty years since my days as a marine and i have no desire to start shooting now its resting on the cardboard box that passes as a nightstand beside my bed another box on the floor is filled with the possessions i needmy laptop ipad some books a shaving kit a ziploc bag filled with cash a couple of files with personal records and a prepaid cell phone with unlimited minutes and a miami area code a cheap suitcase one that will fit into the audis rather small trunk is packed with my wardrobe and ready to go most of these itemsthe gun the cell phone the suitcasewere purchased recently just in case a quick exit became necessary well said exit is now at hand before dawn i load the car and wait i sit on my terrace for the last time sipping coffee and watching the ocean fade into pink then orange as the sun peeks over the horizon ive watched this many times and never grow tired of it on a clear morning the perfect sphere rises from the water and says hello good morning what another fine day its going to be im not sure where im headed or where ill end up but i plan to be near a beach so i can begin each day with such quiet perfection at i walk out of the condo leaving behind a refrigerator half filled with food and beverages a motley assortment of dishes and utensils a nice coffeepot some magazines on the sofa and some bread and crackers in the pantry for fortysix days i lived here my first real home after prison and im sad to be leaving it i thought i would stay longer i leave the lights on lock the door behind me and wonder how many more temporary hiding places await me before i am no longer forced to keep running i drive away and am soon lost in the heavy commuter traffic going west into jacksonville i know theyre back there but maybe not for long two hours later i enter the sprawl north of orlando and stop for breakfast at a pancake house i eat slow read newspapers and watch the crowd down the street i check into a cheap motel and pay cash for one night the clerk asks for some id with a photo and i explain that i lost my wallet last night in a bar she doesnt like this but she likes the idea of cash so why bother she gives me a key and i go to my room working the yellow pages and using my prepaid cell phone i eventually find a detail shop that can squeeze me in at three that afternoon for the kid on the other end promises to make my car look like a new one bucks pro shine is on the backside of a large assemblyline car wash thats doing a bustling business my car and i are assigned to a skinny country kid named denny and he takes his job seriously in great detail he lays out his plan for washing and shining and is surprised when i say that ill wait could take two hours he says i have nowhere to go i reply he shrugs and moves the audi onto a wash rack i find a seat on a bench under a canopy and start reading a walter mosley paperback thirty minutes later denny finishes the exterior wash and starts the vacuum he opens both doors and i ease over for a chat i explain im leaving town so the suitcase stays in the backseat and the cardboard box in the trunk is not to be touched he shrugs again whatever less work for him i take a step closer and tell denny that im going through a bad divorce and i have reason to believe my wifes lawyers are watching every move i make i strongly suspect there is a gps tracking device hidden somewhere in or on the car and if denny finds it ill slide him an extra bill at first he is hesitant but i assure him its my car and theres nothing illegal about disarming a tracking device her slimy lawyers are the ones breaking the law finally theres a twinkle in his eye and hes on board i pop the hood and together we start combing the car as we do so i explain there are dozens of different devices all shapes and sizes but most are attached with a strong magnet depending on the model the battery can last for weeks or the device can even be hotwired to the cars electrical system some antennas are external some internal how do you know all this he asks flat on his back his head under the car poking around the chassis because i hid one on my wifes car i reply and he finds it funny why havent you looked for yourself he asks because i was being watched we search for an hour and find nothing i am beginning to think maybe my car was bugfree after all when denny removes a small panel behind the right headlight hes on his back his shoulder squeezed against the right front tire he snaps something loose and hands it to me the waterproof covering is the size of a cell phone and made of hard black plastic i remove it and say bingo ive looked at a hundred of these online and have never seen one like this so i assume its government issued no brand name no markings numbers or letters nice work denny i say and hand him a bill can i finish detailing now he asks sure i drift away leaving him to his labors next to the car wash there is a small shopping center with half a dozen lowend stores i buy a cup of stale decaf and sit in the window of a coffee shop watching the parking lot an elderly couple in a cadillac park get out and shuffle into a chinese buffet as soon as theyre inside i exit the coffee shop and walk through the lot as if im headed to my car behind the cadillac i quickly bend over and slap the tracking device onto the bottom of the fuel tank ontario license platesperfect denny is washing windows sweating profusely lost in his work i tap him on the shoulder startle him and say look denny nice work and all but somethings come up i need to hit the road im peeling off cash and hand him three bills hes confused but i dont care whatever you say man he mumbles staring at the money gotta run he pulls a towel off the top of the car good luck with the divorce man thanks west of orlando i take interstate north through ocala then gainesville then into georgia where i stop in valdosta for the night over the next five days my wanderings take me as far south as new orleans as far west as wichita falls texas and as far north as kansas city i use interstate highways state routes country roads and national parkways all expenses are paid in cash so to my knowledge there is no trail i double back a dozen times and become convinced there is no one behind me my journey ends in lynchburg virginia where i roll in just after midnight and once again pay cash for a motel room so far only one place has refused to do business because i claim to have no id then again im not lodging at marriotts or hiltons im tired of the road and eager to get down to business i sleep late into the next morning then drive an hour to roanoke the last place anyone who knows max baldwin would expect to find him fortified with that knowledge and a new face i am confident i can move around with anonymity in a metro area of people the only troublesome part of my package is the florida license plates on my car and i contemplate renting another one i decide against this because of the paperwork plus the florida angle will pay off later i drive around the city for a while checking out the landscape downtown the old sections and the inevitable sprawl malcolm bannister visited roanoke on several occasions including once as a seventeenyearold high school football player winchester is just three hours north on interstate as a young lawyer there malcolm drove down twice to take depositions the town of salem adjoins roanoke and malcolm spent a weekend there once at a friends wedding that marriage ended in divorce same as malcolms the friend was never heard from again after malcolm went to prison so i sort of know the area the first motel i try belongs to a national chain and has rather strict rules about registration the old lostwallet ruse fails me and i am denied a room when i cannot produce an id no problemthere is an abundance of inexpensive motels in the area i drift to the southern edge of roanoke and find myself in a less than affluent part of salem where i spot a motel that probably offers rooms by the hour cash will be welcomed i opt for the daily rate of and tell the old woman at the front desk i will be around for a few days shes not too friendly and it dawns on me that she might have owned the place back in the good ole days when blacks were turned away its ninety degrees and i ask if the airconditioning is working brandnew units she says proudly i park around back directly in front of my room and far away from the street the bed linens and floors are clean the bathroom is spotless the new window unit hums along nicely and by the time i unload my car the temperature is below seventy i stretch out on the bed and wonder how many illicit hookups have occurred here i think of eva from puerto rico and how nice it would be to hold her again and i think of vanessa young and what it will be like to finally touch her at dark i walk down the street and eat a salad at a fastfood place im down twenty pounds since i left frostburg and im determined to keep losing for now anyway as i leave the restaurant i see stadium lights and decide to take in a game i drive to memorial stadium home of the salem red sox bostons class higha affiliate theyre playing the lynchburg hillcats before a nice crowd for i get a seat in the bleachers i buy a beer from a vendor and soak in the sights and sounds of the game nearby is a young father with his two sons tballers i suspect no more than six years old and wearing red sox jerseys and caps i think of bo and all the hours we spent playing catch in the backyard while dionne sat on the small patio and sipped iced tea it seems like yesterday that we were all together a little family with big dreams and a future bo was so small and cute and his father was his hero i was trying to turn him into a switchhitter at the age of five when the feds entered my life and wrecked things what a waste and other than myself no one really cares anymore i suppose my father and siblings would like to see my life made whole again but its not a priority they have their own lives to worry about once you go to prison the world assumes you deserve it and all pity comes to an end if you polled my former friends and acquaintances in my hometown im sure they would say something like poor malcolm he just crawled in bed with the wrong people cut some corners got a bit greedy how tragic everyone is quick to forget because everyone wants to forget the war on crime needs casualties poor malcolm got himself captured so its just me max reed baldwin free but on the run scheming some way to exact revenge while riding off into the sunset chapter for the sixth day in a row victor westlake sipped his early morning coffee while scanning a brief memo on mr max baldwin the informant had vanished the gps tracker had finally been removed from a cadillac seville owned by an elderly canadian couple as they ate lunch near savannah georgia they would never know they had been cybertracked by the fbi for three hundred miles westlake had punished the three field agents assigned to monitor baldwins car they lost him in orlando and picked up the wrong scent as the cadillac headed north baldwin wasnt using his iphone his credit cards or his initial internet service provider the courtapproved snooping on those fronts would expire in a week and there was almost no chance it would be renewed he was neither a suspect nor a fugitive and the court was reluctant to allow such extensive eavesdropping on a lawabiding citizen his checking account at suncoast had a balance of the reward money had been tracked as it was split and bounced around the state of florida but the fbi eventually lost its trail baldwin had moved the money so fast the fbi lawyers could not keep pace with their requests for search warrants there were at least eight withdrawals totaling in cash there was one record of a wire transfer of to an account in panama and westlake assumed the rest of the money was offshore he had grudgingly come to respect baldwin and his ability to disappear if the fbi couldnt find him maybe he was safe after all if baldwin could avoid credit cards his iphone use of his passport and getting himself arrested he could remain hidden for a long time there had been no more chatter from the rucker clan and westlake was still dumbfounded by the fact that a gang of narcotraffickers in dc had located baldwin near jacksonville the fbi and the marshals service were investigating themselves but so far not a clue westlake placed the memo in a pile of papers and finished his coffee i find the office of beebe security in a professional office building not far from my motel the yellow pages ad boasted twenty years of experience a law enforcement background stateoftheart technology and so on almost all of the ads in the private investigations section used this same language and i cannot remember as i park my car what attracted me to beebe maybe it is the name if i dont like the outfit ill go to the next name on my list if i had seen frank beebe walk down the street i couldve said there goes a private detective fifty years old thickchested with a gut pressuring his shirt buttons polyester pants pointedtoe cowboy boots full head of gray hair the obligatory mustache and the cocky swagger of a man whos armed and unafraid he closes the door to his cramped office and says what can i do for you mr baldwin i need to locate someone what type of case he asks as he lands hard in his oversized executive chair the wall behind him is covered with large photos and seminar certificates its not really a case i just need to find this guy what will you do after you find him talk to him thats all theres no cheating husband or delinquent debtor im not looking for money or revenge or anything bad i just need to meet this guy and find out more about him fair enough frank uncaps his pen and is ready to take notes tell me about him his name is nathan cooley i think he also goes by nat too thirty years old single i think hes from a small town called willow gap ive been through willow gap last i knew his mother still lives there but im not sure where cooley is now a few years back he got busted in a meth sting what a surprise and spent a few years in federal prison his older brother was killed in a shootout with the police frank is scribbling away and how do you know this guy lets just say we go way back fair enough he knows when to ask questions and when to let them pass what am i supposed to do look mr beebe its frank okay frank i doubt there are many black folks in and around willow gap that plus im from miami and i have florida tags on my little foreign car if i show up and start poking around asking questions i probably wont get too far youd probably get shot id like to avoid that so i figure you can do the job without raising suspicion i just need his address and phone number if possible anything else would be gravy have you tried the phone book yes and there are quite a few cooleys around willow gap no nathan i wouldnt get too far making a bunch of cold calls right anything else thats it pretty simple okay i charge a hundred bucks an hour plus expenses ill drive to willow gap this afternoon its about an hour from here way back in the boondocks so ive heard the first draft of my letter reads dear mr cooley my name is reed baldwin and i am a documentary filmmaker in miami along with two partners i own a production company called skelter films we specialize in documentaries dealing with the abuse of power by the federal government my current project deals with a series of coldblooded murders carried out by agents of the drug enforcement administration this topic is very close to me because three years ago my seventeenyearold nephew was gunned down by two agents in trenton new jersey he was unarmed and had no criminal record of course an internal investigation showed no fault on the part of the dea the lawsuit filed by my family was dismissed in researching this film i believe i have uncovered a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of the dea i believe certain agents are encouraged to simply murder drug dealers or suspected drug dealers the purpose is twofold first such murders obviously stop criminal activity second they avoid lengthy trials and such the dea is killing people instead of arresting them to date i have uncovered about a dozen of these suspicious killings i have interviewed several of the families and they all feel strongly that their loved ones were murdered this brings me to you i know the basic facts regarding the death of your brother gene in there were at least three dea agents involved in the shooting and as always they claim they acted in selfdefense i believe you were on the scene at the time of the shooting please allow me the opportunity to meet buy you lunch and discuss this project i am currently in washington dc but i can drop things here and drive to southwest virginia at your convenience my cell phone number is thank you for your time sincerely m reed baldwin the clock slows considerably as the hours pass i go for a long drive south down interstate and check out blacksburg home of virginia tech then christiansburg radford marion and pulaski its mountainous terrain and a pretty drive but im not sightseeing i may need one of these towns in the near future and so i take notes of truck stops motels and fastfood joints near the interstate the truck traffic is heavy and there are automobiles from dozens of states so no one notices me occasionally i leave the fourlane and venture deep into the hills driving through small towns without stopping i find ripplemead population the nearest hamlet to the lakeside cabin where judge fawcett and naomi clary were murdered i eventually wander back to roanoke the lights are on the red sox are playing again i buy a ticket and have a hot dog and a beer for dinner frank beebe calls me at eight the next morning and an hour later im in his office as he pours coffee he says matteroffactly found him in the town of radford a college town of about he got out of prison a few months ago lived with his mother for a while then moved away i talked to his mother a tough old gal and she said he bought a bar in radford im curious so i ask how did you get her to talk frank laughs and lights another cigarette thats the easy part reed when youve been in this business as long as i have you can always spew some bullshit and get people talking i figured his mother still has a healthy fear of anyone connected to the prison system so i told her i was a federal prison agent and needed to chat with her boy isnt that impersonating an officer nope no such thing as a federal prison agent she didnt ask for a card and if she had then i wouldve given her one i keep a bunch of cards on any given day i can be one of many different federal agents youd be amazed how easy it is to fool people did you go to the bar i did but i didnt go in i wouldnt fit its just off the campus of radford university so the crowd is a lot younger than me its called bombays and its been around for some time according to city records it changed hands on may of this year the seller was one arthur stone and your boy nathan cooley was the buyer where does he live dont know nothing in the land records i suspect hes renting so there would be no record of that hell he could be sleeping above the bar its an old twostory building youre not going there are you no good youre too old and youre too black its an allwhite crowd thanks ill meet him somewhere else i pay frank beebe in cash and on the way out i ask say frank if i needed a fake passport you got any ideas sure theres a guy in baltimore ive used before does most anything but passports are tricky these days homeland security and all that crap if they catch you they really get excited i smile and say its not for me he laughs and says gee ive never heard that before my car is packed and i leave town four hours later im in mclean virginia looking for a copy center that offers executive services i find one in an upscale shopping center pay a hookup fee and plug in my laptop to a printer after ten minutes of fiddling and haggling i get the damned thing to work and print the letter to nathan cooley its on skelter films stationery complete with an address on th avenue in miami and a full selection of phone and fax numbers on the envelope i write mr nathan cooley co bombays bar amp grill east main street radford virginia to the left of the address i write in bold letters personal and confidential when its perfect i cross the potomac and drive through central dc looking for a post office drop box chapter quinn rucker turned his back to the bars stuck his hands through and touched his wrists behind him the deputy slapped on the handcuffs as another one opened the cell door they escorted quinn to a cramped holding area where three fbi agents were waiting from there they walked him through a side door and into a black suv with dark windows and more armed guards ten minutes later he arrived with full escort at the rear door of the federal building where he was whisked inside and up two flights of stairs neither victor westlake nor stanley mumphrey nor any other lawyer in the room had ever taken part in such a meeting the defendant was never brought in for a chat if the police needed to talk to the accused they did so at the jail if his appearance was needed in court the judge or magistrate called a hearing quinn was led into the small conference room and the handcuffs were removed he shook hands with his lawyer dusty shiver who of course had to be present but was uncertain about the meeting he had cautioned the feds that his client would say nothing until he dusty allowed him to speak quinn had been in jail for four months and was not doing well for reasons known only to his keepers he was locked down in solitary confinement contact with his guards was minimal the food was dreadful and he was losing weight he was also taking antidepressants and sleeping fifteen hours a day often he refused to meet with anyone from his family or with dusty one week he demanded the right to plead guilty in exchange for life in prison the next week he wanted a trial he had fired dusty twice only to rehire him days later he occasionally admitted killing judge fawcett and his girlfriend but always recanted and accused the government of doping his food he had threatened the guards with promises of death and the deaths of their children only to offer tearful apologies when his mood changed victor westlake was in charge of the meeting and began by saying lets get to the point mr rucker we have it on good intelligence that you and some of your fellow conspirators desire to knock off one of our witnesses dusty touched quinns arm and said not a word do not speak until i say so quinn smiled at westlake as if killing a government witness would be a delight westlake kept going the purpose of this little gettogether is to warn you mr rucker that if any of our witnesses are harmed then you will face additional charges and not just you well go after every member of your family quinn was grinning and he blurted so bannister is on the run huh shut up quinn dusty said i dont have to shut up quinn said i hear bannister has left the warm sun of florida shut up quinn dusty snarled again got him a new face probably a new name the works quinn continued stanley mumphrey said well indict dee ray tall man several of your cousins anybody and everybody we can throw the book at quinn if you harm any of our witnesses you dont have any witnesses quinn shot across the table only bannister dusty threw his hands up and slumped in his chair i advise you to shut up quinn i hear you quinn said i hear you westlake managed to maintain a scowl as he stared at the defendant but he was stunned the meeting was supposed to intimidate quinn not frighten the government how on earth were they able to find bannister in florida and now know he had fled it was a chilling moment for westlake and his assistants if they could find their informant they would certainly bring him in your entire family could face capital murder charges stanley plowed on in a feeble attempt to sound tough quinn just smiled he stopped talking and folded his arms across his chest i have to see vanessa young a meeting has an element of risk to be seen together by the wrong people would create questions im not ready to answer but a meeting is inevitable and has been for several years i saw her at frostburg on a snowy day when many visitors didnt make the drive while i was talking to my father henry she walked in and sat at the next table she was there to visit her brother she was gorgeous early forties soft brown skin beautiful sad eyes long legs and tight jeans the whole package i could not keep my eyes off her and henry finally said you want me to leave of course not because if he left then my visiting time was over the longer he stayed the longer i could look at vanessa before long she was looking back and we were soon making serious eye contact the attraction was mutual at first but there were a couple of sticking points first my incarceration and second her marriage which as it turned out was a mess i leaned on her brother for information but he wanted to stay out of it we swapped a few letters but she was afraid of getting caught by her husband she tried to visit more often to see both her brother and me but she had two teenagers who were complicating her life after her divorce was final she dated other men but nothing worked i begged vanessa to wait for me but seven years is a long time when youre fortyone when her kids left home she moved to richmond virginia and our longdistance romance cooled off vanessas background is such that she is extremely cautious and keeps one eye on the rearview mirror i guess we have that much in common using encrypted emails we manage to arrange a time and place i warn her that i look nothing like the malcolm bannister she met in prison she says shell take that chance she cant wait to see the newandimproved version as i park outside the restaurant in a suburb of richmond i have a bad case of the butterflies im a wreck because i am about to finally touch the woman i have dreamed about for almost three years i know she wants to touch me too but the guy she was so physically attracted to back then looks entirely different now what if she doesnt approve what if she prefers malcolm to max its also unnerving to realize im about to spend time with the only person outside the feds who knows both men i wipe perspiration from my forehead and consider leaving then i get out and slam the door shes at the table and as i almost stutterstep over she smiles she approves i kiss her gently on the cheek and sit down and for a long time we just look at each other finally i say well what do you think vanessa shakes her head and says pretty astonishing i would have never known got any id we both laugh and i say sure but its all bogus it says im max now not malcolm you look thin max thanks and you too i caught a glimpse of her legs under the table short skirt funky high heels shes dressed for action which do you prefer i ask well i suppose i dont have a choice now do i i think youre cute max i like the new you the whole ensemble whose idea was the designer eyeglasses my consultant same guy who suggested the slick head and four days of stubble the more i see the more i like thank god im a nervous wreck relax baby were in for a long night the waiter takes our drink ordersa martini for me diet soda for her there are a lot of things i dont want to discuss namely my sudden exit from prison and witness protection the brother she visited in prison got out but is already back behind bars so we leave him out of the conversation i ask about her kids a daughter whos twenty and in college and a son whos eighteen and drifting at one point as im talking she stops me and says you even sound different good its a new speech pattern ive been practicing for months now a much slower delivery and a deeper voice does it seem genuine i think so yes its working she asks where im living and i explain ive yet to find a home im moving around trying to avoid getting trailed by the fbi and others lots of cheap motels im not a fugitive but im not exactly in the clear our dinner arrives but we hardly notice she says you look a lot younger maybe i should see your plastic surgeon please dont change a thing i talk about the changesprimarily the eyes nose and chin i amuse her by describing the meetings with my surgical team and our efforts to design a new face im also twenty pounds lighter and she thinks i need to put on a few pounds as our nerves settle we relax and talk like a couple of old friends the waiter asks if our food is okay since weve hardly touched it we hit a number of topics but in the back of our minds were both thinking the same thing i finally say lets get outta here the words are barely spoken and shes reaching for her purse i pay cash for the meal and were in the parking lot i dont like the idea of her apartment and she agrees its rather small and bare she explains we check into a hotel i spotted down the street and order a bottle of champagne two kids on their wedding night could not possibly exert more energy than vanessa and i there was so much ground to cover so much catching up to do chapter while vanessa is at work i run a few errands around richmond at one store i spend on a cheap prepaid cell phone with one hundred minutes of call time and at another i buy the identical phone and plan for ill give one phone to vanessa and keep the other at a pharmacy i load up on prepaid credit cards i have an appointment with a man who owns a camera shop and calls himself a videographer but his fee is too high if im lucky and get an interview ill need two peoplea cameraman and a gofer this guy says he works with a full crew or doesnt work at all vanessa and i have a sandwich for lunch in a deli not far from her office for dinner we go to a bistro in the carytown section of richmond our afterdinner routine is remarkably and wonderfully similar to the night before and in the same hotel room this could be habit forming our plans for the third night though are derailed when her son calls hes passing through town and needs a place to stay she figures hell need some money too were finishing dinner when the cell phone in my pocket vibrates the caller id says unknown but then all calls to this phone are unknown expecting big news i say to vanessa excuse me and step away from the table in the foyer of the restaurant i answer the phone a vaguely familiar voice says mr reed baldwin this is nathan cooley i got your letter i tell myself to speak slowly and deeply yes mr cooley thanks for the call of course he got my letterhow else would he have my phone number when do you want to talk he asks anytime im in washington right now and we finished filming today i have some downtime so right now is perfect what about you im not going anywhere how did you find me the internet its hard to hide these days i guess so i usually sleep late then work at the bar from about two until midnight how about lunch tomorrow i say a bit too eagerly just the two of us no cameras or recorders or stuff like that im buying a pause and i hold my breath okay i guess where its your neck of the woods mr cooley you pick the time and place ill be there okay at the radford exit off interstate there is a place called spankys ill meet you there at noon tomorrow ill be there how will i recognize you he asks and i almost drop my phone recognition is a far greater issue than hell ever realize i have subjected myself to surgery that radically altered my face i shave my head every other day and my beard once a week i have starved off twenty pounds i wear fake tortoiseshell glasses with round red frames along with black tshirts fake armani sport coats and canvas sandals one would find only in miami or la i have a different name i have a different voice and delivery and this entire charade has been carefully put together not to mislead the people who want to follow me or kill me but to conceal my real identity from you mr nathan cooley i say im six feet tall black thin a slick head and ill be wearing a white straw hat panama style youre black he blurts yep is that a problem no see you tomorrow i return to the table where vanessa is waiting anxiously i say softly its cooley were meeting tomorrow she smiles and says go for it we finish dinner and reluctantly say goodbye we kiss outside the restaurant and act like a couple of teenagers i think about her all the way to roanoke i arrive fifteen minutes early and park so that i can watch the vehicles as they turn in to the spankys lot the first thing ill see is his car or truck and this will reveal a lot six months ago he was in prison where he had served a little over five years he has no father an alcoholic mother and no education past the tenth grade so his choice of vehicle will be interesting as we talk my plans are to make a mental note of everything i can possibly seeclothing jewelry watch cell phone the traffic picks up as the lunch crowd rolls in at a sparklingnew silver chevrolet silverado halfton pickup arrives and i suspect its nathan cooley it is and he parks on the other side of the lot he glances around nervously as he walks to the front entrance its been four years since ive seen him and he appears to have changed little same weight same blond shaggy hair though he once shaved his head in prison he looks twice at the florida tags on my car then goes inside i take a deep breath put the panama hat on my head and walk to the door be cool you idiot i mumble to myself as my bowels flip this will take a steady hand and nerves of steel we meet inside the front foyer and exchange pleasantries i remove the hat as we follow the hostess to a booth in the rear across the table we face each other and talk about the weather for a moment im almost overwhelmed by my ruse nathan is talking to a stranger while im talking to a kid i once knew quite well he doesnt seem at all suspicious no staring at my eyes or nose no squinting or raised eyebrows or distant glances as he listens to my voice and thankfully no you kinda remind me of a guy i once knew nothing so far i tell the waitress i really want a beer a tall draft and nathan hesitates before saying the same the success of this longshot mission could well depend on alcohol nathan was raised in a culture of hard drinking and meth addiction then he spent five years in prison clean and sober im assuming hes back to his old habits now that hes out the fact that he owns his own bar is a good indication for a hillbilly who was never taught how to dress he looks okay washed jeans a coors light golf shirt some salesman left at the bar and combat boots there is no jewelry and no watch but he does have an incredibly ugly prison tattoo inside his left forearm in short nathan is not flashing around money with his appearance the beer arrives and we tap glasses tell me about this film he says out of habit i nod pause tell myself to speak slowly clearly and as deeply as possible ive been making documentaries for ten years now and this is the most exciting project ive seen look mr baldwin what is a documentary film exactly i watch some movies and all but i dont think ive seen too many documentaries sure theyre typically small independently produced films that you dont see in the big movie houses theyre not commercial theyre about real people real problems real issues no big movie stars and all that really good stuff the best win awards at film festivals and get some attention but theyre never going to make a lot of money my company specializes in films that deal with the abuse of power primarily by the federal government but also by big corporations i take a sip tell myself to go slow most are about an hour long this one might run for ninety minutes but well decide that later the waitress is back i order a chicken sandwich and nathan wants a basket of wings howd you get into the bar business i ask he takes a gulp smiles says a friend the guy who owned the bar was going under not from the bar but from other properties recession got him i think so he was trying to unload bombays he was looking for some fool to take the deed and assume the debts and i said what the hell im only thirty no job no prospects why not take a chance so far though im making money its kinda fun lots of college girls hanging around youre not married no dont know how much you know about me mr baldwin but i just finished a fiveyear prison sentence thanks to the federal government i aint had too many dates recently just now getting back in the game know what i mean sure the prison time arose out of the same incident in which your brother was killed right you got it i pled guilty and went away for five my cousin is still in prison big sandy over in kentucky a bad place most of my cousins are either locked up or dead thats one reason i moved to radford mr baldwin to get away from the drug business i see please call me reed my father is mr baldwin okay and im nathan or nate we tap glasses again as if were suddenly much closer in prison we called him nattie tell me about your film company he says i anticipated this but it is still shaky ground i take a gulp and swallow slowly skelter is a new company based in miami just me and two partners plus a staff for years i worked for a bigger production company in la an outfit called cove creek films you may have heard of it he has not he just glanced at the rear end of a shapely young waitress anyway cove creek has won a ton of awards and made decent money in this business but last year it blew up big fight over creative control and which projects to do next were still in the middle of some nasty litigation that looks like it will drag on for years theres an injunction in federal court in la that prohibits me from even talking about cove creek or the lawsuit pretty crazy huh to my relief nathan is rapidly losing interest in my film company and its problems why are you based in miami i went there a few years ago working on a film about bogus government defense contractors and fell in love with the place i live on south beach ever been there no except for the trips arranged by the us marshals service nathan has never ventured more than two hundred miles from willow gap its a happening place beautiful beaches gorgeous girls wild nightlife i got a divorce four years ago and im enjoying the single life again i spend about half the year there the other half im on the road filming how do you film a documentary he asks then knocks back some beer its far different from a feature film its usually just me and a cameraman maybe a technician or two the story is the important part not the scenery or the actors face and you want to film me absolutely you maybe your mother maybe other members of the family i want to go to the place where your brother was killed what im after here nathan is the truth im onto something something that could really be big if i can prove the dea systematically knocks off drug dealers that they murder them in cold blood then we might be able to bust these sumbitches my nephew was breaking bad getting deeper into the crack trade but he was not a hardcore dealer stupid yes but not dangerous he was seventeen and unarmed and he was shot three times from pointblank range a stolen pistol was left at the scene and the dea claims it belonged to him theyre a bunch of liars nathans face slowly contorts into anger and he looks as if he wants to spit i press on the film will be the story of three maybe four of these murders im not sure if my nephews will be included because im the filmmaker maybe im too close to his death ive already filmed the story of jose alvarez in amarillo texas a nineteenyearold undocumented worker who was shot fourteen times by dea agents problem is no one in his family speaks english and theres not much sympathy for illegal immigrants ive filmed the story of tyler marshak a college boy in california who was peddling marijuana the dea broke into his dorm room like a bunch of gestapo goons and shot him dead in his bed you may have read about it he has not the nathan cooley i knew played video games hours a day and never looked at a newspaper or magazine nor does he have the innate curiosity to check out either skelter films or cove creek anyway i have some great footage of the dorm room the autopsy and statements from his family but theyre currently tied up in a lawsuit against the dea i may not be able to use this lunch arrives and we order more beer nathan rips chicken off the bone and wipes his mouth with a napkin why are you so interested in my brothers case lets say im curious i dont know all the facts yet i would like to hear your version of what happened and walk through the drug bust at the scene my lawyers have filed freedom of information applications to get the dea records and also the court file well plow through the paperwork but theres a good chance the dea has covered up everything thats what they typically do we will slowly piece things together and at the same time well see how you and your family look on camera the camera doesnt like everyone nathan he says i doubt if the camera likes my mother well see not so sure about that she probably wont do it you mention anything about genes death and she falls all to pieces he licks his fingers and selects another wing perfect thats what i want to capture on film whats the time frame here what are we looking at i take a bite of my sandwich and chew for a while as i ponder maybe a year id like to finish all the filming within the next six months then have that much time to cut splice edit maybe reshoot some stuff you can tinker with these things forever and its hard to let go as far as youre concerned i would like to shoot some initial footage maybe three or four hours and send that to my producers and editors in miami let them see you hear you get a feel for the story and your ability to tell it if we all agree then well keep shooting whats in it for me nothing other than the truth and exposing the men who killed your brother think about it nathan wouldnt you love to see these bastards charged with murder and put on trial damned right i would i lean in fiercely my eyes on fire then do it nathan tell me his story you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain tell me about the drug trade how it wrecked your family how gene got caught up in it how it was simply a way of life in these parts there were no other jobs you dont have to name namesi dont want to get anyone in trouble i take a sip and finish off my second beer where was gene the last time you saw him lying on the ground hands behind his back getting handcuffed not a single shot had been fired by anyone the deal was gone the bust was over i was handcuffed and led away then i heard gunshots they said gene tripped an agent and sprinted into the woods bullshit they killed him in cold blood you gotta tell me this story nathan you gotta take me back to the scene and reenact it the world needs to know what the federal government is doing in its war on drugs its taking no prisoners he takes a deep breath to let the moment pass im talking too much and too fast so i spend a few minutes with my sandwich the waitress asks if we want another round yes please for me i say and nathan quickly follows he finishes off a wing licks his fingers and says my family is causing problems right now thats why i moved away and came to radford i shrug as if this is his problem not mine but im not surprised i ask if you cooperate and the rest of your family does not will that cause more trouble he laughs and says trouble is the norm with the cooleys we are notorious for feuding lets do this lets sign a onepage agreement already prepared by my lawyers and in english so plain you dont need to hire your own lawyers unless you enjoy pissing away money and the agreement will state that you nathan cooley will cooperate fully in the making of this documentary film in return youll be paid a fee of which is the minimum required of actors in these projects from time to time or whenever you want you can review the film in progress andand this is crucialif you dont like what you see you can walk and i cannot use any of your footage thats a pretty fair deal nathan he nods as he searches for loopholes but nathan is not the type to analyze things quickly plus the alcohol is urging him on i suspect hes drooling over the word actor eight thousand dollars he repeats yes as i said these are lowbudget films nobody will make a lot of money the interesting point here is that i mentioned money before he did i sweeten the deal by adding plus youll get a small piece of the back end a piece of the back end nathan is probably thinking of something else that means that youll get a few bucks if the movie sells some tickets but dont expect it i say youre not doing this for the money nathan youre doing it for your brother the plate in front of him is littered with bones the waitress brings our third round and removes the scraps its important to keep him talking because i dont want him thinking what kind of guy was gene i ask he shakes his head and looks as if he might cry my big brother you know our dad disappeared when we were small just me and gene he narrates a few stories about their childhood funny stories about two kids trying to survive we finish our third beers order another round but vow to stop after that at ten the following morning nathan and i meet at a coffee shop in radford he looks over the contract asks a few questions and signs it i sign as the vice president of skelter films and hand over a check for drawn on a company bank account in miami when do we start he asks well nathan im here and im not leaving the sooner the better what about tomorrow morning sure where ive been thinking about that were in southwest virginia where mountains are important in fact the land here has a lot to do with the story the remoteness of the mountains and so on i think id like to be outdoors at first anyway we can always move around do you live in town or in the country im renting a place just outside town from the backyard theres a nice view of some hills lets take a look ill be there at ten in the morning with a small crew and well check out the lighting okay i talked to my mother and she says no way can i talk to her you can try but shes pretty tough she doesnt like the idea of you or anybody else making a movie about gene and our family she thinks youll make us look like a bunch of ignorant mountain folk did you explain that you have the right to monitor the film as it progresses i tried to she was drinking sorry ill see you in the morning chapter nathan is living in a small redbrick house on a narrow road a few miles west of the radford city limits his nearest neighbor lives in a doublewide trailer half a mile closer to the state highway his front lawn is neatly mowed and there are a few shrubs lining the narrow front porch hes outside playing with his yellow lab as we arrive and park in the drive behind his shiny new truck my ace crew consists of my new assistant vanessa who will be called gwen on this project and two freelancers from roanokeslade the videographer and his assistant cody slade bills himself as a filmmaker and works out of his garage he owns the cameras and equipment and he looks the partlong hair in a ponytail jeans with holes in the knees a couple of gold chains around his neck cody is younger and sufficiently grungy their fee is a day plus expenses and part of the deal is that they do what theyre supposed to do and stay as quiet as possible i have promised to pay them in cash and ive made no reference to skelter films or anything else it might be a documentary film or it might be something else just do as i say and offer no details to nathan cooley vanessa arrived in radford last night and we bunked together in a nice hotel where we registered in her name and used a prepaid credit card she told her boss she had the flu and under doctors orders cant leave the house for several days she knows nothing about filmmaking but then neither do i after a round of awkward introductions in the driveway we check out the surroundings nathans backyard is a large open area that slopes up the side of a hill a herd of whitetail deer scamper over a fence when they see us i ask nathan how long it takes to cut his grass and he says three hours he points to a tractor shed where a fancy john deere riding mower is parked it looks new he says hes a country boy who prefers the outdoors likes to hunt and fish and pee off the back porch plus he still thinks of prison and life there with a thousand men surviving in close quarters no sir he loves the open spaces while we walk and talk slade and cody wander aimlessly about mumbling to each other as they look at the sun and rub their chins i like it here i say pointing taking charge i want those hills in the frame slade seems to disagree but he and cody nonetheless start hauling gear from their van the setup takes forever and to show my artistic temperament i start barking about the time gwen has brought along a small makeup kit and nathan reluctantly agrees to a touchup with powder and a bit of blush im sure its his first but he needs to feel like an actor gwen is wearing a short skirt and a blouse thats hardly buttoned and part of her act is to see how easily the boy can be teased i pretend to look over my notes but i watch nathan as he watches gwen he loves the attention and teasing when the camera lights monitor and sound are almost ready i take nathan aside just the two of us director and star to contemplate my vision okay nathan i want you to be very serious think about gene his murder at the hands of the federal government i want you to be somber no smiles no fun here okay got it speak slowly almost painfully ill ask the questions you look at the camera and just talk act naturally youre a nicelooking guy and i think the camera will like you but its important to just be yourself ill try he says and its obvious nathan is really looking forward to this one last thing and i should have mentioned it yesterday if this film does what we hope and blows the cover off the dea then there could be some retribution some payback i dont trust the dea for one seconda bunch of rogue thugsand they might do anything thats why its important for you to be shall we say out of the business im clean man he says youre not dealing in any way hell no im not going back to prison reed thats one reason i moved over here away from my family theyre still cooking meth and selling it not me okay just think of gene cody puts the mike on him and we get situated were on a set in folding chairs with lights and wiring all around us the camera is over my shoulder and for a moment i feel like a real kickass investigative journalist i look at gwen and say did you forget the still shots come on gwen she jumps as i bark and grabs a camera i say just a couple of stills nathan so well have a clear record of the lighting he frowns at first then smiles at gwen as she snaps away finally after weve been here for an hour we start filming i hold a pen with my left hand and scribble on a legal pad malcolm bannister was righthanded just in case nathan might be suspicious which he does not seem to be to loosen him up i start with all the basics name age employment education prison criminal record children no marriages and so on a couple of times i tell him to relax repeat something were just having a conversation his childhooddifferent homes schools life with his big brother gene no father a rocky relationship with his mother at this point he says look reed im not going to say bad things about my mother okay of course not nathan thats not at all what i intended and i quickly change the subject we get around to the meth culture of his youth with some hesitation he finally opens up and paints a depressing picture of a rough adolescence filled with drugs booze sex and violence by the time he was fifteen he knew how to cook meth two of his cousins were burned alive when a lab blew up in a mobile home he was sixteen when he first saw the inside of a jail cell he dropped out of school and life got crazier at least four of his cousins have served time for drug distribution two are still locked away as bad as prison was it did get him away from the drugs and alcohol he was sober for the five years he was incarcerated and is now determined to stay away from the meth beer is another matter we break at noon the sun is overhead and slade is concerned about the brightness of the conditions he and cody stroll around looking for another spot how long can you go today nathan i ask im the boss he says smugly i can go in whenever i want great so a couple more hours why not how am i doing terrific it took you a few minutes to settle down but now youre very smooth very sincere gwen adds youre a natural storyteller nathan he likes this shes back with the makeup routine wiping perspiration from his forehead brushing touching flirting revealing he craves the attention we brought sandwiches and soft drinks and eat under the shade of an oak tree next to the toolshed slade likes this spot and we decide to move the set gwen whispers to nathan about using the restroom this makes him uncomfortable but by now he can hardly keep his eyes off her legs i walk away and pretend to be on the cell phone talking to important people in los angeles gwen disappears into the back door of the house she will later report that the house has two bedrooms but only one with furniture nothing in the den but a sofa a chair and a huge hd television one bathroom in need of a good scrubbing a kitchen with a sink full of dirty dishes and a refrigerator filled with beer and cold cuts there is an attic with a folddown staircase the floors are covered with cheap carpeting there are three doorsfront back and garageand all three are secured with thick dead bolts that have obviously been added recently there appears to be no alarm systemno keypads or sensors over the windows and doors in his bedroom closet there are two rifles and two shotguns in the closet in the spare bedroom there is nothing but a pair of muddy hunting boots while she is inside i continue my fake phone chat while i watch nathan from behind large sunglasses he keeps his eyes on the back of his house nervous that she is inside alone slade and cody are getting the set rewired when she returns nathan relaxes and apologizes for his sloppy housekeeping she coos and works on his hair when everything is in place we plunge into the afternoon session he mentions a motorcycle accident when he was fourteen and i dissect this for half an hour we delve into his sketchy employment historybosses coworkers duties wages dismissals back to the drug trade with details about how to cook meth who taught him key ingredients and so on romances girlfriends he claims to have impregnated a young cousin when he was twenty but has no idea what happened to the mother or child he had a serious girl before he went to prison but she forgot about him judging by the way he looks at gwen its obvious this boy is wired hes thirty years old and other than the death of his brother and a prison sentence his life has been unremarkable after three hours of prodding and poking i extract anything and everything of interest he says he needs to get to work we have to visit the place where gene was killed i say as slade turns off the camera and everybody relaxes its outside of bluefield about an hour from here he says bluefield west virginia thats right and why were you there we were making a delivery but the buyer was an informant i have to see this nathan to walk through it all to recapture the scene the violence the moment the place where gene was shot and killed it was at night right yeah long after midnight gwen is tapping his face with a cloth removing the makeup youre really good on camera she says softly and he smiles when can we go there i ask he shrugs and says whenever tomorrow if you want perfect we agree to meet at his house at am and caravan through the mountains into west virginia to the remote abandoned mine site where the cooley brothers walked into a trap weve had a good day with nathan he and i got on well as filmmaker and actor and at times he and gwen seemed ready to strip and have a go late in the afternoon she and i find our way to bombays on main street in radford next to the college campus and take a table by the dartboard its far too early for the college crowd though a few rowdies are at the bar enjoying happyhour discounts i ask the waitress to inform nathan cooley that we are having a drink and within seconds he appears with a big smile we invite him to have a seat which he does and we start downing beers gwen drinks little and manages to sip on a glass of wine while nathan and i knock back a few pints coeds straggle in and the place gets louder i ask about specials and theres an oyster poboy on the chalkboard we order two and nathan disappears to yell at the cook we have dinner and stay until after dark not only are we the only blacks in the bar but we are also the only patrons over the age of twentytwo nathan stops by occasionally to check on us but hes a busy man chapter at nine the following morning we return to nathans house and once again hes in the front yard playing with his dog waiting i am assuming he meets us outside because he doesnt want us inside i explain that my little audi is in bad need of service and it might be best if we could ride over in his pickup an hour each way will give us two hours alone with nathan and no distractions he shrugs and says okay whatever and away we go with slade and cody following in their van im in the front seat gwen is folded into the backseat of the club cab shes wearing jeans today because nathan couldnt keep his eyes off her legs yesterday she will be a bit more aloof just to keep him guessing as we head west toward the mountains i admire the interior of the truck and explain that ive never spent much time in such vehicles the seats are leather there is an advanced gps system and so on nathan is really proud of the truck and chatters on about it to change the subject i bring up his mother and claim to really want to meet her nathan says look reed youre welcome to try but she doesnt like what were doing i talked to her last night again and i explained the whole project and how important it is and how much you need her but i got nowhere cant we at least talk say hello you know i almost turn and smile at gwen now that we know nathan deems the project important i doubt it shes a tough woman reed drinks a lot nasty temper were not on good terms right now being the pushy investigative journalist i decide to plow into sensitive matters is it because youve gotten away from the family business that youre making money with your bar thats kind of personal isnt it gwen scolds from the rear nathan takes a deep breath and glances out the side window he grips the wheel with both hands and says its a long story but mom has always blamed me for genes death which is crazy he was the big brother the leader of the gang the head chef in the meth lab plus he was an addict i was not i used the stuff occasionally but i never got hooked gene he was out of control this place were going to was a run gene made once a week occasionally i tagged along i shouldnt have been there the night we got busted we had a guy i wont use any names but he was running meth for us on the west side of bluefield we didnt know it but he got busted flipped told the dea when and where we walked into a trap and i swear i could do nothing to help gene as ive told you we surrendered and they were taking us in i heard gunshots and gene was dead ive explained this to my mother a hundred times but she wont hear it gene was her favorite and his death is all my fault terrible i mumble did she visit you in prison gwen asks sweetly from behind another long pause twice nothing is said for at least three miles were on the interstate now headed southwest listening to kenny chesney nathan clears his throat and says to tell you the truth im trying to get away from my family my mom my cousins a bunch of deadbeat nephews words out that i own a nice bar and im doing okay so it wont be long before these clowns start begging for money i need to get farther away where would you go i ask with great sympathy not far i love the mountains the hiking and fishing im a hillbilly reed and thatll never change boone north carolina is a nice place somewhere like that someplace where there are no cooleys in the phone book he laughs at this a sad little chuckle a few minutes later he rocks us with you know i had a buddy in prison kinda reminds me of you malcolm bannister was his name great guy black dude from winchester virginia a lawyer who always said the feds got him for no reason i listen and nod along as if this is of no consequence whatsoever i can almost feel gwen seize up in the rear seat what happened to him i manage to ask my mouth has never been drier i think mals still in prison couple more years maybe ive lost track its something something in the voice maybe the mannerisms something cant quite put my finger on it but you remind me of mal its a big world nathan i say in a deeper voice thoroughly unconcerned and remember to white folks we all look the same he laughs and gwen manages an awkward laugh too while i was mending at fort carson i worked with an expert who videoed me for hours and made a list of habits and mannerisms i had to change i practiced for hours but once i landed in florida i stopped practicing natural moves and habits are hard to break my mind is frozen and i cant think of anything to say gwen comes through with nathan you mentioned some nephews a few minutes ago how long will this go on do you think i mean it looks like the meth business is becoming generational for a lot of families nathan frowns and considers this id say its pretty hopeless there are no jobs except for coal and so many young men just dont want to work in the mines anymore plus they start getting high when theyre fifteen hooked at sixteen the girls are pregnant at sixteen kids having kids babies nobody wants once you start screwing you dont stop i dont see much future around here not for people like me im listening but not hearing my head is spinning as i wonder how much nathan knows how suspicious is he what have i done to tip him off im still undercoverim sure of itbut whats he thinking bluefield west virginia is a town of eleven thousand located on the extreme southern tip of the state not far from the virginia line we skirt around it on highway and are soon on winding roads that fall and rise dramatically nathan knows the area well though its been years since he was here we turn onto a county road and fall deeper into a valley the asphalt ends and we zigzag along gravel and dirt roads until we stop at the edge of a creek old willow oaks hang overhead and block the sun the weeds are kneehigh here we are he says as he turns off the ignition we get out and i tell slade and cody to get their gear we will not be using lighting and i want the smaller handheld camera they scramble around grabbing equipment nathan walks to the edge of the creek and smiles at the bubbling water how often did you come here i ask not much we had several drop points around bluefield but this was the main one gene had been making runs here for ten years but not me the truth was i didnt work in the business as much as he wanted me to i could see trouble i tried to find other jobs you know i wanted out gene wanted me to get more involved where were you parked he turns and points and i decide to move his truck and slades van to keep them out of the frame relying on my vast directorial skills i want to shoot an action piece with nathan approaching the scene on foot and the camera right behind him we practice this for a few minutes then begin rolling nathan is doing the narrative louder nathan you gotta be louder i bark from the side nathan is walking toward the scene and talking it was about two in the morning when we arrived here me and gene we were in his truck i was driving as we pulled up right about here we could see the other vehicle over there backed into those trees where it should have been he keeps walking and pointing everything appeared normal we parked near the other vehicle and our man lets call him joe so joe gets out and says hello we say hello and walk to the back of genes truck in a locked toolbox there are about ten pounds of meth good stuff most of it cooked by gene himself and under a sheet of plywood there is a small cooler also with about ten pounds total drop was roughly twenty pounds with a wholesale value close to we got the stuff out of the truck and moved it into the trunk of joes car and as soon as he slammed the trunk all hell broke loose there mustve been a dozen dea agents all over us i dont know where they all came from but they were quick joe disappeared never to be seen again they dragged gene over by his truck he was cussing joe and making all sorts of threats me i was just so damned scared i could hardly breathe they had us dead guilty and i knew i was headed to prison they handcuffed me went through my wallet my pockets and then led me down the trail over there as i was walking away i looked over my shoulder and i could barely see gene on the ground with both hands behind his back he was angry and still cussing a few seconds later i heard gunshots and then i heard gene scream when he got hit loudly i say cut and walk around in circles for a moment lets do it again i say and we go back to the starting point after the third take im satisfied and seize upon the next idea i ask nathan to stand on the spot where gene was lying the last time he saw him we place a folding chair there and nathan sits down when the camera is rolling i ask now nathan what was your initial reaction when you heard gunfire i couldnt believe it they threw gene down on the ground and there were at least four dea agents standing above him his hands were already behind his back not yet handcuffed he had no weapon there was a shotgun and two millimeters in the truck but we had not removed them i dont care what the dea said later gene was unarmed but when you heard the gunshots i stopped in my tracks and yelled something like what is that whats happening i yelled for gene but the agents shoved me forward down the trail i couldnt look backi was too far away at one point i said i wanna see my brother but they just laughed and kept pushing me into the darkness we finally got to a van and they shoved me inside they drove me to the jail in bluefield and the whole time im asking about my brother what happened to my brother where is gene what have you done with gene lets cut for a minute i say to slade i look at nathan its okay to show some emotion here nathan think of the people watching this film what do you want them to feel as they listen to this awful story anger bitterness sadness its up to you to convey these feelings so lets try it again but this time with some emotion can you do it ill try roll it slade now nathan how did you first learn that your brother was dead the next morning at the jail a deputy came in with some paperwork i asked him about gene and he said your brothers dead tried to run from the dea and they shot him down just like that no sympathy no concern nothing nathan pauses and swallows hard his lips begin to quiver and his eyes are moist behind the camera i give him a thumbsup he continues i didnt know what to say i was in shock gene didnt try to run gene was murdered he wipes a tear with the back of his hand im sorry he says softly and the kid is really in pain theres no acting here just real emotion cut i say and we take a break gwen rushes in with a brush and some tissue beautiful just beautiful she says nathan stands and walks to the creek lost in his thoughts i tell slade to start rolling again we spend three hours at the site shooting and reshooting scenes that i create on the fly and by pm were hungry and tired we find a fastfood place in bluefield and choke down burgers and fries riding back to radford the three of us are silent until i tell gwen to call tad carsloff one of my partners in miami carsloffs name was mentioned by the crs secretary when nathan called our home office number two days earlier feigning a real conversation gwen says hello tad its gwen great you yeah well were riding back to radford with nathan we spent the morning at the site where his brother was murdered pretty powerful stuff nathan did a fantastic job of narration he doesnt need the script it just comes natural i sneak a look at nathan behind the wheel he cannot suppress a smug little smile gwen continues with her oneway dialogue his mother a pause she hasnt budged yet nathan says she wants no part of the film and doesnt approve reed wants to try again tomorrow a pause hes thinking of going to their hometown to film the grave site talk to old friends maybe some guys he worked with you know that sort of thing a pause as she listens intently to nothing yes things couldnt be better here reed is thrilled with the first two days and nathan is just wonderful to work with really powerful stuff reed says hell call later this afternoon ciao we ride in silence for a mile or two as nathan soaks up the praise finally he says so were going to willow gap tomorrow yes but you dont have to go if you dont want to i say i figure after two days youve had enough of this so youre finished with me he asks sadly oh no after tomorrow im going home to miami and ill spend a few days looking at footage well begin the editing trying to whittle things down then in a couple of weeks whenever you can work us in well be back for another round of shooting have you told nathan about tads idea gwen says from the backseat no not yet i think its brilliant she says what is it nathan asks tad is the best editor in the company and we collaborate on everything because this film involves three or four different families different murders he has suggested we bring you guys together same place same time and just let the cameras run put you all in a room in a very comfortable setting and let the conversation begin no script no direction just the facts as brutal as they are as ive told you we have researched half a dozen cases and they are all remarkably similar well pick the best three or four yours is definitely the best gwen interjects and let you the victims compare stories tad thinks this could be beyond powerful hes right gwen chirps i would love to see it i tend to agree i say where would we meet nathan says practically on board were not that far along but probably miami have you been to south beach nathan gwen asks no oh boy for a single guy thirty years old you will not want to leave the partying is nonstop and the girls are how would you describe them reed havent noticed i say on script right lets just say they are beautiful and hot this is not about partying i say scolding my assistant we could also do it in the dc area which would probably be more convenient to the families nathan says nothing but i know hes voting for south beach vanessa and i spend the afternoon in a hotel room in pulaski virginia a half hour southwest of radford we go over my notes from fort carson and try anxiously to figure out what made nathan suspicious to hear him utter the name malcolm bannister was chilling enough now we need to understand why malcolm pinched his nose when he was thinking he tapped his fingers together when he listened he cocked his head slightly to the right when he was amused he dipped his chin when he was skeptical he stuck his right index finger into his right temple when he was bored with a conversation just keep your hands still and away from your face vanessa advises and speak lower was my voice too high it tends to go back to normal when youre talking a lot stay quieter not as many words we argue about the seriousness of his suspicion vanessa is convinced nathan is fully on board and looking forward to a trip to miami she is certain no one from my past could recognize me now i tend to agree but im still stunned by the reality that nathan uttered my old name i can almost believe he had a twinkle in his eye when he did so as if to say i know who you are and i know why youre here chapter nathan insists on going with us to his hometown of willow gap so for the second morning we work our way through the mountains as he drives and gwen gushes about the reactions in miami she says to nathan that tad carsloff and other important people down there in the home office watched all of our footage last night and are beyond thrilled they simply love nathan on camera and are convinced he is the turning point in the production of our documentary more important one of our major investors is visiting miami and happened to watch the tape from virginia the guy is so impressed with nathan and the entire film so far that he is willing to double down on his money the guys worth a bundle and thinks the movie should run at least ninety minutes it could lead to indictments within the dea it could explode into a scandal like washington has never seen as i listen to this chatter i am on the phone presumably speaking with the home office but theres no one on the other end i grunt occasionally and say something profound but mainly im just listening and brooding and acting as though the creative process can be burdensome sometimes i glance at nathan the boy is all in over breakfast gwen stressed again that i should say as little as possible speak deeply and slowly and keep my hands away from my face im happy to let her do the talking something shes quite good at gene cooley is buried behind an abandoned country church in a small weedy cemetery with about a hundred graves i tell slade and cody i want several shots of the grave and its surroundings then i step away for another important phone call nathan now quite the actor and full of himself suggests that he kneel beside the grave while the camera rolls and gwen loves the idea i nod from a distance with the cell phone stuck to my jaw whispering to no one nathan even manages to work up a few more tears and slade zooms in for a closeup for the record willow gap has five hundred people but youll never find them downtown proper is an overgrown alley with four crumbling buildings and a country store with a post office attached to it a few folks are moving about and nathan becomes nervous he knows these people and he does not want to be seen with a camera crew he explains that most of the residents including his family and friends live out from town off the narrow country lanes and deep in the valleys they are suspicious people by nature and i now understand why he wanted to accompany us there is no school he and gene attended the kids from willow gap are bused an hour away made it easy to quit nathan says almost to himself he reluctantly shows us a tiny empty fourroom cottage where he and gene lived once for about a year it was the last place i remember living with my father he says i was about six i guess so gene was about ten i cajole him into sitting on the broken front steps and talking to the camera about all the places he and gene lived for the moment he forgets about the glamour of acting and becomes sullen i ask him about his father but he wants no part of that conversation he gets angry and barks at me and suddenly hes acting again a few minutes later gwen very much on his side now and wary of me tells him hes superb as we loiter around the front of the shack i pace as if lost in a deep creative funk i finally ask where his mother is living now he points and says about ten minutes down that road but we are not going there okay i reluctantly agree and step away to chat on the phone again after two hours in and around willow gap weve seen enough i make it known im not too pleased with what weve shot and i become irritable gwen whispers to nathan hell get over it where was genes meth lab i ask its gone he answers blew up not long after he died thats just great i mumble we finally load up everything and leave the area for the second day in a row lunch is a burger and fries just off an interstate exit when were on the road again i finish another imaginary phone call and stick the phone in my pocket i turn so i can see gwen and its obvious i have big news okay heres where we are tad has been talking nonstop to the alvarez family in texas and the marshak family in california i mentioned these two cases to you nathan if youll recall the alvarez boy was shot fourteen times by dea agents the marshak kid was asleep in his college dorm room when they broke in and shot him before he woke up remember nathan is nodding as he drives theyve found a cousin in the alvarez family with good english and hes willing to talk mr marshak has sued the dea and his lawyers have told him to keep quiet but hes really pissed and wants to go public both can be in miami this weekend at our expense of course both have jobs though so the filming has to be done on a saturday two questions nathan first do you want to go and do this and second can you go on such short notice have you told him about the dea files gwen asks before he can answer not yet i just found out this morning what is it nathan asks i think i told you our lawyers have filed the necessary paperwork to obtain copies of the dea files on certain cases including genes yesterday a federal judge in washington ruled in our favor sort of we can see the files but we cannot actually have possession of them so the dea in dc is sending the files to the dea office in miami and we will have access to the materials when gwen asks as early as monday do you want to see genes file nathan gwen asks cautiously protectively he doesnt answer quickly so i chime in we wont be shown everything but there will be a lot of photoscrime scene stuff and statements from all of the agents probably a statement from the informant who set you guys up there will be ballistics reports the autopsy photos of that it could be fascinating nathan clenches his jaws and says id like to see it so youre in i ask whats the downside he asks and this question gets a lot of consideration for the next few minutes finally i reply downside if you are still dealing then the dea would come after you with a vengeance weve had this discussion im not dealing i told you that then theres no downside youre doing it for gene and for all of the deas murder victims youre doing it for justice and youre gonna love south beach gwen adds i close the deal by saying we can leave tomorrow afternoon out of roanoke fly straight to miami do the shoot on saturday play on sunday see the dea file on monday morning and youre home that night gwen says i thought nicky had the jet in vancouver i reply he does but itll be here tomorrow afternoon you have a jet nathan asks and he looks at me in pure amazement this is amusing to gwen and me i laugh and say not mine personally but our company leases one we travel an awful lot and sometimes its the only way to get things done i cant leave tomorrow gwen says looking at her schedule on her iphone ill be in dc but ill just fly down saturday im not gonna miss the three families in the same room at the same time incredible what about your bar i ask nathan i own the place he says smugly and i got a pretty good manager plus id like to get outta town for a few days the bar is ten twelve hours a day six days a week and your parole officer im free to travel i just have to notify him thats all this is exciting gwen says almost squealing with delight nathan is smiling like a kid at christmas me im all business as usual look nathan i need to nail this down right now if were going then say so i have to call nicky and line up the jet and i have to call tad so he can arrange flights for the other families yes or no without hesitation nathan says yep lets go great gwen asks which hotel would nathan like reed i dont know theyre all good your call i tap keys on my phone and begin another unilateral conversation you want to be right on the beach nathan or one block off where are the girls he asks and laughs at his own incredible humor okay on the beach it is by the time we return to radford nathan cooley thinks hes booked into one of the coolest hotels in the world on one of the hippest beaches and hell arrive there by private jet which will only be fitting for such a serious actor vanessa leaves in a mad dash for reston virginia dc suburbs some four hours away her first destination is a nameless organization renting space in a rundown strip mall its the workshop of a group of talented forgers who can create virtually any document on the spot they specialize in fake passports but for the right price they can produce college diplomas birth certificates marriage licenses court orders car titles eviction notices drivers licenses credit historiestheres no limit to their mischief some of what they do is illegal and some is not they brazenly advertise on the internet along with an astonishing number of competitors but claim to be careful about whom they work for i found them several weeks ago after an exhaustive search and to validate their reliability i sent a check drawn on skelter films for a fake passport it arrived in florida a week later and i was floored at its seeming authenticity according to the guy on the phone a real expert there was an eightytwenty chance the fake passport would clear customs in the event i tried to leave the country there was a percent chance i would be able to enter any country in the caribbean problems will arise though if i try to reenter the united states i explained that this will not happen not with my new fake passport he explained that nowadays in the age of terror the us customs service is much more concerned with whos on the no fly list than whos fudging with phony papers because its a rush job vanessa forks over in cash and they get down to business her forger is a nervous geek with an odd name that he reluctantly divulged like his colleagues he works in a cramped fortified cubicle with no one else in sight the atmosphere is suspicious as though everyone there is violating some law and half expecting a swat team any minute they dont like dropins they prefer the shield of the internet so no one sees their shady business vanessa hands over the memory card from her camera and on a twentyinch screen they look at the shots of a smiling nathan cooley they select one for the passport and drivers license and go through his dataaddress date of birth and so on vanessa says she wants the new documents in the name of nathaniel coley not cooley whatever the geek says he could not care less he is soon lost in a flurry of highspeed imaging it takes him an hour to produce an american passport and a virginia drivers license that would fool anyone the passports blue vinyl binding is sufficiently worn and our boy nathan whos never traveled far has now seen all of europe and most of asia vanessa hustles into dc where she picks up two firstaid kits a pistol and some pills at she turns around and heads south for roanoke chapter the airplane is a challenger one of the finer private jets available for charter its cabin seats eight comfortably and allows those under six feet two to move around without scraping the ceiling a new one costs something like million according to the data and specs online but im not in the market i only need a quick rental at an hour the charter service is out of raleigh and it has been paid in full with a skelter films check drawn on the bank in miami were set for a pm friday departure out of roanoke just two passengersnathan and me i spend most of friday morning trying to convince the charter service that i will email copies of our passports as soon as i can locate mine my story is that i have temporarily misplaced it and im turning my apartment upside down for trips outside the country a private charter service must submit its passengers names and copies of their passports several hours before departure the us customs service checks this information against its no fly list i know that neither malcolm bannister nor max reed baldwin is on the list but i dont know what might happen when customs receives a copy of nathaniel coleys fake passport so i stall hoping and believing that the less time customs has with both passports the luckier i might get finally i inform the charter service that ive found mine and i kill another hour before emailing it and nathaniels to the office in raleigh i have no idea what customs will do when it receives the copy of my passport quite possibly my name will trigger an alert and the fbi will be notified if this happens it will be to my knowledge the first trace of me since i left florida sixteen days ago i tell myself this is no big deal because im neither a suspect nor a fugitive im a free man who can travel anywhere without restrictions right but why does this scenario bother me because i dont trust the fbi i drive vanessa to the roanoke regional airport where she catches a flight to miami through atlanta after i drop her off i drive around until i find the small terminal for private aircraft i have hours to kill so i find a parking place and hide my little audi between two pickup trucks i call nathan at his bar and deliver the bad news that our flight has been delayed according to our pilots there is a bug in a warning light no big deal but our technicians are hard at work and we should take off around pm the charter service emailed me a copy of our itinerary and the challenger is scheduled to be repositioned in roanoke at pm on the dot it lands and taxis to the terminal the adventure at hand makes me both nervous and excited i wait half an hour before calling the charter service in raleigh to explain that i will be delayed until approximately pm the hours pass and i fight boredom at pm i stroll into the terminal ask around and meet one of the pilots devin i turn on the charm and chat up devin as if were old pals i explain that my copassenger nathan is the subject of one of my films and were headed off for a few days of beach fun i dont know the kid that well devin asks for my passport and i hand it over without being obvious he checks my face with my photo and all is well i ask to take a look at the airplane will the other pilot is in the cockpit reading a newspaper as i step onto a private jet for the first time in my life i shake his hand like a politician and comment on the stunning display of screens switches instruments dials meters and so on devin shows me around behind the cockpit is the small kitchen or galley complete with microwave a sink with hot and cold water full bar drawers filled with china and flatware and a large ice bin where the beer is just waiting i specifically asked for two brands one with alcohol and one without behind one door is a collection of snacks in case we get hungry dinner will not be served because i do not want a flight attendant on board the people at the charter service insisted that the aircrafts owner required the use of a flight attendant at which time i threatened to cancel they backed down so it will be just nathan and me on the trip south the cabin is furnished with six large leather chairs and a small sofa the decor is soft earth tones and very tasteful the carpet is plush and spotless there are at least three screens for movies and as devin goes on proudly a surround sound system we move from the cabin to the restroom then the cargo hold im traveling light and devin takes my carryon bag i hesitate as if ive forgotten something i have a couple of dvds in my bag and i might need them i explain can i get to it during the flight sure no problem the cargo hold is pressurized too so you have access devin says great i spend half an hour examining the airplane then begin looking at my watch as if im irritated at nathan and his tardiness this kids from the mountains i explain to devin as we sit in the cabin doubt if hes ever been on a plane before hes kinda rough around the edges what kind of movie yall doing devin asks documentary the meth business in appalachia devin and i return to the terminal and continue waiting ive forgotten something in my car and i leave the building minutes later i see nathans new pickup truck roll into the lot he parks quickly then hops out eager hes wearing cutoff denim shorts a pair of white nike running shoes no socks a flatbilled truckers cap and best of all a pinkandorange floralprint hawaiian shirt with at least the top two buttons unfastened he grabs a stuffed adidas gym bag from the back of his truck and bounds toward the terminal i intercept him and we shake hands im holding some papers sorry about the delay i say but the airplane is here and ready to go no problem his eyes are watery and i catch a whiff of stale beer wonderful i lead him inside and to the front desk where devin is flirting with the receptionist i walk nathan to the windows and point to the challenger thats ours i say proudly at least for this weekend he gawks at the aircraft as devin walks over i quickly slip him nathans fake passport he glances at the photo then at nathan who at that moment turns from the window i introduce him to devin who hands me the passport and says welcome aboard are we ready to go i ask follow me devin says and as we leave the terminal i say off to the beach on board devin takes the adidas gym bag and stores it in cargo while nathan falls into one of the leather chairs and admires his surroundings im in the galley preparing the first round of beersthe real thing for nathan one with no alcohol for me when theyre poured into icecold mugs you cant tell the difference i banter with devin as he goes through the emergency procedures nervous that he might mention our destination he does not and when he retires to the cockpit and straps himself in i take a deep breath he and will give me the thumbsup and start the engines cheers i say to nathan and we tap glasses and take a gulp i unfold a mahogany table between us as the jet begins to taxi i say you like tequila hell yeah he replies already the party animal i jump up walk into the galley fetch a fifth of cuervo gold and two shot glasses and place them hard on the table i pour two shots and we kill them following them up with more beer i have a buzz by the time we take off when the seat belt sign is turned off i pour another round of beer and we do more shots shots and beer shots and beer i fill in the conversation gaps with drivel about the film and how excited our financial partners are at the moment this soon bores nathan so i tell him we have a late dinner lined up and one of the young ladies there is a friend of a friend who could be the hottest chick on south beach shes seen a portion of our footage and wants to meet nathan did you bring any long pants i ask i assume the adidas bag is filled with clothing about as tasteful as what im looking at oh yeah got all kinds of stuff he says his tongue getting thicker by the moment when the cuervo gold is half gone i look at the navigational map on display and say only an hour to miami drink up we knock back another shot each then i drain my glass of unleaded i weigh at least thirty pounds more than nathan half my drinks have no alcohol and my vision is blurred as we pass over savannah at thirtyeight thousand feet hes getting bombed i keep pouring and he shows no signs of slacking off as we pass high over my old stomping ground at neptune beach i fix the final round into nathans beer mug i drop two tablets of chloral hydrate five hundred milligrams each lets kill these dead soldiers i say slamming them onto the table and we turn bottoms up i take it easy and nathan wins the contest thirty minutes later hes dead to the world i watch our progress on the screen next to the galley were now at forty thousand miami is in sight but we are not descending i pull nathan out of his chair and drag him to the sofa where i stretch him out and check his pulse i pour a cup of coffee and watch miami fade below us before long cuba is behind us too and jamaica emerges at the bottom of the screen the engines throttle back a notch and we begin our long descent i gulp coffee in a desperate effort to clear my head the next twenty minutes will be crucial and chaotic i have a plan but so much of it is beyond my control nathan is breathing heavily and slowly i shake him but hes unconscious from the right pocket of his tootight denim cutoffs i remove his key ring in addition to the one for his pickup the collection includes six others of varying shapes and designs im sure a couple fit the doors and dead bolts of his house perhaps a couple lock and unlock bombays in the left pocket i find a neat fold of cashabout and a pack of gum from the left rear pocket i remove his wallet a cheap vinyl velcro trifold thats sort of bulky as i inventory it i realize why our party boy had loaded up with eight trojan condoms stored at the ready on his left buttock there are also ten crisp bills a valid virginia drivers license two membership cards to bombays a business card for his parole officer and one for a beer distributor nathan has no credit cards probably because of his recent fiveyear stint in prison and his lack of a real job i leave the cash in place dont touch the trojans and remove everything else i substitute the fake drivers license for the valid one and give nathaniel coley his wallet back then i gently place the fake passport in his right rear pocket he doesnt move or twitch doesnt feel a thing i go to the restroom and close and lock the door i open the cargo hold unzip my carryon and remove two nylon pouches with the words first aid stamped in bold letters i stuff these into the bottom of nathans gym bag then rezip everything i walk to the cockpit pull back the black curtain and lean forward to catch devins attention he quickly removes his headset and i say look this guy drank nonstop until he passed out i cant seem to wake him up and theres not much of a pulse we might need some medical attention as soon as we land will hears this even with his headset and for a split second he and devin stare at each other if they were not descending one of the two would probably step into the cabin and take a look at nathan okay devin finally says and i return to the cabin where nathan lies in near rigor mortis but with a pulse five minutes later i return to the cockpit and report that he is indeed breathing but i cant rouse him idiot drank a fifth of tequila in less than two hours i say and they both shake their heads we land in montego bay and taxi past a row of commercial airliners at the gates of the main concourse to the south i see three other jets parked at the private terminal there are emergency vehicles with red lights flashing all waiting for nathan ill need the chaos to aid in my disappearance im far from sober but the adrenaline has kicked in and im thinking clearly when the engines are turned off devin jumps up and opens the door i have my briefcase and carryon in my chair ready for the opportunity but im also hovering over nathan wait for immigration devin says sure i reply two grimfaced jamaican immigration officers appear in the cabin and glare at me passport please one says and i give him my passport he looks it over and says please leave the aircraft i hustle down the stairs where another officer tells me to wait two medics board the plane and i presume theyre tending to nathan an ambulance backs up to the stairs and a police car arrives with lights but no sirens i take a step back then another there is a dispute about how to remove the patient from the airplane and everyonemedics immigration officers policeseems to have an opinion they finally decide against using a stretcher so nathan is basically dragged out and handed down the stairs hes limp and lifeless and if he weighed more than pounds the entire rescue would have been botched as hes loaded into the ambulance his gym bag appears in the door and an immigration officer quizzes devin about it devin makes sure the authorities know that the adidas bag belongs to the unconscious one and it is finally placed in the ambulance with him i need to go now i say to the nearest officer and he points to a door of the private terminal i enter just as nathan is being hauled away my passport is stamped and my carryon and briefcase are scanned a customs official tells me to wait in the front lobby and as i do i see devin and will in a tense discussion with the jamaican authorities they probably have some tough questions for me and id rather avoid them a taxi swings through the gate and stops under the terrace outside the front door a rear window comes down and i see my dear vanessa waving frantically for me to get in when no one is near i leave the terminal jump into the cab and we speed away she has a room in a cheap hotel five minutes away from the thirdfloor balcony we can see the airport and the jets come and go lying in bed we can hear them we are exhausted and running on fumes but sleep is out of the question chapter victor westlake was attempting to sleep late on saturday morning but after the second call he got out of bed made the coffee and was contemplating a possible nap on the sofa when the third call jolted him and swept away any lingering drowsiness it was from an assistant named fox who was currently keeping the bannisterbaldwin file and waiting for something to monitor there had not been a peep in over two weeks it came from customs fox was saying baldwin left roanoke yesterday afternoon on a private jet and flew to jamaica a private jet westlake repeated thinking about the in reward money and wondering how long it might last if baldwin was burning through it yes sir a challenger chartered from a company in raleigh westlake thought for a moment i wonder what hes doing in roanoke odd yes sir didnt he go to jamaica a few weeks back his first trip out of the country yes sir he flew out of miami to montego bay spent a few days there then went to antigua i suppose he likes the islands westlake said as he reached for fresh coffee is he alone no sir hes traveling with a man named nathaniel coley at least thats whats on his passport however it appears as though coley is traveling with a fake passport westlake sat the untouched coffee back onto the counter and began to pace around the kitchen this guy got by customs with a fake passport yes sir but keep in mind it was a private aircraft and the passport was not actually examined by customs all they had was the copy sent in by the charter service and they checked it against the no fly list its pretty routine remind me to fix that routine yes sir so the question fox is whats baldwin up to right why is he chartering a private jet and why is he traveling with a man whos using a fake passport can you answer these questions for me and soon if those are my orders yes sir but im sure i dont have to remind you how prickly the jamaicans are no you dont in the war on drugs not all battles were fought between cops and traffickers the jamaicans like many police agencies in the caribbean had long resented the bullying from us officials ill get to work fox said but its saturday here and there be in my office early monday morning with something okay yes sir nathan cooley awoke in a small windowless room dark except for the red glow of a digital monitor on a table near him he was lying on what appeared to be a hospital bednarrow with railings he looked up and saw a bag of fluids then followed the tube all the way down to the back of his left hand where it disappeared under the white gauze okay im in a hospital his mouth was as dry as salt and his head began to pound as he tried to think he looked down and noticed the white nike running shoes still attached to his feet they whoever in hell they might be had not bothered to cover him or dress him in a patients gown he closed his eyes again and slowly the fog began to lift he remembered the shots of tequila the endless mugs of beer the craziness of reed baldwin as the two of them got smashed he remembered having a few at his bar on friday afternoon as he waited for his trip to the airport then on to miami he must have had ten beers and ten shots what an idiot blacked out again and now hooked to an iv he wanted to get up and move about but his head was screaming and his eyes were bleeding dont move he said to himself there was a sound at the door and a light came on a tall very dark nurse in a pristine white outfit entered the room in midsentence all right mr coley time to go some gentlemen are here to take you it was english but with an odd accent nathan was about to ask where am i when three uniformed officers marched in behind the nurse and looked as though they were ready to beat him all three were black with very dark skin what the hell nathan managed to say as he sat up the nurse removed the iv and disappeared closing the door hard behind her the older officer stepped forward and whipped out a badge captain fremont jamaican police he said just as they do on television where am i nathan asked fremont smiled as did the two officers immediately behind him you dont know where you are where am i youre in jamaica montego bay in the hospital for now but soon to be in the city jail howd i get to jamaica nathan asked by private jet and a nice one but im supposed to be in miami at south beach theres some mistake here you see is this a joke or something do we look like the joking type mr coley nathan thought it was odd the way these people pronounced his last name why did you try to enter jamaica with a fake passport mr coley nathan reached for his rear pocket and realized his wallet was missing wheres my wallet he asked in our custody along with everything else nathan massaged his temples and fought the urge to vomit jamaica what the hell am i doing in jamaica we have some of the same questions mr coley passport what passport ive never had a passport ill show it to you later its a violation of jamaican law to attempt to enter our country with a bogus passport mr coley under the circumstances though you have far more serious problems wheres reed im sorry reed baldwin the guy who brought me find reed and he can explain everything i havent met this reed baldwin well you gotta find him okay hes a black guy like you all and reed can explain everything i mean we left roanoke yesterday around seven i guess we had too much to drink we were headed for miami to south beach where we were supposed to work on his documentary its about my brother gene you know anyway theres some big mistake here were supposed to be in miami fremont slowly turned and looked at his two colleagues the glances they exchanged left little doubt they were dealing with a confused and babbling moron jail did you say jail your next stop my friend nathan clutched his stomach and his jaws filled with vomit fremont quickly handed him a lined waste bin then took a step back to stay clear nathan puked and heaved and gasped and cursed for five minutes as the three officers inspected their boots or admired the ceiling when the episode was mercifully over nathan stood and placed the waste bin on the floor he wiped his mouth with a tissue from the table and took a sip of water please tell me whats going on he said in a scratchy voice youre under arrest mr coley fremont said customs violations the importation of controlled substances and possession of a firearm why did you think you could enter jamaica with four kilos of pure cocaine and a handgun nathans jaw dropped his mouth opened but nothing escaped but warm air he squinted frowned pleaded with his eyes and tried again to speak nothing finally he managed a feeble what dont play dumb mr coley where were you going off to one of our famous resorts for a week of drugs and sex was it all for personal consumption or did you intend to sell some of it to other rich americans this is a joke right wheres reed the funs over haha now get me outta here fremont reached for his thick belt and removed a set of handcuffs turn around sir hands behind your back nathan suddenly yelled reed i know youre out there stop laughing asshole and tell these clowns to knock it off turn around sir fremont said again but nathan did not comply instead he yelled even louder reed ill get you for this nice joke i hear you laughing out there the other two officers stepped forward and each took an arm nathan wisely realized that resisting would not work when the handcuffs were in place they led him from the room and into the hallway nathan spun around wildly looking for reed or anyone else who might step forward and put an end to this they walked past rooms with open doors small rooms with two and three beds practically touching each other they walked past comatose patients on gurneys parked against the walls and nurses writing in charts and orderlies watching television everyone is black nathan noticed i really am in jamaica they shuffled down a set of stairs and through an exit door when he stepped into the thick air and brilliant sun nathan knew he was on foreign soil and unfriendly territory a cab takes vanessa back to the airport where shell catch a flight to atlanta she is scheduled to arrive in roanoke this evening at she will drive to radford and check into a motel i will not be joining her for a few days i take another cab to the downtown area of montego bay unlike kingston the capital which is three hundred years old montego bay is a new city that developed as resorts hotels condos and shopping villages sprawled inward away from the ocean and finally met up with the neighborhoods there is no main avenue or central plaza or stately courthouse in the center of town government buildings are scattered over a wide area as are most of the professional buildings my driver finds the law office of mr rashford watley i pay the fare and hustle up a flight of stairs to a landing where a bunch of lawyers keep small separate offices mr watley explained on the phone that he rarely works on saturdays but hell make an exception for me his ad in the yellow pages boasts of thirty years experience in all criminal courts when we shake hands i can tell hes pleasantly surprised to see that i too am black he probably assumed that as an american tourist i was like all the rest we take our seats in his modest office and after a few pleasantries i get to the point sort of he suggests that we dispense with the formalities and use first names only so its reed and rashford i quickly go through the narrative about my background as a filmmaker my current project involving one nathan coley and so on but before long im veering off course i tell rashford that nathan and i came to jamaica for a few days of fun he got drunk and blacked out on the airplane causing a medical emergency upon our arrival im not sure but i think he tried to smuggle in some drugs and was packing a gun i managed to get away last night in the confusion so i wish to retain rashford for two purposes first and most important to represent me and protect me from whatever hot water i might be in second to make some calls and pull some strings to find out about nathan and the charges against him i want rashford to visit nathan in jail and assure him im doing all i can to secure his release no problem rashford assures me we agree on a fee and i pay him in cash he immediately gets on the phone and checks with contacts in customs and the police i cant tell if hes hamming it up for me but the guy knows a lot of people after an hour i excuse myself and walk down the street for a soft drink when i return to his office rashford is still on the phone scribbling away on a notepad im reading a magazine in the lobby under a noisy ceiling fan when rashford appears and sits on his secretarys desk things are grim and hes shaking his head your friend is in big trouble he says first he tried to enter with a bogus passport no kidding rash i listen intently did you know this he asks of course not i reply i assume rashford has never chartered a private jet and therefore does not know the routine but much worse he continues he tried to smuggle in a handgun and four kilos of cocaine four kilos of cocaine i repeat acting as shocked as possible found the powder in two nylon firstaid kits in his gym bag along with a small pistol what a fool im shaking my head in disbelief he mentioned buying drugs once he got here but said nothing about smuggling the stuff in how well do you know this gentleman rashford asks i just met him a week ago were not exactly close friends i know he has a history of drug violations in the states but i had no idea he was an idiot well he is and hell probably be spending the next twenty years in one of our fine prisons twenty five for the coke fifteen for the gun thats outrageous you gotta do something rashford the options are limited but allow me to go about my business what about me am i okay down here i mean they checked my bags at customs and everything was cool im not an accomplice or guilty by association right as of now nothing but i suggest you leave as soon as possible i cant leave until i see nathan i mean i gotta help this guy you know theres not much you can do reed they found the coke and the gun in his bag i start pacing around the small room deep in thought worried sick rashford watches me for a moment then says theyll probably allow me to see mr coley i know the boys at the jail see them all the time youve hired the right lawyer reed but again im not sure what can be done how often do you see thisamerican tourists busted for drugs down here he thinks about this then says happens all the time but not like this the americans get caught on the way out not bringing the stuff in its rather unusual but the drug charges are not that crucial were soft on drugs but hard on guns we have very tough laws especially with handguns what was this boy thinking i dont know allow me to go see him and make contact i need to see him too rashford you gotta work this out lean on your friends at the jail and talk them into it it might take some cash how much he shrugs and says not much twenty bucks us i got that allow me to see what i can do chapter the pilots are calling my cell phone but i refuse to answer devin leaves four frantic voice mails all pretty much the same the police have seized the airplane and the pilots have been told they cannot leave the island they are staying at the hilton but not having any fun their office in raleigh is screaming and everybody wants answers the pilots are taking the heat for submitting a fake passport and will probably lose their jobs the airplanes owner is threatening and so on i dont have the time to worry about these people im sure a man who owns a million jet can figure out a way to get it back at pm rashford and i leave his office and he drives us ten minutes to the police department the city jail is attached to it he parks in a crowded lot and nods at a lowslung flatroofed building with narrow slits for windows and razor wire for decoration we walk down a sidewalk and rashford says a pleasant hello to the guards and orderlies he goes to a door and whispers with a guard he obviously knows i watch without being obvious and no cash changes hands at a desk we sign a sheet on a clipboard i told them youre a lawyer working with me he whispers as i scribble one of my names just act like a lawyer if he only knew rashford waits in a long narrow room the lawyers use for meetings if the police are not using it for anything else there is no airconditioning and the room feels like a sauna after a few minutes the door opens and nathan coley is shoved inside he looks wildeyed at rashford then turns to his guard who leaves and closes the door nathan slowly sits down on a metal stool and gawks at rashford the lawyer thrusts a business card at him and says im rashford watley attorney your friend reed baldwin has hired me to look into this situation nathan takes the card and inches the stool closer his left eye is partially closed and his left jaw is swollen there is dried blood at the corner of his lips wheres reed he asks hes here he is very concerned and wants to see you are you okay mr coley your jaw is swollen nathan looks at the large round black face and tries to absorb the words its english all right but with a strange accent he wants to correct this guy and explain that its cooley not coley but then maybe the guy is trying to say cooley but it just comes out differently in jamaica are you all right mr coley the lawyer repeats ive had two fights in the past two hours lost both of them you gotta get me outta here mr he looks at the card but cant focus on the words its watley mr watley fine mr watley this is a big misunderstanding i dont know what happened what went wrong but i aint guilty of anything i didnt use a fake passport and i damned sure didnt try to smuggle in drugs and a gun somebody planted that stuff in my bag you got that thats the truth and ill swear on a stack of bibles i dont use drugs dont sell em and i damned sure dont smuggle them i want to talk to reed he sort of spits his words through clenched teeth and rubs his jaw as he talks is your jaw broken rashford asks i aint no doctor ill try to get one and ill try to get you moved to another cell theyre all the samehot overcrowded and dirty you gotta do something mr watley and fast ill never survive in here youve been in prison before i think i just spent a few years in a federal pen but nothing like this i just thought that was bad this is pure hell i got fifteen guys in my cell all black but me with two beds and a hole in the corner to piss in no airconditioning and no food please mr watley do something youre facing very serious charges mr coley if convicted as charged you could be sentenced to twenty years in prison nathan drops his head and takes a deep breath i wont last a week im confident i can get a reduction but still youre facing a lot of time and not in a city jail like this theyll send you away to one of our regional prisons where the conditions are not always as pleasant then give me a plan youve got to explain to the judge or whoever that this is all a mistake im not guilty okay you gotta make somebody believe that ill try mr coley but the system has to run its course and unfortunately things move rather slowly here in jamaica the court will schedule your first appearance in a few days then formal charges will be handed down what about bail can i post a bond and get outta here im working on that now with a bail bondsman but im not optimistic the court would consider you a flight risk how much money is at your disposal nathan snorts and shakes his head i dont know i had a thousand bucks in my wallet wherever it happens to be now im sure the moneys gone i had five hundred bucks in my pocket too and its gone theyve picked me clean i got a few assets back home but nothing liquid im not a rich man mr watley im a thirtyyearold excon who was in prison about six months ago my family has nothing well the court will look at the amount of cocaine and the private jet and think otherwise the cocaine is not mine i never saw it never touched it it was planted okay mr watley so was the gun i believe you mr coley but the court will likely be more skeptical the court hears such stories all the time nathan opened his mouth slowly and picked at the dried blood at the corner of his lips he was obviously in pain and shock rashford stood and said keep your seat reeds here if anyone asks tell them hes just one of your lawyers nathans battered face lights up somewhat when i enter i sit on my stool less than three feet from him he wants to yell but he knows someone is listening what the hell is happening here reed talk to me my act at this point is that of a frightened man who is not sure what will happen tomorrow i dont know nathan i say nervously im not under arrest but i cant leave the island i found rashford watley first thing this morning and were trying to figure it all out all i remember is that we got real drunk real fast stupid got that you passed out on the sofa and i was barely awake at some point one of the pilots called me up to the cockpit and explained that air traffic around miami was grounded because of weather tornado warnings a tropical storm really bad stuff miami international was closed the system was moving north so we circled to the south and were diverted over the caribbean we circled and circled and i really cant remember all of what happened i tried to wake you but you were snoring i dont remember blacking out he says tapping his sore jaw does a drunk ever remember passing out no he does not you were bombed okay you had been drinking before we took off anyway at some point we were getting low on fuel and had to land according to the pilots we were directed here to montego bay to refuel then we were supposed to leave for miami where the weather had cleared im drinking coffee by the gallon and so i remember most of what happened when we land the captain says just stay on the plane well only be here for twenty minutes then he says that immigration and customs want to take a look were ordered off the plane but youre in a coma and cant move you barely have a pulse they call an ambulance and everything starts going wrong whats this shit about a fake passport my mistake we fly into miami international all the time and they often want to see a passport even for domestic flights especially private ones i think it goes back to the drug wars in the s when a lot of private jets were used to haul drug lords and their entourages now with the war on terror they like to see a passport its not mandatory to have one but its very helpful i got a guy in dc who can produce one overnight for a hundred bucks and i asked him to crank one out for you just in case we needed it i had no idea it would become an issue poor nathan does not know what to believe i have the benefit of months of preparation hes getting hit fast and furious and is thoroughly bewildered believe me nathan a fake passport is the least of your worries whered the coke and the gun come from he asks the police i say casually but with certainty it wasnt you and it wasnt me so that narrows the list of suspects rashford says this is not unheard of on the island a private jet from america arrives with a couple of rich guys on boardrich otherwise they wouldnt be buzzing around on such a fine airplane one of the rich dudes is so drunk he cant hit his ass with both hands blackedout drunk they get the sober guy off the plane and get the pilots distracted with paperwork and when the timing is perfect they plant the drugs stuff it in a bag just that simple a few hours later the jet is officially seized by the jamaican government and the trafficker is placed under arrest its all about money cash nathan is absorbing this as he stares at his bare feet his pinkandorange hawaiian shirt has blood stains on it there are scratches on his arms and hands can you get me something to eat reed im starving they served lunch an hour ago shit so nasty you cant imagine and before i could take a bite one of my cellies decided he needed it more than me i say sorry nathan ill see if rashford can bribe one of the guards he mumbles please do you want me to call someone back home i ask he shakes his head no who the only person i halfway trust is the guy who runs my bar and i think hes stealing im cut off from my family and they wouldnt help anyway how can they they dont know where jamaica is not sure i can find it on the map rashford thinks they might charge me as an accomplice so i might be joining you back there he shakes his head you might survive because youre black and youre in good shape a skinny white boy aint got a chance as soon as i walked into the cell this big dude says he really likes my nikes gone next guy wants to borrow some money and since i dont have any money he wants me to promise to get some real soon this leads to the first fight which involved at least three of these thugs beating the shit out of me i remember hearing a guard laughing saying something about a white boy who cant fight too good my spot on the concrete floor is right next to the toilet which is nothing but an open hole like an outhouse the smell will make you gag and puke if i move an inch or two then im on somebody elses turf and theres a fight theres no airconditioning and its like an oven fifteen men in a tight space all sweating and hungry and thirsty and no one can sleep i cannot imagine what tonight will be like please reed get me outta here ill try nathan but theres a good chance these guys might try to nail me too just do something please look nathan this is all my fault okay that means nothing at this point but i had no way of knowing we were flying into a storm the stupid pilots shouldve told us about the weather before we took off or they shouldve landed somewhere on us soil or they shouldve had more fuel on the airplane well sue the bastards when we get home okay whatever nathan ill do anything i can to get you out of here but my ass is still on the line too its gonna come down to money this is nothing but a shakedown a grab for money by a bunch of cops who know how to play the game hell they wrote the rules rashford says theyll squeeze the owner of the jet and pocket a handsome bribe theyll throw a bone our way and see how much cash we can scrape together now that they know we have a lawyer he thinks theyll contact him pretty soon they prefer to work their little bribery schemes before the case gets into court after that you got formal charges and judges watching everything you understand all this nathan i guess i just cant believe this reed this time yesterday i was at my bar having a beer with a cute girl bragging about flying to miami for the weekend now look at methrown into a filthy jail cell with a bunch of jamaicans and theyre all lined up waiting to kick my ass youre right reed this is all your fault you and your ridiculous movie i shouldve never listened to you im sorry nathan believe me im so sorry you should be just do something reed and hurry i cant last much longer back there chapter rashford gives me a ride to my hotel and at the last minute graciously extends an invitation to dinner he says his wife is an excellent cook and they would be delighted to have such an accomplished filmmaker in their home though i am tempted primarily because i have nothing to do for the next eighteen hours i beg off with the lame excuse of feeling bad and needing sleep im living a lie and the last thing i need is a long dinner conversation about my life my work and my past i suspect there will be serious people following my trail sniffing for clues and a stray word here or there could come back to haunt me its july the tourist season is over and the hotel is not busy theres a small pool with a bar in the shade and i spend the afternoon under an umbrella reading a walter mosley and sipping red stripe beer vanessa lands in roanoke at saturday evening she is exhausted but rest is not an option in the past fortyeight hours she has driven from radford to dc to roanoke and flown from roanoke to jamaica and back by way of charlotte atlanta and miami other than a fitful threehour rest in bed in montego bay and several catnaps on airplanes she has had no sleep she leaves the terminal with her small carryon bag and takes her time finding her car as always she notices everything and everyone around her we doubt if shes being followed but at this point in our project we take nothing for granted she drives across the highway from the airport and gets a room at a holiday inn she orders room service and eats dinner at the window as the sun goes down at pm she calls me and we speak briefly and in code were on our third or fourth prepaid cell phone and its highly unlikely anyone is listening but again were taking no chances i conclude with a simple proceed as planned she drives back to the airport to the general aviation terminal and parks next to nathans pickup truck its late on a saturday night and there is no private air traffic no movements in the empty parking lot she puts on a pair of thin leather gloves and using nathans keys unlocks his door and drives away its vanessas first drive in such a vehicle and she takes it easy not far down the road she pulls in to a fastfood parking lot and adjusts the seat and mirrors for the past five years shes been driving a small japanese model and the upgrade is astounding and uncomfortable the last thing we can afford is a fender bender or a set of flashing blue lights eventually she makes it onto interstate and heads south toward radford virginia its almost midnight when she leaves the state highway and turns onto the country lane to nathans house she passes the doublewide trailer home to nathans nearest neighbor at fifteen miles per hour making virtually no noise in her own car shes driven this road a dozen times and knows the terrain the road winds past nathans and through some pastureland before passing another home almost two miles farther into the country beyond that the asphalt fades into gravel then to dirt there is no traffic because there is so little population it seems odd that a thirtyyearold bachelor would choose such a secluded place to live she parks in his driveway and listens nathans yellow lab is in the backyard in the distance barking inside a large fencedin dog run with a cute little house to keep him dry other than the dog though there are no sounds the darkness is broken slightly by a small yellow porch light vanessa has a millimeter glock stuck in a pocket and she thinks she knows how to use it she walks around the house careful where she steps listening to everything the dog barks louder but no one other than vanessa can hear him at the rear door she starts using the keys the first three fit neither the locked knob nor the dead bolt but numbers four and five do the trick she takes a breath as she pushes the door open there are no sirens no frantic beepings she had walked through the same door just five days earlier during the first session of filming and noticed the dead bolts and the absence of an alarm system once inside vanessa peels off the leather gloves and puts on a pair of disposable latex gloves she is about to examine every inch of the house and she cannot leave a single print walking quickly she flips on lights pulls down all the shades and cranks up the airconditioning its a cheap rental house being leased by an unmarried hillbilly whos spent the last five years in prison so the decor and furnishings are sparse there are a few sticks of furniture the obligatory oversized television and sheets on some of the windows there are also dirty dishes stacked by the kitchen sink and dirty clothes on the bathroom floor the guest bedroom is used to store junk two dead mice lay perfectly still in traps their necks snapped in two she begins in nathans bedroom by going through a tall chest of drawers nothing she looks under his bed and between the mattress and the box spring she examines every inch of his cluttered closet the house has a conventional framed foundation no concrete slab and the hardwood flooring gives way slightly with each step she taps the flooring searching for a more hollow sound for evidence of a hiding place i suspect nathan has hidden his loot somewhere in the house though probably not in one of the main rooms nonetheless we have to look everywhere if hes smart which is a stretch he has split it and is using more than one hiding place from his bedroom vanessa inspects the guest room giving the dead mice plenty of space at she begins turning off lights as if nathan is winding down room by room she goes checking every corner every plank every pocket nothing goes unturned or untested it could be in the walls the floors the drywall above the ceilings or it could be buried in the backyard or stashed in a safe at bombays the cramped basement has sevenfoot ceilings no airconditioning and unpainted cinderblock walls after spending an hour there vanessa is soaking wet and too tired to go on at am she stretches out on the sofa in the den and falls asleep with her hand on the glocks holster if rashford was hesitant to work on saturday he was almost belligerent on sunday but i gave him little choice i pleaded with him to accompany me to the jail and pull the same strings hed pulled the day before i gave him a bill to facilitate matters we arrive at the jail just before am and fifteen minutes later i am alone with nathan in the same room used yesterday i am shocked at his appearance his injuries are evident and substantial and i wonder how long the guards will allow the abuse to continue his face is a mess of gashes open wounds and dried blood his upper lip is bloated and protrudes grotesquely from under his nose his left eye is completely shut and his right one is red and puffy he is missing one front tooth gone are the cutoffs and cute hawaiian shirt replaced by a dirtstained white jumpsuit covered with dried blood we both lean forward our faces just inches apart help me he manages to say almost in tears heres the latest nathan i begin the crooks are demanding million from the jets owner and hes agreed to pay it so these scumbags will get their money theyre not going to charge me with anything as of this morning for you they want a half a million bucks ive explained through rashford that neither of us has that kind of money ive explained that we were just passengers on someones jet that were not rich and so on the jamaicans dont believe this anyway thats where we are as of right now nathan grimaces as if it hurts to breathe as bad as his face looks id hate to see the rest of his body im imagining the worst so i dont ask what happened he grunts and says can you get back to the us reed his voice is weak and scratchy even it is wounded i think so rashford thinks so but i dont have a lot of cash nathan he frowns and grunts again and looks as though he may either faint or cry reed listen to me i have some money a lot of it im staring him straight in the eyes or at least his right one because his left one is closed this is the fateful moment upon which everything else has been created without this the entire project would be a gargantuan disaster one horrific and lousy gamble how much i ask as he pauses he does not want to go on but he has no choice enough to get me out a half a million dollars nathan that and more we need to be partners reed just me and you ill tell you where the money is you go get it you get me out of here and well be partners but you gotta give me your word reed i have to trust you okay hang on nathan i say pulling back and throwing up both palms you expect me to leave here go home then come back with a sackful of money and bribe the jamaican police are you serious please reed theres no one else i cant call anyone at home no one there understands whats happening here only you you gotta do it reed please my life depends on it i cant survive here look at me please reed you do what i ask get me out and youll be a rich man i back away some more as if hes contagious hes begging come on reed you got me into this mess now get me out it might be helpful if you explain how you made so much money i didnt make it i stole it no surprise there drug money i ask but i know the answer no no no are we partners reed i dont know nathan im not so sure i want to start bribing jamaican police what if i get busted i could end up just like you then dont come back send the money to rashford get him to make the delivery you can figure it out reed hell youre a smart man i nod as if i like the way hes thinking wheres the money nathan are we partners reed fiftyfifty just me and you man okay okay but im not risking jail over this you understand i got it theres a pause as we study each other his breathing is labored and every word is painful slowly he extends his right hand its puffy and scratched partners reed he asks pleading slowly i shake his hand and he grimaces its probably broken wheres the money i ask its at my house he says slowly reluctantly as he gives away the most precious secret of his life youve been there theres a storage shed in the backyard full of junk it has a wooden floor and to the right under an old sears push mower that doesnt work is a trapdoor you cant see it until you move the mower and some of the junk around it watch out for snakesthere are a couple of king snakes that live there open the trapdoor and youll see a bronze casket his breathing is labored and he is sweating profusely the physical pain is obvious but hes also tormented by the pain of such a momentous revelation a casket i ask incredulous yes a childs casket closed and sealed waterproof and airtight theres a hidden latch at the narrow end where the feet would go when you lift it the seals release and you can open the casket whats inside a bunch of cigar boxes wrapped in duct tape i think there are eighteen of them you hid cash in cigar boxes its not cash reed he says as he leans closer its gold i appear too dumbfounded to speak so he continues almost in a whisper minibars each weighing ten ounces as pure as anything being mined in the world theyre about the size of a large domino theyre beautiful reed just beautiful i stare at him for a long time in disbelief then say okay as hard as it is ill resist asking a lot of obvious questions im supposed to hustle home go fetch the gold from a casket fight off some snakes somehow find a dealer wholl swap me gold for cash and then figure out a way to smuggle a half a million bucks back here into jamaica where ill fork it over to some crooked customs agents and police wholl then set you free that pretty well sum it up nathan it does and hurry okay i think youre crazy we shook hands were partners reed you figure out a way to do it and youll be a rich man how many dominoes are we talking about between five and six hundred whats gold worth these days two days ago it was trading for fifteen hundred bucks an ounce i do the math and say thats between seven and a half and eight million bucks nathan is nodding he does the math every day of his life as he watches the price fluctuate there is a loud knock on the door behind me and one of the jailers appears times up mon he says then disappears this is probably one of the stupidest things ill ever do in my life i say or maybe one of the smartest nathan replies but please hurry reed i cant survive long we shake hands and say goodbye my last visual of nathan is a battered little man trying to stand in pain rashford and i leave in a hurry he drops me off at my hotel where i run to my room and call vanessa shes in the attic where its degrees picking through old cardboard boxes and broken furniture its not there i announce its outside in the storage shed hang on she says as she climbs down the retractable ladder has he told you she asks between breaths yes someones here she says and through the phone i hear a loud doorbell chime vanessa ducks low in the hallway and reaches for the glock ill call you right back she whispers into the phone and turns it off its late sunday morning nathans truck is in his driveway assuming his friends would know he was away for the weekend the presence of his truck would raise questions the doorbell chimes again and someone starts pounding on the front door then he yells nathan you in there open up vanessa crouches but doesnt move the banging continues then someone else is knocking on the back door and yelling for nathan there are at least two of them with voices of young men no doubt friends of nathans who stopped by for some reason they show no signs of leaving one of them taps on his bedroom window but he cannot see inside vanessa eases into the bathroom and wipes her face her breathing is heavy and shes shaking with fear theyre pounding and yelling and will soon come to the conclusion that something is wrong with nathan theyll kick in a door instinctively vanessa strips down to her bikini panties dries the sweat off her body leaves the glock near the bathroom sink and steps to the front door she opens it widely and the young man gets a most unexpected treat her brown breasts are large and firm her body athletic and toned his eyes drop from her chest to the panties pinched together to reveal as much flesh as possible then he catches himself shes smiling and saying maybe nathan is busy right now wow he says sorry theyre facing each other through a screen door neither in a hurry to leave over his shoulder he says hey tommy over here tommy arrives at the front door in a rush and cant believe his eyes vanessa says come on guys give us some privacy here okay nathans in the shower and were not finished with our business who shall i tell him stopped by she then realizes that in her haste she forgot to remove the latex gloves red panties aquamarine gloves neither can take his eyes off her breasts one says uh greg and tommy we uh were just sorta passing by both are entranced by her nakedness and baffled by the gloves what on earth has this gal been doing with our buddy ill be happy to tell him she says with a cute smile as she slowly closes the door through the window she watches as they back away still slackjawed and confused they finally get to their truck climb in and start laughing as they leave the driveway after theyre gone vanessa fixes a glass of ice water and sits at the kitchen table for a few moments shes rattled and ready for a meltdown but cannot afford one shes sick of the house and has serious doubts about the entire project but she has to go on im in the back of a cab headed for the airport when i see the call ive spent the last fifteen minutes imagining various scenes and conflicts inside nathans house none of them with good endings are you okay i ask yes just a couple of rednecks looking for nathan i got rid of them how ill tell you later did they see you oh yes its cool were fine wheres the stuff out back in the storage shed ill stay on the phone okay vanessa checks the driveway once more to make sure there are no more visitors then hurries out the back door and to the storage shed the dog is growling and barking frantically and i can hear him clearly in jamaica i cannot make myself warn her about the snakes so i silently pray that she does not encounter them digging through a grungy outbuilding is bad enough throw in the snakes and she might freak out and disappear when she steps into the shed she describes the interior she says its like an oven i relay nathans instructions and we sign off shell need both hands she moves two empty paint thinner cans kicks aside a burlap bag pushes the sears mower as far away as possible lifts a sheet of plywood and finds a rope handle its stuck so she yanks it harder and harder until the door opens there are no hinges so the entire trapdoor bolts from the floor and falls against the wall under it on the ground as advertised is a soiled bronze casket no more than four feet in length vanessa gawks at it in horror as if she has stumbled upon a crime scene and found some poor childs body but there is no time for fear or secondguessing no time to ask what in hell am i doing here she tries to lift the casket but it is too heavy she finds the latch twists and half of the top lid opens slowly mercifully there is no dead baby inside far from it vanessa pauses to study the collection of small wooden cigar boxes all sealed with a band of silver duct tape and for the most part stacked in rows sweat is dripping from her eyebrows and she tries to swipe at it with a forearm carefully she removes one of the boxes and steps outside under the shade of an oak glancing around seeing no one nothing but the dog whos tired of barking and growling vanessa peels off the tape opens the box and slowly removes a layer of wadded newspaper minibars little bricks dominoes an entire casket full of them millions upon millions she removes one and examines it a perfect rectangle not quite a half inch thick lined with a tiny border ridge that allows for precise stacking and storage on the front side is stamped ounces and under that and nothing elseno bank name no indication of where it came from or who mined it no registration number using a prepaid credit card i pay for an air jamaica flight to san juan puerto rico it leaves in an hour so i find a bench near my gate and kill time staring at my cell phone before long it lights up and vibrates vanessa says hes not lying talk to me love to baby we now own eighteen cigar boxes filled with these gorgeous little gold minibars havent counted them all yet but there must be at least five hundred i take a deep breath and feel like crying this project has been on the drawing board for over two years and during most of that time the odds of a successful outcome were at least a thousand to one a series of loosely connected events had to fall perfectly into place were not yet at the finish line but we are in the homestretch i can smell the barn between five hundred and six hundred i say according to our boy hes earned the right to be trusted where are you at the airport i bought a ticket made it through customs and ill board in an hour so far no problems where are you im leaving this dump ive loaded up the good stuff and put everything back in its place the house is locked dont worry about the house hell never see it again i know i gave his dog a whole sackful of food maybe someone will check on him get away from that place im leaving now just follow the plan and ill call when i can chapter its almost eleven sunday morning july a hot clear day with little traffic around radford vanessa wants to avoid another encounter with anyone who might see nathans pickup truck and get suspicious she heads north on the interstate past roanoke into the heart of the shenandoah valley driving as cautiously as humanly possible with the needle stuck on seventy miles per hour and every lane change properly telegraphed with a turn signal she watches the rearview mirror because its now such a habit and she watches every other vehicle to avoid any chance of a collision on the passengers floorboard and on the seat next to her there is literally a fortune in gold a fortune in unmarked and untraceable ingots freshly stolen from a thief who stole them from a crook who took them from a gang of thugs how could she explain such a collection of precious metal to a nosy state trooper she could not so she drives as perfectly as possible as the wheelers roar by in the left lane she exits at a small town and drifts until she finds a cheap dollar store the banner across the front windows advertises prebacktoschool specials she parks near the entrance and spreads a soiled blanket taken from nathans over the cigar boxes she puts the glock under a corner of the blanket next to her and analyzes the parking lot its virtually empty on a sunday morning finally she takes a deep breath gets out locks the truck and hurries inside in less than ten minutes vanessa buys ten kids backpacks all with a desert storm camouflage motif she pays in cash and does not respond when the cashier quips must have a lot of kids heading back to school she shoves her purchases into the cab of the truck and heads back to the interstate an hour later she finds a truck stop near staunton virginia and parks next to the rigs when shes certain that no one is watching she begins to quickly stuff the cigar boxes into the backpacks two of which are not used she fills up the tank eats lunch from a fastfood drivethrough and kills time roaming up and down interstate as far north as maryland and as far south as roanoke the hours drag by she cannot park and leave the jackpot it has to be guarded at all times so she flows with the traffic while she waits on darkness im pacing in a crowded and humid wing of the san juan airport waiting on a delta flight to atlanta my ticket was purchased in the name of malcolm bannister and his old passport worked just fine it will expire in four months the last time it was used dionne and i escaped on a cheap cruise to the bahamas another lifetime i call vanessa twice and we speak in code got the goods packages are fine shes moving around following the plan if a spook somewhere is listening then hes scratching his head at we finally board and then sit for an hour in the sweltering cabin as a howling storm pounds the airport and the pilots go mute at least two babies are squalling behind me as tempers rise i close my eyes and try to nap but i have deprived myself of sleep for so long i have forgotten how to doze off instead i think of nathan cooley and his hopeless situation though i have little sympathy i think of vanessa and smile at her toughness under pressure we are so close to the finish line but there are still so many ways to fail we have the gold but can we keep it i wake up as we lurch forward and begin rumbling down the runway two hours later we land in atlanta at passport control i manage to avoid the counters manned by black customs agents and instead pick a beefy young white boy who seems to be bored and indifferent he takes my passport glances at a nineyearold photo of malcolm bannister quickly compares it to the revised face of max reed baldwin and sees nothing unusual we all look the same i am assuming customs has by now notified the fbi that i left the country two days earlier on a private jet bound for jamaica what i dont know is whether the fbi is still monitoring any possible movements by malcolm bannister im betting they are not and i want the fbi to think im still somewhere in the islands having a grand time at any rate im moving quickly since malcolm no longer has a valid drivers license max rents a car at the avis desk and fortyfive minutes after landing in atlanta im leaving the city in a hurry near roswell georgia i stop at a walmart and pay cash for two more prepaid cell phones as i leave the store i drop two old ones into a trash can after dark vanessa parks the truck for good shes been driving it for almost twelve hours and cant wait to get rid of it for a moment she sits behind the wheel in a space next to her honda accord and watches a commuter airliner taxi to the roanoke terminal its a little after on a sunday night and there appears to be no traffic the parking lot is almost empty she takes another deep breath and gets out working quickly while watching everything around her she transfers the backpacks from nathans front seat into the trunk of her car eight backpacks each seemingly heavier than the one before it but she does not mind at all she locks the truck keeps the keys and leaves the parking lot if things go as planned nathans truck will not be noticed for several days when his friends realize hes missing they will eventually notify the police who will find the truck and start piecing together a story theres no doubt nathan boasted to someone that he was headed to miami on a private jet and this will cause the cops to chase their tails for a while i have no way of knowing if the authorities can link their missing man to nathaniel coley the clown who recently left town with a fake passport four kilos of coke and a pistol but i doubt it he might not be located until someone down in jamaica finally allows him to make a phone call whom he calls and what he tells that person is anyones guess he is more likely to count the hours and days until i return with a sackful of cash and start bribing people after weeks maybe a month hell realize his old pal reed stiffed him took the money and ran i almost feel sorry for him at am i approach asheville north carolina and see a sign for the motel at a busy interchange parked behind it and out of view is a little blue honda accord with my dear vanessa sitting behind the wheel the glock at her side i park next to her and we step inside our firstfloor room we kiss and embrace but we are much too tense to get amorous we quietly unload her trunk and toss the backpacks on one of the beds i lock the door chain it and stick a chair under the doorknob i pull the curtains tight then hang towels from the rods to cover the slits and cracks and make certain no one can see inside our little vault while i do this vanessa takes a shower and when she emerges from the bathroom she is wearing nothing but a short terrycloth bathrobe that reveals miles and miles of the prettiest legs ive ever seen dont even think about it she says shes exhausted maybe tomorrow we empty the backpacks put on disposable latex gloves and make a neat arrangement of eighteen cigar boxes each secured with two precise bands of silver duct tape we notice two have apparently been opened with the tape cut along the top and we set them aside using a small penknife i cut the tape on the first canister and open the box we remove the minibars count themthirtythen put them back inside and retape the lid vanessa scribbles down the quantity and we open the second one it has thirtytwo minibars all shiny perfectly sized and seemingly untouched by human hands beautiful just beautiful she says over and over it will last for centuries forever i say rubbing a minibar wouldnt you love to know what part of the world it came from she laughs because well never know we open all sixteen of the sealed boxes then inventory the minibars from the two that had previously been opened they held about half the number as the others our total is with gold fluctuating around an ounce our jackpot is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of million we lie on the bed with the gold stacked between us and its impossible not to smile we need a bottle of champagne but at on a monday morning in a cheap motel in north carolina champagne does not exist there is so much to take in here at this moment but one of the more glorious aspects of our project is that no one is looking for this treasure other than nathan cooley no one knows it exists we took it from a thief one who left no trail seeing touching and counting our fortune has energized us i yank off her bathrobe and we crawl under the covers of the other bed try as we may its difficult to make love without keeping one eye on the gold when we finish we collapse with exhaustion and sleep like the dead chapter at monday morning agent fox walked into the large office of victor westlake and said the jamaicans are as slow as ever nothing much to add baldwin arrived late friday night on a jet chartered from a company in raleigh a nice plane that is currently being seized by jamaican customs and cant come home no sign of baldwin his friend nathaniel coley tried to enter with a fake passport and is now locked up just like the airplane hes in jail westlake asked chewing on a thumbnail yes sir thats all i can get as of now dont know when he might be getting out im trying to get the police to check hotel records to find baldwin but theyre hesitant to do so hes not a fugitive they dont like to piss off the hotels it was the weekend et cetera find baldwin trying sir whats he up to fox shook his head it makes no sense why burn that much cash on a private jet why travel with someone using a fake passport who the hell is nathaniel coley weve done a search in virginia and west virginia and found no possible hits maybe coley is a good friend who cant get a passport and they were trying to beat customs so they can play in the sun for a few days maybe maybe you got it sir keep digging and report back by email yes sir im assuming he left his car behind at the roanoke airport he did in the parking lot of the general aviation terminal same florida license plates we found it saturday morning and have it under surveillance good just find him okay and if we do just follow him and figure out what hes doing over coffee and gold we plan our day but we do not linger at nine vanessa turns in the key at the front desk and checks out we kiss goodbye and i follow her out of the parking lot careful not to crowd the rear bumper of her accord on the other side of it hidden deep in the trunk is half the gold the other half is in the trunk of my rented impala we separate at the interchange shes going north and im going south she waves in the rearview mirror and i wonder when ill see her again as i settle into the long drive tall coffee in hand i remind myself that the time must be spent wisely no foolish daydreaming no mental loafing no fantasies about what to do with all the money so many issues vie for priority when will the police find nathans truck when do i call rashford watley and instruct him to pass along the message to nathan that things are proceeding as planned how many of these cigar boxes will fit into the bank lockboxes i leased a month ago how much of the gold should i try to sell at a discount to raise cash how do i get the attention of victor westlake and stanley mumphrey the us attorney in roanoke and most important how do we get the gold out of the country and how long might it take instead my mind drifts to thoughts of my father old henry who hasnt had contact with his younger son in over four months im sure hes disgusted with me for getting busted out of frostburg and shipped off to fort wayne im sure hes puzzled by the absence of correspondence hes probably calling my brother marcus in dc and my sister ruby in california to see if theyve heard anything i wonder if henrys a greatgrandfather yet courtesy of marcuss delinquent son and his fourteenyearold girlfriend or did she get the abortion on second thought maybe i dont miss my family as much as i sometimes think it would be nice though to see my father though i suspect he will not approve of my altered looks truth is theres a good chance ill never see any of them again depending on the whims and machinations of the federal government i could remain a free man or i could spend the rest of my life as a fugitive regardless ill have the gold as the miles pass and i cling to the speed limit while trying to avoid getting hit by the big rigs i cant help but think of bo ive been out of prison for four months now and every day ive fought the urge to dwell on my son its too painful to think i may never see him again but as the weeks go by i have come to accept this reality reuniting with him in some fashion would be the first huge step down the road to normalcy but my life from now on will be anything but normal we could never again live together under the same roof as father and son and i see no benefit to bo of knowing that im suddenly around and would like to have an ice cream twice a month im sure he still remembers me but the memories are certainly fading dionne is a smart lovely woman and im sure she and her second husband are providing a happy life for bo why should i a virtual stranger and a guy who certainly looks like one pop into their world and upset things once i convinced bo i was really his father how would i rekindle a relationship thats been dead for over five years to stop this torment i try to focus on the next few hours then the next few days crucial steps lie ahead and a screwup could cost me a fortune and possibly send me back to prison i stop for gas and a vendingmachine sandwich near savannah and two and a half hours later im in neptune beach my old temporary stomping ground at an office supply store i purchase a heavy thick briefcase then drive to a public parking area for the beach there are no security cameras and no foot traffic and i quickly open the trunk remove two of the cigar boxes and place them in the briefcase it weighs about forty pounds and as i walk around the car i realize its too heavy i remove one container and return it to the trunk four blocks away i park at first coast trust and nonchalantly walk toward the front door the digital thermometer on the banks rotating billboard reads ninetysix degrees the briefcase gets heavier with each step and i struggle to act as though it contains nothing but some important papers twenty pounds is not a lot of weight but its far too much for a briefcase of any size every step is now being captured on video and the last thing i want is the image of me lumbering into the bank with a heavy satchel i worry about vanessa and her efforts to access her lockboxes in richmond with such a burden on her shoulder heavy as it is i cant help but smile at the astonishing weight of pure gold inside i wait patiently for the vault clerk to finish with another customer when its my turn i give her my florida drivers license and sign my name she checks my face and my handwriting approves and escorts me to the vault in the rear of the bank she inserts the house key into my lockbox and i insert my own noises click perfectly the box is released and i carry it to a narrow private closet and close the door the clerk waits outside in the center of the vault the lockbox is six inches wide six inches tall and eighteen inches long the largest available when i leased it a month ago for one year at per i place the cigar box inside vanessa and i labeled each one with the exact number of minibars this one has thirtythree or ounces roughly i close the box admire it kill a few minutes then open the door and report to the clerk part of her job is to remain aloof with no suspicions whatsoever and she does it well i suppose shes seen it all twenty minutes later im in the vault at a branch of the jacksonville savings bank the vault is larger the lockboxes smaller the clerk more suspicious but everything else is the same behind a locked door i gently place another stash of minibars into the box thirtytwo gorgeous little ingots worth another half a million bucks at my third and final bank not a half mile from the first one i make the last deposit of the day then spend an hour looking for a motel where i can park just outside my room in a mall on the west end of richmond vanessa wanders through a highend department store until she finds the ladies accessories though she acts calm she is all nerves because her accord is alone out there in the parking lot just waiting to be vandalized or stolen she selects a chic red leather shoulder bag large enough to be called luggage its designer is wellknown and it will probably be noticed by the female clerks who run the banks she pays cash for it and hustles back to her car two weeks earlier maxshe had always known him as malcolm but she liked the new name betterhad instructed her to rent three lockboxes she had carefully selected the banks around richmond made the applications passed the screenings and paid the fees then as instructed she had visited each one twice to deposit useless paperwork and such the vault clerks now recognized her trusted her and were not the least bit suspicious when ms vanessa young showed up with a killer new bag and needed access to the vault in less than ninety minutes vanessa safely stashes away almost million in gold bullion she returns to her apartment for the first time in over a week and parks in a space she can see from her secondfloor window the complex is in a nice part of town near the university of richmond and the neighborhood is generally safe she has lived here for two years and cannot remember a stolen car or a burglary nevertheless she is taking no chances she inspects the doors and windows for signs of entry and finds none she showers changes clothes then leaves four hours later she returns and in the darkness she slowly methodically hauls the treasure into her apartment and hides it under her bed she sleeps above it the glock on the night table every door locked and latched and jammed with a chair she drifts in and out and at dawn shes sipping coffee on the sofa in the den watching the weather on local cable the clock seems to have stopped she would love to sleep some more but her mind will not allow her body to surrender her appetite is gone too though she tries to choke down some cottage cheese every ten minutes or so she walks to the window and checks the parking lot the early morning commuters leave in shifts the banks do not open until she takes a long shower dresses as if shes going to court packs a bag and takes it to her car over the next twenty minutes she removes three of the cigar boxes from under the bed and takes them to her car these she will soon deposit in the same three lockboxes she visited the day before the great debate raging in her mind is whether the remaining three canisters will be safer in the trunk of her car or in her apartment under the bed she decides to play it both ways and leaves two at home while taking another one with her vanessa calls with the news that shes made her third and final deposit of the morning and is headed to roanoke to see the lawyer im ahead of her by a step or two i visited my three banks a bit earlier made the deposits and am now driving to miami we have tucked away of the minibars its a good feeling but the pressure is still on the feds can and will seize all assets under the right circumstances and even the wrong ones so we can take no chances i have to get the gold out of the country i am assuming the feds do not know vanessa and i are working together i am also assuming they have yet to link nathan cooley to me im making lots of assumptions and have no way of knowing if they are correct chapter stalled in construction traffic near fort lauderdale i punch in the numbers to mr rashford watleys cell phone down in montego bay he answers with a warm laugh as if weve been friends for decades i explain im safely back home in the us and life is swell fortyeight hours ago i was sneaking out of jamaica after saying goodbye to both nathan and rashford terrified i would be stopped by uniformed men before boarding the flight to puerto rico i am stunned at how fast things are happening i repeatedly remind myself to stay focused and think about the next move rashford has not visited the jail since sunday i explain that nathaniel has hatched a scheme to start bribing people down there and is having delusions about my returning with a boxload of cash ive made a few calls and it seems as if the boy has a long history with cocaine still cant believe the idiot would attempt to smuggle in four kilos cant begin to explain the gun a moron rashford agrees and says he chatted with the prosecutor yesterday monday if rashford can work his magic our boy is looking at about twenty years in the jamaican prison system frankly rashford advises he doesnt think nathaniel will survive long in the system based on the beatings hes received his first two nights in jail hell be lucky to live a full week we agree that rashford will visit the jail this afternoon and check on nathaniel i ask him to pass along the message that i am hard at work securing his release the visit to his home went as planned and all things are proceeding as discussed as you wish rashford says i paid his fee so hes still working for me technically i hope its our last conversation vanessa once again makes the threeandahalfhour drive from richmond to roanoke and arrives promptly for a pm meeting with dusty shiver attorney for quinn rucker when she called to schedule the appointment she promised to have in her possession crucial evidence about quinns case dusty was intrigued and attempted to pry over the phone but she insisted on a meeting as soon as possible she is dressed fashionably in a skirt short enough to get attention and she carries a smart leather attache dusty jumps to his feet when she enters his office and offers a chair a secretary brings in coffee and they manage some strained small talk until the door is closed for good ill get right to the point mr shiver she says quinn rucker is my brother and i can prove hes innocent dusty absorbs this and allows it to rattle around the room he knows quinn has two brothersdee ray and tall manand a sister lucinda all have been active in the family business he now remembers that there was another sister who has not been involved and has never been mentioned quinn is your brother he repeats almost mumbling yes i left dc a few years ago and have kept my distance okay im listening lets hear it vanessa recrosses her legs and dusty maintains eye contact she begins a week or so after quinn walked away from the camp at frostburg he almost overdosed on cocaine in dc we the family knew he would kill himself with the stuffquinn was always the heaviest userand we intervened my brother dee ray and i drove him to a rehab facility near akron ohio a tough place for serious addicts there was no court order so they couldnt lock him down but thats basically what happens at this facility quinn had been there for twentyone days when the bodies of judge fawcett and his secretary were found on february she lifts a file from her briefcase and places it on dustys desk the paperwork is all here because he had just escaped from prison he was admitted under an assumed namemr james williams we paid a deposit of in cash so the rehab facility was happy to go along they didnt ask a lot of questions they gave him a complete physical exam complete blood work so theres dna proof that quinn was there at the time of the murders how long have you known this i cannot answer all of your questions mr shiver there are many secrets in our family and not many answers dusty stares at her and she coolly returns his look he knows he will not learn everything and at the moment its not that important he has just won a major victory over the government and he is already laughing why did he confess why does anyone confess to a crime they didnt commit i dont know quinn is severely bipolar and has other problems the fbi hammered him for ten hours and used all the dirty tricks at their disposal knowing quinn he was playing games he probably gave them what they wanted so they would leave him alone maybe he fabricated a tall tale so they would run around in circles trying to verify it i dont know remember the lindbergh baby kidnapping the most famous kidnapping in history ive read about it sure well at least people confessed to that crime it makes no sense but then quinn can be crazy at times dusty opens the file there is a report of each day quinn was in rehab from january through february the monday they found the bodies of judge fawcett and naomi clary it says here he left the facility on the afternoon of february dusty says reading thats right he walked away or escaped and made his way to roanoke and why might i ask did he go to roanoke again mr shiver i cant answer a lot of questions so he shows up in roanoke the day after the bodies are found goes to a bar gets drunk gets in a fight gets arrested and hes got a pocketful of cash there are a lot of gaps here miss yes there are and with time the gaps will be filled in right now though its not that important is it whats important is that you have clear proof of his innocence other than the bogus confession the government has no evidence against my brother right thats correct theres no physical evidence just a lot of suspicious behavior such as why was he in roanoke how did he get there where did he get all that cash where did he buy the stolen guns lots of questions miss but i suppose you dont have the answers right correct dusty locks his hands behind his head and stares at the ceiling after a long silent gap he says ill have to investigate this you know ill have to go to the rehab center interview the people there take affidavits and such the feds are not about to roll over until our file is much thicker and we can hit them over the head with it ill need another without hesitation she says ill discuss it with dee ray the pretrial conference is in two weeks so we need to move fast id like to file a motion to dismiss the charges before the conference youre the lawyer another pause as dusty leans forward on his elbows and looks at vanessa i knew judge fawcett well we werent friends but friendly acquaintances if quinn didnt kill him any idea who did she is already shaking her head no the police found nathans truck at the general aviation area of the roanoke regional airport late tuesday morning as expected his employees at the bar became concerned monday when he didnt show and by late afternoon they were making calls they finally contacted the police who eventually scoured the airport nathan had boasted of flying to miami on a private jet so the search was not difficult at least for his truck finding it did not automatically indicate foul play and the police were in no hurry to start a manhunt a quick background check on the name revealed the criminal record and this did nothing to create sympathy there was no family screaming for the lost loved one a computer search and a few phone calls revealed that nathan had purchased the brandnew chevy silverado two months earlier from a dealer in lexington virginia an hour north of roanoke on interstate the selling price was and nathan had paid in cash not the kind of cash often referred to when one writes a check but hard cash an impressive stack of bills unknown to the car dealer or the police or anyone else for that matter nathan had found himself a gold trader i finally find one myself after two trips into the vault of the palmetto trust in southcentral miami i still have in my possession in the trunk of my rented impala exactly fortyone of the precious little minibars value of about i need to convert some of them to cash and to do so i am forced to enter the shady world of gold trading where rules are pliant and adjusted on the fly and all characters have shifty eyes and speak in doubletalk the first two dealers lifted from the yellow pages suspect im an agent of some variety and promptly hang up the third one a gentleman with an accent which im quickly learning is not unusual in the trade wants to know how i came to possess a tenounce bar of seemingly pure gold its a long story i say then hang up number four is a small fry who pawns appliances out front and buys jewelry in the back number five shows some potential but of course will have to see what ive got i explain that i do not want to walk into his store because i do not wish to be caught on video he pauses and i suspect hes thinking about getting robbed of his cash at gunpoint we eventually agree to meet at an ice cream shop two doors down from his store in a shopping center in a good part of town hell be wearing a black marlins cap thirty minutes later im sitting in front of a double pistachio gelato hassan a large graybearded syrian is across from me and working on a triple chocolate fudge twenty feet away is another swarthy gentleman whos reading a newspaper eating frozen yogurt and probably ready to shoot me if i show the slightest sign of causing trouble after we try and fail at small talk i slide over a crumpled envelope inside is a single gold bar hassan glances around but the only customers are young moms and their fiveyearolds along with the other syrian he takes the minibar into his thick paw squeezes it smiles taps it slightly on the corner of the table and mumbles wow this he manages without the slightest hint of an accent i am amazed at how soothing that simple expression is i have never thought about the gold being fake but to have it legitimized by a pro is suddenly refreshing you like huh i say stupidly just trying to get something out very nice he says easing the bar into the envelope i reach over and take it he asks how many lets say five bars fifty ounces gold closed yesterday at an ounce so i know the price of gold he interrupts of course you do do you want to buy five bars a guy like this never says yes or no instead he mumbles talks in circles hedges and bluffs he says it is possible and it certainly depends on the price what can you offer i ask but not too eagerly there are other gold dealers left in the yellow pages though im running out of time and weary of the coldcalling well that depends mr baldwin on several things one must assume in a situation like this that the gold is of shall we say the blackmarket variety i dont know where you got it and dont want to know but there is a reasonable chance it was shall we say extracted from its previous owner does it really matter where are you the registered owner of this gold mr baldwin he asks sharply i glance around no of course not therefore the blackmarket discount is percent this guy doesnt need a calculator ill pay an ounce he says softly but firmly as he leans forward his beard partially covers his lips but his accented words are clear for five bars i ask fifty ounces assuming the other four are of the same quality they are identical and you have no registration records paperwork nothing correct mr baldwin thats right and i want no records now a simple deal gold for cash no receipts no paperwork no videos nothing i came and went and vanished in the night hassan smiles and offers his right hand we shake the deal is done and we agree to meet at nine the following morning at a deli across the street one with booths where we can do our counting in private i leave the ice cream parlor as if ive committed a crime and repeat to myself what should be obvious to wit it is not against the law to buy and sell gold at discounted prices or at inflated ones this is not crack were peddling on the street nor is it inside information from a boardroom its a perfectly legitimate transaction right anyone watching hassan and me would swear they were observing two crooks negotiating a crooked deal who could blame them at this point i am beyond caring im taking risks but i have no choice hassan is a risk but i need the cash getting the gold out of the country will require risks but leaving it here could mean losing it i spend the next two hours shopping at discount stores i buy random items such as backgammon sets small toolboxes hardback books and three cheap laptop computers i haul my goods into a groundlevel motel room south of coral gables and spend the rest of the night tinkering packing and sipping cold beer from the laptops i remove the hard drives and the batteries and manage to replace them with three of my little bricks inside each hardback i stuff one minibar wrapped in newspaper and aluminum foil then bind it tightly with duct tape in the toolboxes i leave the hammer and screwdrivers but remove everything else four minibars fit nicely into each one the backgammon sets hold two bars without feeling suspicious using supplies from fedex ups and dhl i carefully package my goods as the hours pass and im lost in another world i call vanessa twice and we replay our days shes back in richmond doing the same thing im doing were both exhausted physically and mentally but we encourage each other to keep going now is not the time to slow down or get careless at midnight i finish and admire my handiwork on the credenza there are a dozen overnight packages all sealed and properly air billed efficientlooking not the least bit suspicious and together holding thirtytwo minibars worth roughly for international shipments the paperwork is tedious and i am forced to fudge on the contents the sender is mr m reed baldwin of skelter films in miami and the recipient is the same guy at sugar cove villas number willoughby bay antigua my plans are to be there to receive them if they arrive at their destination without incident vanessa and i will probably try similar shipments in the near future if something goes wrong well make new plans shipping like this is another risk the packages might be searched and confiscated the gold could be stolen somewhere along the way however im reasonably confident it will find its new home i remind myself were not shipping banned substances here im too wired to sleep and at am i turn on the lights and my laptop and fiddle with the email it is to mr stanley mumphrey us attorney southern district of virginia and mr victor westlake fbi washington the current draft reads dear mr mumphrey and mr westlake im afraid ive made a grave mistake quinn rucker did not kill judge raymond fawcett and ms naomi clary now that im out of prison it has taken me several months to realize this and to identify the real killer quinns confession is bogus as you probably know by now and you have zero physical evidence against him his attorney dusty shiver now has in his possession clear proof of an airtight alibi that will clear quinn so prepare yourselves for the reality of dropping all charges against him sorry for any inconvenience it is imperative that we talk as soon as possible i have a detailed plan of how to proceed and only your total cooperation will lead to the apprehension and conviction of the killer my plan begins with the promise of complete immunity for myself and others and it ends with the precise result that you desire working together we can finally resolve this matter and bring about justice i am out of the country and have no plans to return ever sincerely malcolm bannister chapter typically sleep is fleeting in fact it is so elusive and fitful im not sure i slept at all there is so much to do that i find myself drinking bad coffee and staring at the television long before the sun rises finally i shower dress load the overnight packages into my car and hit the empty streets of miami in search of breakfast at nine hassan rumbles into the deli with a brown paper sack as though hes been to the grocer for a few items we huddle in a booth order coffee and while we dodge the waitress we do the counting his job is far easier than mine he caresses the five minibars before dropping them into the inside pockets of his wrinkled blazer i poke into the brown bag and struggle to count stacks of bills ten per stack its all there he says watching out for the waitress a hundred and twentytwo thousand dollars when im satisfied i close the bag and try to enjoy the coffee twenty minutes after he arrives he leaves i wait awhile then head for the door nervously expecting a swat team to assault me as i hustle to my car i keep for the trip and stuff into two remaining backgammon sets at a fedex shipping office i wait in line with five overnight packages and watch intently as the customers in front of me go about their business when its my turn the clerk examines the air bills and nonchalantly asks whats inside household items some books nothing of real value nothing to insure i respond the words carefully rehearsed i have a place on antigua just sprucing it up a bit she nods as if shes really interested in my plans for standard business delivery three days guaranteed the bill comes to and i pay with a prepaid credit card as i leave the lobby and leave the gold behind i take a deep breath and hope for the best using the rental cars gps i locate a ups office and go through the same procedure i return to palmetto trust and it takes an hour to get into my lockbox i leave behind the rest of the cash and the four remaining minibars it takes a while to find the dhl shipping desk in the sprawl of miami international but i eventually negotiate my way there and drop off more packages i finally part with my impala at an avis station and take a cab to the general aviation section of the airport far away from the main terminal there are blocks of private aircraft hangars and charter companies and flight schools and my driver gets lost as we search in vain for an outfit called maritime aviation it needs a larger sign because the one currently in use can hardly be seen from the nearest street and im tempted to bark this at the clerk when i walk in the door i manage to bite my tongue and relax there is no scanner to examine me or my luggage and i assume private aircraft terminals are not equipped with these machines i expect to be scanned at some level upon my arrival in antigua so im playing it safe i have about in cash with most of it hidden in my luggage and if they dig through it and get excited ill play dumb and pay the fine i was tempted to try to smuggle in a gold bar or two to see if it can be done but the risk is greater than the reward at the pilots say its time to board and we crawl inside a learjet a small jet about half the size of the challenger nathan and i enjoyed briefly during our recent trip to jamaica the can perhaps seat six people but fullsized men would be shoulder to shoulder instead of a restroom there is an emergency potty under a seat its cramped to say the least but who cares its far cheaper than a big plane but just as fast im the only passenger and im in a hurry max baldwin on board here with proper documentation malcolm bannister has been retired for the final time im sure customs will eventually notify some spook within the fbi and after some puzzlement hell report to his boss theyll rub their chins and wonder what baldwin is doing whats his thing with private jets why is he spending all his money a lot of questions but the big one is still what the hell is he doing they will have no clue unless i tell them as we taxi away from the terminal i quickly review the email to mumphrey and westlake then i press send it is july four months ago i left frostburg and two months ago i left fort carson with a new face and name as i try to recall these past few weeks and put them into perspective i begin to nod off when we reach our altitude of forty thousand feet i fall asleep two hours later i am awakened by turbulence and look through the window we are streaking over a summer thunderstorm and the small jet is getting bounced around one of the pilots turns around and gives me a thumbsupeverythings okay if you say so pal minutes later the sky is calm again the storm is behind us and i gaze down at the beautiful waters of the caribbean according to the navscreen on the bulkhead in front of me we are about to pass over st croix in the us virgin islands there are so many beautiful islands down there and so much variety when i was in prison i kept hidden in the library a fodors guide to the caribbean a thick reference book with two dozen color photos maps lists of things to do and brief histories of all the islands i dreamed that i would one day be loose in the caribbean alone with vanessa just the two of us on a small sailboat drifting from island to island in complete and unrestrained freedom i do not know how to sail and ive never owned a boat but that was malcolm today max is starting a new life at fortythree and if he wants to buy a skiff learn to sail and spend the rest of his life drifting from beach to beach who can stop him the plane jolts slightly as the engines cut back a notch i watch the captain ease down on the throttles as we begin a long descent theres a small cooler by the door and i find a beer we pass over nevis and st kitts in the distance those two islands have attractive banking laws too and i considered them briefly back when i was at frostburg and had plenty of time to dwell on my research i considered the cayman islands but learned that they are now terribly overbuilt the bahamas are too close to florida and filthy with us agents puerto rico is a territory so it never made any of my lists st barts has traffic jams the us virgins have too much crime jamaica is where nathan now resides i chose antigua as my first base of operations because there are seventyfive thousand people almost all black like me not overcrowded but not sparsely populated either its a mountainous island with beaches one for each day or so say the brochures and web sites i chose antigua because its banks are notoriously flexible and known to look the other way and if for some reason the island displeases me ill be quick to move along there are too many other places to see we slam onto the runway and screech to a halt the captain turns around and mouths the words sorry about that pilots take great pride in their smooth landings and this guy is probably embarrassed as if i care the only thing that matters right now is a safe exit from the plane and a smooth entry into the country there are two other jets at the private terminal and fortunately a large one has just landed at least ten adult americans in shorts and sandals are heading into the building to get processed i stall long enough to fall in behind them as the immigration and customs agents go through their routines i realize there are no scanners for the private passengers and their bags excellent i say goodbye to the pilots outside the small building i watch the other americans load into a waiting van and disappear i sit on a bench until my cab appears the villa is on willoughby bay twenty minutes from the airport i ride in the back of the cab windows down warm salty air blowing in my face as we twist around one side of a mountain and slowly descend the other in the distance there are dozens of small boats moored in a bay resting on blue water that seems perfectly still it is a furnished twobedroom condo in a cluster of the same not directly facing the beach but close enough to hear the waves break its leased in my current name and the threemonth rental was covered by a skelter films check i pay the cabdriver and walk through the front gate of sugar cove a pleasant lady in the office gives me the key and a booklet on the ins and outs of the unit i let myself in turn on the fans and airconditioning and check out the rooms fifteen minutes later im in the ocean at precisely pm stanley mumphrey and two of his underlings gathered around a speaker in the center of a conference room table within seconds the voice of victor westlake came on and after quick hellos westlake said so stan what do you make of it stanley whod been thinking of nothing else since receiving the email four hours earlier replied well vic it seems to me that we first need to decide whether were going to believe this guy again dont you think i mean he admits he got it wrong the last time he doesnt admit to lying to us but instead says he just made a mistake hes playing games it will be hard to trust him again westlake said do you know where he is right now mumphrey asked he just flew from miami to antigua on a private jet last friday he flew from roanoke to jamaica on a private jet then reentered the country sunday as malcolm bannister any idea what hes doing with all these weird movements not a clue stan were baffled hes proven himself quite adept at disappearing and at moving money around right i have a scenario vic suppose he lied to us about quinn rucker maybe rucker is part of the scheme and he played along so bannister could get himself out of prison now theyre trying to save ruckers ass sounds like a conspiracy to me lying conspiracy what if we pop them with a sealed indictment scoop up bannister and throw him back in jail then see how much he knows about the real killer he might be more talkative from the other side of the bars so you believe him now westlake asked didnt say that vic not at all but if his email is true and if dusty shiver has an alibi then were screwed with this prosecution should we talk to dusty we wont have to if hes got the evidence well see it soon enough one thing i cant figure out one of many is why they sat on the evidence for so long same here westlake said one theory were floating is that bannister needed the time to find the killer if of course we are to believe him frankly i dont know what to believe at this point what if bannister knows the truth we have nothing on our end we dont have a shred of physical evidence the confession is shaky and if dusty has a smoking gun then were all about to eat a bullet mumphrey said lets indict them and squeeze them ill call in the grand jury tomorrow and well have an indictment within twentyfour hours how much trouble will it be grabbing bannister in antigua a pain in the ass hell have to be extradited could take months plus he might vanish again this guy is good let me talk to the boss before you call in the grand jury okay but if bannister wants immunity then it sounds as though hes committed a crime and wants a deal right westlake paused a second then said its pretty rare for an innocent man to ask for immunity it happens but not very often what crime are you thinking about nothing definite but well find one racketeering comes to mind im sure we can bend rico to fit these facts conspiracy to impede the judicial process lying to the court and the fbi come to think of it the indictment is growing the longer we talk im getting pissed vic bannister and rucker were pals at frostburg and cooked up this scheme rucker walked away in december judge fawcett was killed in february and now it looks like bannister fed us a bunch of crap about rucker and his motives dont know about you vic but im beginning to feel as though weve been duped lets not overreact here the first step is to determine if bannister is telling the truth okay and how do we go about doing that lets wait on dusty and see what he has in the meantime ill talk to my boss lets chat again tomorrow you got it chapter at a tobacco store in downtown st johns i see something that freezes me then makes me smile its a box of lavos an obscure cigar hand wrapped in honduras and costing twice as much in the states the fourinch torpedo model sells for in antigua and at the downtown roanoke tobacco store called vandys smokes it was there that judge fawcett routinely purchased his favorite brand on the bottom side of four of the fourteen lavo boxes we now have stashed in banks there are white square stickers advertising vandys with phone number and street address i buy twenty of the lavo torpedoes and admire the box its made of wood not cardboard and the name appears to have been hand carved across the top judge fawcett was known to drift around lake higgins in his canoe puffing on lavos while fishing and enjoying the solitude evidently he saved the empty boxes the cruise ships have not arrived yet so downtown is quiet merchants sit in the shade outside their shops chatting and laughing in their seductive lilting version of the kings english i drift from shop to shop oblivious to time i have gone from the stultifying tedium of prison life to the jolting madness of tracking a killer and his loot to thisthe languid pace of island living i prefer the latter for obvious reasons but also because it is now the present and the future max is a new person with a new life and the baggage is quickly falling by the wayside i buy some clothes shorts and tshirts beach stuff then wander into my bank the royal bank of the east caribbean and flirt with the cute girl working the front desk she directs me on down the line and i eventually present myself to the vault clerk she studies my passport then leads me into the depths of the bank during my first visit nine weeks ago i rented two of the largest lockboxes available alone with them now i leave some cash and worthless papers and i wonder how long it will be before they are filled with little gold bars i flirt on the way out and promise to be back soon i rent a convertible beetle for a month put the top down fire up a lavo and begin a tour of the island after a few minutes i feel dizzy i cant recall the last time i smoked a cigar and im not sure why im doing so now the lavo is short and black and even looks strong i toss it out the window and keep driving fedex wins the race the first packages arrive monday around noon and because i have been anxiously roaming the grounds of sugar cove i see the truck when it pulls up miss robinson the pleasant lady who runs the office has by now heard the full version of the fiction i am a writerfilmmaker holed up in her villas for the next three months working desperately to finish a novel and a screenplay based on said novel my partners meanwhile are already filming preliminary scenes blah blah blah therefore i am expecting approximately twenty overnight packages from miami manuscripts research memos videos even some equipment she is visibly impressed im really looking forward to the day when i can stop lying inside my villa i open the boxes a backgammon set yields two bars a toolbox four a hardback novel one and another backgammon set two a total of nine all apparently untouched during their journey from miami to antigua i often wonder about their history who mined the gold from which continent who minted it how did it get into this country and so on but i know these questions will never be answered i hustle into st johns to the royal bank of the east caribbean and put the precious ingots to rest my second email to messrs westlake and mumphrey reads hey guys its me again shame on you for not responding to my email of two days ago if you want to find judge fawcetts killer then you need to work on your communication skills im not going away ill bet your initial reaction is to trump up some bogus indictment and come after me and quinn rucker you cant help this because you are after all the feds and its just your nature what is it about our prosecutorial system that makes guys like you want to put everyone in jail its pathetic really i met dozens of good people in prison men who wouldnt physically harm anyone and men who would never screw up again yet thanks to you theyre serving long sentences and their lives are ruined but i digress forget another indictment you cant make the charges stick not that that has ever slowed you down but there is simply no section of your vast federal code that you can possibly use against me more important you cant catch me do something stupid and ill disappear again im not going back to prison ever i have attached to this email four color photographs the first three are of the same cigar box a dark brown wooden box handcrafted somewhere in honduras into this box a worker carefully placed twenty lavos a strong black rich nearlethal cigar with a cone tip the box was shipped to an importer in miami and from there sent to vandys smokes in downtown roanoke where it was purchased by the honorable raymond fawcett evidently judge fawcett smoked lavos for many years and kept the empty boxes perhaps you found a few when you searched the cabin after the murders i have a hunch that if you check with the owner of vandys hell be well acquainted with judge fawcett and his rather rare taste in cigars the first photo is of the box as it would appear in a store its almost a perfect fiveinch square and five inches in heightunusual for a cigar box the second photo is a side shot the third is of the boxs bottom clearly showing the white sticker of vandys smokes this box was taken from judge fawcetts safe shortly before he was executed it is now in my possession i would give it to you but the killers fingerprints are most certainly on it and id hate to ruin the surprise the fourth photo is the reason were all at the table it is of three tenounce gold ingots perfect little minibars without the slightest hint of registration or identification more about this later these little dudes were stacked thirty to a cigar box and tucked away in judge fawcetts safe so one mystery is now solved why was he murdered someone knew he had a pot of gold the big mystery though still haunts you the killer is still out there and after six months of bumbling stumbling goose chasing puffing posturing and lying you do not have a clue come on guys give it up lets cut a deal and close this file your friend malcolm victor westlake canceled yet another dinner with his wife and at pm friday walked into the office of his boss the director of the fbi mr george mctavey two of mctaveys assistants stayed in the office to take notes and fetch files they gathered around a long conference table all exhausted from another interminable week mctavey had been fully briefed so there was no need to cover old territory he began with his trademark is there anything that i dont know this question could always be anticipated and it had damned well be answered truthfully yes westlake replied lets hear it the spike in the price of gold has created a huge demand for the stuff so were seeing all sorts of scams every pawnbroker in the country is now a gold trader so you can imagine the crap thats being bought and sold we ran an investigation last year in new york city involving some rather established traders who were melting gold diluting it then passing it along as basically pure no indictments yet but the case is not closed in the course of this an informant who worked for a dealer got his hands on a tenounce bar with no id stamped on it ninetynine point nine percent pure really fine stuff and an unusual price he dug around and found out that a man named ray fawcett came in from time to time and sold a few bars at a slight discount for cash of course we have a video of fawcett in the store on fortyseventh street back in december two months before he was murdered apparently he drove to new york a couple times a year did his trading and drove back to roanoke with a sackful of cash the records appear to be incomplete but based on what we have it looks as though he sold at least worth of gold over the past four years in new york city there is nothing illegal about this assuming of course the gold was rightfully owned by fawcett interesting but i showed bannisters photo of the gold to our informant in his words they are identical bannister has the gold how much we have no way of knowing the cigar box checks out the gold checks out assuming he got the gold from the killer then he certainly knows the truth and your theory is malcolm bannister and quinn rucker served together at frostburg and they were closer friends than we realized one of them knew about fawcett and his stash of gold and they planned their racket rucker walks away from prison goes into rehab for his alibi and they wait for the killer to strike he does and their plan suddenly becomes operational bannister squeals on rucker who gives a bogus confession which leads to an immediate indictment and bannister walks once hes out he goes through witness protection leaves it somehow finds the killer and the gold wouldnt he have to kill the killer to get his gold westlake shrugged because he had no idea maybe but maybe not bannister wants immunity and were betting hell also demand a rule release for rucker quinn has five more years on his original sentence plus a few extra for the escape if youre bannister why not try to get your buddy out if the killer is dead then rule might not work for quinn i dont know the lawyers are downstairs scratching their heads thats always comforting mctavey said whats the downside of dealing with bannister we dealt with him last time and he lied to us okay but what does he gain by lying now nothing he has the gold mctaveys tired and worried face suddenly became jovial he chuckled threw his hands into the air and said beautiful brilliant i love it we gotta hire this guy because hes a lot smarter than we are talk about a set of balls he gets his dear friend indicted for the capital murder of a federal judge and he knows the entire time he can get it unraveled and walk him out are you kidding me we look like a bunch of fools westlake couldnt help but join in the fun he smiled and shook his head in disbelief mctavey said hes not lying vic because he doesnt have to lies were important earlier during the first phase of the project but not now now its time for the truth and bannister knows the truth westlake nodded in agreement so whats our plan wheres the us attorney on this whats his name mumphrey hes squawking about another indictment but its not going to happen does he know everything of course not he doesnt know that we know fawcett was selling gold in new york im having brunch with the ag in the morning ill explain what were doing and hell get mumphrey in line i suggest the two of you meet with bannister as soon as possible and tie up the loose ends im really tired of judge fawcett vic know what i mean yes sir chapter i wait for another delayed flight inside the sweltering terminal of v c bird international airport but im not the least bit annoyed or anxious by now my fourth day on antigua my wristwatch is in a drawer and im on island time the changes are subtle but i am slowly purging my system of the frenetic habits of modern life my movements are slower my thoughts uncluttered my goals nonexistent im living for today and casting an occasional lazy eye at tomorrow other than that dont bother me mon vanessa looks like a model when she bounces down the steps of the commuter flight from san juan a straw hat with a wide brim designer shades a summer dress that is delightfully short and the easy grace of a woman who knows shes a knockout ten minutes later were in the beetle and i have a hand on her thigh she informs me she has been fired from her job because of excessive time off and insubordination we laugh who cares we go straight to lunch at the great reef club on a bluff overlooking the ocean with a view that is hypnotic the crowd is wellheeled and british we are the only black diners though all of the staff is of our kind the food is just okay and we vow to search out the local joints so we can eat with real people i guess were technically rich but it seems impossible to think in those terms we dont necessarily want the money as much as we want the freedom and security i suppose well grow accustomed to a better life after a dip in the ocean vanessa wants to explore antigua we put the top down find a reggae station on the radio and fly along the narrow roads like two young lovers finally escaping rubbing her legs and watching her smile i find it difficult to fathom that we have made it this far i marvel at our luck the summit is at the blue waters hotel on the northwestern tip of the island i walk into the colonialstyle main house into the breezy lobby all alone i spot a couple of agents in bad tourist clothing as they sip sodas and try to appear innocuous a real tourist here has an easy casual look while a fed posing as a tourist looks like a misfit i wonder how many agents assistant attorneys deputy directors et cetera managed to wedge themselves into this quick little trip to the islands spouses included of course courtesy of uncle sam i walk through archways past gingerbread woodwork along picket fences to a wing where business can be done we meet in a small suite on the second level with a view of the beach i am greeted by victor westlake stanley mumphrey and four other men whose names i dont even try to remember gone are the dark suits and drab ties replaced by golf shirts and bermuda shorts though its early august most of the pale legs in the room have not seen the sun the mood is light ive never seen so many smiles in such an important gathering these men are elite crime fighters accustomed to hard humorless days and this little diversion is a dream for them i have one final nagging doubt that this could be a setup i could be walking into a trap with these boys ready to spring an indictment a warrant an extradition order and whatever else it might take to drag me back to jail in that event vanessa has a plan one that assures the protection of our assets she is two hundred yards away waiting there are no surprises weve talked enough on the phone to know the parameters and we get down to business on a speakerphone stanley places a call to roanoke to the office of dusty shiver who now represents not only quinn rucker but his sister vanessa and me when dusty is on the phone he makes some lame crack about missing all the fun down in antigua the feds roar with laughter we first review the immunity agreement which basically says the government will not prosecute me quinn vanessa young or denton rucker aka dee ray for any possible wrongdoing in the murder investigation of judge raymond fawcett and naomi clary it takes fourteen pages to say this but im satisfied with the language dusty has reviewed it too and wants a couple of minor changes from mumphreys office being lawyers they are required to haggle for a bit but eventually come to terms the document is redrafted in the room then signed and emailed to a federal magistrate on call in roanoke thirty minutes later a copy is emailed back with the magistrates approval and signature in a legal sense we are now teflon quinns freedom is a little more complicated first there is an order of dismissal that clears him of all charges relating to the murders and it contains some benign language inserted by mumphrey and his boys that attempts to soften the blame for their misguided prosecution dusty and i object and the language is eventually removed the order is emailed to the magistrate in roanoke and he signs it immediately next is a rule motion to commute his sentence and set him free it has been filed in the dc federal court from which he was sentenced for cocaine distribution but quinn is still in jail in roanoke i repeat what ive said several times already i will not complete my end of the deal until quinn has been released period this has been agreed upon but it takes the coordinated movements of several people with instructions now coming from the speck of an island nation known as antigua quinns sentencing judge in dc is on board but hes tied up in court the us marshals service feels the need to intrude and insists on moving quinn when the time comes at one point five of the six lawyers in my meeting are on their cell phones two while pecking away at laptops we take a break and vic westlake asks me to join him for a cold drink we find a table under a terrace beside a pool away from the others and order iced tea he feigns frustration with the wasted time and so on i am assuming hes wearing a wire of some variety and he probably wants to talk about the gold im all smiles the laidback antiguan now but my radar is on high alert what if we need your testimony at trial he asks gravely this has been discussed at length and i thought things were clear i know i know but what if we need some extra proof since he does not yet have the name of the killer or the circumstances this question is premature and its probably a warmup to something else my answer is no okay ive made that clear i have no plans to ever return to the us im seriously considering renouncing my citizenship and becoming a fullfledged antiguan and if i never set foot on us soil again ill die a happy man somewhat of an overreaction dont you think max he says in a tone i despise you now have full immunity that might be easy for you to say vic but then youve never spent time in prison for a crime you didnt commit the feds nailed me once and almost ruined my life its not going to happen again im lucky in that im getting a second chance and for some strange reason im a bit hesitant to subject myself to your jurisdiction again he sips his tea and wipes his mouth with a linen napkin a second chance sailing off into the sunset with a pot of gold i just stare at him after a few seconds he says a bit awkwardly we havent discussed the gold have we max no lets give it a go then what gives you the right to keep it i stare at a button on his shirt and say clearly i dont know what youre talking about i do not have any gold period how about the three minibars in the photo you emailed last week thats evidence and in due course ill give them to you along with the cigar box in the other photo i suspect these little exhibits are covered with fingerprints both fawcetts and the killers great and the big question will be wheres the rest of the gold i dont know okay you must agree max that it will be important to the prosecution of the killer to know what was in judge fawcetts safe what got him killed at some point well have to know everything perhaps you wont know everything you never will there will be ample evidence to convict this killer if the government botches the prosecution it will not be my problem another sip a look of exasperation then you dont have the right to keep it max keep what the gold i do not have the gold but speaking hypothetically in a situation like this it seems to me the loot belongs to no one its certainly not the property of the government it wasnt taken from the taxpayers you never had possession of it never had a claim youve never seen it and youre not sure at this point if it even exists it doesnt belong to the killer hes a thief as well he stole it from a public official who obtained it we assume through corruption and if you could possibly identify the original source of the loot and tried to return it those boys would either dive under a desk or run like hell its just out there sort of in the clouds like the internet owned by no one i wave my hands at the sky as i finish this wellrehearsed response westlake smiles because we both know the truth theres a twinkle in his eye as if he wants to laugh in surrender and say helluva job of course this doesnt happen we make our way back to the suite and are told that the judge in dc is still occupied with more important matters im not about to lounge around the table with a bunch of federal boys so i go for a walk on the beach i call vanessa tell her things are proceeding slowly and no i have not seen handcuffs or guns so far its all aboveboard quinn should be released soon she tells me dee ray is in dustys office waiting for their brother during his lunch break the judge who had sentenced quinn to seven years for trafficking reluctantly signed a rule order of commutation the day before he had chatted with stanley mumphrey victor westlake and his boss george mctavey and to underline the importance of what was before him the attorney general of the united states quinn was immediately taken from the jail in roanoke to the law offices of dusty shiver where he hugged dee ray and changed into some jeans and a polo one hundred and forty days after being arrested as a fugitive in norfolk virginia quinn is a free man its almost by the time all the orders and documents are properly signed examined and verified and at the last minute i step outside the room and call dusty he assures me weve got em by the throat all paperwork is in order all rights are being protected all promises are being fulfilled start singing he says with a laugh six months after i arrived at the louisville federal correctional institution i agreed to review the case of a drug dealer from cincinnati the court had badly miscalculated the term of his sentence the mistake was obvious and i filed a motion to get the guy released immediately with time already served it was one of those rare occasions in which everything worked perfectly and quickly and within two weeks the happy client went home not surprisingly word spread through the prison and i was immediately hailed as a brilliant jailhouse lawyer capable of performing miracles i was inundated with requests to review cases and do my magic and it took a while for the buzz to die down around this time a guy we called nattie entered my life and consumed more time than i wanted to give he was a skinny white kid whod been busted for meth distribution in west virginia and he was adamant that i review his case snap my fingers and get him out i liked nattie so i looked at his papers and tried to convince him there was nothing i could do he began talking about a payoff at first there were vague references to a lot of money stashed somewhere and some of it might be mine if i could only get nattie out of prison he refused to believe i could not help him instead of facing reality he became more delusional more convinced i could find a loophole file a motion and walk him out at some point he finally mentioned a quantity of gold bars and i figured he had lost his mind i rebuffed him and to prove his point he told me the entire story he swore me to secrecy and promised me half of the fortune if i would only help him as a child nattie was an accomplished petty thief and in his teenage years drifted into the world of meth he moved around a lot dodging drug enforcement agents bill collectors deputies with warrants fathers with pregnant daughters and pissedoff rivals from other meth gangs he tried several times to go straight but easily fell back into a life of crime he was watching his cousins and friends ruin their lives with drugs as addicts and convicted felons and he really wanted something better he had a job as a cashier in a country store deep in the mountains around the small town of ripplemead when he was approached by a stranger who offered him an hour for some manual labor no one in the store had ever seen the stranger nor would they ever again nattie was making an hour cash off the books and jumped at the chance to earn more after work nattie met the stranger at a prearranged spot and followed him along a narrow dirt trail to an aframe cabin wedged into the side of a steep hill just above a small lake the stranger introduced himself only as ray and ray was driving a nice pickup truck with a wooden crate in the back as it turned out the crate contained a fivehundredpound safe too much for ray to handle by himself they rigged a pulley with a cable over a tree branch and managed to wrestle the safe out of the truck onto the ground and eventually into the basement of the cabin it was tedious backbreaking work and it took almost three hours to get the safe inside ray paid him in cash said thanks and goodbye nattie told his brother gene who was in the vicinity hiding from the sheriff two counties away the brothers became curious about the safe and its contents and decided to investigate when they were certain ray had left the cabin they attempted to break in but were stopped by heavy oak doors unbreakable glass and thick dead bolts so they simply removed an entire window in the basement inside they could not locate the safe but did manage to identify ray riffling through some papers at a worktable they realized their neighbor was a bigshot federal judge over in roanoke there was even a newspaper article about an important trial involving uranium mining in virginia with the honorable raymond fawcett presiding they drove to roanoke found the federal courthouse and watched two hours of testimony nattie wore glasses and a baseball cap in case the judge might get bored and look around the courtroom there were plenty of spectators and ray never looked up convinced they were onto something the brothers returned to the cabin reentered through the basement window and again searched for the safe it had to be in the small basement because that was where nattie and the judge had left it one wall was lined with shelves and covered with thick law books and the brothers became convinced there must be a hidden space behind the wall they carefully removed each book looked behind it then replaced it it took some time but they eventually found a switch that opened a trapdoor once it swung open the safe was just sitting there at floor level waiting to be opened but that proved to be impossible because there was a digital keypad that of course required a coded entry they toyed with it for a day or two with no luck they spent a lot of time in the cabin but were always careful about not leaving a trail one friday gene drove to roanoke about an hour away went to the courtroom checked on the judge then hung around long enough for him to adjourn for the weekend or until am monday gene followed him to his apartment and watched him load his truck with what appeared to be a brown paper sack of groceries a cooler several bottles of wine a gym bag two bulky briefcases and a stack of books ray left his apartment alone and drove west gene called nattie and said ray was on his way nattie tidied up the cabin replaced the basement window swept away any boot prints in the dirt by the porch and climbed a tree fifty yards away sure enough an hour later judge fawcett arrived at the cabin unloaded his truck and promptly took a nap in a hammock on the porch as nattie and gene watched from the thick forest surrounding the aframe the following day a saturday judge fawcett dragged his canoe to the waters edge loaded two fishing rods and some bottled water fired up a short dark cigar and shoved off across lake higgins nattie watched him with binoculars while gene removed the window and hurried inside the cabin the trapdoor was open the safe was visible but it was closed and locked out of luck again gene quickly left the basement reinstalled the window and retreated to the woods the boys were determined to find out what was in the safe but they were also patient ray had no idea he was being watched and if he was adding to his treasure each week then there was no hurry for the next two fridays gene watched the exterior of the courthouse in roanoke but the judge worked late a federal holiday was approaching and they guessed the judge might get away for a long weekend according to the newspaper articles the bench trial was arduous and hotly contentious with a lot of pressure on judge fawcett they guessed correctly at pm friday the proceedings were adjourned until am the following tuesday gene watched as ray loaded up and headed for the lake alone the cabin was too deep in the mountains for electricity or gas thus it had no airconditioning or heating except for a large fireplace food and beverages were kept on ice in the cooler ray hauled back and forth when he needed lights to read by at night he cranked up a small gas generator outside the basement and its low muffled sound echoed through the valley usually though the judge was asleep by pm the basement was one room and one closet a narrow space with small double doors inside the closet ray stored stuff that appeared to be forgottenhunting clothes boots and a pile of old quilts and blankets gene cooked up the plan of hiding nattie in there for hours with the idea that through the tiniest of cracks in one of the doors he would be able to watch as the judge opened the safe and stashed away whatever it was he was hiding nattie at five feet seven and pounds had a long history of hiding in cracks and crevices though he was initially reluctant to spend the night in the closet the plan was revised yet again on the friday before columbus day judge fawcett arrived at his cabin around pm and took his time unloading the truck nattie was curled up in the basement closet virtually invisible amid the hunting clothes blankets and quilts he had a pistol in his pocket in the event things went wrong gene was watching from the trees also with a gun they were nervous as hell but also wildly excited as ray went about his business of settling in he lit a cigar and the entire cabin soon smelled of rich tobacco smoke he took his time talked to himself hummed the same song over and over and eventually hauled a bulky briefcase to the basement nattie was hardly breathing as he watched the judge remove a law book from a shelf flip the hidden switch and pull the trapdoor open he punched in the code on the keypad and opened the safe it was filled with cigar boxes he backed away and removed another cigar box from the briefcase he paused for a second lifted the lid and took out a beautiful little gold ingot he admired it caressed it then returned it to the box which he then placed carefully in the safe another cigar box followed then he quickly closed the safe programmed the code and closed the trapdoor natties heart was pounding so violently he worried about shaking the entire closet but he urged himself to stay calm as he was leaving the judge noticed the crack in the closet door and shoved it tight around pm he lit another cigar poured a glass of white wine and sat in a rocker on the porch to watch the sun fade over the mountains after dark he turned on the generator and puttered around the cabin until ten when he turned it off and went to bed as the cabin became still and quiet gene appeared from the woods and banged on the door who is it ray demanded angrily from inside gene said he was looking for his dog ray opened the door and they spoke through the screen gene explained he had a cabin about a mile away on the other side of the lake and his beloved dog yank had disappeared ray was not the least bit friendly and said he had seen no dogs in the vicinity gene thanked him and left when nattie heard the banging and the conversation upstairs he quietly sneaked out of the closet and left through a basement door he was unable to relock the dead bolt and the boys figured the judge would scratch his head and remain confused as to why the door wasnt properly locked by then they would be lost in the woods the judge would search and search but would find no signs of entry nothing missing and would eventually forget about it naturally the brothers were stunned at what they had learned and they began making plans to rob the safe it would require an altercation with the judge and probably violence but they were determined to follow through two weekends passed and the judge stayed in roanoke then three while watching the cabin and the judge gene and nattie had returned to their meth business because they were broke before they could get the gold they were busted by dea agents gene was killed and nattie went away to prison he waited five years before he strongarmed judge fawcett tortured naomi clary robbed the safe and executed both of them and who exactly is nattie westlake asks all six of the men are staring at me his name is nathan edward cooley and youll find him in the city jail in montego bay jamaica take your time hes not going anywhere might he also be known as nathaniel coley your friend with the fake passport thats him hes looking at twenty years in a jamaican prison so he might make this easy for you my hunch is that nattie will happily plead guilty to a life sentence in a us prison no parole of course anything to get out of jamaica offer him a deal and you wont have to bother with a trial there is a long pause as they catch their collective breath finally vic asks is there anything you have not thought of sure but id rather not share it with you chapter my storytelling talents hold them spellbound and for an hour they pepper me with questions i slog through the answers and when i start to repeat myself i get irritated give a bunch of lawyers the rich details of a mystery theyve lost sleep over and they cant help but ask the same question five different ways my low opinion of victor westlake is raised somewhat when he says thats it meetings over im going to the bar i suggest the two of us have drinks alone and we return to the same table by a pool we order beers and gulp them when they arrive something else he asks yes as a matter of fact there is something else something almost as big as the murder of a federal judge havent you had enough for one day oh yes but i have one parting shot im listening i take another swig and savor the taste if my time line is correct judge fawcett was accepting and hiding pure gold in the middle of the uranium trial the plaintiff was armanna mines a consortium of companies with interests around the world however the majority partner is a canadian company based in calgary and this company owns two of the five largest gold mines in north america the uranium deposits in virginia alone are worth an estimated billion but no one really knows for sure if a corrupt federal judge wants a few gold bars in return for a payoff of billion why not do it the company gave fawcett his jackpot he gave them everything they wanted how much gold westlake asks softly as though he doesnt want his own hidden mike to hear well never know but i suspect fawcett received around million in pure gold he cashed in here and there you have the informant in new york but well never know if it went elsewhere and traded on the black market nor will we ever know how much cash was in the safe when nathan finally got to it nathan might tell us indeed but dont count on it anyway the grand total is beside the point its a lot of money or gold and for it to travel from armanna mines into the somber chambers of the honorable raymond fawcett someone had to be the bagman someone arranged the deal and made the deliveries one of the lawyers probably im sure armanna had a dozen any clue none whatsoever but im convinced a massive crime has occurred with serious implications the us supreme court will hear the case this october and given the probusiness leanings of the majority its likely fawcetts gift to the uranium miners will stand that would be a shame wouldnt it vic a corrupt opinion becomes a law a huge mining company bribes its way past the statutory ban and is given carte blanche to wreck the environment of southern virginia why do you care youre not going back there or so you say my feelings are not important but the fbi should care if you launch an investigation the case could be seriously derailed so now youre telling the fbi how to run its business not at all but dont expect me to remain quiet have you heard of an investigative reporter named carson bell his shoulders sag as he looks away no new york times he covered the uranium trial and has followed the appeals i would make an incredible unnamed source dont do that max you cant stop me if you dont investigate im sure mr bell would love to front page and all that fbi coverup dont do it please give us some time you have thirty days if i hear nothing of an investigation then ill invite mr bell down for a week on my little island i drain my beer smack the table with my glass and get to my feet thanks for the drink youre just getting revenge arent you max one last shot at the government who says its my last i say over my shoulder i leave the hotel and hoof it down the long drive at the end vanessa appears in the beetle and we race away ten minutes later we park outside the private terminal grab our light bags and meet the maritime aviation crew in the lobby our passports are checked and we hustle toward the same learjet that brought me to antigua a week earlier lets get out of here i say to the captain as we climb on board two and a half hours later we land at miami international as the sun dips below the horizon the lear taxis to a customs office for reentry then we wait half an hour for a cab inside the main terminal vanessa buys a oneway ticket to richmond through atlanta and we hug and kiss goodbye i wish her good luck and she does the same i rent a car and find a motel at nine the next morning im waiting outside palmetto trust when the doors are unlocked my carryon bag has wheels and i roll it into the vault within minutes i extract in cash and three lavo cigar boxes containing eightyone minibars on my way out i do not mention to the vault clerk that i will never return the lease for the safedeposit box will expire in a year and the bank will simply rekey and rent it to the next guy i fight the early traffic and eventually make it to interstate going north in a hurry but careful not to get stopped jacksonville is six hours away the tank is full and i plan to drive without stopping north of fort lauderdale vanessa calls with the welcome news that her mission is accomplished she has retrieved the bullion hidden in her apartment emptied the three lockboxes in the richmond banks and is already headed for dc with a trunkful of gold i get stalled in construction traffic around palm beach and this ruins my plans for the afternoon the banks will be closed when i arrive at the jacksonville beaches i have no choice but to slow down and go with the flow its after six when i get to neptune beach and for old times sake i check into a motel ive used before it accepts cash and i park near my room on the ground level i roll the carryon inside and fall asleep with it on the bed with me vanessa wakes me at ten she is safely tucked away in dee rays condo near union station quinn is there and they are having a delightful reunion for this phase of the operation dee ray has broken up with his livein girlfriend and moved her out in his opinion she cannot be trusted she is not family and shes certainly not the first girl he has cast aside i pass along my request to hold the champagne for twentyfour hours wevanessa dee ray and iexpressed strong misgivings about quinn including his estranged wife in our plot a divorce looks likely and its best if she knows nothing at this point once again i find myself killing a few minutes in the parking lot of a bank first coast trust when the doors open at am i wander in as nonchalantly as possible pulling an empty carryon and flirting with the clerks just another sunny day in florida alone in the vault in a private stall i remove two lavos cigar boxes and place them gently into the carryon minutes later im driving a few blocks to a branch of jacksonville savings when that lockbox is empty i make my final stop at a wells fargo branch in atlantic beach by ten im back on interstate headed to dc with golden bricks in the trunk only the five i sold to hassan for cash have disappeared its almost midnight when i enter central dc i take a brief detour and drive along first street passing in front of the supreme court building and wondering what will be the final outcome of the momentous case of armanna mines v the commonwealth of virginia one of the lawyers or perhaps two or three of those involved in the case once defiled the chambers of a federal judge with their filthy bribes said bribes are now in the trunk of my car what a journey im almost tempted to park at the curb take out a minibar and toss it through one of the massive windows however better judgment prevails i circle union station follow the gps to i street then to the corner of fifth by the time i park in front of the building mr quinn rucker is bounding down the steps with the biggest smile ive ever seen our embrace is long and emotional what took so long he asks got here as fast as i could i reply i knew you would come bro i never doubted you there were doubts lots of them were both stunned at the fact that weve pulled it off and at that moment our success is overwhelming we embrace again and each of us admires how thin the other looks i comment that im looking forward to eating again quinn says hes tired of playing the lunatic im sure it comes natural i say he grabs my shoulders stares at my new face and says youre almost cute now ill give you the doctors name you could use some work ive never had a closer friend than quinn rucker and the hours we spent at frostburg hatching our scheme now seem like an ancient dream back then we believed in it because there was nothing else to hope for but deep down we never seriously thought it would work arm in arm we climb the steps and enter the condo i hug and kiss vanessa then reintroduce myself to dee ray i met him briefly years ago in the visitors room at frostburg when he came to see his brother but im not sure i would recognize him walking down a street it doesnt matter we are now blood kin our bonds solidified by trust and gold the first bottle of champagne is poured into four waterford flutesdee ray has expensive tastesand we chug it dee ray and quinn stick guns in their pockets and we quickly unload my car the party that follows would seem implausible even in a fantasy film with champagne flowing the gold bars are stacked ten deep in the center of the den floor all of them and we sit on cushions around the treasure its impossible not to gawk and no one tries to suppress the laughter since im the lawyer and the unofficial leader i commence the business portion of the meeting with some simple math we have before us little bricks were sold to a syrian gold trader in miami and are now resting safely in a bank vault on antigua the total taken from our dear pal nathan is worth roughly million pursuant to our agreement dee ray gets of the glowing little ingots his percent was earned by fronting the cash quinn was caught with for paying dustys legal fees for supplying the four kilos of nathans cocaine along with the pistol and the chloral hydrate i used to knock him out dee ray picked up quinn when he walked away from frostburg and he monitored nathans release from prison so we would know exactly when to start the project he also paid the deposit to the rehab center near akron for quinns phony cocaine problem dee ray is in charge of the yacht as hes getting drunker he hands over an itemized list of his expenses including the yacht and rounds it all off at an even were assuming a value of an ounce so we vote unanimously to award him another twenty bars no one is in the mood to quibble and when youre staring at such a fortune its easy to be magnanimous at some unknown and unknowable point in the future the remaining bars will be equally divided among quinn vanessa and me thats not important nowthe urgency is in getting the stuff out of this country it will take a long time to slowly convert the gold to cash but well worry about that much later for the moment we are content to pass the hours drinking laughing and taking turns telling our version of the events when vanessa replays the moment in nathans house when she stripped naked and confronted his buddies at the front door we laugh until its painful when quinn recounts the meeting with stanley mumphrey in which he blurted out the fact that he knew max baldwin had left witness protection and left florida he imitates mumphreys wildeyed reaction to this startling news when i describe my second meeting with hassan and trying to count stacks of bills in a busy coffee shop they think im lying the stories continue until am when were too drunk to go on dee ray covers the gold with a quilt and i volunteer to sleep on the sofa chapter we slowly come to life hours later the hangovers and fatigue are offset by the excitement of the task at hand for a young man who has lived on the fringes of an operation adept at smuggling illegal substances into the country the challenge of smuggling our gold out is light lifting for dee ray he explains that we are now avid scuba divers and he has purchased an astonishing collection of gear all of it stored in heavy official us divers brand nylon duffel bags each with a solid zipper and a small padlock we hustle around the condo removing masks snorkels fins regulators tanks weight belts buoyancy compensators gauges dry suits even spearguns none of which has ever been used it will be on ebay within a month the gear is replaced by an assortment of smaller us divers snorkel backpacks and dry bags all filled with gold minibars the weight of each bag is tested and retested by the men to see how much can be carried the bags are bulky and heavy but then they would be if filled with scuba gear in addition dee ray has accumulated a variety of luggage the sturdiest cases he could and all on rollers we place the gold in shoes shaving kits makeup bags even two small tackle boxes for deepsea fishing when we add a few items of clothing for the trip our bags and gear seem heavy enough to sink a fine boat the weight is important because we do not want to raise suspicion of much greater significance though is the fact that all bars are now packed under lock and key and safe or so we pray before we leave i take a look around the condo it is littered with diving gear and packing debris on the kitchen table i see empty lavo cigar boxes and have a twinge of nostalgia they served us well at ten a large van arrives and we load the scuba duffels and the luggage inside theres barely enough room for the four of us vanessa sits in my lap fifteen minutes later we pull in to a parking lot at the washington marina its piers are lined with slips and hundreds of boats of all shapes rock gently on the water the larger ones are at the far end dee ray points in that direction and tells the driver where to go the yacht is a sleek beautiful vessel a hundred feet long three decks high brilliant white and called rumrunner which seems vaguely appropriate it sleeps eight comfortably and has a crew of ten a month earlier dee ray chartered it for a quick cruise to bermuda so he knows the captain and the crew he calls them by name as we spill out and start grabbing bags two porters help with the scuba duffels and strain under the weight but then theyve dealt with serious divers before passports are collected by the steward and taken to the bridge quinns is fake and were holding our breath it takes an hour to inspect our quarters get ourselves situated and settle in for the ride dee ray explains to the deckhands that we want the scuba gear in our cabins because we are fanatical about our equipment they schlep it up from storage and haul it to our rooms when the engines come to life we change into shorts and congregate on the lower deck the steward brings the first bottle of champagne and a tray of shrimp we motor slowly through the harbor and into the potomac from passing boats we get some looks perhaps its unusual to see a yacht loaded with africanamericans this is a white mans game right the steward returns with all four passports and wants to chat i explain that i have just bought a place in antigua and were going down for a party he eventually asks what i do for a living in other words where is this money coming from and i tell him im a filmmaker when hes gone we toast my favorite actornathan cooley soon were in the atlantic and the coast fades away our cabin is large by boat standards which isnt very big at all with four pieces of luggage and two scuba duffels we have trouble moving about the bed though works fine vanessa and i have a quickie then sleep for two hours three days later we ease into jolly harbour on the west end of antigua sailing is serious business on the island and the bay is crowded with moored boats of all sizes we ease past them barely inching along leaving almost no wake as we take in the views of the mountains on all sides the big yachts are docked together at one of the piers and our captain slowly maneuvers the rumrunner into a slip between two other fine ships one about our size and the other much larger in this fleeting moment of living like the rich we find it impossible not to compare the lengths of the yachts we stare at the larger one and think who owns it what does he do where is he from and so on our crew scurries around to secure the boat and after the engines die the captain collects passports again and steps onto the pier he walks about a hundred feet to a small customs building goes inside and does the paperwork a week earlier when i was killing time and waiting on vanessa to arrive on antigua i sniffed around the dock at jolly harbour until a yacht arrived i watched the captain go to the customs building just as ours is doing now and more important i noted that no one from customs inspected the boat the captain returns everything is in order we have arrived on antigua with the gold and with no suspicions i explain to the steward that we want to move the scuba gear to my villa because it will be easier to use from there and while were at it well take the luggage as well well probably use the yacht to dive around the islands and for a long dinner or two but for the first day or so well stay at my place the steward is fine with this whatever we wish and calls for taxis while they are en route we help the deckhands unload our bags and duffels onto the dock its quite a pile and no one would suspect were hiding million in gold in luggage and scuba gear it takes three taxis to haul everything and as we load up we wave goodbye to the steward and the captain twenty minutes later we arrive at the villa in sugar cove when everything is inside we exchange high fives and jump in the ocean
