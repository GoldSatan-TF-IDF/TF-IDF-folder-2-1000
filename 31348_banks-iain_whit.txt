whit iain banks chapter one i was in my room reading a book i turned a page the curved shadow of one candlelit white surface fell over another and the action made a small sharp rustling noise in the silence suddenly a dizziness struck me and i was acutely aware of the papers thin dryness rough against the skin of my fingers and seemingly conducting some powerful disorienting energy from it to me i sat as if stunned for a moment while the unbidden memory of my first healing coursed through me suffused with the light of a distant season it was a hot summers day one of those close still afternoons when distant haze over the hills or across the plain might become thunder before the evening and stone walls and outcrops of naked rock will give off small bursts of sweet heated air when you walk close by my brother allan and i had been playing daringly far away from our home at the farm and daringly close to a main road we had been stalking rabbits in the fields and looking for birds nests in the hedgerows all without success i was five he a couple of years older we found the fox lying in a justcut field on the far side of the hedge from the road where cars and trucks roared past in the sunlight the animal was small and still and there was dried blood round its nose and mouth allan poked the foxs body with a stick and pronounced it long dead but i looked and looked and looked at it and knew that it could still live and so went forward and stooped and raised it up gathering its stiffened form into my arms and burying my nose in its fur allan made noises of disgust everybody knew foxes were covered in fleas but i felt the flow of life in me and in the animal a strange tension built in up me like a blessed opposite of bottledup anger germinating budding and blossoming then flowing out of me like a glowing beam of vitality and being i felt the animal quicken and stir in my hands in a moment it jerked and i set it down on the ground again it wobbled to its feet and shivered once looking shakily around it growled at allan and then leaped away vanishing into the ditch before the hedge allan stared at me wideeyed with what appeared to be horror and for all that he was the boy and two years my senior looked very much as though he was about to cry the muscles at the hinge of his jaws beneath his ears quivered spasming my brother dropped his stick shouted incoherently and then also ran off through the brindle stalks towards the farm i was left alone with a feeling of unutterable contentment later years later with the benefit of a more mature perspective on that vivid childhood instant i was to recall precisely or at least seem to what i had felt when id lifted the fox off the ground and troubled ask myself whether whatever gift i had could act at a distance the dizzying moment passed the turned page settled against those read before it memory the gift we all share and which certainly does act at a distance released me back to the present and though i didnt know it at the time what was the start of my own tale i shall introduce myself my name is isis i am usually called is i am a luskentyrian i shall begin my story properly the day salvador my grandfather and our founder and overseer received the letter which set in motion the various events described herein it was the first day of may and all of us in the order were already caught up in the preparations for the festival of love due to take place at the end of the month the quadrennial festival and especially the implications it would involve for me personally were much on my mind then and it was with a sense of impending relief and only a hint of guilt that i was looking forward to departing the community for my weekly walk to dunblane its cathedral and the flentrop organ our home lies in a loop of the river forth a number of miles upstream from the town of stirling the river rising from a confluence just above aberfoyle meanders like a brown rope the creator has dropped haphazardly across the ancient green floodplain which forms the eastern flank of scotlands pinched waist the river curves swerves doubles back and bows round again in a series of convoluted wriggles between the gargunnock escarpment to the south and the long shallow slope of collectively untitled hills to the north my favourite of which for its name alone is slymaback it passes through stirling itself swelling gradually and continues to snake its way to alloa where it broadens out further and begins to seem more like part of the sea rather than a feature of the land where it passes us the river is deep not yet tidal smoothly flowing unless in spate often soupy with silt and still narrow enough for a child to throw a stone all the way across from one muddy reeded bank to the other the pouch of raised land where we live is called high easter offerance the victorian mansion the older farmhouse its outbuildings and associated barns sheds and glasshouses as well as the various abandoned vehicles that have been pressed into service as additional accommodation storage or greenhouses together take up perhaps half of the fifty or so acres the rivers loop encompasses with the rest given over to a small walled apple orchard two goatcropped lawns a stand of scots pine and another of birch larch and maple and where the old estate slopes down to the river a nearencircling wilderness of weeds bushes muddy hollows giant hog weeds and rushes the community is approached from the south across a bowarched bridge whose two main girders each bears an unidentifiable coat of arms and the date the bridge was once quite capable of supporting a traction engine i have seen photographs but its wooden deck is now so thoroughly rotten there are numerous places where you can see through its eaten timbers to the swirling brown waters below a narrow pathway of roughly naileddown planks makes a pedestrian route across the bridge on the far side of the bridge set amongst the crowding sycamores on the raised bank opposite the community proper is the small turreted house where mr woodbean and his daughter sophi live mr woodbean is our gardener though the house he lives in belongs to him the estate of high easter offerance was gifted to my grandfather and the community by mr woodbeans mother on condition she and her descendants possessed title to the turret house i am fond of telling people sophi is a liontamer though her official title is assistant animal handler she works at the local safari park a few miles across the fields near doune beyond the woodbeans house the overgrown driveway winds through the trees and bushes to the main road there tall rustedshut iron gates look out over a semicircle of gravel where sophis morris minor sits when not elsewhere and the postmans van parks when he comes to deliver mail a single small gate to one side gives access to the dank treedark driveway within north behind the community where the coiling river almost meets itself at the drawstring of our enpursement the land dips towards the line of the old drymen to bridge of allan railway line which describes a long grassy ridge between us and the major part of our policies beyond a rich quilt of flat fertile arable land comprising some two thousand acres there is a gap in the old railway line where a small bridge long since removed had given access to the fields back when the line had been operational my route to the cathedral that mistbright monday morning would begin there but first i would break my fast our secular lives tend to centre around the long wooden table in the extended kitchen of the old farmhouse where the fire burns in the open range like an eternal flame to domesticity and the ancient stove sits darkly in one corner radiating heat and a comfortingly musty odour like an old and sleepy family dog at this point in the morning at this time of the year the kitchen is bright with hazy sunlight falling in through the broad extension windows and crowded with people i had to step over tam and venus playing with a wooden train set on the floor near the hall door they looked up when i entered the kitchen beloved isis tam piped buvid icesis the younger child said brother tam sister venus i said nodding slowly with mock gravity they giggled embarrassed then returned to their play venuss brother peter was arguing with his mother sister fiona about whether today was a bath day or not they too stopped long enough to greet me brother robert nodded from the open courtyard door lighting his pipe as he stepped outside to get the horses ready his nailed boots clicked across the flagstones clio and flora ran yelping and screaming around the table clio chasing her elder sister with a wooden spoon and followed by handyman the collie his eyes wide his long pink tongue flapping girls the girls mother gay said with weary exasperation looking up from the festive banners she was sewing then seeing me and wishing me good morning her youngest child thalia stood on the bench beside her gurgling and clapping her hands at the show her sisters were putting on the two children hurtled past me shrieking with the dog skittering across the tiles behind them and i had to lean back against the warm black metal of the stove the stove was built for solid fuel but now runs on methane piped in from the waste tanks buried in the courtyard if the fire with its giant black kettle swung over the flames is our neverextinguished shrine then the stove is an altar it is habitually tended by my stepaunt calliope usually known as calli a dark stocky denselooking woman with beetling black brows and a tiedback sheaf of thick hair still ravenblack without a trace of silver after her fortyfour years calli is particularly asian in appearance as though almost none of my grandfathers caucasian genes found their way to her gaiamarie she said when she saw me looking up from her seat at the table calli always refers to me by the first part of my name in front of her a knife glittered back and forward over the chopping block incising vegetables she rose i put out my hand and she kissed it then frowned when she saw my travelling jacket and my hat monday already she nodded sitting again it is i confirmed placing my hat on the table and helping myself to porridge from the pot on the stove sister erin was in earlier gaiamarie calli said returning to the slivering of the vegetables she said the founder would like to see you right i said thank you sister anne on breakfast duty left the toasting rack at the fire and fussed over me dropping a dollop of honey into my porridge and ensuring i got the next two bits of toast plastered with butter and slabbed with cheese a cup of strong tea followed almost immediately i thanked her and pulled up a seat beside cassie her twin paul was on the other side of the table they were deciphering a telephone scroll the twins are callis two eldest an attractive mixture of callis subcontinental darkness and the saxon fairness of their father my uncle brother james who has been performing missionary work in america for the last two years they are my age nineteen years they both rose from their seats as i sat down they quickly swallowed mouthfuls of buttered bread and said good morning then returned to their task counting the peaks on the long roll of paper converting them into dots and dashes and then gathering those into groups that represented letters a younger child is usually given the task of collecting the long scroll of paper from the woodbeans house each evening and bringing it back to the farm for deciphering this had been my duty for a number of years i am a few months younger than the twins and even though i am the elect of god i have quite properly been brought up to be humble in the sight of the creator and to learn some of that humility through the accomplishment of common simple tasks i recall my scrollcollection duties with great affection while the trip to the house on the far side of the bridge could be unpleasant in foul weather especially in the winter darkness carrying a windswung lantern across the decaying iron bridge with the swollen black river loud below i was usually rewarded with a cup of tea and a sweet or a biscuit in the woodbean household and there was anyway the fascination of just being in the house with its bright electric lights shining into the corners of the rooms and the old radiogram filling the sitting room with music from the airwaves or from records mr woodbean who is a sort of fellow traveller where our faith is concerned draws the line at television his concession to my grandfathers strictures on the modern world i was under instructions not to linger in the house longer than necessary but like most of us charged with the scroll run i found it hard to resist staying a while to soak in that shining beguiling light and listen to the strange distantsounding music experiencing that mixture of discomfort and allure younger luskentyrians commonly endure when confronted with modern technology this was also how i came to get to know sophi woodbean who is probably my best friend before even my cousin morag even though she lives mostly amongst the blands and like her father is what my grandfather would call only halfsaved cassie ticked off another group of signals and glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner it was almost six oclock unless the scroll looked like containing an especially urgent signal brother malcolm would be calling the twins away to their work in the fields soon where up to a dozen others of our order were probably already working at the far end of the table the primaryage youngsters were trying to eat at the same time as feverishly copying each others homework before uncle calum rang the bell for class to begin in the mansion house across the yard the secondaryschool children were almost certainly still asleep the bus which would stop at the end of the driveway to take them to the gerhardt academy at killearn wouldnt arrive for another hour and a half astar callis sister was likely busy supervising bedmaking and laundry collection while indra her son was probably to be found tinkering with some piece of pipework or joinery if not attending to the festive ale being prepared in the hopfragranced brewhouse in the barn beyond the courtyards western corner allan my elder brother was almost certainly already in the community office also across in the mansion house keeping the farm records up to date and giving sister bernadette or sister amanda letters to type i finished my breakfast gave the plates to brother giles who was on washingup duty that day said a general goodbye to all in the kitchen sister anne fussed over me and thrust an apple and a couple of pieces of haggis pakora wrapped in greaseproof paper into my pocket and crossed the yard to the mansion house the mist above was only faint the sky beyond clear blue steam rose from the wash house and sister veronique called out and waved to me a laundry basket piled and heavy on her hip i waved to her and to brother arthur holding one of the clydesdales while brother robert and brother robert b adjusted its harness the men called me over to look at the horse dubhe is the largest of our clydesdales but also the laziest the two roberts reckoned he was limping a little but werent sure i have a way with animals as well as people and if i have anything that can be said to resemble a duty in the community it lies in helping to soothe some of the pains injuries and conditions people and beasts are prone to we walked the horse round a little out of his harness and i clapped his flanks and held his head and talked to him for a while rubbing my face against his while his breath thundered out of his blackpink nostrils in haysweet clouds eventually he nodded once taking his huge head out of my grasp and then holding it high looking around i laughed hes fine i told the men i crossed to the mansion house this is the rather grand title given to the dwelling mr woodbeans father had built to supersede the original farmhouse at the turn of the century it is built of chiselled greypink sandstone rather than the rough undressed stone of the earlier building and its three storeys stand taller better lit and devoid of whitewash it was reduced to a burnedout shell some sixteen years ago in the fire that killed my parents but we have rebuilt it since inside brothers elias and herb two muscular american blonds were on their hands and knees buffing the hall floor the air was filled with the sharp clean smell of the polish elias and herb are converts who came to us after hearing about our community from brother james our missionary in america they both looked up and smiled the broad perfect smiles which they have assured us almost proudly it seemed to me cost their respective parents many thousands of dollars isis elias began beloved herb snorted glancing at me and rolling his eyes i smiled and gestured to elias to continue beloved isis elias grinned would you kindly cast some light into the poor occluded mind of our brother here on the matter of the coessential nature of the body and the soul ill try i said suppressing a sigh elias and herb seem to thrive on interminable debates concerning the finest points of luskentyrian theology points so fine indeed that they were almost pointless at the same time i have to admit to a certain feeling of gratification at having two such glowing examples of californian manhood both a couple of years older than i on their knees before me and hanging on my every word what i asked is the exact nature of your dispute elias shook his yellow duster at the other brother herb here contends that if the heresy of size is to be fully rejected then the soul or at least that part which receives the voice of the creator must effectively be the skeleton of the believer now it seems obvious to me that and on they went the heresy of size came about when a few of grandfathers original followers misunderstanding his teachings on the physicality of the soul decided that the bigger and fatter one was the larger a receiver one presented for gods signals and so the better one would hear gods voice perhaps the fact that salvador had filled out somewhat over the previous few years to become an impressive and substantial figure had something to do with the sizist heresy the disciples concerned had only known our founder as a big bulky man and did not know that his rotundity was entirely a result of both blissful inner peace and his wives extravagantly generous cooking had they been able to see photographs of salvador when he first appeared on the sisters doorstep when he was apparently quite skinny they might not have deceived themselves so while elias and herb argued on i nodded with all the appearance of patience and looked fleetingly round the woodpanelled hall hanging in the hall and on up the gleaming walls of the broad stairwell there are various paintings and one framed poster there is a portrait of the elder mrs woodbean our benefactress several landscapes of the outer hebrides and almost shockingly given the way grandfather feels about the contemporary media a bright purple and red poster advertising an event in something called the royal festival hall in london two years ago the poster publicises a concert on the instrument called the baryton to be given by the internationally renowned soloist morag whit and it is a measure of grandfather salvadors love of and pride in my cousin morag that he suffers such a garishly modern thing to be displayed so prominently in his sanctum cousin morag the jewel in the crown of our artistic missionary work was to be our guest of honour at the festival of love at the end of the month we are not a wealthy order indeed part of our attraction for outsiders has always been that we ask nothing from our followers save belief observance and if they come to stay with us honest toil all donations are politely returned but we are more than self sufficient and the farm produces a decent surplus each year part of which it pleases our founder to spend supporting missionary work brother james in america and sister neith in africa have saved many a soul over the last few years and we hope that brother topee currently at glasgow university will become our envoy to europe after he graduates and receives suitable instruction from salvador cousin morag is not a missionary as such but it is our hope that her fame as an internationally famous baryton soloist when combined with her espousal of our faith will help turn people to the truth additionally it has been morags expressed desire since the last festival of love to take a fuller part in this one and we were happy to hear a couple of years ago that she had met a nice young man in london and wanted to marry him at this years festival when elias and herb had both explained their positions i looked thoughtful and answered them as best i could as usual it was a dispute about nothing very much resulting from them making two subtly different but equally profoundly mistaken interpretations of grandfathers teachings i assured them that the answer would be found in their copies of the orthography if they only studied them properly i left them still looking puzzled and ascended quickly to the first floor before they could think of any supplemental questions that they would in any event i had no doubt and could only hope that they would have moved on to another part of the floor or a different and preferably quite distant task entirely when i descended again the rattle of the communitys ancient remington typewriter sounded from one of the old bedrooms now the office to the left at the top of the stairs i could hear my brother allans voice as i reached the landing where the floorboards creak allans voice cut off then i heard him say something else and while i was walking towards the double doors which led to my grandfathers quarters the office door opened and the broad flushedlooking face of sister bernadette poked out framed in crinkly red hair sis ah beloved isis brother allan would like a word well im a little late already i said clutching the handle of grandfathers anteroom and knocking on the door with the hand in which i was holding my travelling hat it wont take the door swung open before me and sister erin tall greying primly elegant and looking somehow as though shed been up for hours stood back to let me in sparing a small smile for sister bernadettes crestfallen face on the other side of the landing as she closed the door behind me good morning beloved isis she said gesturing me towards the door to grandfathers bedroom youre well i hope good morning sister erin yes i am well i said walking across the polished floor between the couches chairs and tables while sister erin followed outside beyond the partition at the courtyard windows which screens off grandfathers private kitchen i heard the school bell sound as brother calum called the children to their studies and you oh well enough erin said with a sigh it was hard not to suspect was fully supposed to sound longsuffering your grandfather had a good night and a light breakfast sister erin will insist on talking about grandfather as though he is a cross between royalty and a condemned prisoner admittedly he does encourage us all to treat him somewhat regally and at the age of seventyfive may not have all that long left with us but still oh good i said as ever at a loss to respond suitably to such portentousness i think hes had his bath erin said reaching round me to open the door to grandfathers suite she smiled thinly marjorie and erica she said crisply as i took off my shoes and handed them to her she hauled the door back the door opened to steps which led up onto the surface of grandfathers bed which is composed of six kingsize beds and two single beds squeezed hard up against each other and which entirely fills the bedroom itself save for a single raised table near the far wall the bed surface is covered with multitudinous quilts and duvets and several dozen pillows and cushions of varying shapes and sizes the curtains had not been drawn and in the gloom the bed looked like a relief map of a particularly mountainous area the air was thick with the smell of incense candles scattered everywhere along the single shelf which ran round the walls a few were still lit gurgling noises and voices came from a halfopen door ahead of me my grandfathers large round wooden bath lies in the spacious bathroom beyond his dressing room which is in turn beyond the bedroom the bathtub and its surrounding platform constructed for him by brother indra fills half the room the rest contains an ordinary bath a shower cabinet washhand basin toilet and bidet all supplied from a tank in the mansion house loft which is itself fed from our river waterwheel based on an ancient syrian design indra says via various filters including a raised slope of reedbed a tangle of pipes a methanepowered pump roofmounted solar panels and finally a methaneboosted hotwater tank immediately above the bathroom beloved isis chorused sister marjorie and sister erica marjorie who is three years my elder and erica who is a year younger than me wore peachcoloured shifts and were drying the bath with towels good morning sisters i said nodding i pushed through the double doors into the lush and fragrant space which grandfather calls the cogitarium a greenhouse which extends from the end of the mansion houses first floor and rests on the roof of the ballroom below where we hold our meetings and services the cogitarium was even warmer and more humid than the bathroom my grandfather his holiness the blessed salvadoruranos odin dyaus brahma mosesmohammed mirza whit of luskentyre beloved founder of the luskentyrian sect of the select of god i and the creators overseer on earth and patently unembarrassed when it came to bestowing extra and religiously significant names upon himself sat in a modest cane chair situated within a splash of sunlight at the far end of the greenhouse up a chessboardtiled path between the incrowding fronds of multitudinous ferns philodendrons and bromeliads grandfather was dressed as usual in a plain white robe the long whitely curled mane of his hair had been dried and with his dense white beard formed a nimbus round his head which seemed to glow in the misty morning sunlight his eyes were closed the leaves of the plants brushed at my arms as i walked up the path making a gentle rustling noise grandfathers eyes opened he blinked then smiled at me and how is my favourite granddaughter he asked i am well grandfather i said and you old isis he said smiling but well enough his voice was deep and sonorous he is a handsome man still for all his years with a powerful leonine face and skin that might grace a man half his age the only blemish on his face is the deep vshaped scar high on his forehead which is the original emblematic mark of our order that deep rich voice which rings out above us all when we sing during a service is identifiably scots though tinged with a hint of publicschool english and the occasional american vowel sound blessings to you grandfather i said and made our sign bringing my right hand up to my forehead and administering what might best be described as a slow tap salvador nodded slowly and indicated a small wooden seat by the side of his cane chair and blessings to you isis thank you for coming to see your old grandfather he put his right hand slowly up to the back of his head and winced its this neck again ah ha i said i put my hat down on the seat hed waved at and went to stand behind him putting my hands on his shoulders and starting to massage him he let his head drop a little as i kneaded his muscles my hands working across his smooth lightly tanned skin i stood there in the hazy sunlight its glowing warmth twicefiltered by mist and glass and ran my hands over my grandfathers shoulders and neck no longer massaging but simply touching i felt the strange welling itch inside myself that is the symptom of my power felt its tickle come rising through my bones and go tingling into and through my hands and knew that i still had my gift that i was healing i confess that a few times in such situations i have attempted to discover if touch is really necessary for my gift to work i have let my hands hover just over some afflicted animal or bodily part to see if mere proximity is sufficient to create the effect the results have been as my old physics teacher would have said indubitably ambiguous with animals i simply am not sure and with people well they can tell you arent touching them and touching is what they seem to expect for the gift to work i have always been coy about taking anybody into my confidence concerning the exact reason for my interest in this matter ah thats better grandfather said after a while i took a deep breath letting my hands rest on his shoulders all right very much so he said patting my right hand thank you child come now sit down i lifted my hat and sat on the wooden seat at his side off to play the organ are we he asked yes grandfather i said he looked thoughtful good he said nodding slowly you should do things you enjoy isis he told me and reached out to pat my hand you are being given the luxury of time to prepare for your role in the order once im gone oh grandfather i protested no more comfortable than usual with this line now now he said reasonably patting my hand again it has to happen eventually isis and im ready and i shall go happily when the time comes but my point is that you should use that time and use it not just to study and sit in the library and read i sighed smiling tolerantly i had heard this line of argument before but to live your life as young people need to to seize the opportunity to live isis there will be time enough to take on cares and responsibilities in the future believe me and i just dont want you to wake up one morning after im gone with all the weight of the community and the order on your shoulders and realise that you never had any time for enjoyment and freedom from cares while you were young and now its too late do you see i see grandfather ah he said but do you understand his eyes narrowed we all have selfish even animal urges isis they have to be controlled but they have to be given their due as well we ignore them at our peril you may make a better and more selfless leader of the order in the future if you behave a little more selfishly now i know grandfather i told him and put on my most winning smile but selfishness takes different forms too i indulge myself most shamelessly when im sitting reading in the library and going to play the flentrop he took a deep breath smiling and shaking his head well just never forget that youre allowed to enjoy yourself he patted my hand never forget that we believe in happiness here we believe in joy and love you are entitled to your share of those he let go of my hand and made a show of looking me up and down youre looking well young lady he told me youre looking healthy his grey abundant eyebrows flexed looking forward to the festival are we he asked his eyes twinkling i brought up my chin selfconscious beneath the blessed salvadors gaze i suppose i must describe myself at some point and now seems as good a time as any to get it over with i am a little above average height and neither skinny nor fat i keep my hair very short it grows in straight if allowed to it is surprisingly blonde for my complexion which has a hue roughly in keeping with my racial mix though in my vainer moments i confess i like to think i inherited a little more than my fair share of my grandmother aasnis highboned himalayan handsomeness my eyes are large and blue my nose is too small and my lips are too full they are also inclined to leave a slight gap through which my unremarkable teeth may be seen unless i deliberately keep my mouth firmly closed i believe i developed late physically a process that has at last ceased to my great relief my chest has remained relatively nonpneumatic though my waist has stayed narrow while my hips have broadened at any rate i have at last gone one full year without once being referred to at least in my earshot as boyish in aspect which is a blessing in itself i was dressed in a white shirt reversebuttoned of course narrow black trousers and a long black travelling jacket which matches my broadbrimmed hat my brother allan calls this my preacher look im sure were all looking forward to the festival grandfather i told him good glad to hear it he said so youre off to dunblane are you yes grandfather youll come round this afternoon he asked ive been having more thoughts about the redraft of course i said i had been helping grandfather with what we all suspected would be the final version of our good book the luskentyrian orthography which has been undergoing a kind of divinely sanctioned rolling revision ever since grandfather began the work in fine he said well have a good whatever it is you have playing an organ he said and smiled go with god isis dont talk to too many strangers thank you grandfather ill do my best im serious he said frowning suddenly ive had this feeling about reporters recently he smiled uncertainly was it a vision grandfather i asked trying to keep the eagerness out of my voice visions have been important to our faith from the beginning it all started with one which my grandfather had all those fortyseven years ago and it was the series of visions he had thereafter that guided our church through its early vicissitudes we believed in trusted and celebrated our founders visions though they had perhaps just with age as he had been the first to suggest become much less frequent and dramatic over the years he looked annoyed for a moment then wistful i wouldnt put it as strongly as a revelation or a vision or anything he said just a feeling you know i understand i said trying to sound soothing ill be careful i promise he smiled good girl i took my hat and left the cogitarium the sisters had left the bathroom looking dry and smelling clean i ascended into the upthrust landscape of the bedroom and crossed to the far side through the gloom i picked my boots up from the floor of the sitting room how is he this morning erin asked from her desk near the double doors as i did up my laces sister erin looked at my boots with an expression consistent with having seen something unpleasant on the soles in a jolly good mood id say i told her to be favoured with a wintry smile hey is allan said as we exited doors on either side of the landing at the same time my elder brother is tall and fit and fair both in hair and skin we share eyecolour though his are apparently more piercing he has a broad face and an easy confident grin his gaze is prone to darting about shifting all the time as he talks to you with that winning smile coming back to your eyes every now and again to make sure youre still listening and only zeroing in on you when he wants to convince you of his sincerity allan claims he clothes himself by way of the stirling charity shops like the rest of us though some of us have wondered quite how he seems to find perfectly fitting threepiece suits and smart blazers with such remarkable regularity if we occasionally ungraciously suspect him of vanity however we are content that when he travels outwith the community he favours frayed tatty country clothes that morning he wore a pair of faded jeans with a crease and a tweed jacket over a checked shirt good morning i said bernie said you wanted a word allan shrugged smiling oh it was nothing he said walking downstairs with me it was just we heard aunt brigit wouldnt be coming back for the festival thats all thought you could have mentioned it oh well thats a pity but youll see grandad today you tell him well yes but its just that he takes these things better from you doesnt he i mean youre the apple of his eye arent you eh sis he nudged me and favoured me with a sly grin as we reached the bottom of the steps the smell of polish lingered and the floor looked like an ice rink but elias and herb had departed if you say so i told him he held open the front door for me and i preceded him into the courtyard he pulled on his tweed jacket you off to dunblane i am right he nodded gazing up at the gauzy mist as we walked across the damp cobbles just thought id take a saunter out to the roadend he told me give whoevers on the postrun a hand he adjusted one shirt cuff expecting some fairly heavy parcels he explained hamper perhaps we do all our food shopping by post for somewhat ridiculous reasons i shall probably have to explain later there are hidden intricacies and interpretative choices associated with the postrun itself too we stopped facing each other in the centre of the courtyard hows ah hows the revision going he asked fine i told him he changing much allan asked dropping his voice so slightly he probably didnt realise he was doing it and unable to resist a furtivelooking glance at the mansion house not really i said allan looked at me for a moment i suspected he was debating with himself whether to be sarcastic apparently the decision went my way its just you know he said looking pained some of some of the others are a bit worried about what the old guy might be changing you make it sound like a will i smiled well allan nodded it is his legacy isnt it to us i mean yes i said but as i said he isnt changing much just tidyings up mostly so far weve spent most time explaining false signals the early selfheresies hes been trying to explain the circumstances behind them allan crossed his arms then put one hand to his mouth i see i see he said looking thoughtful still think all this will be ready come the festival he thinks so id imagine so my brother flashed a sudden smile well that sounds all right doesnt it id say so good well see you later i said go with god yes you too he smiled uncertainly and walked away i turned and headed out of the community chapter two the main buildings of high easter offerance form the shape of an h with one end walled off i went from the enclosed courtyard through the gateway into the open yard beyond where chickens clucked and jabbed at the ground and the wheeze of the bellows serving brother indras forge sounded from the blacksmiths shop i looked for indra but could not see him past the animal sheds and barns lay some of our collection of longimmobile vehicles half a dozen old coaches one doubledecker omnibus four pantechnicons a couple of flatbed lorries ten vans of varying capacities and one small rusting fireengine complete with brass bell not one is younger than twenty years old and all are so surrounded and in some cases invaded by weeds and plants it would probably take a tractor or a tank to rip them free even if their tyres and wheels were present and intact and their axles not rusted solid the vehicles shelter some of the less hardy crops for which there is not sufficient room in the glass houses to the south of the main buildings and provide extra dormitory and living accommodation or just additional dry storage space they also make a wonderful place to play when you are a child from there the road leads to the fields through the gap in the railway embankment where a singlespan bridge used to carry the railway above i struck off from the track there and ascended the grassy bank the raised bed of the old railway line was crossed by swollen bridges of golden mist slowly moving and changing in the cool morning sunlight and offering glimpses of our cattle sheep and wheat fields a group of saved digging out a ditch in the hazy distance helloed and waved and i flourished my hat at them as i walked i felt the usual feeling of calmness and dissociation creep over me perhaps enhanced on this occasion by the shining intermittently enveloping veils of mist cutting me off both from the community and the outer world i thought of grandfather salvador and his warning regarding reporters i wondered how serious he was being i have never doubted that our founder is a wise and remarkable man and possessed of insights that justifiably put him on the same level as the great prophets of old but as he himself has said god has a sense of humour who can look at the work that is man and deny this and my grandfather is not above reminding us of this by way of taunting our credulity still some of us trust a prophet the more when he admits to teasing us on occasion it has to be admitted that my grandfather suffers from a spasmodic obsession with the media and has done ever since the founding of our faith the trouble with the media and certain government agencies is that they are liable on occasion to refuse to be ignored getting away from most aspects of the modern world is simply a matter of avoiding them for example if one refuses to enter shops shopkeepers can generally be relied upon not to come and drag you in off the street but the media like the police or social workers are capable of coming to seek you out if they think they have just cause probably the worst time was during the early eighties when there were a number of socalled exposés in the press and a couple of television reports on what they were pleased to call our bizarre lovecult these were usually highly distorted pieces of nonsense about strange sex rituals disseminated by lapsed converts sad cases to a man who had found that the farm work in the order was too hard and gaining access to the female body rather less easy than they had heard or imagined the most worrying of these lies hinted at the involvement of community children in such practices and threatened the involvement of the authorities i was only a child at the time but i am proud that we responded as sensibly as we did educational inspectors and health workers confirmed that we primaryage hometaught children were better educated and healthier than most of our peers and secondary schoolteachers practically fell over themselves to praise the exemplary work and discipline of the community children who came to them we were also able to point out that no underage girl had ever fallen pregnant while in the care of our order reporters meanwhile were offered the chance to stay and work within our community for as long as they liked providing they brought a willingness to work for their keep notebooks rather than taperecorders and a sketch pad in place of a camera grandfather salvador himself was the epitome of openness and while politely deflecting questions about his upbringing and early history so concerned with the souls of the few reporters who did turn up that he took it upon himself to devote several extra hours each night to explaining his ideas and philosophy to them interest waned almost disappointingly quickly though one journalist did stay on for half a year i dont think we ever did trust her however and indeed it turned out she was only researching for a book on us apparently it was no more accurate than it was successfulluckily none of this prurient interest coincided with our fouryearly festival of love when things are more focusedly carnal and we do tend to behave a little more like the popular image we acquired then though i can honestly report that despite the fact i was fifteen years old at the time of the last one and physically sexually mature far from being involved in any way i was quite firmly excluded from the proceedings precisely because i had not reached the age of consent the outside world deemed appropriate at the time i felt a degree of annoyance and frustration although now that the next festival is almost upon us and i am liable to be as much one of the centres of attention as i desire i admit my feelings have changed somewhat at any rate we are always on guard whenever some new seeker after truth appears on our doorstep and whenever we venture outside the community my thoughts turned to my maternal grandmother yolanda we had been warned to expect one of her annual visits sometime over the next few weeks before the next festival of love yolanda is a sunweathered but leanly fit texan in her early sixties with no shortage of funds and a sharply colourful turn of phrase nervouser than a rattler in a room full of rockin chairs is one expression that has always stuck in my mind she joined our order at the same time as her daughter alice my mother though she has never stayed at the community for longer than a couple of weeks at a time save for two threemonth periods after first allan and then i were born perhaps because they are both such strong characters she has never entirely got on with salvador and over the last few years she has taken to staying at gleneagles hotel only twenty minutes from here the way yolanda drives and coming in each day to visit us when she organises selfhelp classes usually for women only it is to her that i owe whatever skills i possess when it comes to accurate longrange spitting texan legwrestling and prompt bodily selfdefence with special reference to the more vulnerable and sensitive parts of a man thanks to her i am also probably the only person in my neighbourhood to own a combined knuckle duster and bottle opener even if it does languish forever unused at the bottom of the underwear drawer in my bedroom i suspect yolanda has at least partially lost her faith she is untypically coy on the subject but i could not deny that i was looking forward to seeing her and experienced a pleasant glow of excitement at the prospect i thought too about allan and how he had changed over the past year since sister amanda had borne him mabon a son it was as though he had refined himself in his dealings with the rest of us and with me in particular treating us all somehow more formally less warmly as if his reserve of care and love was too drained by the demands made on it by amanda and the baby to spare us what we had come to think of as our due portion he seemed also to have developed a habit of asking me to deliver any bad news to our grandfather claiming as he had that morning that my elect status and perhaps my gender made salvador look more kindly upon me than him so increasing the chances he might accept illtidings with less equanimity and health threatening distress somewhat past the boundary of our land i tutted to myself and stopped a moment reaching into my pocket and taking out a small vial i opened it dipped my finger inside and smeared a little of the grey substance inside onto my forehead in a tiny vshape just under my hairline then replaced the vial and continued on my way the mark dried slowly in the humid air it was written with nothing more exotic than ordinary forth mud taken from the banks of the river where it rolls past the community just silt and quite likely largely cow silt and bull silt given the many herds farmed in fields upstream from us it marks us all with our founders stigmata and reminds us that our bodies come from and are destined for the common clay we imprint ourselves so for our own and not for others benefit certainly not to advertise ourselves but the mud anyway tends to dry a shade barely lighter than my skin and is often hidden by the halfinch of hair that hangs over it i strode along the old track alone in the drifting golden mist i negotiated the a by means of a muddy foot tunnel and the river teith via the broad curved top of an otherwise buried oil pipeline it was here by the side of the a id first healed that day allan and i found the fox lying in the field whenever i passed this spot i always looked for a fox and thought back to that high summer day to the feel of the animal in my hands and the smell of the field and the wide prizedopen eyes of my brother when id returned to the farm later sauntering back chewing on a length of straw id been taken straight to my grandfather hed shouted at me and made me cry for playing so close to the road then cuddled me and told me id obviously inherited a way with animals from my late father and if i ever brought anything else back to life i ought to let him know it might be that i had a gift ever since then ive been smoothing away aches and pains and limps and assisting at births in the byres and barns out of the numerous hamsters kittens puppies lambs kids and chicks ive been brought over the years by tearful children i think ive coaxed one or two back to life but i would be loath to swear to it and anyway it is really god who does the healing not i regardless still i wonder does it work at a distance my ability with people i am even more sceptical about even though i know that i certainly feel something when i lay my hands on them personally i am more inclined to believe it is their own faith in the creator that heals them rather than any real power of mine but i suppose it would be wrong to deny there is something mysterious going on and i hope that what i call humility in myself is not faintheartedness i attained the carse of lecropt road between the farms of greenocks and westleys and crossed over the m motorway and under the stirlinginverness railway line on my way to bridge of allan already bustling with school commuter and delivery traffic bridge of allan is a pleasant exspa town at the foot of a wooded ridge when i was younger i believed my brother when he told me that it had been named after him the path up the east bank of allan water continued through the woods of the kippenross estate in a cool sunken track before skirting the bottom edge of dunblane golf course where a few early golfers were already swinging clubs and lofting balls before depositing me near the centre of dunblane with only the dual carriageway and a few small streets between me and the cathedral the mists had lifted the morning was warm and by this time i had my jacket over my shoulder and my hat in the other hand i held the hat in my teeth while i used my fingers to comb my damp hair forward over my forehead i dallied just a little in the town looking in shop windows and glancing at the headlines of newspapers displayed outside the newsagent fascinated and repelled as ever by the gaudy goods and the loud black letters i am well aware at such moments that i resemble the proverbial small child with its nose pressed against a sweetshop window and hope that i draw some humility from this realisation at the same time i have to admit to a sort of thirst a hankering after some of these vapidities which makes it a relief to recall that as i have not a single penny in my pockets such goods so illnamed as my grandfather has pointed out remain entirely outwith my reach then i shook myself and strode towards the long weatheredsandstone bulk of the cathedral mr warriston was waiting in the choir i learned to play the organ in the mansion houses meeting room when i was still too short to be able to reach the highest stops or depress the pedals without falling off the seat i could not read music though my cousin morag could and she taught me the rudiments of that skill later she would play the cello while i played the organ her reading from her score while i extemporised i think we sounded good together even though the ancient organ was wheezy and in need of the sort of professional and expensive repairs and refurbishment even brother indra could not supply i learned to avoid certain notes and stops i believe it was god who brought me here five years ago on one of my regular long walks shortly after the flentrop had been installed and had me stare so admiringly at its pipegleaming fabulously carved wooden heights and so greedily at its keyboards and stops in the presence of one who could appreciate my admiration that that person mr warriston one of the cathedrals custodians and an organ enthusiast himself felt moved to ask me if i played i assured him that i did and we talked a little while about the abilities and limitations of the organ i had learned on i did not mention the mansion house or our order by name though apparently mr w guessed my origins from the first to my relief he has never seemed either unduly interested in or appalled by us or the lies and rumours associated with us mr warriston is a tall gaunt man with a pinched grey but genial face and a soft voice he is fifty years of age but looks more elderly he was invalided out of his job with the hydro board some years before i met him he had been about to test the organ for a recital to be given that evening he let me sit on the narrow bench in front of the three stepped keyboards pointed out the pedals and the stops with their odd dutch names bazuin and subbas quintadeen and octaaf scherp and prestant salicionaal and sexquilter and then by god the glory of it he let me play the gorgeous sonorously alive thing so that hesitantly at first only gradually finding my way about the first small part of the great instruments abilities i filled the mighty space around us with rolling swells of sound shrilling and booming and swooping and soaring amongst the timbers stones and glorious glass of that towering house of god and what was that you were playing today is mr warriston asked setting down a cup of tea on the small table by my chair im not sure i admitted taking up my cup something my cousin morag used to play i sipped my tea we were in the warristons sitting room in their bungalow across the river from the cathedral the window looked out over the back garden where mrs warriston was hanging up the washing the cathedral tower was visible over the springfresh greenery of the trees around the hidden railway line and river i sat on a hard wooden chair mr w had brought in from the kitchen for me while he lounged in a recliner soft furnishings are forbidden us this was only the third time in as many months i had visited the warriston household though i had been invited to do so that first day i played for mr w and often enough thereafter mr warriston looked thoughtful it sounded rather vivaldiish at the start i thought he was a priest wasnt he he took orders originally i think yes good have you heard his four seasons mr w asked i could put on the cd i hesitated really i ought not listen to something as sophisticated as a cd player my grandfathers teachings were clear on the matter of the unacceptability of such media a clockwork gramophone was just about acceptable if one plays serious or religious music on it but even a radio is considered unholy for general or entertainment use at least we did keep an ancient valve set for the purposes of radiomancy and for years after the move from luskentyre the two branches of the order kept in touch by shortwave radio while i was dithering mr warriston got up saying let me play it for you and moved to the stacked black mass of the hifi equipment squatting looking compact and complicated on a set of drawers in one corner of the room he opened a drawer underneath the dark machine and took out a plastic case i watched engrossed even though at the same time i realised i was clenching my teeth uncomfortable in the presence of such technology a sudden noise in the hall made me jump my cup rattled in its saucer mr warriston turned and smiled its only the phone is he said kindly i know i said quickly frowning excuse me a moment mr w went out to the hall putting the plastic cd case down on top of the player unit i was annoyed with myself because i had blushed i know with every fibre of my being i am the elect of god but i feel and act like a confused child sometimes when confronted by even the simplest tricks of the modern world still such instances inspire humility i told myself again i nibbled on the digestive biscuit that had accompanied my tea cup on its saucer and looked around the room there is an inevitable fascination for the saved in the trappings those we call the blands amongst other things though in any event hardly ever to their faces surround themselves with here was a room with immaculately bright wallpaper voluminous billowy furniture that appeared capable of swallowing you up a carpet that looked as though it was poured throughout the house it extended with apparent seamlessness into the hall and bathroom and stopped only at the doorway to the tiled spotlessly clean kitchen and a single huge long window made from two vast sheets of glass which reduced the sound of a passing train to a distant whisper when outside it sounded like shrieking thunder the whole house smelted clean and medicinal and synthetic i could detect what might have been deodorant aftershave perfume or just washingpowder fumesmost blands smell antiseptic or flowery to us we are happy to indulge salvador and his tub on account of his age and holy seniority but there is simply not enough water hot or cold for each of the rest of us to bathe more often than once a week or so often when we do get our turn it is only a standup bath and we are anyway discouraged from using perfumes and scented soaps as a result of such strictures and limitations and the fact that many of us do heavy manual work in clothes we cannot change or wash every day we tend to smell more of ourselves than of anything else a fact which the occasional bland has been known to comment on obviously i myself am not expected to undertake much menial labour but even so i try to make sure i have my big wash on a sunday evening before i walk in to dunblane and meet mr warriston plus there is electricity i glanced towards the hall then leaned across to the small table beside mrs warristons armchair where there was a pile of hardback books and a reading lamp i found the lamps switch the light clicked on just like that and off again i shivered ashamed at myself for being so childish but it taught one a lesson it showed how even the simplest manifestation of such technology could distract a person beguile them fill their head up with clutter and an obsession with fripperies drowning out the thin quiet voice that is all we can hear of god i looked furtively towards the hall again mr warriston was still talking i put down my cup and went to inspect the cd the case was disappointing but the rainbowsilver disc inside looked interesting wonderful little things arent they mr w said coming back into the room i nodded gingerly handing the disc to him it occurred to me to ask mr warriston whether he owned any cds by my cousin morag the internationally acclaimed baryton soloist but to have done so might have seemed like vicarious boasting so i resisted that temptation amazing they manage to squeeze seventy minutes of music onto them he continued bending to the hifi device he switched it on and all sorts of lights came on sharp points of bright red green and yellow and whole softly lit fawn windows with sharp black lettering displayed in them he pressed a button and a little drawer slid out of the machine he put the disc inside pressed the button again and the tray glided back in again of course some people say they sound sterile but i think they do you have to turn them over like records i asked what no mr warriston said straightening he pressed another button and the music burst out suddenly on both sides of us no you only play one side why i asked him he looked nonplussed and then thoughtful you know he said ive no idea i dont see why you couldnt make both sides playable and double the capacity he stared down at the machine you could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand hmm he smiled at me i might write to one of those notes and queries features about that yes good point he nodded over at my wooden chair anyway come on lets get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect eh i smiled pleased to have thought of a technical question mr warriston could not answer i listened to the cd then thanked mr and mrs warriston for their hospitality declined both lunch and a lift home in their car and set off back the way i had come the day was warm and the clouds small and high in a luminously blue sky near a small meadow by the side of allan water i sat on a soft bank in leafdappled sunlight and ate the apple and the haggis pakora sister anne had thought to furnish me with earlier the broad river gurgled over its smooth rocky slabs sparkling under my feet a train clattered unseen on the far bank hidden by the trees i folded the pakoras greaseproof paper back into my pocket went down to the river and drank some water from my cupped hands it was clear and cool i was shaking my hands free of the droplets and looking round with an exultant heart thinking how beautiful god had made so much of the world when i recalled that this was the spot where two years ago some sad unsaved had dragged me from the path and into the bushes his hand over my mouth had smelled of chipfat and his breath stank of cigarettes it had taken a moment or two for my poor slow brain to register the fact that in the words of grandmother yolanda this is not a drill appropriately of course it was also grandmother yolanda who had organised those selfdefence classes which had left me with to adopt yolandas words again the chance to set the agenda for my encounter with this scumbag i had waited until hed stopped hauling me backwards and i found my footing i think he tried to throw me down but i was holding tightly onto his arm with both my hands then id raked my foot smartly down his nearest shin and was thankful for my heavy farmsensible boots and stamped down on his instep with all my might and weight i was surprised at how loud the snap was he dropped me and screamed i did not even have to use the sixinch hatpin which yolanda herself had presented me with and which i carried in the lapel seam of my travelling jacket only its little jetbeaded head showing the man lay curled up on the shaded brown earth a skinny fellow with longish black hair a shiny synthetic black jacket sporting two white stripes faded blue jeans and muddy black training shoes he was clutching his foot and sobbing obscenities to my shame i did not stay and try to reason with him i did not tell him that for all his weakness and wickedness god still treasured him and if he only chose to look for it there was an intense enhancing and unending love to be found in the adoration of the divinity which would assuredly be infinitely more satisfying than some short physical spasm of pleasure especially one achieved through the coercion and subjugation of a fellow human being and so entirely lacking in the glory of love indeed what i thought of doing at the time was kicking his head very violently several times with my heavy sensible boots while he lay there helpless on the ground what i actually did was search for my hat while keeping one eye on him as he crawled away whimpering further into the bushes and then having found it and dusted it off go down to the sunlit river and wash my face to get rid of the smell of chip fat and stale cigarette smoke i shall tell the police i shouted loudly towards the windloud trees from the path i did not however and so was left with a nagging feeling of guilt on several counts well that is water under the bridge as they say and i can only hope that the poor man attacked nobody else and found an undepraved outlet for his love in the worship of our maker i completed drying my hands on my jacket and continued on my way i arrived back in high easter offerance to find disturbance and alarums a disaster in the making and a war council in progress chapter three the next morning while the dawn was still just a grey presence in the quiet mists above i splashed into the waters of the river just downstream from the iron bridge my feet squelching through the chill mud under the brown water on the steep bank above under the sombre canopy of the drooping trees in a silent massed presence stood almost every adult of our community i heaved myself up and into my rubber coracle while sister angela steadied the dark craft brother robert handed her the old brown kitbag from the shore and she passed it on to me i placed it in my lap my boots were hung round my neck on tied laces my hat was slung over my back brother robert slid into the water too he held my little boat and passed the trenching tool to sister angela who delivered it into my hands i unfolded it and locked the blade into place while she used the cold river water to clean my feet which stuck out over the edge of the giant innertube and then dried them slowly and reverently with a towel i looked up at the others standing watching on the shore their collective breath hanging in a cloud above their heads grandfather salvador was in the midst of them a whiterobed focus within their darkly sober penumbra sister angela was passed my socks which she carefully put on my feet i gave her my boots and she laced those up too ready my child our founder said quietly from the shore i am i said sister angela and brother robert were looking round at my grandfather he nodded and they pushed me firmly away from the bank and out towards the centre of the river go with god sister angela whispered brother robert nodded the current caught my odd craft and started to turn it and draw me away downstream i dipped the trenching tool into the silky grey waters paddling to keep my brothers and sisters in view go with god with god go god go with god with god god with go the others whispered their mingled voices already half lost in the rivers gurglings and the lowing of distant awakening cattle finally just before the river bore me around the tight bend downstream and out of sight i saw grandfather salvador raise his arm and heard his voice boom out over all the others go with god isis then the innertube entered an eddy and i was spun around the world whirling about me i paddled on the other side and looked back but the river had swept me away from them and all i could see were the reeds and bushes and the tall black trees hanging over towards each other from each bank of the mistwreathed river like monstrous groping hands i set my mouth in a tight line and paddled away downstream heading for the sea and the city of edinburgh where my mission would take me first to the home of gertie fossil what i asked appalled your cousin morag grandfather salvador told me has written from england to say that not only is she not returning for the festival at the end of the month but she has found what she calls a truer way to god she has sent back our latest monthly grant to her but thats terrible i cried what false faith can have poisoned her mind we dont know salvador snapped we were in the community office across the mansion landing from salvadors quarters my grandfather my stepaunt astar allan sister erin sister jess and i i had just returned from dunblane i still held my travelling hat i had been crossing the boundary back into our lands when i saw brother vitus running towards me along the old railway track he stood breathless telling me i was required urgently at the house then we ran back together we must write to her i said explain to her the error of her thoughts have any of her previous letters given any hint of the exact nature of her delusion is she still living in london brother zebediah is still there i believe could he not talk to her shall we call a mass prayer session perhaps she has lost her copy of the orthography shall we send her another allan glanced at my grandfather then said i think you are missing the point here a little is he sounded tired what do you mean i asked i put down my hat and took off my jacket sister morag is important to us in many ways astar said astar is fortythree a year younger than her sister calli and as lightly european looking as calli is dark tall and sensuous with long glossy black hair braided to the small of her back and large eyes hooded by dark eyelids she is the mother of indra and hymen she dresses even more plainly than the rest of us in long simple smocks but still manages to exude elegance and poise she is most dear to all of us she said the point is salvador cut in astars head dipped deferentially and her eyes half closed that while im sure we care as much for sister morags soul as for any of our number and so feel the grief of her apostasy most keenly and would in any event do all we can to bring her back to the fold with all due speed there is the more immediate result of morags desertion namely what do we do about the festival i hung my jacket on the back of a chair salvador was pacing up and down in front of the offices two tall windows sister erin stood by the door near the small desk which supported the remington typewriter allan arms folded head slightly bowed face pale stood by his desk which took up a fair proportion of the other end of the room in front of the fireplace beloved grandfather if i may allan said salvador waved him on isis allan said spreading his hands the point is weve made quite a thing of morag attending the festival as guest of honour weve been writing to the faithful all over the world encouraging them to come to this festival citing morags fame and her continuing faith i was shocked but i didnt know anything of this we usually shunned anything that smacked of publicity onetoone conversions were more our style though in the right circumstances wed always felt there was a place for standing on street corners shouting well allan said looking pained as well as pale it was just an idea we had he glanced at grandfather who looked away shaking his head there was no particular need for you to know at this stage beloved isis erin said though i wasnt sure she sounded convinced herself the point is morags not coming to the damn festival salvador said before i could reply he turned and paced past me he wore a fresh set of the long creamy woollen robes from our own flock naturally which he wore every day but on this occasion he looked different somehow agitated in a way i could not remember him being before morag beautiful graceful talented morag had always been a special favourite of my grandfathers i suspected that in a clean fight as it were without the special status as the elect of god conferred upon me by the exact date of my birth morag not i would be the apple of our founders eye i felt no bitterness or jealousy regarding this she had been my best friend and she was still even after all this time probably now my secondbest friend after sophi woodbean and anyway i was as taken with my cousin as my grandfather was morag is a hard woman not to like we have a few like that in our extended family when did we find all this out i asked the letter arrived this morning allan said he nodded at a sheet of paper lying on the agescuffed green leather surface of his desk i picked up the letter morag had been writing home for the last six years ever since she had moved to london until now her letters had been the source of nothing but pride as she became more and more successful and on the two occasions she had come back to see us since she had seemed like some fabulously exotic almost alien creature svelte and groomed and sleek and brimming with an effortless selfconfidence i read the letter it was typed without corrections as usual allan had told me he half suspected morag used something called a word processor which for a long and rather confused time i imagined must do to words what a food processor a device whose activities i had once witnessed does to food morags signature was as big and bold as ever the text itself was terse but then her communications had never been particularly wordy i noticed she still used dont instead of dont the letterhead address of her flat in finchley had been scored out i mentioned this has she moved i asked it looks like it allan said the last letter sister erin sent to morag came back marked moved away sister morags last letter before this one was on notepaper from the royal opera house in london we should perhaps have guessed that something was wrong then but assumed that her busy schedule had led her to forget to keep us informed of what was happening well what are we to do i asked i have called an extraordinary service for this teatime salvador said stopping pacing to look out of a window we shall discuss the issue then he was silent a moment then he turned to look levelly at me but id be grateful if he broke off then strode over took me by the shoulders and stared into my eyes his are deep brown the colour of horse chestnuts he is an inch shorter than i but his presence is such he made me feel he towered over me his grip was firm and his bushy beard and curled white hair shone in the sunlight like a halo around his head isis girl he said quietly we may have to ask you to go out amongst the benighted oh i said you were morags friend he continued you understand her and you are the elect if anyone can persuade her to change her mind it must be you he continued to look into my eyes what of the alterations to the orthography grandfather i asked they can wait if need be he said frowning isis allan said walking closer to us youre under no obligation to do this and he glanced uncertainly at grandfather there are good reasons why you should not go too if you have any doubts about such a mission you must stay here with us sister erin cleared her throat she looked regretful it might be best she said to assume that morag wont be coming back in which case perhaps the beloved isis could take her place in the festival salvador frowned allan looked thoughtful astar just blinked i gulped and tried not to look too shocked perhaps well come up with another idea at the meeting astar suggested we can only pray allan said grandfather clapped him on the shoulder and turned back to look at me they all did i realised they were waiting for me to say something i shrugged of course i said if i must go i must go the service was held in our meeting room the old ballroom of the mansion house every adult was there the elder children were looking after the youngsters across the lower hall from us in the schoolroom the meeting room is a plain simple room with tall windows white walls and a kneehigh podium at the far end in one corner there is a small pipe organ it stands about six feet high has two keyboards and is worked by bellows in a regular celebratory service for a full moon or for a baptism or a marriage i would be sitting there playing at this point but on this occasion i was standing with everybody else in the body of the kirk at the front of the podium is a lectern adorned by two scented candles grandfather stood at the lectern while the rest of us sat on the wooden pews facing him from the floor against the rear wall stands the altar a long table covered in a plain white woollen sheet and holding pots of our holy substances the table was made from flotsam washed ashore at luskentyre while the cloth was made from wool gathered from our own flock at high easter offerance in the centre of the table stands a small wooden box which contains a vial of our holiest substance zhlonjiz while behind it stands a tall russian samovar on a battered silver tray other boxes and small chests are scattered over the rest of the tables surface salvador raised his arms above his head the signal for talking to cease the room fell silent the samovar had already been lit and the tea brewed sister astar filled a large bowl with tea she gave it to our founder first who sipped at it then she brought it to those of us sitting in the front pew i drank next then calli then astar herself then allan and then so on through all the other adults the tea was just ordinary tea but tea has great symbolic value for us the bowl came back from the rear of the room with a little cold tea in the bottom astar set it to one side on the altar next came a plate containing a slab of common household lard this too was passed round we each rubbed a finger over the surface and licked the smear from our fingers a large cloth followed so that we could wipe our hands salvador raised his arms again closed his eyes and bowed his head we did the same our overseer said a brief prayer asking god to look upon us guide our thoughts and if we were worthy if we listened faithfully if we held our souls open to gods word talk to us our founder bade us rise we all stood then we sang in tongues this is a regular part of our life and we pretty well take it for granted but apparently it is utterly startling for the uninitiated as grandma yolanda would say you had to be there salvador always starts his fulsome muscular voice booming out over us and providing a deep luxuriant bass line to which we all gradually add our voices a single flock following its leader an orchestra obeying its conductor it sounds like nonsense like babble and yet through this glorious chaos we communicate singing solely as individuals and yet absolutely together we follow no score or agreedon script nobody has any idea where our song will lead us when we start or at any point during it and yet we sing harmoniously linked only through our faith singing in tongues reminds us of our founders first and most glorious vision during the night he lay near death in a storm at luskentyre in a trance of understanding and transcendence his lips speaking words no one could understand singing in tongues brings peace to our souls and a feeling of intense togetherness we never know when it will stop but eventually somehow when the time just seems right the sound dies away and it is over and so it was on this occasion the timeless interval of our singing had passed we stood quietly smiling and blinking with the only echoes those resounding in our souls salvador let us collect ourselves in silence for a while then said another short prayer thanking god for the gift of tongues then smiled upon us and bade us sit down we did so salvador gripped the sides of the lectern and bowed his head again for a moment then he looked up at us and began to talk about morag recalling her grace and her talent and her beauty and reminding us of the place she held in our missionary ambitions he ended with the words unfortunately there has been a development sister erin sister erin nodded then rose and stood on the podium beside salvador explaining the situation as we understood it when she sat down again allan took her place by the lectern and talked about potential solutions including the possibility of sending somebody on a mission to find morag and attempt to bring her back within the fold though without mentioning me by name allan resumed his place on the front pew and then salvador opened the discussion up to the floor calli said we should not have allowed her to go in the first place salvador rolled his eyes then said the same thing several more times in slightly different ways until she got onto the subject of pickles and condiments and the possibilities offered for spiritual propaganda by my grandmother aasni and greataunt zhobelias recipes why if we sold those we could finance a whole orchestra on the profits an old refrain astar was asked what she thought and circumlocuted with brief grace malcolm callis husband a big roughlooking but gentle man suggested that as young people often needed something to rebel against it might be best if we didnt rise to her bait then she might come creeping back after having made her point perhaps we ought just to do nothing glowered down by grandfather indra our wiry fidgety fixer of all things offered to go and find her and tell her to pull herself together muttered down by almost all sister jess our doctor a small delicate woman pointed out that morag was a grown woman and if she didnt want to come to the festival then that was her decision much indrawing of breath and shaking of heads brother calum our principal teacher unhunched himself long enough to stand up and suggest we might put an advertisement in a paper or in the personal columns asking her to contact us more of the same sister fiona wife of brother robert wondered what the possibilities were of putting brother zebediah on the case laughter from those who knew zeb he was generally regarded as something of a hopeless case and it was known he hadnt gone to a single one of morags concerts in london brother jonathan said he thought we were missing something why not just hire a private detective to look for her and possibly even kidnap her and bring her back he was sure his father would put up the money come to think of it he said when this was met by shocked silence he jonathan had some money a single call to his stockbroker or his bank in the cayman islands what on earth was all the fuss about brother jonathan is young his father is an underwriter at lloyds i didnt think hed last long with us allan explained patiently not for the first time about the importance of the sanctity of the source when it came to money no lucre was entirely unfilthy but it was a matter of revelatory fact that funds earned through farming the land and fishing the sea were the least contaminated of all followed by those made playing serious music preferably serious religious music jonathan stood up again and said well he had a good and philanthropic friend who owned a recording studio in an old church salvador himself scowled that one down like i say i dont think jonathans really right for us eventually sister erin said that there was a suggestion that i be dispatched to london to talk some sense back into morag most eyes turned to me i looked about smiling bravely and tried not to blush too much sister fiona b stood up to say yes it was about time we started talking about our errant sisters spiritual state not just the mechanics of getting her back here this met with applause and hallelujahs salvador and allan both nodded slowly frowning sister bernadette said that as the elect of god i was far too precious to be risked in the kingdom of the wicked babylondon shouted sister angela starting to shake and speak in tongues sister angela is excitable and prone to do such things concerned brothers and sisters restrained her gently brother herb said he didnt think i should go either but if i did then my anointed state made me all the more likely to be safer and more successful than anybody else there was much more talk i was asked what i thought and said that all i could contribute was an expression of honest willingness to travel to london and remonstrate with morag if that was what was decided upon i sat down again had we debated much longer we would have had to light the chapel lamps eventually salvador announced that reluctantly he had to concede that the only thing to be done was to ask me to leave the premises of the just for the cities of the plain charged with the mission of restoring morags faith a further special service a week from now would provide a forum for the discussion of any fresh developments and offer a venue for the evaluation of any new ideas on the communitys plight the main responsibility was mine however and we would have to trust that the creator would protect and steer me on my embassy amongst the unsaved responding to my grandfathers look i stood and announced that i was honoured to accept my task in the wilderness humbly and would leave as soon as practicable allan stood and announced that our overseer himself calli astar malcolm calum and i would retire to consider our next move i stood quickly and said that i would like brother indra to join us and this was agreed the service broke up after a final prayer and those on dinner duty went off to make a belated start on the evening meal which included bridie samosa channa neeps black pudding bhaji and saag crowdie paneer the day brightened slowly around me i paddled on through the swelling dawn chorus and beneath the drifting mists between the mud and grass of the river banks where puzzledlooking cattle stared bigeyed at my passing the great gentle beasts chewed the cud sometimes stopping to low at me moo yourself i told them the kitbag resting in my lap was getting in my way as i paddled i pushed it further down flattening it between my legs and into the well of the innertube where indras sheet of welded rubber was keeping my bottom from getting wet the bag scrunched down and under until i was more or less sitting on it paddling became easier the kitbag contained a copy of the orthography with salvadors most recent amendments hastily written in by myself from our notes old battered but beautiful leatherbound pocket editions of the pilgrims progress by john bunyan waverley by walter scott paradise lost by john milton and maunders treasury of knowledge some vials of important substances river mud hearth ash seaweed ointment a travelling hammock a bed roll a compact sitting board various maps a miniature candlelantern a tiny can of wind and waterproof matches some envelopes paper and stamps and a pencil a penknife a roll of twentynine onepound notes a parcel of food wrapped in greaseproof paper a bottle of water some toiletries and a change of clothes our final subcommitteed council of war had been to decide on my mode of transport to edinburgh i had already determined what this ought to be and was able to argue my case over the objections of some of the others brother indra agreed immediately to check on and modify the innertube and left to do just that i had also formed an opinion on how to approach gertie fossils based on the study of certain old maps and had an idea how i might effect the much longer journey to the city of london in the southeast of england my arguments carried the day before we go any further i had best try to explain why given that i am on a mission of such importance where time is potentially of the essence i was not doing something more obviously expeditious like catching an intercity train straight to london or ordering a taxi to glasgow or edinburgh airport this will require some theology god is both and neither male and female and everything else as well god is always referred to as god in the singular but takes the third rather than the second person in the plural to remind us of the mysterious and ultimately inexpressible nature of their being god is omniscient but only strategically concerning the far future not tactically otherwise time would be redundant they are also omnipotent but having chosen to set up the experimentcumartform that the universe is they are unlikely to intervene unless things go either apotheosistically well or apocalyptically badly to god our universe is as a snowscene or the contents of a testtube and far from unique they have many more and although they care for us and love us we are not the only apple of their eye to god man is like a deformed child they love him and would not deny him but they cannot suppress their regret that their child is not perfect there is no devil only the shadow caused by man obscuring gods radiant splendour there is a fragment of gods spirit in man but while god might be said to be perfect their perfection conies from their immense completeness therefore man lacks this aspect of gods qualities man is the creature of god and made to serve them and to oversee the universe but in his closeness to the business of mundane existence he is corrupted by his own intelligence and ability to change what appears to be important but is not rather than applying himself to the more difficult but ultimately far more rewarding task god has appointed him to and in this respect is rather like a young child who has become skilled at just crawling very quickly instead of standing up and learning to walk man must learn to stand and walk with his spirit rather than crawl with his technology before he allows that technology which is the physical expression of his spiritual shadow to destroy him gods ultimate aim for man is not known and not even knowable in our present state we must become spiritually adult before we can even discover what god holds in store for us as a spiritual species all previous ideas of heaven or hell or second comings or judgment days are childish attempts to come to terms with our own ignorance the perception of gods ultimate aim is one of the tasks of future prophets what awaits us individually when we die is reunion with the godhead but during this process we are relieved of our narrow and limiting individuality becoming one with the universe new souls are drawn from the pool of spirit that is god in the universe and sometimes a tiny fragment of memory from some previous existence will survive the twin disturbances of death and dissolving and birth and reforming this accounts for the beguiling but ultimately appallingly vain and conceited concept of reincarnation the possibility exists that man can achieve perfection in the sight of god because mans nature is not immutable just as it can alter through evolution so it can be altered through listening to the voice of god with the soul your whole body is your soul with the brain the most important part like the cats whisker in an old crystal radio we do not yet understand exactly how it works and may never be able to do so without the direct help of god themself physical love is the communing of souls and therefore holy all holy books and all religions contain grains of truth broadcast from the mind of god but politics and money corrupt the signal and so the trick is to reduce the clutter around oneself and listen calmly to the soul which is ones godgiven radio receiver at certain seemingly but not really random psychological moments you will hear or experience god talking to you this means for example that when you see somebody standing in a field staring apparently vacantly into space you should not disturb them as a consequence i might add people of the community are occasionally mistaken for scarecrows this is called receiving naturally some people hear the voice of god more clearly than others and they are usually called prophets a prophets first vision or revelation will tend to be the most intense but also the most debased by all that the prophet has experienced before it follows that the first codification of that revelation will be the least perfect the most contaminated by the prejudices and misunderstandings of the prophet the full story the real message only comes out gradually over time through revisions glosses and apparent marginalia all the result of gods persisting attempts to make themself clear through the imperfect receiver that is the human soul much of what other prophets have said before all the above was made clear to our founder may be useful and true but because their teachings have been corrupted by being institutionalised in the form of large religions they will have lost much of their force the best strategy is to treat the revelations and teachings of others with cautious respect but rely most fully on the teachings of our own overseer and listen to the voice from inside all of us the voice from god merit and calmness are to be found in the outoftheway the byways of life in the unnoticed in the hidden and ignored in the interstices amongst the gaps between the slabs in the pavement of life this is called the principle of indirectness or the principle of interstitiality therefore there is goodness and the potential for enlightenment in doing things differently seemingly just for the sake of it the less conventional and normal ones life is the less interference the less jamming one will experience from the machinery of civilisation and the more receptive one will therefore be to gods signals being born on the th of february is a good start is it starting to become clear the fact that i am not taking a train or a bus or even hitchhiking to edinburgh but instead am floating and paddling down this virtually untravelled stretch of twisty muddy old river with the full intention of walking round half the city when i get there is because to do so is important for the holiness of my mission to travel so is to sanctify the act of journeying itself and correspondingly increase my chances of success when i arrive at my eventual destination because i am travelling in the uncluttered sight of god with a soul as uncontaminated by the fuss of unsaved life as possible i paddled on into the misty brightening morning passing between more fields where cattle stood coming within hearing of the main road and seeing the roofs of a few farms and houses over the grassy river banks i passed the remains of what must have been a small suspension footbridge in the shape of two obelisklike concrete structures standing facing each other across the brown waters near craigforth house i had to negotiate a riverwide blockage of tangled treetrunks and debris and almost left my hat behind snagged on a grey weedhung branch i went under a pair of bridges and then swung round another bend to where the forth is joined by the teith an army base lay to my right the matt green aluminium hulls stacked on the grass were the only boats i had ever seen on the river upstream from this point i passed under the concrete expanse of the motorway one lorry rumbled overhead in the sparkling mist immediately the current increased as i approached some small low islands and passed two fishermen on the left bank standing on the first sandy shore i had seen then i heard the rush of water ahead and knew the tidal weir lay before me the tide was in and the rapids negligible my innertube craft bumped into a couple of submerged rocks and ill own that my heart did beat a little faster as i was swept down the broad white slope of rushing water but the total drop must have been less than two feet and i estimated that the worst i risked was a soaking i got a few odd looks floating through stirling but you become used to stares when youre a luskentyrian i had hardly slept that night after our various councils of war and a long briefing session with my grandfather in his sitting room part of which allan sat in on during which it must be said grandfather became gradually the worse for wear courtesy of a bottle of whisky it had been late into the lamplit darkness when brother indra had reappeared from his workshop to declare himself satisfied with his alterations to the old black innertube the innertube had been the largest of the inflatables the children had been using in the river during the previous summer we had no paddle as such but indra suggested the trenching tool sister jess left for gargunnock the nearest village where she would post a letter to my halfbrother zeb in london telling him to expect me within the next few days on the way back she would call in at the woodbeans house and use their telephone to send a signal telling of my coming to the house of gertie fossil a process much more longwinded than the words i have just used to describe it meanwhile i had been given the old kitbag which had been in our order almost since it was founded and which had something of the status of a holy relic with us and chosen what i would put into it sister erin handed me a thick roll of paper cash bound with a rubber band and sealed inside a plastic bag i had already thought about this and thanked her and the others but then sorted out the twentynine onepound notes and handed the rest back my grandfather watched as i did this i saw tears in his eyes and he came over and crushed me to him hugging me fiercely and saying ah god isis child isis isis child and slapping me vigorously on the back allan smiled tremulously at the two of us his face still pale erins jaw had the set that meant she was biting her tongue she forced a smile you will make sure you come back in time for the festival wont you child salvador said pulling away from wetting my shirt collar with his tears you have to be there more than anybody you must be there you will be back please god it wont take anything like that long to talk to morag i told him holding his fleshy forearms i hope i shall be back for the full moon service in the middle of the month but if it does take longer i shall i took a deep breath i shall return in any event in good time for the festival its so important grandfather said nodding he patted my cheek so important i may not see another he blinked rapidly you will i told him but anyway dont worry everything will be all right sweet child he hugged me again with the preparations complete grandfather called a short aftersupper service to ask for the blessing of god on my mission i found a morsel of time late on to slip out and away across the dark bridge to the woodbeans house on the far bank to tell sophi that i had to leave and to say goodbye chapter four my thoughts that night as i lay in my hammock in my room in the farmhouse centred around the coming trip and the possible reasons for my cousin morags apostasy i knew that sleep was probably impossible and that if i did drift off it would probably be just before i was due to be awakened leaving me feeling shaky and disoriented and tired for much of the day but i was resigned to this and it is anyway well known that in such waking tiredness one can often experience a trancelike state which opens one all the better to the voice of the creator morag and i had been close friends even though she was four years my senior i had always mixed easily with community children older than myself my special status as the elect conferring the equivalent of a handful of years added to my actual age morag and i got on especially well despite the difference in our years sharing an interest in music and i suppose a similar demeanour morag is the daughter of my aunt brigit who left us six years ago aunt brigit joined a millennialist cult based in idaho in the united states of america one of those strange sects who appear to think salvation grows out of the barrel of a gun she came back for the last festival of love but spent most of her time trying to convert us to her new faith although to no avail of course we are arguably far too tolerant sometimes aunt brigit was never entirely sure who morags father was which is a not uncommon result of the communitys informality and one of those unfortunate trends which can help give credence to the more sensationalistic media reports about us certainly my grandfather always treated her like a daughter but then salvador has always behaved as though all the order children are his own probably just to express his love for all the saved but perhaps just to be on the safe side brigits daughter is a tall perfectly proportioned creature with bounteous brownred hair and eyes deep and blue and big as an ocean her saving flaw was a rather wide gap between her two front teeth though much to our disappointment shed had that seen to when she too came back to visit us four years ago i think that in any other upbringing morag would never have developed the talent she had for music she would have learned too early that her looks were a facile passport to whatever she might desire and so have been spoiled wasted even as a person fit only to hang on a rich mans arm signalling his status by her pampered glamour and her overpriced clothes and with nothing more to temper the vacuity of her existence than the prospect of bearing him children they could spoil together instead she grew up with us in the community where plain clothes no makeup a practical haircut and just a general lack of concern with looks mitigates against such distraction and so was given the time to discover that the greatest gift god had seen fit to bestow upon her was something less ephemeral than physical beauty morag learned to play the violin then the cello then later the viola da gamba and eventually the baryton a kind of viola da gamba with extra resonating strings not just with fluent flawless technique but with an emotional intensity and an intuitive understanding for the music that at first belied her lack of years and later continued to develop and mature though they are expressed with all due modesty it is obvious from her letters that she almost alone has been responsible for the revival of interest in the baryton as an instrument and through her appearances and recordings given pleasure to many thousands of people i hope we are not guilty of vanity in feeling as proud of her as we do and even in some small way partially responsible for her achievements the weather turned bright and sunny i put on my hat to shield my head from the sun i floated alongside acres of huge windowless warehouses and passed alloa with the ebbing tide taking a rest from my paddling as i lunched on clapshot naan and ghobi stovies and drank some water from my bottle during the afternoon the wind freshened from the west and helped drive me down river past a huge power station and under kincardine bridge i paddled with renewed vigour hugging the southern shore with its gleaming mudflats to the north lay another gigantic generating station while to my right the smokes steams and flares of the grangemouth oil refinery leaned away from the breeze pointing the way towards edinburgh i had been to gertie fossils in edinburgh once before when i was sixteen so at least as far as there i knew where i was going london was another matter that city is almost as much a magnet for young orderites as it is for the average youthful scot and as well as my cousin morag and brother zeb it had attracted various others from the community including for a year my brother allan who had also harboured some musical ambitions he went to london with two friends he had made at the agricultural college in cirencester where hed been sent to study farm management he has played the whole thing down since but i got the impression he was sorely disappointed by his failure to make something of himself in the big city i know that he joined a rock music ensemble while he was there and apparently played some form of portable electric organ however it would seem that whatever visions of stardom he may have cherished came to nothing and after what i suspect was a generally humiliating experience he returned adamant both that his place and his work and his destiny were with us in the order and that he would never again set foot in that vast inhuman fleshpot epicentre of clutter and scourge of dreams the day wore on i paddled through the chopping water taking rests when my arms grew too tired and sore and shifting my position as best i could to ease an ache in my back which was wet from getting splashed by the waves ahead perhaps ten miles in the distance i could see the two great bridges over the river and was heartened by the sight knowing edinburgh was not too far beyond i took the trenching tool in my by now rather raw hands and paddled on if i was finding my journey tiring and painful i reflected that it was as nothing compared to the seminal aquatic rebirth undergone by my grandfather four and half decades earlier the seeds of our sect were sown one windfierce night on the shores of the island of harris in the outer hebrides it was the last hour of the last day of september and in the first great storm of the season the atlantic wind threw the oceanic rollers at the fractured coast in waves of darkness edged by boiling foam rain and saltspray merged in the darkness of the storm to roll across the seaward land bringing the taste of the sea miles inland beyond even the thunderous hollow booming of the waves falling on the rocks and sands two frightened asian women sat huddled together around a single scented candle in an old van sheltering in the dunes behind a long dark beach listening to the waves pound and the wind howl and the rain rattle on the wood and canvas roof of the ancient vehicle which rocked and creaked on its leaf springs with each furious gust and seemed likely to tip over and crash into the sand at any moment the two women were sisters their names were aasni and zhobelia asis and they were outcasts refugees they were khalmakistanis daughters of the first family of asians to settle in the hebrides their family had established a business running a travelling shop round the islands and had become surprisingly well accepted for a place where hanging out washing on a sunday is considered tantamount to blasphemy khalmakistan is a mountainous region on the southern fringes of the himalayas currently disputed by india and pakistan in this it is similar to kashmir though the inhabitants of each statelet share little else except a mutual contempt aasni and zhobelia were the first of the familys second generation and generally regarded as having had their heads turned by the bright lights of stornoway at any rate they were thought too headstrong and westernised for their own good or that of the family had their family acted quickly enough they might have had the two girls successfully married off to suitable suitors summoned from the subcontinent before they got too used to making up their own minds but as it was the second world war intervened and almost seven years were to pass before an easing of both travelling and rationing restrictions created favourable conditions for a match to be arranged by then however it was too late it was determined that the two sisters should be offered in marriage to two brothers from a family well known to their parents certainly the brothers concerned were elderly but their family was well off known to be longlived and the menfolk in particular were notorious for being fecund well into their twilight years besides as their father told them he was sure they would be the first to admit that a steadying hand even if it was wrinkled and a bit shaky was exactly and manifestly what the two girls needed perhaps infected by the spirit of independence sweeping the raj itself and catching something of the mood of female emancipation the war had helped to bring about by putting women into factories uniforms jobs and a degree of economic control perhaps simply having seen one propaganda film too many about jolly soviet crane drivers at the stornoway alhambra the sisters refused point blank and the eventual result was that they took the extraordinary step in the eyes of both their original culture and that which they now found themselves part of of estranging themselves completely from their family and going into competition with them they had some savings and they borrowed money from a sympathetic freethinking farmer who was himself something of an outsider in that land of the free kirk they bought an old van which had been used as a mobile library round the islands and some stock they sold the bacon lard and beef that their family would not touch and for a few months they sold alcohol too until the excise men brought them to book and explained the niceties of the licensing system to them luckily they were not also asked to produce a driving licence they were barely making a living they had to sleep in the back of the van they were forever ordering far too much or much too little stock they were constantly running foul of the rationing authorities and they were utterly miserable without their family but at least they were free and that and each others company was about all they had to hold on to that day before the storm had darkened the horizon they had washed their bedding on some stones in a river which decanted into loch laxdale and left it to dry while they went about their business in lewislewis and harris are referred to as separate islands though in fact they are both thoroughly linked and decisively separated by a range of by himalayan standards small but impressively craggy mountains the harris folk are generally smaller and darker than the people of lewis a phenomenon popular myth ascribes to the romantic efforts of hordes of swarthy spaniards washed ashore after armada ships were wrecked off the rockragged harris coast but which is probably no more than the difference between celtic and norse ancestry by the time the sisters had rushed back through the quickly steepening gloom of midafternoon the rain had already started and when they got to where they had left their bedding the wind had flung most of it against a barbedwire fence and thrown the rest of it into the swollen river the rain was heavy and almost horizontal by then and the sheets and blankets on the fence could hardly have been wetter had they too been dumped in the river the sisters salvaged their sodden bedding and retreated to their van driving it to a hollow in the dunes nearby where they could shelter from the storm and so they sat in their coats clutching each other while their little scented candle flickered in the draught surrounded by tea chests and boxes full of lard both symptoms of aasnis inability either to resist a good deal or to remember how little storage space they had meanwhile water from their sheets pooled about their feet and threatened to spoil the bags of sugar flour and custard powder piled under the shelves then there was a thump as something heavy hit the seaward side of the van they both jumped outside a male voice moaned barely audible over the noise of the wind and the waves they had a lantern they put the little scented candle inside and ventured out into the bellowing blackness of the drenching gale lying on the sandy grass by the side of the van was a young white man in a cheap twopiece suit he had black hair and a terrible head wound in his upper forehead which oozed blood the beating rain washed away they dragged him towards the open rear door of the van the man came to and moaned again and managed to stand up for a moment he fell onto the vehicles floor and they pulled him far enough inside on a floor lubricated with water and now with blood to close the banging windblown door he looked deathly white and shivered uncontrollably still moaning all the while blood dribbled from the wound in his forehead they wrapped their coats around him but he wouldnt stop shivering aasni remembered that people who swam the english channel would cover themselves with grease and so they broke out the lard of which they had rather more than they needed due to an irresistible greymarket deal with a man in carloway whod found several cases washed ashore and setting modesty aside stripped the man to his sodden underpants and started to cover him in lard he still shivered blood still trickled from his forehead they cleaned the wound and dabbed some antiseptic on it aasni found a bandage zhobelia opened the special chest her grandmother had sent her from khalmakistan on her twentieth birthday and took out the bottle of cherished healing ointment called zhlonjiz which she had been told to keep for extra special emergencies she made a poultice and put it on the wound binding his head with the bandage the man still shivered they didnt want to get their coats covered with lard so they opened one of the chests of tea the tea wasnt in the best of condition anyway having been stored too long in a barn near tarbert by a farmer whod hoped to turn a profit on the wartime black market and tipped the dark tea leaves over the mans quivering whitelarded form it took two tea chests to cover him entirely he seemed half unconscious still moaning from within his covering of tea and lard but at least and at last he appeared to have stopped shivering and for a moment his eyes opened and he looked briefly around and into the eyes of the two sisters before falling back into unconsciousness they started the van with the intention of taking the man to the nearest doctor but the grass in the little hollow they had parked in was so slippery from the rain they couldnt move the vehicle more than a few feet aasni put on her coat and went out into the storm to summon help from the nearest farm with a phone zhobelia was left in charge of their deathly white stormwaif she checked that he still breathed that his poultice was in place and the bleeding had stopped then she did her best to wring the water out of his clothes he babbled talking in a language that zhobelia could not understand and suspected nobody else would be able to understand either a couple of times however he mumbled the word salvador the man of course was my grandfather god spoke to salvador they were waiting enthroned in and surrounded by glorious light at the end of a dark tunnel which my grandfather seemed to ascend to from the banal world he assumed he was dying and this was the way to heaven god told him it was the way to heaven but he was not going to die instead he had to return to the earthly world with a message from them to humanity cynics might suggest that it had something to do with the poultice the potent exotic unknown khalmakistani herbs seeping from it to enter salvadors bloodstream and poisoning his mind producing something akin to a hallucinatory trip but the smalland fearful minded will always try to reduce everything to the triviality and mundanity which their stunted despiritualised minds feel safe dealing with the fact remains that our founder woke a different man and for all that he had almost died from hypothermia aggravated by loss of blood a better more whole one one with a mission one with a message a message god had been attempting to transmit complete to man for a long time through the aggregating clutter of modern life and technology a message that only somebody whose ambient mental activity had been reduced to something close to quietitude by the proximity of death would be capable of hearing possibly other men had heard gods message but been too close to that edge of death and slipped over it unable to transmit the signal on to their fellow men certainly there had been no shortage of death over the previous decade however that may have been my grandfather knew when he finally awoke on a calm milkyskyed day with warm tea being poured down his throat by the two darkskinned women he had assumed were figments of his imagination that he was the one the enlightened the overseer to whom god had given the task of establishing an order which would disseminate the truth of their message on earth thereafter then whoever our founder had been before whatever had driven him to that place on that night however he had made his way through the storm out of the sea off the land or even falling from the sky became unimportant all that mattered was that salvador awoke remembering his vision and the task he had been charged with and decided he had a purpose in life he had work to do first however there was the matter of a canvas bag the last leg of my waterborne journey in the early evening seemed to take forever i had passed beneath the bowed deck of the grey road bridge and the straight bed of the rail bridge fighting an incoming tide with only the wind at my back to aid me once through the narrows between the queensferries i could slacken my efforts a little but every muscle in my upper body felt as if it were on fire finding that the bottom of my small craft was sloshing with water which had splashed in during my battle with the tides and fearful for the contents of my kitbag i stopped for a while and bailed out the water using my handkerchief then i paddled on between golden sands and quiet wooded shores to my right and two long landisolated jetties to my left to each of which a huge oil tanker was tied up a motor boat left one of the jetties and swung round towards me the boat proved to be full of surprisedlooking workmen in brightly coloured overalls at first they seemed reluctant to believe that i was not in some difficulty but then laughed and shook their heads and told me if i had any sense id head for shore and continue on foot they called me hen which i found mildly insulting though i think it was meant congenially enough i thanked them for their advice and they powered off heading upstream i came ashore at last at cramond at the point where a line of tall obelisks strides out across the sands to a low island just before i touched the sands i heaved my kitbag out from under me it was only a little damp and dug out the vial of forth mud to freshen up the mark on my forehead which i suspected must have been washed off by a combination of spray and sweat my strange craft bumped ashore onto greyblond sands and i got out i had a little difficulty in standing and then in straightening but eventually did so and luxuriated in a long if painful stretch all under the quizzical gaze of numerous swans floating in the waters of the river almond and a few suspiciouslooking youths standing on the promenade hey mister you shipwrecked aye one of them shouted no i said pulling my kitbag out of the innertube and packing the folded trenching tool away i left my craft lying on the sand by a small slipway and climbed up to the youths and i am a sister not a mister i told them drawing myself up they wore baggy clothes and longsleeved tshirts with hoods their short hair looked greasy one of them looked down at the innertube zat big tyre goin spare then hen its all yours i told them and walked away i felt a kind of exhilaration then having accomplished the first part of my journey i strode out along the esplanade munching on another naan with my kitbag slung over my shoulder while my shadow lengthened in front of me i consulted my map negotiated a few roads and found the abandoned railway line now a cycleway at granton road within a hundred yards i discovered a thin straight broken branch hanging off a tree by the trail i tore it down and used my penknife to remove a few twigs and soon had a serviceable staff to accompany me on my way the old railway path took me almost three miles towards my destination by turns under and over the evening traffic the air was full of the smell of engine exhaust and the sky was lit with flagrant red clouds as i crossed to pick up the towpath of the old union canal and then took the footpath skirting school playing grounds the last part of my trip was as well accomplished in near darkness given that it took me along a stretch of railway line which was still in occasional use i hid in some bushes up the embankment as a loud diesel engine came swinging round the bend from the east pulling a long train of open doubledeck wagons stacked with cars the red taillight on the last wagon blinked fast as a racing heart as it disappeared round the turn in the cutting and i sat there on my haunches for a moment or two thinking after a moment i got up and continued along the trackside passing through an abandoned station and then walking under a busysounding road junction until i came to within a couple of streets of the home of gertie possil in the douce edinburgh suburb of morningside and arrived there in time to take part in a ceremonial supper chapter five blessed isis beloved isis oh what an honour we are so honoured oh oh sister gertie fossil tiny whitehaired frail and easily old enough to be my grandmother made the sign set the paraffin lamp she carried down on a narrow table and prostrated herself at my feet then edged forward until she could touch my boots which she patted as though they were tiny delicate animals gertie fossil was dressed in something oatmealcoloured and flowing which settled around her on the black and white tiles of the hallway floor like a pool of porridge behind me the stainedglass door swung shut thank you sister gertie i said making the sign in return and feeling just a little embarrassed at having my boots petted please do rise welcome welcome to our humble unworthy house she wailed getting back up again i helped her the last couple of feet putting my hand to her elbow and she stared openmouthed at my hand and then at my face oh thank you blessed isis she said and felt for the glasses that hung from a cord on her chest she positioned them properly and sighed deeply staring at me seemingly lost for words behind her in the dark hallway of the large gloomy house stood a tall plump man with a large and mostly bald head this was gerties son lucius he wore a heavy purple dressinggown over dark trousers and spatted shoes a cravat was bunched awkwardly under his double chins he beamed at me and rubbed his fat hands together nervously umm umm umm he said let lucius take your bag you wonderful child you gertie fossil said to me and then turned to her son lucius the anointeds bag see here you lump whats the matter with you she tsked as she reverently took my staff and leaned it against the coat stand that boy of mine she muttered sounding exasperated lucius bumbled forward bumping into things in the hallway i handed him my kitbag he took it and smiled broadly nodding his adams apple bobbing up and down like a pigeons head tell the beloved you are honoured gertie said using the flat of her hand to hit her son in the stomach with surprising force honoured honoured lucius gulped still smiling broadly nodding vigorously and swallowing powerfully he swung the kitbag over his shoulder and clunked the grandfather clock with it he appeared not to notice honoured he said again brother lucius i nodded as gertie helped me off with my jacket you must be exhausted gertie said carefully hanging my jacket on a padded hanger i shall prepare some supper and lucius will run you a bath you are hungry arent you you havent eaten may i wash your feet you poor child you look tired are you weary i glanced at my face in the mirror by the coat hooks illuminated by the weak yellow light of the paraffin lamp i thought i did look tired certainly i felt weary it has been a long day i admitted as gertie shooed her son ahead of her towards the stairs i would love a cup of tea sister gertrude and something to eat a bath would be pleasant later of course and please call me gertie lucius you lump upstairs the good bedroom thank you i said as lucius thumped up the stairs and his mother led me through to their candlelit parlour firstly however i must use your telephone to tell the community i have arrived safely indeed of course it is here she doubled back and flitted past me opening the door to the cupboard under the stairs she set down the paraffin lamp on a narrow shelf and showed me to a small wooden chair facing a tiny table which supported a large black bakelite phone with a twisted fabric cord i shall leave you the lamp she announced she turned to go hesitated gazed raptly at me then held out her hands to one of mine and tremulously said may i i gave her my hand and she kissed it her thin pale lips felt soft and dry as paper beloved isis blessed isis she said blinking quickly and scurried away into the dim hall i sat down and picked up the phone handset we do not of course have a telephone in the community and while there is a set in the woodbeans house we are allowed to use we do not make or receive normal calls there is a tradition in the order that telephones must only be used for urgent messages and then not in a way so trivial and facile as by simply lifting the receiver and talking i dialled the woodbeans number above me i could hear lucius clumping around on the first floor i let the phone ring twice then put it down and dialled again this time letting it ring nine times then clicked the cradle buttons down once more before dialling a third time and allowing four more sets of trills to sound this was my special cipher it had been agreed on the previous evening during our final council of war that no further coded signal would be required to let the order know that i had arrived safely at the home of gertie fossil this was just as well sending a long message in this manner using our own form of morse code can take several hours especially if one has to transmit ones own number to the person initially receiving the call and then has to leave gaps in ones transmission during which they may ring back to send signals containing questions and never forgetting that there is a degree of inaccuracy inevitable to the whole process anyway given that the rings heard at the source phone do not always tally exactly with those at the receiving machine this i am told is why a caller can think that a phone they are calling into has been lifted before it has started ringing of course we do not ask the woodbeans to sit by the phone all night noting down the sequence of rings either a preagreed time is set up for a call during which an orderite will be sitting with pencil and paper in the woodbeans front hall or a special machine can be switched on designed and built by brother indra which records each trill the phone makes on a piece of paper wound round a metal drum and which is made from bits of an old taperecorder a clock and a barometer there was also of course a security aspect to all this while my grandfather no longer believed there was a special government department dedicated to the observation and harassment of our order and there seems to have been little recent interest from those peddlers of prurience the popular press it is always wise to keep up ones guard for as my grandfather has pointed out it is the surprise attack the assault undertaken once the victim has been lulled into slackened discipline and sloppy vigilance that is the most devastating some ungracious apostates have suggested that the whole ritual is motivated by a desire to economise on telephone bills and it is true that the system does have the additional benefit of considerable frugality however the sheer awkwardness of the whole business surely points to a holier more pure purpose when i finished my call i joined gertie in the kitchen to find her preparing the supper on the stove a kettle sat surrounded by several castiron pots all gradually coming to the boil and filling the room with mouthwatering aromas blessed isis gertie exclaimed adding a dab of lard to each of three large white china plates on which tiny piles of tea already sat you said you were hungry indeed i am i conceded we ate in the dining room round a long table of darkly gleaming polished wood whose centre was lined with tall candles condiments preserves pickles and baskets of leavened and unleavened bread the supper was conducted with all due solemnity the presence of the lard and the tea on the side of the plate as well as the incense candles and a dish as grand as venison tikka pasanda marked this out as a special occasion i said the blessing i served the first piece of food from each dish i read from the orthography and marked both gertie and luciuss foreheads with the vial of mud from home i even made polite conversation and brought the fossils up to date with the news from the community they had not visited for a year or so and though they were hoping to be there for the festival of love in four weeks time they were grateful for a briefing beforehand i accepted the offer of a bath though i was already almost dead on my feet and woke to find myself chindeep in the tepid water with gertie banging as loud as deference would allow on the bathroom door i assured her i was awake again rinsed and dried and then made my way to my bedroom it was the finest room in the house and it possessed a large victorian fourposter bed which i remembered from my visit here three years earlier this was ideal for my purposes as it meant i was able to sling my hammock between two of the sturdy posts and even orient my hammock in a direction that ensured my head would be pointing towards the community i slept soundly and dreamed of nothing i could recall it was while i was sorting out my kitbag the following morning that i found right at the bottom of it something extra and very special something i did not know i had it came in the shape of a tiny vial wrapped in a scrap of paper and secured by a rubber band in case s said the words printed on the note i opened the tiny glass jar with some difficulty and sniffed the dark almost black ointment inside it was zhlonjiz the priceless irreplaceable unguent that is more precious and significant to us than gold frankincense and myrrh to christians no more precious yet it is as though we possess our grail but it is still magically powerful and consumable i had heard of zhlonjiz since toddlerhood but only ever seen or smelled it once before at my comingofage ceremony three years earlier i knew that my grandfather had only the tiniest amount of the treasured mystical salve left after all these years that he should honour me so by entrusting this substantial fragment of our holy of holies to my keeping was both a humbling tribute to the love he had for me and the faith he had in me and a sobering reminder had i needed one of the importance of my mission i felt tears prick behind my eyes i carefully resealed the vial pressed its little bakelite cap to my forehead and whispered a blessing then kissed the tiny glass jar and stowed it carefully wrapped in my extra clothes back in the bottom of my kitbag edinburgh has the merit as a city by our beliefs that it is at its centre erratic convoluted and full of different levels and strange steep passageways though by all accounts the old cities of the holy lands surpass it in this regard and tokyo in japan is apparently quite creditably difficult to find ones way around edinburgh is still a city of course and therefore to be avoided unless one has some pressing need to stay there in gertie fossils case a nostalgic weakness for the marital memories associated with the house was what had persuaded her to remain but as cities go it is neither overly regular in pattern save in the new town nor too large to see out of two criteria which have always seemed to me important we have always held it to be a bad sign when navigating ones way round a city becomes a matter simply of knowing ones xaxis from ones yaxis and we are i think rightly horrified at the prospect of discovering that the only direction to look in the hope of finding something natural to look at is up at the clouds like as not polluted by the sight of aircraft and their vapour trails or at night by the reflected lights of the city itself i had still to decide how i was to make my journey to london with sanctity but the relative speed of my progress the previous day i had envisaged taking two days and having to find shelter somewhere ashore together with the comparatively benign atmosphere of edinburgh left me in no hurry to start travelling immediately when i woke up the next morning at a shamefully late hour i decided i could take up to a day to rest and think fêted at breakfast as much as at supper there were rosepetals in my tea and i had to let gertie fossil wash my feet i told her and her son that i needed to reconnoitre various aspects of the city and would return once i had completed my scouting expedition i declined gerties offer of a guide in the shape of lucius he looked relieved too behind an anxious smile and assured her that i could look after myself gertie still looked worried and so i mentioned that i felt doubly secure knowing that i had the jar of zhlonjiz upon my person sister gertrude was suitably impressed that the semilegendary salve had been entrusted to my care but seemed satisfied that my safety was thereby guaranteed and so i went out amongst the unsaved also known as the wretched the insane the norms the obtuse the reject the clinker the chaff the cluttered the rank the passives the benighted and the asleep uncomfortably conscious of the fact that i was walking away from the only other two people in the city who were numbered among the saved likewise the enlightened the sane the preferred the acute the chosen the refined the engraced the clear the commissioned the active the dawned and the awoken my jacket pockets filled with the more precious items i had brought from the community and a couple of cheese and mango pickle sandwiches prepared by gertie the day was warm and i left my hat dangling down over the back of my jacket which had been cleaned as best she could by gertie overnight the main thoroughfares of the city were choked with cars the pavements aswarm with people the air reeked of burned petrol lurid advertisements and shop windows screamed for attention from every side a few people looked at me oddly i did not think that my monochrome garments were particularly different from those worn by many of the youths of both sexes whom i saw and i observed a few people with hats so perhaps it was the staff i carried which set me apart i felt awkward and tense in the midst of so much strident clutter and so many people and after a while i took to the quieter streets away from the stressing mass of humanity some children in a school playground shouted through the railings at me accusing me of being what they called a loony and asking for a shot of your stick does it turn into a power sword i had been going to ignore them but turned and approached instead they shrank back initially then perhaps encouraged by their numbers and by the railings between us they came back whats a power sword i asked you know like in transforcers on saturday mornings one of them said i thought for a moment you mean on television aye of course yeah on the telly they chorused i shook my head we dont have a television set in our house what no yer kiddin get outa here you live in the loony bin missus no i live in the community this caused some mirth amongst a few of the older ones one of whom the one whod talked first asked whats that on your forehead its a mark of respect i told him smiling a mark of love and faith whats your name mark he replied to some giggles he looked defiant whats yours well i have a bit of a funny name i told them i am the blessed very reverend gaiamarie isis saraswati minerva mirza whit of luskentyre beloved elect of god iii more laughter the bell rang then and they were called away by a teacher who looked at me suspiciously i waved to the children and blessed them under my breath then turned away looking at the stave in my hand and thinking how slight are the signals by which we serve notice inadvertently or not that we are not part of the bland world it also struck me that such signs are often emblems of an unfamiliar practicality and how misguided it is to believe that the greater world is somehow ultimately cosmopolitan and tolerant my own school days not long over i suppose judged against the scale of a full life though they seem moderately distant to me now were passed at the gerhardt academy we have been sending our secondary school children as day pupils to the academy just outside the village of killearn on the western flank of the southern hills for thirty years ever since wed had some trouble with the local authorities they were and are happy with the standard of our primary teaching but demanded we put our elder children through more formal educational channels the gerhardt academy is a school for the children of parents who wish them to have an education that is officially recognised but less strictly structured than the state or private norm it was still a longterm aim of my grandfather to educate all order children up to secondary standard and even to lay the foundations for a college some time in the future but in the meantime the academy provides a satisfactory secondary alternative i had both mostly enjoyed the experience at the time and felt afterwards that i had benefited from it to this day whenever i see the younger brothers and sisters heading off to catch the bus in the morning i still feel a smidgen of nostalgia for the days when i too carried a sitting board and a satchel over the bridge past the woodbeans house and up the drive to the rusted gates the satchels are selfexplanatory the boards were because the bus had padded seats which we were not allowed to use so took our own hard wooden boards to sit on rebellion then consisted of sitting on the soft seats and using ones board with a roller skate underneath as a skate board the academy housed in a high and gothic castle in the trees above killearn village is a good place to learn im sure to some of the pupils and parents it seems a strange spartan and even eccentric institution with its odd combination of archaic fixtures and traditions i was given slates and chalk to work with during my first year freeflowing curriculum easy discipline and unconventional teachers but to us order children it tends to seem like a haven of luxury order and common sense after the community in addition to its formal scholastic role the academy has traditionally been the place where young luskentyrians learn more about the nonacademic world mixing with unsaved children and being exposed to the more common adolescent interests such as pop music comics the adulation of sporting and cultural heroes the use of popular slang and so on this can be a traumatic experience for a child of the community however we tend to arrive forewarned by those who have gone before us and in groups that can offer support to any individual in need of it plus of course we have our faith to comfort us through any teenage angst that may result furthermore possessing a generally superior if usually only theoretical knowledge regarding sex and drugs compared to our unsaved peers gained in the enlightened atmosphere of the community means that we can give as good as we get when it comes to peerimpressing so i had enjoyed my school days and i suppose i could even be said to have shone academically if that is not too immodest indeed a few of my teachers had tried to persuade me to go on to university either to read physics or english however my grandfather and i knew that i had been marked out for a more holy purpose and that my rightful place was with and in the community i turned and walked away from the school in the end it took me two days to get out of edinburgh i spent that day fruitlessly trying to work out how to stow away on a motorail train at waverley station but it looked too difficult to my surprise i saw a notice that said the service would soon cease altogether i could just have jumped on a londonbound train and trusted to my wits to keep away from a guard we have our own nonsense language and a look of somehow foreign incomprehension perfected for when one is caught in such situations or i might have tried a longrange variant of the technique we call back bussing however it struck me that this would prove problematic over such a distance and more to the point there was something insufficiently holy about this approach we are not averse to travelling in trains either sitting on the floor of the guards van or using the wooden sitting boards we carry to avoid the luxury of soft furnishings but my mission was so important i had to be rigorous in my piety and there was something too beguilingly easy about simply avoiding paying my fare on an ordinary passenger train i retreated to morningside using as many outoftheway routes as i could including one snicket or footpath charmingly called lovers loan en route i saw several cars with signs in the back saying child on board and was reminded by now with more amusement than embarrassment of my first trip to edinburgh three years earlier when i had proudly pointed out to sister jess who was one of my attendants for that trip that given the number of people so advertising the fact their offspring were not deigning to sit on soft automobile seats our order obviously had many converts in the city while taking tea at the fossils that afternoon i heard the distant sound of a diesel locomotive and was reminded of the train which had passed me the night before as id been travelling along the nearby cutting thereafter i went out and walked around trying to recall exactly what the cars i had seen last night on the freight train had looked like happily i have a good memory and the cars proved common i went to the nearest car dealership and inquired about where ford escorts were constructed then spent some considerable time in the area around the junction where morningside road and comiston road join watching freight trains the trains came from the west through the abandoned station immediately to the west of the bridge carrying the crossroads or through the shallow treelined cutting just to the east which had been the point at which id struck out for gertie fossils the night before the trains were few and far between which made it easy to memorise their times via the old clock tower near the junction but i became concerned that i might become conspicuous and so returned to the fossils and borrowed a wooden tray a length of wallpaper which i tore into traysized rectangles and a thick black crayon gertie used to write messages for the milkman thereafter i returned to the railway and the road junction and made a series of sketches of the buildings while i watched for passing trains i was relieved to see one pass westwards loaded with cars at approximately the same time as the one i had hidden from yesterday finding no regularity in the trains schedule from hour to hour but having formulated a plan which might work if they kept to the same timetable on a daytoday basis i returned to the home of gertie fossil and another ceremonial supper followed by a service which i trust i conducted in a manner my grandfather would have approved of the service went well enough i think despite the fact that lucius is profoundly tone deaf and when it comes to singing in tongues can only mumble in them still thinking about my plan and having come to the conclusion that it possessed the flaw of being difficult to carry out in daylight or even around dusk i walked back to the road junction yet again and was rewarded with the sight of a train that would suit me perfectly the following night found me crouched in some bushes on what had once been the platform of morningside station my jacket buttoned up so that no trace of my white shirt showed my hat on so that my face was in shadow and my pale kitbag concealed behind me a light rain was falling from clouds smudged orange with the citys glare i was getting wet above and behind me latenight traffic roared and hissed on the road junction where i had spent so much time yesterday i estimated that i had been waiting for almost half an hour and was beginning to worry that somebody might already have noticed the large cardboard box i had thrown over the train signals further up the track near the next bridge to the east where the railway passes under braid avenue the box had apparently once contained a washing machine i had found it in a skip a couple of streets away carried it to the cutting made sure there was nobody about thrown it over the jagged railings and climbed after it then fought my way through brambles and bushes and heaved the box over the signals i wondered how long it would take for somebody to spot this and report it to the relevant authorities luckily no trains had yet passed in the opposite direction whose drivers might have noticed but i was becoming concerned i had bade the fossils farewell after another solemn supper and another reverential washing of my feet by gertie she gave me food and water for my journey lucius mumbled and spluttered until hit firmly on the back of the neck by his mother whereupon he explained that the cravat he was holding out to me and which i had been about to bless was a present i accepted gerties food and luciuss cravat and thanked them both i had already packed the map of london id asked to borrow i presented them with the drawings of the buildings around the road junction and told them they could keep the wooden staff lucius bubbled with gratitude gertie put her hand to her chest and seemed about to have a seizure she thereupon fell at my feet and so i exited the house backwards as i had entered it with sister gertie patting my boots walking through the drizzle to the railway track and the abandoned station had been oddly relieving i heard a train rumbling towards me along the cutting to the west i gripped my kitbag and flexed my legs which had become stiff squatting in the same position for so long small white lights appeared in the black cutting and the diesel noise swelled the dark mass of the loco rumbled past i could make out the driver sitting staring ahead in the yellowlit cab the engine hauled empty open wagons similar to those i had seen the night before at around this time and which i guessed i had seen twice before in addition on each occasion loaded with new cars the locomotive roared under the bridge supporting the road junction its exhaust billowing around me stinking the train of wagons flowed clatteringly past and for a second i thought my plan had foundered then with a squeal and a cacophony of metallic shrieks the train began to slow i almost jumped up then but waited for the wagons to draw to a stop before walking calmly out of the bushes to where the thirdlast wagon lay stationary i stepped onto it from the weedstrewn platform as easily as a farepaying passenger into a normal carriage i squinted down the girdered length of the train towards the rear then walked in that direction jumping from one wagon to the next on the final wagon there was a single automobile sitting right at the rear i went up to it its bodywork looked dull and mat and felt as if it was covered in wax there was a large pale chalkylooking x scrawled on its bonnet and a sheaf of paperwork taped to the inside of the windscreen i tried the passenger door and discovered it was unlocked i looked up into the drizzle praise be i said smiling and would have whooped for joy had i not been afraid of revealing my presence praise be indeed i said laughing quietly and jumped inside my heart rejoicing a minute later the train gave a series of jerks and started moving forward again gathering speed and taking me away from edinburgh heading south chapter six the day after the great storm aasni and zhobelia scraped my grandfather clean of tea and lard and took him to the farm of mr eoin mcilone the freethinker who had offered shelter to the sisters before on this occasion he also offered succour to their stormtossed foundling for whom he made up the bed in what he called his spare room though in truth it was more like a study or even a library the walls were lined with mismatched bookcases and rickety shelving nailed to the wooden walls all supporting mr mcilones considerable collection of books on philosophy politics theology and radical thought my grandfather continued to drift in and out of something between a fever and a coma for most of the next few days rambling incoherently and moaning the local doctor had been summoned and had judged grandfather too ill to move he had taken the zhlonjiz poultice off my grandfathers head and had applied a proper dressing which aasni had removed and replaced with a fresh poultice the instant she heard the doctors car start up again it took grandfather some days to come fully round the name of mr mcilones farm was luskentyre when my grandfather did eventually become entirely conscious and lucid and sat up in the bed in his booklined room and was asked what his name was he told his two dusky rescuers that he had been reborn and so had no name hearing that he had muttered the name salvador during the first night he suggested this was a sign from god to take that name and asked his rescuers to address him so he then told the sisters of a canvas grip he had possessed which was all he wished to salvage from his past life this canvas bag was most important to him as was proved by the fact that while he could remember nothing else from the day of the storm he knew that he had been carrying the canvas bag and that everything he valued had been inside it he implored aasni and zhobelia to search the beaches and rocks around the place he had been found for the grip and to bring it to him unopened if they did they duly searched while my grandfather recovered often talking at some length about his revelations with mr mcilone mr mcilone was an atheist but he was still fascinated by my grandfathers revelatory experience even if he ascribed it to the effects of being near death losing a lot of blood and possibly being affected by whatever strange herbs liniments and potions were contained in the zhlonjiz poultice mr mcilone suggested that my grandfather make use of the books on the shelves around him if he wanted to think further about his apparently religious experience and this salvador duly did diffidently at first the sisters reported back to say they had found many things washed ashore but no canvas grip before he was really well enough salvador struggled out of bed and joined them in the search and the three of them scoured the beaches coves islets inlets and rock pools of the coast as the search went on my grandfather expounded upon his revelations with increasing force and conviction and in greater and greater detail what the sisters understood with their imperfect english and lack of a common cultural and religious background they found both impressive and interesting mr mcilone loaned salvador an old army ridgepole tent and he pitched it in the remains of an old seaweed processing factory a mile along the coast not far from where grandfather had been washed ashore the tumbledown seaweed plant had become the centre of a highly complicated and acrimonious legal dispute before the war and so there was nobody to turn grandfather and the sisters off the land gradually they made the old factory their base and then their home meanwhile aasni and zhobelia continued to run their travelling shop business and salvador roamed the shoreline further and further in each direction in the shortening daylight hours still searching for the canvas grip in the evenings while the wind moaned through the old building and their paraffin lamps guttered in the draughts which swept the rooms they had refurbished in the factory offices salvador took to writing down the revelations the creator had visited upon him and branded into his brain while the livid mark on his forehead slowly faded to leave a vshaped white indentation and his hair grew in prematurely white often at his elbow were books borrowed from mr mcilones library where he had begun his studies and was still welcome to pursue them grandfather had decided to work his way through every book and tract and pamphlet in mr mcilones spare room a task he was accomplishing with voracious expedition as he used their insights and teachings to further refine his own exactly when grandfather and the asis sisters embarked upon the more intimate aspect of their tripartite relationship is not recorded grandmother aasni and greataunt zhobelia were always coy about the details concerning which one took him to their bosom first or whether they shared him from the start whether there was any acrimony over this especially by the professed standard of the time unorthodox sexual arrangement was not something they ever talked about for his part when asked about such matters salvador has always assumed an air of regretful silence implying that while of course he believes in openness and in the unashamed celebrative sanctity of the bodily communing that is physical love he is first and foremost a gentleman and so forsworn from confiding anything on the subject without the express permission of both sisters which given that my grandmother aasni died some years ago is unlikely to be given unless it is at least partially from beyond the grave salvador found manual work on mr mcilones farm to help himself and the sisters through the next year meanwhile he continued to search and to write with gradually less and more conviction respectively as time went by it took me some time to fall asleep after the carwagon train restarted its journey i suppose i was still excited after the whole business of stopping the train and boarding it the car i was in smelled strongly of plastic the dashboard and much of the other trim was plastic and there were transparent plastic covers over the seats i had taken out my compact sitting board in case i wanted to sit rather than lie down then stowed my kitbag in the front footwell and got into the back seat where there was more room judging that it might be rather noisy if i was trying to sleep i had taken the plastic cover off the back seat and left it folded on the drivers seat then id settled down for the night but had not been able to sleep i felt uncomfortable just being in the car at all it smelled so new and seemed somehow designed to be so archetypically bland that a true luskentyrian could hardly feel otherwise however my delight at having secured such an interstitial mode of transport helped to ameliorate the effects of the cars toxic banality while i was still lying there trying to sleep i thought of my cousin morag the apostate and recalled once sitting with her on the platform of the deivoxiphone in the warm sunlight of a summer four years ago when she was the age i am now and i was fifteen the deivoxiphone was a piece of army surplus which was there at the farm before the order took up residence mrs woodbean the lady who gifted the estate to us had had a brother who collected strange vehicles and pieces of equipment and stored them at the farm he was killed at a meeting of likeminded enthusiasts in perthshire when a jeep he was driving too exuberantly turned over one of the things he collected was a bizarrelooking device on a trailer which had been used briefly during the blitz at the start of the second world war the instrument consisted of what appeared to be a number of gigantic fluted listening trumpets appearances in this case were not deceptive for that was exactly what the apparatus was a huge artificial ear for pointing at the skies and trying to hear german bombers before they arrived overhead a sort of poormans radar in other words and from the little i have heard concerning their efficacy about as useful as one might imagine when i was nine i thought this piece of junk was just the most wonderful mechanism on gods earth and somehow got it into my head that it was important to rescue the thing from the paddock where it was being slowly submerged in weeds and set it up somewhere my grandfather had been dubious thinking the device had too much of an aura of clutter about it but he could refuse me nothing and so hed had the thing taken off its trailer and hoisted up onto a wooden platform built especially on top of the old circular barn at the back of the farm grandfather named it the deivoxiphone i did not of course believe that we would literally be able to hear the voice of god any better using this extraordinary contraption but as a symbol of our ideals i thought it was powerful and important i was going through a serious stage at that age and objects and stories which seemed symbolic meant a lot to me of course as soon as the instrument had been raised to its position of prominence i lost all interest in it but there it sat perched on its octagonal wooden rostrum to the south of the farm aimed at the heavens like an olivegreen multibarrel blunderbuss there was enough space on the decking around it for sunbathing or just sitting looking out over the gardens woods and distant hills and that was where id sat legs dangling over the platform edge arms flat on the platforms lower rail four years earlier talking to morag the pendicles of collymoon she said what the pendicles of collymoon she repeated its a place i saw it on the map oh collymoon i said placing the name yes up near buchlyvie buchlyvie is a wee village about a dozen miles west from the community due south of scotlands only lake the lake of menteith in between is collymoon a scatter of houses on the north shore of the forth east of flanders moss id noticed it on a map too and had passed it once on one of my longrange walks a couple of years earlier it was a pleasant enough situation but nothing special morag lay back in the sunlight gazing up at the sky or perhaps the deivoxiphones preposterous trumpets dont you think thats the most wonderful name though dont you think thats just the most romantic name you ever heard i shrugged i think it is she said nodding emphatically the pendicles of collymoon she said once more with languorous grace it sounds like a romantic novel doesnt it probably a hopelessly slushy one i said oh youre so unromantic morag said slapping my hip im not i protested awkwardly i just have a higher threshold of romanticism thats all i lay down on my side one arm supporting my head facing her i envied morag her shiningly auburn hair it was a billowed halo on the sunbleached planks around her head a wild red river sparkling in the sun it takes more than a few words on a map to make me go all gooey whos all gooey i didnt say i wasall gooey i bet you imagined some dishy guy coming from the pendicles of collymoon dishy morag said her face screwing up as she started giggling dishy she laughed her breasts shook under her tshirt as she chortled i felt my face go red well hunky then i said pinching her arm to no effect sorry if im not up with the latest slang we live a sheltered life here i pinched harder aow she said and slapped my hand away she raised her head up turning on her side to face me anyway she smiled what does make you romantic she made a show of looking about any of the guys here i looked away now it was my turn to lie down on my back and stare up at the sky not really i admitted frowning she was silent for a while then she tapped me on the nose with one finger maybe you should get out more cuz i took her finger in my hand and held it and turned to look at her my heart suddenly beating wildly she looked puzzled for a moment as i gently squeezed her finger and gazed into her eyes then gave a small perhaps regretful smile she took her finger gently from my grasp and said oooh very softly nodding really i looked away crossing my arms across my chest oh i dont know i said miserably i felt like crying all of a sudden but refused to i have so many feelings so much passion inside me but it never really seems to come out the way it should its like i sighed struggling to find the right words its like i feel i ought to be interested in boys or if not in boys then in girls but i almost have to force myself to feel anything sometimes i think i do feel something like im normal but then i shook my head i do the laying on of hands and its like all that passion is earthed then like lightning i looked imploringly at her please dont say anything to anybody dont worry she said and winked youd be amazed at just how discreet i am but listen love is all that matters thats what i think love and romance people get all worked up about things they think are unnatural or perverted but the only thing thats really unnatural and perverted is thinking theres something wrong with people loving each other she patted my shoulder again you do what you thinks right is its your life i turned and looked at her i still hadnt cried but i had to sniff a bit and blink to clear my eyes i cleared my throat it doesnt always feel that way i told her well look whatever it is you feel if it doesnt feel like sex then it isnt all right youre feeling something and maybe it is to do with love but i dont think its necessarily got that much to do with sex if thats the way it is dont try to make it into something it isnt just because you feel its expected of you i thought about this then said yes but what about the festival and everything she frowned and for a while i was able to look into her handsome firm face then she said oh and took a deep breath and lay back beside me looking up at the strange device above us oh yes the festival and everything she said theres that there certainly is i said unhappily lying back i sat in the plasticfragranced car and watched the yellow lights of towns roll past in the distance suddenly bright white lights strobing through the carriages ahead announced a train passing in the opposite direction i ducked down to lie on the seat while the locomotive thundered past then sat up again when the train had disappeared up the track heading north a moments dizziness afflicted me as i sat back up the immediate memory of the white lights flickering through the sides of the wagons ahead seeming to reflect and multiply inside my mind as though my brain was transparent and my skull a mirror my heart raced and my mouth tasted of something metallic the moment passed and i returned to my thoughts of my cousin realising as though to sum up that i had another reason for wanting morag to come back to us if she did not return and be our guest of honour at the festival then i might be expected to step into the breach not to mention having somebody step into mine so to speak that was not a prospect i relished sleep finally claimed me around the border i would guess and i dreamed of high easter offerance and our community and in my dream i was a ghost floating through the farms busy courtyard calling to everybody i knew but unheeded unheard somehow exiled i awoke with the dawn i yawned and stretched then peeked over the top of the windowsill the train was passing through damp flat countryside which i guessed was in the middle of england i took a drink of water then snoozed some more later i sat up and watched the view while eating a light breakfast of cheese and pickle sandwiches and consulting my map of london i detrained at a red signal north of hornsey climbed a low embankment relieved myself behind a bush then scrambled over a brick wall by a bridge and dropped onto a pavement in front of a surprisedlooking indian lady i tipped my hat to her and strolled away feeling distinctly pleased with myself at getting to london in such a sanctified but relatively effortless manner i took it as a good omen that the first person i should encounter down south had been another person of subcontinental origin it was midmorning half past eight according to the clock displayed in the corner of a programme playing multitudinously in a tvshop window time for some back bussing back bussing is a way of minimising travel expenditure which we have used on buses for decades and which can occasionally be employed on other forms of transport it consists of getting on the bus and asking the conductor preferably in a strange alien accent for a ticket for a stop in the opposite direction one is travelling in on being informed one is heading the wrong way it is vital to look most confused and be extremely apologetic usually one will then be allowed to get off almost invariably without paying at the next stop along the route from where one may begin to repeat the process until one arrives at ones destination i waited at a bus stop on high road wood green having selected a stop which served the route numbers i required the kitbag was over my shoulder my sitting board was in my hand i got onto the first bus that came along it had folding doors at the front and the driver seemed to double as the conductor this threw me somewhat i mumbled unintelligibly and got off again blushing the next few buses were all of the same sort i stood looking at the traffic which was slow and noisy and at the buildings which were low and undistinguished after a while and a few more oneperson operated buses i gave up and walked south which was roughly the right direction for kilburn where my halfbrother zeb lived i read my map as i walked and decided i would take the a southwest when i came upon it eventually however i was passed by an oldfashioned bus with an open rear platform heading in the right direction i found the next bus stop with the relevant routenumber and waited a bus came i jumped on and went upstairs unfortunately the four front seats were already taken i chose the next row back put my wooden sitting board down and sat while still in the car on the train i had peeled the top four pounds off my roll of cash and stuck the notes in my jackets inside pocket when the conductor came i held out a pound note and said a ticket to enfield plis whats this then the conductor asked taking the note and looking at it i glared at him he was a small grey man with thick glasses it is beink vun off your pounds i told him in a foreignsounding accent not one of ours mate i think it is na this is toy town money this is it is note of the realm i think you what he held it up to the light na look its scottish innit this heres some old scottish onespot whered you get that then you been savin them or sumfink na mate he said handing the note back to me come on i avent got all day whered you say you was going enfield plis enfield he exclaimed laughing blimey you are in a state arent you youre goin in the wrong direction chum oh sorry miss is it sorry couldnt see for the at should have known you was a girl from you wearing an at inside shouldnt i anyway like i say youre going in the wrong direction love excuse plis i said looking confused you are goinggih in the wronggih doirectshun he said loudly you want to get off at the next stop and look here we go you get up come with me get up yes you thats it i stood up and let the man usher me downstairs to the platform as the bus slowed well put you off ere see that stop over there na na other side of the street love yeah thats the stop for the bus to enfield right you catch bus there it go enfield yeah there you go then mind out bye now he rang the bell and disappeared back upstairs shaking his head as the bus moved off i stayed where i was grinning and waited for the next bus over the next two hours i moved a shorter distance than i could had i walked on two occasions even though it was a couple of minutes before the conductor came to take my money i still got off nearer to the stop id got on than to the next one down the route due to the abominably clotted traffic eventually i got onto a bus and met the same conductor id encountered originally bleedin ell darlin you still lost i looked at him blankly desperately trying to think what to say finally i managed this is enfield plis he took me across the road himself and left me at the bus stop i admitted defeat and walked south to the grand union canal i hiked along the towpath to maida vale then headed northwest to the house where my halfbrother zeb lived on brondesbury road the basement and the ground storey of the threestorey endofterrace house were boarded up and i had to go round the back and pull corrugated iron sheeting aside to gain entry to the rear garden i banged on the back door eventually a voice rang out above yeah i stepped back and looked up at a female face the sides of her head were shaved long fair lengths of hair like skinny pigtails hung down from the back of her head she appeared to have several rings piercing her nostrils good morning i said im looking for zebediah whit is he here zeb dunno whore you isis isis yes nice name thank you most people call me is im a relation of zebediahs tell him im here if you can find him right hang on the door opened a minute later and brother zebediah stood there barefooted stuffing a crumpled shirt into tattered jeans wow is jeez shit brilliant wow zeb is two years older than me he was even skinnier than i recalled and his black hair both longer and much more tangled his face looked spottier where it was visible between little tufts of black facial hair that probably signalled he was trying to grow a beard i made the sign and held out my hand to him zeb looked confusedly at it for a moment then said oh wow yeah sorry course like yeah and took my hand he kissed it and went down on one knee yeah like wow beloved blessed beloved isis welcome cool yeah the girl id talked to first stood in the hallway behind she stared openmouthed at my halfbrother then at me brother zebediah i said i am pleased to see you please arise he did so grinning broadly he attempted to comb his fingers through his extravagantly untidy locks but didnt get terribly far i handed him my kitbag he took it and following my gaze turned to the girl with the halfshaved halfpigtailed hair oh yeah yeah ah beloved is roadkill roadkill the beloved is yeah he nodded with his whole body and grinned then made the sign and bowed ushering me forward i entered the house taking off my hat and handing it to zeb the girl was still staring at me i nodded gravely at her charmed i said chapter seven brother zebediah had not received the letter informing him of my imminent arrival the squat for such the house he lived in was had at best an erratic postal service which seemingly depended largely on the sympathy or otherwise of the postperson on whose round it was the household did not possess a telephone so the letter had been our only means of communication accordingly no preparations had been made for my arrival zebediah did the best he could however considering he was all set to give me his room which he shared with roadkill his girlfriend while they decanted to the loft but on viewing the room and the state of the plaster on the walls i suggested that the loft might be more suitable for me as i could rig my hammock safely between two of the roof trusses roadkill looked relieved at this the loft was haphazardly floored with old doors and random bits of wood i had zeb rearrange these and take away the single electric light bulb which hung from the roof i would use a candle for light in fact i had been hoping that the squat might be entirely free of electricity and i had been disappointed to find that it was not in addition zeb generously donated a rug and a small table from his room to make the place look more welcoming i stuck my head out of the skylight to check which direction was nornorwest then instructed zeb who had found a hammer and two sixinch nails where to rig my hammock with it in place we repaired to the kitchen where zeb lit the stubs of some scented order candles and ceremonially washed my feet in a small plastic basin while roadkill prepared food in the form of some type of pastie or samosa i handed her some blessed tea and a tiny amount of lard she looked at the two little twists of greaseproof paper oddly then looked inside sniffing this smells like tea she said she had a pleasant accent i was unable to locate anywhere more exactly than southeast england it is i told her eeurgh this one smells of animal that is lard i said and looked severely at zeb who was cleaning between two of my toes with his little finger he looked guilty as well he might it was obvious that brother zeb had not been performing certain of our dietary rituals what like from pigs roadkill asked that is correct i told her cant handle that man roadkill said taking the tiny package in two fingers and dropping it on the formicatopped table near me roadkills a veggie zeb said apologetically that is quite all right i said and smiled at the lass i understand as you no doubt know our own faith forbids eating some meat too in the form of that from anything with two legs like birds for example i saw roadkill and zebediah exchange an odd look at this point and surmised that zeb had been corrupted by the city to the point where he had eaten fowl my mission down here might have to include bringing brother zebediah back onto the straight and narrow too i suspected if there was time appearing not to notice their guilty glance i went on if youd just put a little of the tea into whatever you are making for me id be most grateful what tea leafs in the patties she asked just the merest sprinkle i told her as if it were salt or pepper its not for taste it has symbolic value only right she said symbolic value sure she turned away shaking her head i retrieved the little twist of lard and pocketed it i would anoint the food with it myself just before eating there was a bang from the hallway footsteps and a large young white man with very short hair and wearing a grubby anorak with colourful badges on it entered the kitchen he stopped and looked down at zeb who was still washing my feet i smiled up at him chroist he said in an irish accent and grinned close zeb said sighing youve got a stepsister called what hagar i confirmed nodding but thats a guys name innit zeb zeb looked vague and shrugged yeah roadkill said like that strip in the sun for a moment i wondered what possible relevance removing ones clothes in daylight had before i recalled there was a popular newspaper called the sun well as i understand it i said hagar is a biblical name a hebrew name that of abrahams wifes maid her slave cool it was early evening and we were walking back from an offlicence on kilburn high road through the roar and stench of the rushhour traffic i had volunteered to help zeb and roadkill fetch some celebratory alcohol for the squats evening meal i rang my code back to the woodbeans house from a nearby callbox while they were actually buying the drink this turned out to come in the shape of garishly labelled plastic bottles full of something called litening stryke a form of cider i thought some more and i have a stepbrother called hymen hymen roadkill said like in virginity like in maidenhead thats right a stepbrother yes weird does he really use that name regrettably no brother hymen is an apostate and a what an apostate one who has renounced his or her faith oh im afraid so apparently he makes a living diving for golf balls in lakes on american golf courses and goes under a new name now dont blame him i mean hymen it is a male name you know i said hymen was a greek deity the son of apollo wow roadkill said admiringly you know a lot about this holy stuff dont you i smiled well you might say its my job zeb guffawed then looked a little fearfully at me but i just smiled what exactly are you supposed to be roadkill asked i am the elect of god i told her the third generation of our family born on the twentyninth of february wow in my case i was born on the twentyninth of february nineteen seventysix officially if you were to ask me what age i am i would have to say that i am four and threequarters shit roadkill laughed not four and threequarter years of course four and threequarter quadquennia i am nineteen years old hmm roadkill looked thoughtful so what sign does that make you astrologically it is our belief that the elect have no sign it is one aspect of our holy separateness freaky she shook her head shit you must have to have a hell of a birthday party if it only comes round every four years we try to make it special i agreed tell roadkill about the festival is zeb suggested putting together the first real sentence id heard him utter since id arrived you mean you havent brother i asked he aint told me nothin about this sect of yours roadkill said hitting zeb on the forearm with her free hand well shit you know complicated zeb said reverting actually i was glad he hadnt while any festival is by its very nature not something one can really keep secret salvador did prefer us not to bruit the details of ours about too much for the mediasensitive reasons i have already gone into however i judged that telling roadkill was probably a reasonable course of action it happens at the end of may every year before a leap year i told her we ask those wishing to participate to perform the act of love without contraception as frequently as possible around that date to increase the chances of another elect being born fuck roadkill said after a moments thought an orgy well thats a pejorative term isnt it i said no that implies exclusively group sex i believe whereas the festival is concerned to promote all forms of potentially procreative activity really its just a huge celebration the public side of it wouldnt embarrass the most prudish soul what goes on behind closed doors afterwards is up to the individuals concerned oh yeah roadkill said well then why not come and visit us i suggested you and zeb would be very welcome at any time of course but especially so if you came for the festival i said to her roadkill glanced at zeb who frowned down at the pavement i dunno she said he hasnt said nothin about it zeb glanced at me and i frowned at him well you should come i told roadkill not necessarily to take part in the procreative side of the festival but just because its such an enjoyable time we have music and dancing and feasts and the children stage little plays its a time of celebration of rejoicing i told her i laughed there is absolutely no compulsion to engage in constant sex if you dont want to believe me hmm right roadkill said noncommittally as id spoken the words though id wondered who i was trying to convince as far as i was concerned there was indeed a degree if not of compulsion then certainly of expectation that i would be taking a full part in this festival even if morag did show up i recalled that remark of grandfathers to the effect that i was looking healthy and telling me i had a duty to enjoy myself just a couple of days ago the pressure id be under if my cousin didnt come to the festival hardly bore thinking about great things it seemed to me might be expected of my ovaries roadkill had obviously been thinking along the same lines so she said smiling at me and flexing one pinkrinsed eyebrow were you underage last time or is this your big you know big occasion this festival i smiled as confidently as i could well yes its possible that i might be expected to be one of the centres of attention this time round wow roadkill said you got anybody lined up yet as a father i mean i shrugged im still thinking it over i said which contained an amount of truth so do you have to get married first or anything no we regard marriage as optional to love and procreation some people actually treat their partners better without that form of commitment and some people are better as single parents especially in our community where child care can be shared but if i did want to marry i could in fact i could marry myself i told roadkill who looked a little dubious at this i explained as an officer of the luskentyrian sect im empowered to officiate at all religious ceremonies including marriages and there is a precedent for the officiating cleric himself or herself being one of the parties to the marriage freaky roadkill said hmm i said ah i nodded at the lane that led round to the back of the squat here we are in february my grandfather decided to marry aasni and zhobelia asis he had not just with gods permission but indeed at their insistence bestowed upon himself the title very reverend which meant that he could carry out religious ceremonies the sisters agreed that their ménage à trois ought to be regularised and a ceremony was duly held in the specially decorated hall of the old seaweed factory the only witness was eoin mcilone the farmer who had given the sisters and later grandfather shelter and succour he and salvador had taken to playing draughts several evenings a week in the spare roomcumstudy at luskentyre farm a couple of miles along the road from the seaweed factory they argued incessantly each evening and with increasing vehemence as they gradually drank more and more of mr mcilones whisky but partly because they both enjoyed arguing and partly because neither could ever remember what they had been arguing about when they woke up the following morning mr mcilone alone in his narrow bunk set into the wall of his old farm house grandfather in between the two asis sisters in his bed on the floor of the old factory office they both entirely looked forward to their draughts games whisky and arguments salvador and his two brides spent their wedding night in the seaweed factory as usual but the sisters had redecorated a different room in the offices and moved the bed two mattresses covered with bedding through to their candlelit marital suite that night a rat ran across the bed terrifying the two sisters and rather spoiling the whole event and the next day salvador constructed a kind of huge threeperson hammock out of various lengths of rope stout wooden battens and a large piece of sailcloth all of which hed found washed ashore over the previous few months while hed been scouring the shores for the lost canvas grip slung from the iron roofbeams of the old factory office in their giant hammock the sisters felt much safer and when the factory and almost everything in it were burned a few months later by a crowd of indignant locals with flaming torches and grandfather and his two wives moved into a barn at mr mcilones farm the one thing the girls had rescued from the fire and bundled into the back of the van apart of course from greataunt zhobelias special chest sent to her from khalmakistan by her grandmother and repository of the zhlonjiz had been the giant hammock actually i strongly suspect from hints dropped by calli and astar who heard the original story from aasni and zhobelia that it was a very small crowd of indignant locals and i know that it was late one friday night and that drink had been taken and the men concerned had probably heard some grotesque exaggeration of grandfather and the sisters marital arrangements and they probably didnt mean to torch the factory they were just looking for salvador to give him a good hiding he was however already hiding having taken refuge in the sisters van which was outside they had concealed him beneath some bolts of reject tartan theyd picked up for a song from a firesale in portree but being drunk and clumsy one of the men fell and smashed his lantern and the fire started and the rest ran away while grandfather cooried deeper under the bales of tartan and the sisters at first tried to put the fire out and then just saved what they could but the way grandfather tells it is better at any rate although the original monumental hammock was left behind in luskentyre when the community moved to high easter offerance and salvador and the sisters thereupon enjoyed more normal sleeping arrangements in the shape of a couple of beds shoved together that is why hammocks are sacred to us and why an elect is expected to sleep in one at least every now and again and whenever they are away from the community and preferably with their head pointed towards the community to show their thoughts lie in that direction personally ive always liked hammocks and never really felt comfortable in ordinary beds so i rarely sleep in anything else i lay in my hammock the loft was spinning i suspected i had put away too much of the litening stryke cider over the course of the evening at home when we wish to partake of alcohol we almost invariably drink our own ales produced in the brew house at the farm there are certain ceremonies in which small amounts of a special holy ale are used and generally the fact that fermented or distilled fluids have a certain effect on the human brain is taken as being at best a benediction and a gift from god and at worst an example of their irritatingly inventive sense of humour which it would be dangerously unwise as well as distinctly unsporting not to be a willing party to at the same time however while a degree of tipsiness is welcomed and indeed even encouraged at certain social events in the order extreme inebriation and loss of control of ones mental and bodily functions is very much frowned upon community beers tend to be relatively heavily flavoured but mild in strength whereas the cider we had consumed with the evening meal had been just the opposite and i was suffering the effects of having treated one like the other the evening had passed very pleasantly the others in the squat were dec the irishman whod walked in as brother zebediah had been washing my feet boz a most sizable and lustrously black jamaican man with a fabulously deep slow voice scarpa his interestingly pale south london girlfriend and wince a smaller version of boz but confusingly with an irish accent they had been a little wary of me at first but things had gradually become more convivial first over the meal of vegetable curry sweet potatoes and chicken the last of which i couldnt eat of course and was glad to see brother zebediah passed on as well and later while watching a videotaped film in the squats living room which was bare but functional and in terms of newlooking electrical entertainment equipment surprisingly wellequipped i was especially initially distinctly uncomfortable sitting in the presence of all this cluttering technology but felt that it was my duty to be sociable i was after all the ambassador for my faith amongst these people as well as owing them the normal courtesies a guest owes hosts partly no doubt the feeling of relaxation i experienced was due to the effects of the litening stryke as well as the blow drug cigarettes they smoked but partly too it was thanks to my somewhat playing the holy fool regaling them with tales of our life at high easter offerance our history revealed truths commandments and rituals they all appeared to find this most entertaining and there was much laughter and giggling dec wiped tears from his eyes at one point and asked me jayzus is what are you on a mission i informed him to further hilarity i think zeb was a little embarrassed in places but i counted it no disgrace for our order to be the cause of such enjoyment in others and it is anyway the case that what one initially laughs at and finds quite ridiculous can often on more sober reflection come to seem quite sensible and latterly even wise there are more ways than one in which to spread the good word i had managed to have a quiet word with zeb at one point helping him to do the dishes after the meal i briefly explained the nature of my mission and told him i expected his full cooperation in the search for our cousin morag which would start promptly on the morrow well i never heard her being internationally famous zeb muttered towards the suds well she is brother zeb i told him are you in the habit of attending classical concerts or mixing in that sort of circle no but well then i said emphatically brother zebediah looked as though he was going to argue about this but i looked sternly at him and he smiled meekly and looked down nodding we were watching one of the videotaped films it appeared to consist largely of cars chasing each other lots of large colourful explosions and american men becoming angry and sweeping coffee tables mantelpieces and so on clear of breakables when i realised i was getting overly intoxicated i stood and made my goodnights requesting only a pint glass of water to take to my hammockside i tried to read a few passages from the orthography by candlelight but confess that my vision even with one eye determinedly closed was not really up to the task i closed the word of the creator and vowed to read twice as much the following evening i disrobed to my underwear and climbed into the hammock with a practised ease that even my sobrietycompromised state could not endanger it occurred to me as i lay there swinging in my hammock and trying to ignore the pressure in my bladder that we were all abbreviated i from isis to is zebediah to zeb declan to dec winston to wince i wasnt sure about boz or scarpa but one certainly sounded contracted though both could have been nicknames i got up to relieve myself donning my jacket for modesty as i left the toilet i heard somebody say something like got the bucket and brother zebediah barged out of his and roadkills room wearing only his trousers and an amulet dashed past me holding his mouth and was sick in the stillflushing toilet i hesitated looking from the toilet to the wooden ladder which led to the loft uncertain whether to offer to help my halfbrother or not zeb came out of the toilet a few moments later sighing and smiling are you all right brother zebediah i asked yeah he said and smiled broadly yeah he nodded and took me by the shoulders and then hugged me youre beautiful is he said and sighed again then walked off smiling back to his room i climbed back to my hammock in the loft somewhat bemused but thankful that zeb seemed able to shrug off minor maladies with such alacrity chapter eight what about kangaroos kangaroos i said wondering what brother zebediah was talking about kangaroos he confirmed as we boarded the underground train at kilburn park there were seats free and i thought i detected zeb making to head for one and sit despite the fact he did not have his sitting board with him he coughed and made a show of walking past the first free seat to look at a newspaper lying on a more distant seat then came back to where i was standing near the doors which closed the train moved off kangaroos i reminded him oh yeah he said he shrugged in a quizzical manner eat them i see i said and thought the train charged through the dark tunnel shaking and rattling it was midmorning it had taken an unconscionably long time to rouse my halfbrother from his slumbers but i had been loathe to embark upon such a crucial part of my mission alone i had been happy with my navigation through london the previous day considering that i had not visited the british states capital before and while admitting the relative failure of my back bussing ploy i thought i had done reasonably well in coping with a city of such in my own experience unprecedented size nevertheless i did not imagine myself to be streetwise and suspecting that todays expedition would be more complicated in nature i believed that i would therefore benefit from having zebs considerable local knowledge built up over a number of years of capital living and the subject of obvious if quiet pride in his alltoooccasional letters home extracting zeb from his room or even his bed at a decent hour mat morning had proved to be the most demanding and frustrating task of my mission so far my gentle cajolings offered cups of coffee eulogies on the beauty of the day waitings of toast under the nose admittedly jocular threats of excommunication and even an invigorating reading from a particularly stimulating passage of the orthography all failed to elicit more than low groans from the narrow crease in the covers that was all i could see of my brother in faith zeb was alone in bed at this point roadkill having already left finally it took a graduated series of containers a thimble an egg cup a tea cup a pint glass and a bucket to convince him that i was serious and that he was getting no more sleep that day no matter how much he was hurting people usually give in after having the thimble of water poured over them but zeb held out until the tea cup which indicated either a remarkably violent hangover or admirably steely determination i knew which one id have put my money on if we were allowed to do such things he certainly didnt look well and seemed to have developed a cold overnight he spent so long in the toilet i suspected he was trying to indulge in some more sleep though when i banged on the door he sounded already awake he did eventually succeed in what he colourfully described as getting his shit together and we finally left the house at the disgracefully late hour of ten oclock zeb wore grubby training shoes with no socks the same flayed jeans hed worn the night before a shirt a holed jumper and an old parka i looked through one of the holes in his jumper as we walked to the underground railway station brother zebediah i asked suspiciously is that shirt reversebuttoned aw he said shit is please look christ come on brother zebediah this backsliding has to stop come on off with the jumper aw fuck shit come on no is i stood in front of him and helped him off with his jacket then pulled the jumper over his head christ i dont i mean this fuck unreal we were outside a newsagents and i did not wonder at the looks we were getting what with this stream of profanity zeb held his parka and jumper while i undid his shirt buttons one by one and did them up properly fuck is what i mean roadkill i mean she we share both fuck whatevers you know lying about reversebutton your shirts that the saved shall know each other i quoted him yeah but fuck reversebuttoning apparently started because salvador was ashamed of having mismatched buttons on his shirt one time when he had to go to stornoway it became one of our rituals when it was realised that it could be a way of recognising other orderites as well as acting as a constant reminder that we are different reversebuttoning consists simply of pushing a shirt button through from the outside of the buttonhole so that the button is hidden and faces in towards the skin there i said pushing zebs shirt back into his jeans and patting his concave belly heavens brother zebediah theres nothing of you zeb sighed and put his jumper back on then shrugged his jacket over his narrow shoulders he made to move off ah i said and pointed at his forehead jeez is fuck hell i dont expect you have any of the blessed mud i told him but you may use mine this once and luckily i have brought some spare vials from the community one of which i can leave with you shit zeb said but let me make the little v on his forehead with the mudointment i pocketed my jar there i told him taking his arm and continuing towards the station now we are indeed ready to face whatever the city will throw at us zeb had gone very quiet after that and only spoke again once we had our tickets when he asked about eating kangaroos tricky one i admitted could kangaroos forelegs really be said to be legs at all given that they seem to be used more as arms yeah zeb said see zactly could go either way i said nodding grimly sort of thing one might have to ask the founder my pal zeb said ozzie had some said like great best meat ever tasted lean delicious totally brutal brilliant really hmm i said in that case id probably err on the side of generosity i have always been of the opinion that god does not normally make things appetising for no good reason right good thought so yeah zeb looked relieved for a moment and then oddly thoughtful as though some aberrant brainstate had succeeded in troubling him orwell he said tentatively orwell i echoed puzzled he shrugged four legs good i stared nonplussed at him for a moment then understood ah i exclaimed clapping him on the back and causing him to stagger two legs bad i laughed thats quite funny brother zebediah he still looked confused our train terminated at baker street we returned almost to the surface i stood to one side while zeb queued at the ticket office it being a frustrating property of the london underground system that the techniques of back bussing cannot be applied i looked around such crowds of people i was conscious of the complete reversal of the situation one experienced living in the community where for days weeks and even in certain cases months at a time one would know and know fairly well every single person one came into contact with to see a stranger was an event here the opposite was the case one assumed that everybody one bumped into was a stranger and meeting a familiar face was generally a cause for joy and celebration excuse me can i help you said a quiet spoken middleaged man in a grey coat he put one hand gently on my elbow his other hand held a black briefcase are you lost he asked me far from it i told him looking down at his hand i am one of the found i suspect it is you who are one of the lost sir what he said looking confused friend you see before you one of the most fortunate and favoured people to walk the sorry soil of earth for i walk in the sight of god i have the joyful honour of oi zeb said walking smartly up to us the man muttered something vaguely apologetic and moved away into the crowd head down brother zebediah i was engaged in missionary work just there i rebuked him as we returned to the train tunnels like shit fuckin pervert more like got be careful zeb i am not totally naive concerning the ways of the world and the vices of the city i told him quite possibly that gentleman did have some nefarious and even sexually predatory motive in talking to me but i ask you what other sort of soul is more in need of being saved i have a duty as an officer of the true church and especially as the elect to spread the good word wherever and whenever possible i am grateful for your concern but you must not assume that i am being gulled when in fact i am evangelising i am perfectly capable of requesting help should i happen to need it this seemed to send zeb into something of a huff and i reflected that perhaps it was as well that i hadnt gone on to point out that as i was an inch or so taller than he not to mention better and more sturdily built his intervention in such circumstances might not always be as decisive as he seemed to imagine zebs pique continued onto the train and even my attempt to jolly him out of the mood by suggesting that we repair to the buffet car for a cheering cup of tea was met with a roll of the eyes and a huh still i hoped i had proved something regarding my resourcefulness and general urbanity just by revealing that i knew of the existence of such civilisational complexities as buffet cars on trains our next change of line came at green park station where we ascended to buy tickets for covent garden are you sure this is the quickest way to travel i asked my halfbrother as clutching another couple of tickets we descended underground once more buses zeb explained slower yes but it seems wasteful to have to keep buying separate tickets for each leg of the journey all this extra toing and froing from platforms to ticket office and back cannot be efficient yeah zeb sighed crazy innit once we had established ourselves on the correct platform for covent garden i stared suspiciously at an illuminated sign which read jubilee line southbound hmm i said yet another change of line and a concomitant return to the surface for another pair of tickets at finsbury park station took us at last to finchley it was a short walk from the station to the block of flats off nether street which had been my cousin morags last address i was unprepared for the opulence of the building i suppose i have always associated flats with council dwellings and even slums and had rather assumed that to her credit morag was putting up with cramped conditions during her stay in london so that she could save money however from the size of the cars parked in the blocks car park and the general look of the place this was no rookery for the poor marble steps led to glass double doors revealing a foyer lined by sofas and potplants i shook the door handles but the doors appeared to be locked riff raff brother zebediah said keeps out he was looking at a sort of grid in the marble wall composed of small boxes with buttons and little illuminated labels there was a grille to one side number he asked thirtyfive i told him he ran his finger down the little plastic windows his fingernails were long and soiled however i thought the better of saying anything here he said thirty five says mr mrs coyle he pressed the button yes a female voice said from the grille after a short delay excuse me brother i said to zeb taking his place good morning madam i said into the grille i am sorry to disturb you but i am looking for ms morag whit the internationally renowned baryton soloist excuse me morag whit the internationally renowned baryton soloist i repeated she is my cousin does she still live here this is the last address we have for her no im sorry the lady who used to live here left a couple of months ago i see its just that im her cousin you see and my family are rather anxious to trace her did she leave a forwarding address not really might i ask who that other gentleman is there with you i straightened and looked with a degree of consternation ill admit at zeb he nodded over our heads to a small box just inside glass doors camera he said good grief i said are we on television closed circuit zeb said lordy i gulped is that a muchwatched show my mouth had gone a little dry hello said the small voice from the grille zeb stared at me frowning with incomprehension then he grimaced not broadcast he said sounding exasperated security for flats private i thought i understood and quickly turned back to the grille blushing and flustered i do beg your pardon madam i misunderstood this is my halfbrother brother zebediah another luskentyrian im sorry said the female voice zeb sighed behind me and i caught him shaking his head out of the corner of my eye another what another luskentyrian i replied feeling my face colour again explaining these things to blands could be timeconsuming its complicated im sure well the voice said with an unmistakable note of finality im very sorry i cant help you she left no forwarding address i said desperately we just want to make sure shes all right well please she did leave the address of her agent or manager or something for anything urgent but just the address not phone or fax that would be wonderful i said oh thank you well just hold on ill go get it there was a click i turned feeling relieved to zeb who was looking vaguely out at the trees between us and the road there we are i said and clapped him enthusiastically on the back he stumbled forward coughing and had to jump down a couple of steps before he could regain his balance he glared back at me hello said the metallic voice from the wall our journey from finchley was relatively simple taking the northern line south to tottenham court road and then walking along oxford street and down dean street to brewer street the premises corresponding to the address we had been given for cousin morags agent a mr francis leopold did not look very encouraging dirty books zeb said and made another forlorn attempt to pull his hand through the topological and trichological nightmare that was his hair we stood on the pavement looking at the oddly blank window of something calling itself an adult book shop well i said looking to one side the number may refer to this establishment zeb glanced porn cinema or here zeb stuck his head into the doorway peep show downstairs upstairs models girls i must have looked blank prostitutes he said sighing ah i said well where shall we inquire first zebs narrow face managed to display a breadth of dubiety inquire really wise brother zebediah i said shocked youre not embarrassed are you i waved at the varied sexual emporia in front of us such places are stigmatised by a hypocritical society which is still frightened by the power of sexuality nevertheless in their own admittedly somewhat sordid and avaricious way such places celebrate the physical communion of souls actually even as i was saying all this i was feeling a bit dubious about it but i was more or less quoting a certain brother jamie a convert from inverness whod gone to stirling university the campus of which was only a few miles from the community for some reason this had all sounded more plausible when hed said it now that i was actually confronted with the establishments he had been talking about they didnt look celebratory at all however id launched into this minisermon so i supposed id better round it off false signal or not why i exclaimed by our doctrine they ought to be accorded the status of churches brother zebediah looked levelly at me through hooded eyes for a moment he took a deep breath then nodded slowly churches right yeah way go okay cool uh he nodded at the nearest door after our inquiries at the various facilities of dubious repute met with no success whats this abaht whore you from never erd of im never erd of ur neevir look i got a business to run inni and fack orf comprised the more helpful of the various replies we received my attempts in the cramped foyer of the erotic picture house to explain that despite the obvious squalidness of the surroundings and the primarily financial motive behind the pornographic concerns we found ourselves in the midst of there was still a degree of common cause between such grubbily commercial exploitations of humanitys most holy instinct and the pure sanctified expression of that urge to be discovered through our holy order was met initially with glazed incomprehension then quickly thereafter the back of my jacket and shirt collar were gripped extremely firmly by the heavily ringed hand of a very large crophaired gentleman in a suit pushing my hat down over my eyes so that i could hardly see where i was going and zeb and i were given an undignifiedly rough escort past a variety of lurid posters to the doors where we were ejected into the street outside with such force that i almost lost my footing and came within inches of colliding with a person on a motorcycle this person then skidded to a stop pushed up his helmet visor and informed me in no uncertain terms of my sexual activity mental acuity and physical size characterised me correctly by my genitals then changed tack and insinuated that my hat was supported by a presumably grossly enlarged male sexual organ and finally that my parents union had not been sanctioned either by the state or an established church i tipped my hat and begged his pardon he roared away shaking his crash helmet zeb joined me on the far pavement his collar had been in the other fist of the man who had seen us off who was now standing with his arms massively crossed filling the doorway to the cinema a few people in the crowded street were looking at us okay zeb asked dignity a little tarnished i told him adjusting the lapels of my jacket otherwise uninjured and you fine zeb said shrugging his shoulders forward and pulling down on his jumper good i said adjusting my hat properly time for a cup of tea i think what do you say tea yeah right café there the royal opera house covent garden proved no more able to offer help if rather more polite and stately in the manner of not providing it well obviously we are not really the sort of venue one would find a soloist at said the young man who had been summoned by the box office to talk to us he seemed quite pleasant and well dressed though he appeared to be troubled by his hair a length of which over his right temple continually fell over his right eye and had to be swept back into place i was surprised to find somebody working for an opera house who did not appear to open his teeth or make more than the most cursory of movements with his lips when he spoke i see i said our surroundings now were rather at the other end of the scale from the pornographic picture house only a fraction of a mile away though the amount of gilt and deep vibrant colours gave the magnificent foyer a similar if more monumental feel but you have heard of her morag whit the internationally renowned baryton soloist baryton the young man said sweeping his blond hair back and staring at the central chandelier high above us baryton he pursed his lips isnt that in ireland somewhere it is a form of viola da gamba i said frostily with extra resonating strings yes the young man said drawing the word out as though it was an extrusion yes he nodded you know i think i did see something about a concert once it would probably be my cousin who was soloist i told him hmm he said crossing his arms and putting one hand up to his mouth apart from that i really cant help you im afraid i cant imagine what your cousin was doing writing to you on our headed notepaper but then i imagine it isnt something we keep under lock and key exactly and of course with photocopiers and so on these days well he smiled tipping his head to one side his hair fell over his eye again he swept it back once more i see i said oh well thank you anyway i fished in one of my jacket pockets my pleasure he said smiling he turned to go his hair falling over his eye again as he did so please with my compliments i handed him a kirbigrip well i said this is all most odd brother zebediah and i stood on the terrace of the royal festival hall in a mild blustery river wind looking across the broad greybrown back of the river thames pleasure boats crisscrossed before us sunlight glinting on their windows as they rocked across the waves and slapped through the scissoring wakes of their fellow craft yep i turned to face zeb arms folded my back against the railings zebs face looked pinched and jerky somehow but i have seen the poster i protested yep the royal festival hall claimed never to have heard of cousin morag they certainly had not hosted a concert by her at eight oclock on tuesday the th of february which was unless my normally accurate and reliable memory was failing me the date and time detailed on the poster which hung in the hall of the mansion house back in high easter offerance and which my grandfather was so proud of the eventually helpful lady member of staff we had been referred to was adamant that no person of that name was known to her and that indeed there had never been a solo baryton concert in the south bank complex at least when i mentioned the instrument itself she had heard of that i was beginning to wonder if it existed she was slim cardiganed and wellspoken and her hair was neatly bunned i suspected at the time from her confident manner and general bearing that i had met a memory as retentive as my own but knew that one of us must be wrong and so implored her to check she invited us to take a seat in the coffee bar and disappeared back into the administrative offices of the building to reappear with a large batteredlooking thing she called a printout and which detailed all the events in the various parts of the complex over the year if there had been such a concert it would probably have been more suited to the purcell room she told us leafing through the broad greenlined pages could the poster have got the year wrong i asked she looked sour and took off her glasses well it certainly didnt happen last year id remember but if you really want i can check ninetytwo id be terribly grateful i said in a small voice taking off my hat and trying to look waiflike she sighed all right i watched her go brother zebediah i said to him he looked startled as if he had been falling asleep in his seat i think we ought to get the lady a cup of coffee dont you he looked at me i nodded towards the serving counter he looked cross for a moment me he said always me paying not he waved one hand at me turn i glared at him no he said faltering brother zebediah i said drawing myself up and putting my hat back on i am on a highly important mission with the blessing of and instructions directly from our founder himself i do have some emergency funds but otherwise i am relying on the support of the blessed whether they adhere strictly to our code or not i hope you are not already forgetting the gravity of this matter morag has been central to our missionary plans for some time now quite apart from being especially favoured by our dear founder and due to take centrestage at the quadrennial festival we all have to make sacrifices at such a time brother zebediah and i am shocked that you should right okay right all right im going he said interrupting me before i had really had a chance to make my point he loped off to the counter the lady did not want any coffee which put me at a disadvantage with brother zebediah for the rest of the meeting during which i became convinced that cousin morag had indeed never played on the south bank i thanked her as she rose to leave and then i sat back thinking zeb drank the cup of cooling coffee with a smug expression and an unnecessary amount of noise no forwarding address no agent no concerts nobody has heard of her i exclaimed and her a soloist of international repute yup weird in such a situation the average person might start to doubt their sanity however luskentyrians have it drummed into them from a very early age that it is the outside world the world of the billions of blands that is obviously demonstrably utterly and in the short term irredeemably insane while they themselves have had the immense good luck or karma if you like theres a fine and still debatable theological point at issue here to be born into the one true church with a decent grasp of reality and a plausible explanation for everything i did not therefore even begin to question whether i was in full possession of my faculties with the singular and brief exception of my memory as mentioned above though i was well aware something was seriously out of kilter somewhere and that as a result my mission was rapidly taking on a degree of complexity and difficulty neither i nor my fellow officers back at the community had bargained for urgent action was obviously called for what i really needed to do was talk to god chapter nine i think my grandfather still holds that one of the greatest achievements of his ministry was the conversion of mr mcilone to the set of beliefs which at the time our founder was still in the act of formulating if i say that i suspect it was also an accomplishment my grandfather found extremely enjoyable and hence craved to repeat i think i am paying our founder a compliment given the intrinsic goodness and holiness of the act concerned mr mcilone was a kindly generous man but a freethinker an atheist of long standing who had had the strength of will and character however fundamentally misguided and wrongheaded to maintain and preserve his sinful belief in the face of the opprobrium and isolationary contempt of a conservative and even selfrighteous community of the sort that tends to get called closeknit by those not inclined to search overly long for their images of social cohesion while by our creed we must count the dour presbyterians of the western isles with their cruelly humourless feardemanding and vindictivesounding idea of god our allies whether they like it or not and the humanely compassionate mr mcilones of this world our evangelical prey at best and outright opponents at worst and it is undeniably more effective preaching to the already half converted than attempting to plant the seeds of faith in souls hardened by a history of material falseness there is nevertheless often more common cause spiritually to be found with those who are naturally generous sharing wise and enlightened but by chance brought up outwith the sight and hearing of god than with those who while part of a community or faith whose beliefs are in some strategic sense more in keeping with our own are by the very strictness and severity of that persuasion individually far less happily unrestricted in the joy of their worship of god and the appreciation of the beauty of the universe the world and the human in both its spiritual and its physical form i think myself that by the sound of it mr mcilone was one of those sensitive souls prone rather to despair he was like my grandfather in seeing little but cruel idiocy in the actions of his fellow humans but different from him in choosing for his response the easy easeful option of simply condemning everybody and turning his back on the world from what i have read and i think i may fairly claim to have read a fair amount for my age i think it must have seemed a world worth turning ones back on the most destructive war in all history was finally over but only at the cost of ushering in with those two diabolic nuclear dawns over japan an age which seemed to have finally brought the epoch of apocalypse to earth the thunderous earthshaking power to annihilate whole cities in an instant that humanity had habitually ascribed to its gods was now at mans own beck and call and no god ever seemed so fearful and capricious as the new possessor of that power humanity had thought itself progressing after that earlier war to end wars only to discover once the dust and soot had settled that one of the worlds most civilised and sophisticated nations had found no better outlet for its ingenuity than to attempt to annihilate industrially an ancient people who had probably contributed more to the worlds store of learning than any other single group and perhaps knew too that their own nations had colluded in the prelude to that terminal obscenity and what future beckoned after this spasm of destruction and the death of any idea that humanity was in some way rational that humanity indeed was reliably humane why only the continuation of war in another colder form with weapons fit for the end of the world allies becoming enemies and the real victors of the european war turning upon themselves and their new conquests with redoubled savagery as though their twenty million dead had only given the apparatus a taste for it meanwhile mr orwell on another hebridean island near the whirlpool wrote what he almost called this was mr mcilones world then as was the pallid washedout britain of the stillrationed late forties and for all that the semiindependent croft and fishing economy of the western isles softened the blow of some of the shortages most keenly felt in cities on the mainland it was still a hard cold windswept place where a man lived close to land or sea with only his god family and friends and sometimes the drink to sustain him and provide a little comfort perhaps it is not so surprising then that mr mcilone brought into contact with my grandfathers messianic blazing certainty and the unconventional but obvious love he shared with his two exotically foreign beauties should feel that he was missing out somewhere that there was another retort to the worlds absurdities and viciousness besides hermetic hermitlike withdrawal whatever factors emotional personal or philosophical eventually produced this holy seachange in mr mcilone by the end of it was complete and our founder had his first real convert i dont think he ever felt his wives fully believed though they gave every appearance of behaving he also had the run of the farm at luskentyre the continuing opportunity to study in its library the use of its buildings access to whatever funds and produce it gave rise to and an eventually decisive say in its running and so it was there that our sect the true church of luskentyre made its first home from until when mrs woodbean gifted us the estate at high easter offerance on the green and ancient flood plain of the river forth far to the southeast of those wild isles well it smells like that liniment stuff me mother used to slap on us soon as we coughed out of turn dec said flopping into a huge cushion on the floor beside me i had partaken of the precious zhlonjiz unguent some hours earlier in my loft bedroom shortly after zeb and i had made our way back to kilburn from the south bank happily this required no changes of underground train line i had pulled up the loft ladder and closed the loft door placing the ladder on top of it i removed all my clothes save for my knickers and sat in the lotus position meditating for some time beforehand a cup of water id brought from the bathroom sat to one side a scented order candle to the other i struggled to open the tiny jar the cap gave an audible crack when it finally turned the sharp spicy salve inside was black in the candlelight i took a little of the thick dark cream on my little finger and placed some on my forehead some behind my ears and some on my bellybutton i slipped the rest into my mouth scraping it off against the back of my teeth and quickly swallowing it i washed it down with the cup of water the gritty black cream burned my tongue and the roof of my mouth as it slid down my throat i coughed and my nose ran and the fierce dark smell of the stuff seemed to surround me fiery and raw and dissolving reeking of a mountainous halfmythical east i sniffed back breathing deeply to suffuse my being with the magical balm relaxing and trying to let my soul open to the voice of the creator attempting both to ignore the vast city and its millions of cluttered unsaved souls and at the same time to use their untapped ignorant capacity for receiving to focus the signals of god upon myself in short it did not work i waited for the blink of an eye and the life of an old god i waited until the next heart beat and the next ice age i waited for the merest whisper of murmured acknowledgement and the erupting scream of god at last losing patience with us all i waited long enough for the candle to flicker and go out my legs to grow sore and my skin to prickle with goosebumps eventually i opened my eyes and stared into the darkness aware of an edge of light round the sides of the loft door and the vague buzz of voices and smell of food drifting up from downstairs i lowered my head and might have wept until i rebuked myself for such selfpity and told myself that if fault there was it was my own and i had nobody else to blame i sniffed rose stiffly and dressed tidied things up and lowered the wooden ladder through the opened loft door what liniment i asked declan i dunno he said lighting a small rollup cigarette some stuff she just called it di lineament and dabbed the damn stuff on us at every opportunity worst was when you had the toothache stung like hell worse than the toothache i thought it smelled like coriander said roadkill who was rolling one of their drug cigarettes we were all save for scarpa in the living room listening to some modern cd music on the hifi i had eaten after the others having missed the main meal while i was attempting to receive i had perhaps misguidedly attempted to explain to the others what i had been trying to do in the loft probably i ought not to have mentioned the zhlonjiz at all roadkill at least seemed sympathetic brother zeb also now rolling what they called a number seemed to be ignoring me dec boz said stretching his hand across me to offer declan the drug cigarette which was currently in circulation dec seemed to hesitate and boz offered the long white tube to me hey isis child you want to try the holy ganja instead i looked at it id probably just cough i told him though i was thinking about it our creed holds no thing wrong just because the blands say it is and from what i had heard both at school and from various people at the commune cannabis was a benign if befuddlingly distracting drug indeed i felt much more discomfited by the presence of all the electrical activity around me than i did by the haze of smoke that hung in the room ah go on with ye declan said very well i said and exhaled to the bottom of my lungs i reached out for the drug cigarette but boz moved it away out of reach hey dont take too much there isis youll give youself a coughing fit sure enough you just breathe in gentlelike i breathed in looking up at boz who was sitting on another giant cushion i of course was on the wooden floorboards i took the long cigarette and sucked on it not too hard easy now isis boz said as i gulped and tried not to cough and handed the thing quickly on to declan i exhaled and took another few deep breaths cooling my fiery throat at least the cannabis had that in common with the zhlonjiz you all right now isis boz asked looking at me i nodded i rather liked the way boz said isis slowly and deeply with the emphasis on the sis fine i said with only the smallest of coughs my head started to spin alcohol never acted as rapidly i passed on the next spliff and went for another cup of water but took some of the next drug cigarette and the next there was much talk and laughter and at one point i found myself trying to explain to roadkill that in a sense everything was action at a distance and that this was the most important thing in the world even though as i told her this i knew i was talking complete nonsense i told her this too and she just laughed some people i didnt know came in and boz went through to the kitchen with them when i went there for more water later on i saw him sitting at the table using a knife and a pair of scales to measure out small pieces of black stuff which he then wrapped and gave to the strangers boz smiled at me i felt a little faint at the time so i just smiled back and went through to the living room again i surmised in a sort of hazy dissociated way that boz must be cutting up weights to be distributed to small businesses in the area so that their scales were all properly calibrated to my shame it was at least a good quarterhour before i saw declan rolling another joint with the same black stuff made crumbly by having been heated with a cigarette lighter and realised what boz was actually doing this led me into a fit of the giggles so intense that at one point i almost lost control of my bladder once i had calmed down i explained the cause of my confusion to the others whereupon several of them started laughing too causing me to relapse into hysteria a little later i dried my eyes excused myself and bade them all goodnight i negotiated my way carefully and deliberately to my lofty boudoir taking great care always to have three points of contact as i climbed the ladder and leaving the loft trapdoor open to light my way taking equal care to tread only on the doors providing the lofts flooring and even more extra special care when having partially disrobed i swung myself into my hammock my head was spinning the loftspace was spinning and i had the distinct impression that they were in contrarotation to each other i closed my eyes but this only made the sensation worse i thought it not impossible that with my senses so unusually disrupted i might be able to open my soul to god and so receive their word but not until i could both stop the room spinning and prevent occasional aftershocks of giggles afflicting my body i took several deep breaths and tried to compose myself by thinking of our family history a subject which requires considerable concentration and an alert retentive and some might argue an open mind salvador whit and aasni whit née asis begat two daughters brigit and rhea and a son christopher who was salvadors first boychild and born on the th of february and so was known as the elect of god and given a long impressive name which ended in the roman numerals ii because he was a secondgeneration leapyearian salvador whit and zhobelia whit née asis begat two daughters calli

probably begat a daughter helen fiona galland and salvador whit probably begat a daughter heather gay sumner and salvador whit may have begat a daughter clio after that it gets complicated the room was still spinning i imagined i was in a porcelainhulled boat drifting silently upstream to the pendicles of collymoon with my cousin morag at my side she was slowly bowing the throaty manyvoiced baryton and somehow that was our means of propulsion i was floating in a silvery spaceship its rocket tubes like organ pipes i was lying under the deivoxiphone listening to the voice of god but we had a crossed line and all i could hear was opera i lay on the floor in sophis room in the little turreted house across the halfruined bridge talking about playing the organ in the cathedral while she lay on the bed leafing through magazines but my words were coming out of my mouth as literal bubbles with little fat naked men and women in them performing strange and unlikely sexual acts in each one i sat at the flentrop organ but the keys just snarled at me and became a piano with the top down and locked and all i could hear was the sound of a dwarf running up and down inside stamping out some stupid monotonous tune and swearing loudly but muffledly i lay in the moonlit clouds of my grandfathers beard listening to the clustered stars sing overhead the northern lights curved and twisted in great shawls of ghostly luminescence like the flapping sails of some vast craft fit to sail between the galaxies i wondered hazily if this might be the start of a vision it had been my ambition to start having visions and so to take over from my grandfather and follow in his footsteps as it were but despite a few promisingly unsettling sensations i had experienced over the years i had never been privileged with such a visitation my grandfather had told me that there were different ways to hear the voice of god one could calm oneself prepare ones mind meditate and relax and eventually know what it was god had said to one the way everybody else in our order did or one could as he had in the past at any rate just suddenly find oneself dumped willynilly effectively at random into one of those fitlike visions over which he seemed to have no control but that was god speaking to him too so if what i was experiencing now was the start of a vision i reasoned then perhaps my attempt this evening had worked after all albeit not quite as i had anticipated howyi isis you all right there said a voice nearby making me start i must have closed my eyes i opened them again i had no idea how much time had passed there was somebody standing by the side of my hammock a tall shadowy shape looking down at me id recognised his voice declan i said focusing with some difficulty what was it he had asked then i remembered yes im fine i said how are you ah i just thought you might be feelin a bit strange you know yes no im all right right he said he stood there for a moment just visible in the light from the loft trapdoor you sure now he asked putting his hand out to my forehead and running his fingers through my hair he stroked the back of my head ah jayzus isis youre a beautiful kid ye know that really i said which was probably the wrong thing chroist yes anyone ever tell you you look like dolores oriordan he said bending closer who the cranberries who i repeated confused actually his hand was producing quite a pleasant sensation at the back of my head but i knew that as a man declan would be unlikely to regard that as an end in itself ye mean yeve never heard of the cranberries he laughed gently bringing his face nearer to mine by god ye have led a sheltered life havent you i suppose so look declan ah yere glorious so ye are isis he said and used his hand at the back of my head to lift my face up to his as he bent further forward i put my hands up to his chest and pushed declan i said turning my face away to avoid his lips and getting an earful of wet tongue youre very nice and i like you but ah isis come on he said putting one arm round my hammock and pulling me to him his lips seeking mine i pushed harder and he let me go leaving me swinging to and fro between my roof beams he sighed then said ah isis whats the matter will ye not even as he leant forward and reached out again i extended my hands to push him away but he stumbled i think and next thing i knew he was falling forward on top of me forcing the wind out of me declan went whoo our combined weight swung the hammock out away from over the doors forming the floor there was a creaking noise from somewhere beyond my feet then a jerk and in a moment of helpless horror i knew what was going to happen next oh no i shouted the nail brother zebediah had bashed into the roof truss to take the foot of my hammock sprang out of the wood and sent declan and me tumbling forward into the darkness under the slope of the roof had declan not had both arms around me my hammock and sleeping roll and had i not had my arms trapped for that same reason one of us might have been able to save one or both of us but instead the second nail at the head of my hammock gave way too and sent us crashing lengthwise to land neatly between two rafters onto the rough grimily ridged surface of the plaster it broke like puddleice and we fell through into light surrounded by dust and brittle shards of plaster with me screaming and declan snouting and somebody else screaming too we must have twisted in midair as we fell because i landed beside declan with only his head thumping onto my midriff we landed half on the floor of the room below which proved to be bozs and half on the double mattress which was bozs bed and on which he was lying at the time propped up by a couple of cushions and watching a video we must have just missed landing on his feet he gave a surprisingly high shriek and pulled the bed sheet quickly up over himself as declan and i bounced once and lay stunned under a rain of dust and more lumps of plaster id got just the vaguest glimpse of something black and purple boz had been holding as we crashed down onto the bed in front of him i moved an arm to shift some plaster off declans head and my hip and caught a glimpse of bozs video being shown on another remarkably newlooking television set on the other side of the room i saw a woman sucking in a somehow exaggerated way and from a distinctly unnaturallooking angle a mans erect penis i stared at this two in one batch of seconds life was strange declan moaned and looked up instantly aged thirty years by the grey dust coating his face and hair he looked at me and then at boz he coughed oops he said i hardly heard i was staring with my mouth open and my eyes boggling almost out of their sockets at the screen of the television set the girl in the erotic video was now lying on her back by a sunlit swimming pool while the man did something to her one could not see her face contorted with what was probably meant to be ecstasy i couldnt believe it i pointed with one shaking hand at the television declan followed my gaze to where the woman pouted and grimaced on the screen that i exclaimed loudly is my cousin morag the internationally famous soloist on the baryton declan watched the screen for a moment looked back round at me glanced at boz who still seemed stunned into wideeyed silence then shook his head releasing a cloud of dust yer arse he laughed thats fusillada debauch the porn queen and the only thing shes renowned for is playing the pink piccolo pal chapter ten the next morning in the living room i studied the videotape boz had been watching boz had recovered his cool and then started laughing at us while the dust was still settling around his bedroom declan apologised to boz first i noticed but then afterwards to me he repaired the roof as best he could with a couple of posters over the hole in the ceiling and one of the lofts door floorboards on the other side boz slipped into a pair of boxer shorts he and i cleaned up the plaster my head was still spinning but i felt somewhat more sober for the experience of the others only roadkill seemed to have either heard anything or thought there was aught untoward about what they had heard i told her zebs handiwork had proved fragile to the sound of declan banging the hammock nails back into the roof trusses i felt faint again and waving away decs apologies climbed back up to the loft taking my hammock and bedroll with me i shook it free of dust and rehung it then collapsed into it and was asleep within minutes next morning with a head that felt stuffed with cotton wool and a cough that made me think i was coming down with the cold i politely asked boz for the videotape we will pass over my attempt by the laying on of hands to cure the sore knee which declan woke up with and which was probably a delayed result of our fall but what better proof is needed that all this clutter robs the saved of their holiness boz seemed unembarrassed at my request which was a relief and went upstairs to get the video cassette he showed me how to work the videotape player then went to make some breakfast the sensation of so deliberately using the video player the television and their remote control devices not just sitting in the same room to be sociable while they were used made my teeth ache our rules concerning such matters take the form of disciplines rather than outright prohibitions and i did experience a kind of excitement in taking command of this seductive blackly buttoned technology however my principal emotion was one of tense fractious unease and i grew extremely frustrated when the machines did not seem to obey the remote controls i muttered at the machinery and felt like throwing the remote controls across the room suddenly it occurred to me that this must be how blands feel all the time i calmed myself and persevered and before too long everything behaved the videotape began to play the woman was definitely morag her voice sounded euroamerican somehow but i could hear the scottish accent coming through every now and again from what i saw the video itself had a semblance of a plot but it was patently used merely to provide punctuation for the various unlikely sexual exploits the heroine morag fusillada indulged in with both sexes as for the videos effect well i had a chance as never before to admire my cousins bounteously sleek physique and cannot say i was left unmoved by the theatrical but obviously unfaked copulatory shenanigans displayed though quite why the videos makers thought that it was always necessary to show the men ejaculating each time was a mystery to me the sight which i had not witnessed before hardly seemed to warrant the amount of time devoted to it and made me feel slightly queasy nevertheless all in all i admit i felt quite hot and bothered as i sat there and viewed rather more of the production than strictly required to establish morags identity i handed back the tape to boz over breakfast he asked did i really know fusillada debauch i replied that i did and asked him what he was doing that day soho again suddenly the location we had been sent to the previous day seemed less like a complete red herring the revelation that my cousin had at the very least a sideline as a worker in the sex industry suddenly made looking for her agent in this area seem quite reasonable and so we had returned to try again to find mr francis leopold brother zeb had put his hair into a bushily disorderly ponytail as a disguise he and boz who seemed unduly impressed that fusillada was my cousin and i suspect hoped we might bump into her together distracted the large man with the muchberinged hands in the foyer of the erotic cinema while i slipped up the stairs between the picture house and the entrance to the adult book shop the stairs were narrow and steep three doors led off the landing at the top which was lit by one grubby dirtstreaked window whose outlook was anyway largely obscured by the facade advertising the cinema next door round a turn in the landing another flight of stairs led to the next storey i peered at the doors each had a little sign on it kelly silk madame charlotte and eva sm i ascended to the next floor where the landing was marginally better lit vixen cimmeria fl enterprises ah ha i knocked on the door there was no reply after half a minute i tried the handle but the door was locked a siren ever the chorus to the citys songs sounded somewhere nearby i knocked again and rattled the door the door to the left marked cimmeria cracked open and a sliver of dark face looked out i smiled and tipped my hat good morning i said yeah oh indeed it is i said gesturing to the window i glanced back at the door to fl enterprises im ah looking for mr leopold is this his office yeah i could still only see about two inches of the black face looking at me through the gap between door and jamb i cleared my throat ah good only he doesnt seem to be in yeah do you know when he might be expected to return no oh dear i said and took off my hat looking dejected the one eye of the negress i could see moved her gaze taking in my hair my face and then torso what you want anyway she asked opening the door a fraction wider im trying to trace my cousin morag whit i think she might be better known as ah fusillada debauch the single eye widened the door closed and it occurred to me that perhaps i had said something wrong well this wasnt proving too fruitful i thought gripping my hat to replace it on my head a chain rattled behind cimmerias door and it swung open the woman came out onto the landing glancing around then stood with her back to her door her arms crossed she was small and very black with tiedback hair she wore a black kimono which looked like silk her head tossed up once like a horses what you looking for her for you really her cousin oh im her cousin certainly her mother was my fathers sister were from scotland never have guessed really i thought perhaps my accent would rather give that was irony child the woman said looking away for a moment with widened eyes oh i beg your pardon i said blushing i felt awkward but for some reason i trusted this woman i decided to trust my instincts anyway to answer your first question im looking for morag because well its complicated but we i mean her family are concerned about her are you now yes also i hesitated then sighed may i be frank with you miss cimmeria she nodded well i said fingering the rim of my hat the plain fact is morag is or was a member of our church back home and we are concerned that she has lost her faith of most immediate concern is the matter of a festival that we are to hold at the end of the month a very important festival one that only takes place every four years cousin morag was to be our guest of honour at that and now well we dont know what to do the festival is important as i say but her soul is more important and personally i am worried that my cousin has fallen under the spell of some religious charlatan and judge that ultimately to be the more important business but im afraid it is the question of her attendance at the festival which presents us with the most immediate predicament cimmeria looked through narrowed eyes face turned slightly what church is this oh i said its the true church of luskentyre the luskentyrians as were usually known i dont expect youve heard of us were a small but active faith based in scotland we have a oh i suppose you could call it sort of an ashram a commune near stirling we believe in cimmeria held up one hand okay okay she said smiling you people christians strictly speaking no we regard christ as one prophet amongst many and the bible as one holy book amongst many we believe there is merit and wisdom to be found in all holy teachings we do believe in love and forgiveness and the renunciation of excess materiality and fine spare me cimmeria said holding up her hand again she nodded at the door so youre looking for frank i explained about visiting morags old apartment block in finchley the day before is mr leopold her agent i asked cimmeria shrugged agent manager whatever phew i said grinning on the right track at last i hit my thigh with my hat i can be quite shameless cimmeria laughed and pushed her door open come on in youll have to excuse the mess this is early for me i doubt it can match the mess created last night in the squat where i am staying while in london i said accepting her invitation twenty minutes later i joined boz and zeb in the same cafe zeb and i had retreated to a day earlier they both appeared unharmed and in good spirits all right chaps yeah fine cool you were okay isis i sat down between them getting brother zebediah to move over i had tea i told them with a very nice lady called cimmeria whose real name is gladys she told me that mr leopold is indeed morags fusilladas agent and manager and that he was here just yesterday but that he has had problems with vat i said looking inquiringly from one to the other vat boz nodded slowly then sipped carefully at his coffee value added tax isis he tutted and shook his head seemingly unimpressed with the concept indeed i said well apparently mr leopold has been experiencing difficulties with this vat for some time now and is currently helping customs and excise with their inquiries huh well so zeb said so i said cimmeria gladys told me that she thought mr leopold lives in the county of essex in a village called gittering near badleigh and thinks that that was where he took a number of the papers and files he previously kept in the office she suggests we try there what do you say essex zeb said with an expression on his face which given we were sitting in a cafe in central london might have been better suited to accompanying the word mongolia delivered in the same tone of voice isis you think your cousin might be there well i said apparently some of the scenes for certain of fusilladas videotape productions were shot in mr leopolds home there which is called la mancha cimmeria gladys knows this because some of her friends have been there to take part in them so as morag is no longer living at the flat in finchley i suppose it is not impossible she is there though we have no guarantee of course boz thought about this he looked very big and bulky in baggy black trousers and an expensivelooking black leather jacket he wore a black peaked cap it was back to front so that people behind him could read the white letter x what the hell he said i wasnt doin nuthin much today anyway and i heard about essex girls eh he delivered what looked like the gentlest of pulled punches past me to brother zebediahs arm zeb rocked in his stool and looked pained he forced a smile while he rubbed his arm suppose yeah shit essex shit lets make tracks i said jumping off my stool and unable to resist nudging zeb in the elbow he looked startled and stared concernedly at his elbow boz slurped on his coffee we took a bus to liverpool street station and a train from there to badleigh not having anticipated a journey outside the capital i had not brought my sitting board so zeb and i stood in the aisle by bozs seat boz read a paper called the mirror i whiled away the time for zeb by reading him parts of passages from the orthography and asking him to recall what words came next he was shockingly poor at this though that may have been because completing the pieces of text would have required talking in sentences of more than one word and he had obviously quite got out of that particular habit at one point when boz had gone to the toilet for a quick toke which i took to be jamaican slang for a bowel movement given the amount of time he was away i asked zeb why does boz wear his cap back to front zeb looked at me as though i had asked him why boz wore his shoes on his feet its like baseball cap he said scornfully i thought about this ah i said really none the wiser the city went on and on every time i thought we had finally left the metropolis behind the patch of greenery id based this assumption on would turn out to be a park or an area of waste ground eventually however while i was engrossed in the orthography zeb had gone off to the toilet some time earlier the city gave way to countryside and when i next looked up we were sliding through a level landscape of fields and narrow lanes dotted with buildings villages and towns all sliding quickly past under a sky of small clouds i felt some relief at having left the vast busyness of the city behind as though my cluttersmothered soul was finally drawing something like a clear and unobstructed breath again badleigh proved to be a flat town with a split personality a villagelike old town with low erratically streeted buildings to one side of the railway line and a cubical landscape of mediumrise brick and concrete on the other one building i thought at first must still be under construction proved on closer inspection as the train slowed and we got ready to get off to be a multilayered car park he says its three miles isis boz told us after talking to the man in the ticket office good i said a stroll no way man boz said grinning from behind dark sunglasses i call us a taxi he loped off to the exit for a mere three miles i said aghast to zeb city zeb said shrugging then appeared to think his face brightened briefly lanes he said with a hint of pride i thought he nodded happily lanes he said again and sounded pleased with himself lanes i asked lanes narrow no pavements cars speeding walking dangerous he shrugged lanes he turned and walked to the doors beyond which boz could be seen getting into a car lanes i muttered to myself feeling obliged to join my two comrades well im sorry dear but you cant kneel on the seats but i could put the belt round me i said struggling to pull the restraining seatbelt out far enough thats not the point though love is it the regulations say that my fares have to be seated if youre kneeling youre not seated are you could i sit on the floor i asked no i dont think so but id be seated yeah but not on a seat you wouldnt be seated on a seat know what i mean there something wrong with her mate the childs eccentric man shes from scotlan im sorry hey isis you got the man here thinkin he got some sort of lunatic in the back of his car here well i meant like piles or sumfing actually he goin to be askin us to get out an walk if you dont settle down sorry man you just start the meter rollin now we get this sorted look i said havent you got some sort of board or something hard i could sit on the taxi driver looked round at me he was a hunched little chap with alarmingly thick glasses sumfing hard to sit on he said then glanced at boz see told you he reached down the side of his seat and handed me a large book here we go the a to z will that do i tested it the battered hardback flexed a little it will suffice thank you sir all part of the service he said turning back nuffink to be embarrassed about had the same problem myself once cept you dont usually see people young as you wif it do you no i agreed as we started off and i belted myself in too flustered to follow what he was talking about the car smelled powerfully of a cheap sharp perfume we passed the three miles to gittering being regaled with graphic tales of our drivers multiple hospitalisations and various operations attractive ranch style zeb said staring with admiration at the large house beyond the gate separating road from driveway at the far end of the drive la mancha was a white bungalow complex with roofs at various angles and large windows backed by closed curtains the gardens looked well tended although somebody had abandoned a gaily painted horsecart in the centre of the lawn there was a newlooking plough standing on a strip of grass across the drive from the lawn and a brightly decorated cartwheel lay against the side of the house it looked terribly clean and tidy to be a working farm there were various signs on the shoulderhigh white wooden gate one said la mancha another said private property keep out and another said beware of the dog and had a colour picture of the head of a very large dog on it just in case the reader was under any illusion concerning what dogs looked like this is it i said looking through the bars of the gate for a slide or staple that would allow us to open it whoa zeb said tapping the beware of the dog sign i slid the gates bolt and started to push it open what i said oh dont worry about that they probably dont have any dogs besides i told my two uncertainlooking companions as i held the gate open for them i have a way with animals especially dogs i closed the gate after us then took the lead and headed for the house we were halfway down the drive when we heard the deepthroated barking we all stopped a huge hound came running round the side of the building looking very much like the one on the sign at the gate it was brownblack its head was huge and there was spittle already flying from its jowls as it came powering towards us it looked about the size of a foal jeez run isis run i glanced back to see zeb and boz who was still looking back at me heading smartly for the gate i felt calm i had faith and i really did have a way with animals i thought for a moment weighing up the situation behind me the dog barked again it sounded like a dinosaur with a bad cough i started to run a way with animals does run in our family when my grandfather persuaded mr mcilone to become his first apostle and moved in to the farm of luskentyre he discovered a gift for working with cattle and horses he was always able to calm them when they were distressed and often able to tell what was wrong with them even before the vet arrived my father inherited the same talent and was largely in charge of the sheep and cows at high easter offerance even before he left school though our founder thought that animal husbandry was beneath an elect still salvador could refuse his son nothing a trait that seems to have been made transferable to other elects and become an article of faith im glad to say certainly i have benefited from it and so my father was allowed to indulge his vocation for farming to his souls content i do not share my fathers love of animals though i like them well enough and have inherited both a modicum of the facility for empathising and working with them to which he fell heir from my grandfather plus an ability to heal them when i was happy that zeb and especially boz were convinced i was following them as they sprinted for the gate i stopped spun round onto the grass and went down on all fours with my forearms extended in front of me i crouched there on the grass looking up at the giant dog as it bore down on me i sort of flopped forward a little bouncing up and then down arms still extended backside up in the air the dog looked confused and slowed as it approached i repeated the movement and to my enormous relief the beast dropped back to a walk and made snuffing huffing noises i repeated the gesture once more the dog hesitated looked around and then padded forward i made the same movement its dog for lets play and lowered my eyes when it growled at me when i looked up again its tail was wagging it came up to sniff me i have as i have said a gift if a large dog comes running at most people running smartly away is probably by far the best idea whatever a minute later i was squatting on the grass patting my new slobbering panting friend and looking at zeb and boz who were on the far side of the gate staring at me yall right there with that thing isis so far i called i wouldnt come in just now though ill see if its happy with me standing up then ill head for the front door the beast growled when i made to rise i could have sworn the ground shook i decided that dignity must bow to expediency and so crossed to the front door on all fours with the huge dog padding contentedly at my side i reached up and rang the doorbell the hound barked loudly its voice echoing in the open porch and then it ran away back the way it had come disappearing round the side of the house i stood up it was some time before the door was half opened by a tall young man with streaked blond hair whom i immediately guessed was not mr leopold somehow the way cimmeria had talked about him and even the place where he had his office did not tally with the bronzed fitlooking fellow standing in front of me from the vertical half of him i could see he was wearing a peaked cap like bozs worn the wrong way round a tshirt and jeans yeah what you want ah good afternoon my name is isis whit i put out my hand the young man looked me in the eyes his brows furrowed pleased to meet you i said taking off my hat with my other hand and smiling i used my eyes to indicate my hand and cleared my throat delicately the young man went on scowling at me my hand went unclasped excuse me sir i am offering to shake hands i had been given to understand that good manners extended to this part of the country he frowned even more deeply wot sir i said sharply presenting my hand almost in front of his face perhaps it is simply that persistence pays with such people he looked at my proffered hand as though seeing one for the first time and finally tentatively put out his own hand and shook it there that wasnt so difficult now was it i said setting my hat back on my head at a jaunty angle the young mans frown had lifted a little im very sorry to disturb you and your fine dog but im looking for a young wheres tyson he demanded his frown deepening again i beg your pardon tyson he said he looked over my head to the lawn eyes swivelling i hazarded a guess at who tyson was the dog hes fine and in good voice where is he then he escorted me here to the door and then ran back round the side there when the bell went wot you want he asked suspiciously letting the door swing further open to reveal that he was holding a long polished wooden stick gosh i said whats that he gave me a look not dissimilar to the one id received from zeb on the train when i inquired about the directional orientation of bozs cap its a baseball bat innit he told me it crossed my mind to ask whether he was holding it the right way round but i just nodded appreciatively is it really i said well as i was saying my name is isis whit im really looking for my cousin morag whit i was told that mr francis leopold is her manager and that he lives here so im sort of looking for him its just that my family is rather worried about morag and id really like to spain the young man said suddenly spine i asked mishearing spain he repeated you know the country mr leopold is in spain the fellow looked troubled well no hes not in spain no we was supposed to go like but his voice trailed away and his gaze wandered over my head somewhere customs and excise i ventured chirpily how you know about that he asked scowling as he focused on me again ah bad news travels fast doesnt it he was looking over my head again he nodded whos that then he hefted the baseball bat i looked round to see boz and zeb in the driveway advancing tentatively zeb waved the skinny white one is my cousin zebediah i told the young man the big black one is our friend boz what they want then the fellow said slapping the baseball bat into the palm of his hand at that point i heard tyson barking zeb and boz promptly turned tail again and ran for the road tyson appeared racing after them but broke off the chase halfway up the drive as the men scrambled over the gate the dog barked in a perfunctory manner then came swaggering across the lawn towards us pausing only to collect a small rubber ball which at first i thought hed swallowed but which proved to be lodged wetly between his massive jaws he joined us in the porch and dropped the ball at my feet i squatted on my haunches and tyson let me chuckle him under his chin snuffling how you do that the young man asked seemingly mystified i have a way with animals i explained stroking tysons back and smiling at the hound you wot he said his voice suddenly high i have a way with animals i repeated looking up at him oh he said he gave what could well have been a laugh right he patted tyson on the head the beast growled anyway he said shes not here who morag i asked rising carefully and keeping one hand on tysons back i could feel the animal vibrating but there was no audible growl yeah shes not here oh dear where shes gone gone really well she would be wouldnt she i suppose wh to an elf farm haha i didnt quite catch that shes gone to at that point a telephone rang somewhere behind him he looked back into the hall then at me then at tyson telephone he said and swung the door until it was almost closed i heard him say ullo then yeah ullo mo and for a second i was filled with confusion wondering what my uncle mo was doing phoning here before i realised it was probably morag i glanced down at tyson and smiled the dog growled i put one finger to the edge of the door and pushed very gently so that it appeared the door was being blown open by the breeze the young man was a couple of yards inside the hall by a small table on which the telephone sat he still held the baseball bat he frowned at me i grinned vacuously then stooped and picked up tysons rubber ball the ball was old and worn and porous the beasts saliva felt cold and slimy as it oozed to the surface of the rubber toy i threw the ball out onto the lawn tyson took off after it yeah got it the young man was saying into the phone and glanced down at a little cube of paper notelets by the side of the telephone fine no yeah na no word he said turning so that he had his back to me he lowered his voice yeah actually theres somebody here just now askin for you i heard him say as a panting noise and a hefty thud on the outside of my left thigh announced tysons return i kept my eyes on the young man as i went down on my haunches and retrieved the sodden ball cant the young man said he turned back to look at me what you say your name was again isis i said he turned back hunching slightly isis i heard him say next second he jerked straight wot he barked sounding angry you mean its this one you mean its this bastard ere this one i didnt like the look or the sound of this a plan i had been turning over tentatively at the back of my mind suddenly thrust itself to the fore and demanded an immediate yes or no i didnt really have to think about it i decided the answer was yes and threw the soggy rubber ball into the hall the ball squelched on the carpet just behind the young man and bounced past him further down the hall tyson pounced in after it and shouldered the fellow out of the way making him bang his leg into the telephone table aow fack the young man said he recovered his balance by clunking the baseball bat against the wall the salivasaturated ball rolled into a distant room tyson thundered after it call yer back the young man said and threw down the phone tyson skidded and disappeared from view there was an expensivesounding crash from the room tyson the young man yelled sprinting after the hound tyson you cant he screamed charging into the room and disappearing from view i slipped in through the door as more crashes and oaths resounded from the room concerned i had been hoping the young fellow would just put down the phone thus giving me a chance to talk to morag assuming that had indeed been her calling but the handset was back in its cradle i picked it up anyway but heard only the dialling tone you facker come ere the hall floorboards shook to the sound of something like a sideboard falling over i looked at the little cube of notelets by the side of the phone the one the young man had glanced at when hed said yeah got it a minute or so earlier there was a telephone number written there i glanced down the hall just as the young man appeared in the doorway holding tyson by his studded collar and waving the baseball bat at me his face looked somewhat florid tyson had the ball clamped in his teeth and seemed pleased with himself right the young man yelled jabbing the bat towards me you ice or whatever your fackin name is aht the ahse now i was already retreating then the fellow added and mo says to stop boverin her or else right youll get a slap you will he glanced down at tyson who seemed to have become vicariously upset as well by now and was glowering at me growling sonorously the young man let go the beasts collar get the bint my son bothering her i was thinking as tyson dropped the ball and leaped towards me with a furious snarl somehow i didnt think that my way with animals was going to prove effective this time i stepped back into the porch and swung the front door closed behind me then i turned and ran i cut across the lawn to the drive i heard the door open behind me and the young man yelling something then all i could hear was barking boz and zeb stood at the gate eyes wide i got the impression as i raced up the drive that the two men were getting ready to help me over the gate out the way i yelled waving one arm thankfully they moved one to each side i got to the gate a second before tyson and vaulted it cleanly staggering as i landed but not falling tyson could probably have jumped it too but contented himself with slamming into the woodwork and making it shudder he continued barking furiously the young man was charging up the drive shouting and waving his baseball bat i gathered myself looked from zeb to boz and nodded down the road race you to the station i panted chapter eleven we stopped running after a bend a hundred or so yards up the lane when we lost sight of him the young man was standing on the road outside the opened gate holding the howling bellowing tyson by the collar with some difficulty and still shouting and waving the bat we slowed to a trot as we entered the small village of gittering itself a quietlooking place with a village green and a single public house boz chuckled hooee he said that was some big mean muthafucka of a dog shit zeb gasped less he looked pale and sweaty sorry about that chaps i said hey youre an athlete isis boz said admiringly thank you but youre crazy what the hell you doin stayin back when that hound of the fuckin baskervilles come at us like that i told you i told him i have a way with animals youre crazy boz laughed according to my maternal grandmother yolanda i told him setting my hat straight upon my head again and trying not to let my heart swell too much with pride and vanity i am a tough cookie yeah he said sounds like your maternal grandmother yolanda aint no fool neither he nodded at a telephone box on the far side of the village green lets call a taxi zeb and i watched for pursuit while boz rang a number on a card inside the telephone box but neither tyson nor his blond handler appeared boz came out of the telephone box its the same guy hes on his way says hell bring the book for you how kind i said excuse me would you i took a deep breath gritted my teeth and stepped into the telephone box i studied the instructions then stuck my head and one arm out zeb some change please zeb gave me his longsuffering look but coughed up a halfpound piece god forgive me i whispered as i inserted the coin and buttoned the number that had been on the pad by the telephone in la mancha boz and zeb looked quizzically in through the glass good morning said a pleasant female voice i was startled even though i was prepared to be spoken to after years spent using telephones as telegraphs it was slightly shocking to hear a human voice rather than the ringing tone clissolds health farm and country club the warm welcoming voice said how may i help you bothering her i thought and reluctantly restrained myself from asking to speak to morag im sorry i said this is clissolds health farm and country club may i help you the lady said again with a little less warmth her accent was definitely english though i couldnt place it more accurately oh i was trying to reach ah scotland i said sounding flustered i think you have the wrong number the lady said sounding amused wrong code really this is somerset oh i said brightly what part i know somerset quite well i lied dudgeon magna were near wells oooh heavens yes i said with such shamelessly specious conviction i almost had myself persuaded know it well i oh bother there goes my money i clicked the handset back onto its rest zeb looked suspicious he glared at the telephone in the box i thought you werent he began somerset i announced to him and boz as the same taxi that had brought us here swung into sight on the far side of the green perversely enough it was probably the burning down of the old seaweed factory that ensured our faith became more than just an eccentricity shared by a handful of people my grandfather just wanted to forget about the whole incident but the lawyers who had charge of the disputed estate to which the old factory had belonged were not so understanding several of the men responsible for the conflagration were apprehended and charged and when the matter came to trial in stornoway salvador aasni and zhobelia had no choice but to appear as witnesses my grandfather had taken to dressing entirely in black by then and whenever he left the farm at luskentyre he wore a black widebrimmed hat with him dressed so and boasting long and now entirely white hair and bushy white beard and the two sisters clad in their best most colourful saris they must have presented a singular sight as they attended the court there was some press interest our founder abhorred such attention but there was little he could do about it and of course the fact that he refused to talk to people on the stornoway gazette or a journalist sent from glasgow from the daily dispatch only piqued their interest and given the rumours about our founder and his two dusky consorts they were already pretty piqued my grandfather managed to avoid most of the publicity and discovered that a widebrimmed hat was particularly effective at shielding him from photographs especially as the cameras of the time were bulky awkward items which are hard to handle while trying to take a snap of somebody striding purposefully down a narrow street usually in the rain nevertheless while he managed to avoid claiming to be married to the two sisters and succeeded in sidestepping insinuations about the exact nature of his relationship with the women he was less reluctant to express himself when it came to his newfound faith and some of the things he said helpfully enhanced by the mysterious process of metamorphosis that tends to occur between reality and newsprint must have struck a chord with a couple in edinburgh called cecil and gertrude fossil though of course my grandfather didnt know this at the time aasni and zhobelia were called as witnesses but were unable unwilling actually to provide any help their english and gaelic both of which they were reasonably at home in seemed to deteriorate to the point of almost total incomprehensibility the instant they crossed the threshold of the court when an interpreter was called for the only people capable of helping proved to be other members of the asis family which might or might not have been acceptable to the defence but in the end didnt matter because the family simply refused to speak or listen to the two brazenly shameless marriagewrecking hussies who had once been their daughters and no threat of being charged with contempt of court was going to change their minds faced with such intransigence in a case which was in the end only concerned with the destruction of a factory nobody who mattered had really cared about the exasperated sheriff thought the better of pressing the point aasni and zhobelia were excused from providing evidence salvador who had never met the rest of the asis family took its rejection of its daughters more personally than they did themselves and swore never to enter the store they had opened in stornoway or later the branch in tarbert somehow this ban became an article of faith and extended as the asis familys commercial interests expanded and shops opened in portree oban and inverness to all retail premises presumably just to be on the safe side the trial ended the cowed murmuring sundaybestdressed men accused of the dastardly drunken factory incendiarism were found neither guilty nor innocent but were told that the charges against them had been found not proven a uniquely scottish verdict that has exactly the same legal force as not guilty but is often popularly taken to mean we think you did it but were not certain and which has the twin merits both of introducing into the usually monochrome guiltyinnocent decent folkcriminal classes goodbad world of the law the concept of quantum uncertainty and leaving a lingering cloud of public dubiety and suspicion over the accused just so they didnt get too cocky in future grandfather and the sisters returned to the farm at luskentyre salvador to work alongside mr mcilone with the animals on the farm and continue reading studying and writing the orthography and the sisters to continue driving round the isles in their converted library van making bad deals and not much of a living come the first summer my grandfather spent on the islands that of the two sisters found themselves doing something else together as their bellies started to swell salvador while suffused with virile pride of course was already wondering how they were going to cope with two extra mouths to feed when the fossils arrived cecil pronounced seesill apparently and gertie possil were an eccentric couple of independent means who wiled away their otherwise relatively pointless lives by joining different sects cults and churches as though they were trying to collect the set cecil was a tall awkward man who had been unable to take part in the war because he only possessed one eye the other one having been hooked out when he was a child when his father a keen angler was teaching him to cast a traumatic incident one might have thought would put the young cecil off fishing and possibly fish for life but which in fact had had exactly the opposite effect when cecil disappeared on one of his frequent fishing trips in the highlands or to the chalk streams of southern england gertie would spend the time attending seances and talking to mystics they had read something about grandfather and his strange new faith including his emphasis on the importance of the th of february in their daily newspaper on the first of march that year and realised that that was the day that would have been the th of february had been a leap year convinced that this meant something entirely profound they had determined to make a pilgrimage to luskentyre later that year though it has to be said that cecil later confessed he had also been thinking of the opportunities for sporting fishing to be had in the hebrides had he and his wife proved unwelcome at or been disillusioned with grandfathers protochurch salvador was wary of the fossils at first though mr mcilone seemed happy to have them stay and the sisters appeared politely indifferent cecil and gertie arrived on harris in a large prewar shooting break a kind of estate car or station wagon which sister jess assures me a lady called everidge once memorably termed a halftimbered car packed with mesopotamian scatter cushions afghan rugs ceylonese onyx incense holders and all the other essentials required for prolonged survival on a modest island farm they also brought with them at least twenty different types of tea which they kept in airtight javanese cinerary urns this greatly endeared them to my grandfather and was probably the difference between them being trusted and accepted when they first appeared or being treated with such suspicion they felt obliged to leave blithely bestowing the luskentyre farm with batiks lacquer screens and silver candelabra the fossils were able to bring an air of luxury to the place that at first appealed to all concerned including my grandfather until then the farm had been a place of creaking iron beds smoky paraffin lamps and bare floorboards relieved by offcuts of linoleum by the time the fossils were finished all of those were still there but by all accounts they didnt seem to define the place any more the fossils stayed initially for two months providing the farm with its veneer of opulence grandfather with all the speciality teas pens and paper he desired and the locals with both a rich new vein of gossip and a lurid new example to brandish in front of children and weakminded adults whenever a paradigm of hedonistic immorality and heathen decadence was required i think they also gave our founder something else an outside perspective a calibratory check a chance to measure his revelations thoughts insights and future teachings against the experience of people whod pretty well played the field as far as odd new sects were concerned and quite assuredly knew their way round a decent cult when they saw one cecil and gertie became converts something about salvadors new religion seemed to chime with them it was if you like both backward and forward looking and they found elements in each direction that agreed with them they had years earlier decided against having their house in edinburghs morningside connected to the electricity mains and were already curiously hermetic in their private lives trying to keep up with all the services and meetings of so many splintered faiths left them little or no time to socialise with the real faithful afterwards and each had few acquaintances outside respectively game fishing and seance attending and no real friends at all i think even salvadors patently scandalous relationship with the two sisters seemed a breath of fresh air to them after the smallminded and hysterical attitude to sexuality the other sects and faiths they had paid court to tended to display and in both that and a desire to live frugally and unfussily outwith conventional society with a respect for the wisdom of the past for nature and for all mystic faiths it might be true that my grandfather was one of the first hippies cecil and gertie left at the end of that first summer as aasni and zhobelia bloomed bigger and shortly after gertie discovered to her alloyed joy that she too had fallen pregnant this was the lump that would turn out to be lucius they swore that they would return and that they would spread the good tidings of the new faiths birth both by word of mouth and by financing the publication of the orthography once salvador had completed it they took all their exotic trappings with them stowing them in the back of the shooting break without a thought for the finer sensibilities of the pregnant sisters who to their dismay suddenly found themselves dumped back into the world of creaking iron beds and curling lino after a heady existence amongst the luxuries of perfumesaturated clothofgold cushions and silk rugs of fabulous design i think that was when salvador who bore the brunt of the sisters complaints in this matter finally turned his back on extravagance and luxury and made simplicity an article of faith the fossils kept up an almost daily correspondence with the farm at luskentyre telling of their mission amongst the heathen folk of edinburgh and their efforts at spreading the good word amongst those who sought game fish in still pools and those who angled after the words warnings and entreaties of the deardeparted meanwhile aasni and zhobelia each grew big with child and jointly developed a passion at a certain point in their confinement for the pungent pickles and condiments they remembered from their childhood forbidden from contacting their parents having no wish to do so anyway and knowing of no other nearby source of spiciness they started to make their own ordering supplies of the rarer raw ingredients chillis coriander cardamom etc by mail from an indian grocer in edinburgh whom gertie had put them in touch with their experiments with the likes of chilli and garlic sauce lime and brinjal pickle apple and ginger chutney and so on did not always meet with complete success but they persisted and salvador discovering along with mr mcilone a liking for the sisters fiery concoctions which might not have been totally unconnected with the commonality of effect produced in the mouth by both cheap whisky and any chillilaced comestible happily encouraged these fragrant forays into the epicurean realm aasni and zhobelias original cravings proved to be the pumppriming inspiration for an avocation that lasted decades and after a long period of initial reluctance which persisted well beyond the time when aasni had been delivered of brigit and zhobelia of calli and the sisters again fitted comfortably behind the counter of their converted library van their chutneys and pickles eventually became their most successful line in the travelling shop giving the more broadminded citizens of lewis and harris a taste for palatescalding subcontinental condiments that has persisted to this day the train carrying zeb boz and me back to london broke down just outside the town of brentwood and limped into the station at little more than walking pace we detrained and encountered some confusion amongst the railway staff on the subject of a relief service but the consensus seemed to be that we might have an hour or so to wait fuck shit man trains fuck how annoying hey maybe we should get somethin to eat yeah boz suggested we headed off to find a public house outside the station on the street we passed four men with very short hair dressed in large boots short jeans and shiny green blousestyle jackets they seemed to be selling papers i dont think id have noticed them further but for the fact they started to make a sort of oooo oooooo noise as we passed by one of them spat on the pavement in front of boz who just lifted his head a little and strolled serenely on who are they i asked zeb who was at my side do they know boz na fascists zeb said bnp bad fucks i looked back at the men who were still staring after us one of them threw something yellow i reached up and caught a halfeaten banana that might have been aimed at boz who was a little in front of us i stopped fuck sake just walk zeb said tersely pulling on my sleeve i slid my arm free and walked back to the group of men good afternoon i said to them as they came forward i held up the halfeaten banana why did you throw this its for the coon dear said the tallest and blondest of them you give it to your black monkey he told me the others sniggered i stared at them probably my mouth was hanging open good heavens i said are you people racists yeah yeah want to buy a fucking newspaper darlin one of them shook a tight bundle of newspapers in my face the headline said something about enough being enough and paki death gangs yeah were fucking racist we believe in white rights said the tall blond one what do you believe in apart from associatin wif niggers well im sorry i said but i believe in love and understanding and the worship of the creator through the worshipping nigger cock more like yeah you let him fuck you up the bum do you look at im back there fucking shittin himself e is look at im im an the little cunt fuckin shittin themselves they are one of the others said then shouted over my head yeah yeah yeah you want some i said do you fucking want some excuse me i said tapping that one on the shiny shoulder of his jacket theres no need for that sort of thing he looked down at his shoulder and then turned on me the tall blond one stepped between us and said look just fuck off back to your nigger friend all right i looked into his eyes i turned to go then swivelled back again could i have one of your newspapers i asked im just interested in what you think the tall blond one sneered then pulled a newspaper from the pile he held he held it in front of me i reached out to take it but he lifted it beyond my reach fifty pence he said i do beg your pardon i said i havent any money but it occurred to me that if you believe in the justice of what you say you might let me have it free well fuckin let you have it jock tart the tall blond one said bending very close to me he slapped my face with the paper then shoved it into my chest pushing me backwards i dropped the halfeaten banana grabbed the paper with both hands and took another step to the rear fuck off the man said again pointing at me im not fuckin telling you again i nodded and touched my hat okay thanks for the paper i said i walked away to jeers and sudden laughter the banana went sailing over my head and landed at the feet of boz and zeb who were standing ten metres away at a street corner looking distinctly anxious isis boz said once we were out of sight you got to stop doin that sorta thing i think i walk behind you from now on you always turnin back into danger those guys are more dangerous than that damn baskerville dog hmm i said jeez fuck christ shit god language brother zebediah i said absently leafing through the newspaper as we walked good grief we ate lunch in a pub i read the paper halfpage by halfpage keeping it tightly folded at bozs request so that it was hard to tell from any distance what i was reading i asked a few questions of zeb and boz regarding what i was reading and can only assume they answered truthfully we spent half an hour or so eating lunch i stood leaning against a wooden partition while boz and zeb sat the sandwich i ate looked attractive but was damp and almost totally lacking in flavour i drank a pint of beer which tasted rather of chemicals and may also have led to what happened next they probly gone from there by now boz said confidently we were approaching the corner where he and zeb had waited for me while id talked to the four young men i looked in a shop window and saw their blackgreen reflections they were just where wed encountered them earlier yes im sure they have i said slowing and looking round we were passing an interestinglooking shop called a delicatessen boz i said brightly halting and causing the other two to stop i would like to contribute to the meal this evening unfortunately i am not allowed to enter retail premises would you mind going into this shop here and purchasing an ingredient or two no problem isis what you want i have some money i said pulling out a couple of onepound notes boz looked at the notes and laughed ill stand you it isis just tell me what you wantin some fresh coriander please i said comin right up boz disappeared into the shop i handed the two onepound notes to zeb there was a toy shop back there i said could you get me a couple of water pistols zeb looked blank an expression that i confess i thought suited him please i said theyre a present zeb walked back to the toy shop still looking blank boz reappeared from the delicatessen shop oh i said touching my forehead and a couple of bottles of that red pepper sauce whats it called tabasco boz said handing me the clump of fresh coriander i stuffed it in a pocket and nodded thats it boz grinned thats strong stuff isis you sure you need two bottles i considered no i said make it four i approached the group of shinygreenjacketed men they formed a line in front of me i walked with my head bowed and my hands pressed in front of me in a gesture of supplication the fascists towered in front of me a wall of crewcut black denim and green shiningness plinthed by bulbous brown leather boots i bowed my head further and let my hands drop to my sides i hoped my pockets werent dripping sirs i said smiling i have read your publication i have read of your hatred and despite of people different from you yeah fuck really despite wot you just dont fuckin listen do you and i would like you to know that i feel exactly the same way as you do wot oh yeah yes i feel exactly the same way about people like you what right god forgive me i muttered taking the little water pistols from my jacket pockets one in each hand and firing them in the faces of the greenjacketed men straight into their eyes somerset boz said on the train into liverpool street apparently i confirmed still carefully cleaning the watery red liquid off my hands with damp toilet paper i had been thinking trying to work out what morag could have meant by talking about me bothering her i still had no idea it was troubling i shall leave tomorrow i told boz and zeb zeb stood with his arms crossed staring at me mad boz kissed me hard on the lips when we got into the squat dont mean nuthin by it you understand isis he said still holding my shoulders we looked at each other for a moment or two but he said well he patted me on one shoulder and walked off mad zeb stood there in the hall shaking his head he grinned tough he said cookie i agreed and patted zeb on the shoulder as though passing it on chapter i think it was my friend mr warriston of dunblane who observed that the ridicule of fools is the surest sign of genius and the scorn of political or religious leaders one of the least ambiguous signals that the object of their venom is espousing something threateningly close to the truth to this i would only add that as most of us are only too willing to define a fool precisely as a person who disagrees with us a degree of selffulfilment is inevitably introduced to the process which while smacking of a kind of facile elegance robs the observation of much of its utility either way it has always seemed to me that the average person has no difficulty weighing their own desires prejudices and bigotries against the totality of the worlds most sophisticated philosophies and every moral lesson such systems have ever given rise to and judging their selfishness to be the more worthy of action as a luskentyrian of course i am far from being an average person and as a thirdgeneration leapyearian indeed the only one i have privilege heaped upon exclusivity with all the responsibility and freight of consideration that entails perhaps therefore it is not really my place to judge my fellows too harshly when what we share is debatably of less importance than that which divides and distinguishes us which made me no better than the four men id left on their knees wheezing and cursing outside the station the previous day nevertheless whether it was good for my soul or not i was still relishing the memory the following morning while i stood at a motorway onramp in gunnersbury being occasionally jeered at from passing cars and vans perhaps on account of my gender perhaps due to my hat and as a rule insulted by the drivers whose offers of a lift i declined because their automobiles seemed somehow too blandly conventional this was part of my strategy for shaking the faithcorroding influence of the big city off my feet i had grown too used to the electric light of the squat which had confused me once id stopped to think about it but had been explained to me as simply the result of the electricity company not caring whether the building was legally occupied or not as long as the bills were paid i had considered taking more of the cannabis cigarettes last night while boz with backing in mono by zeb detailed my exploits of the day to the others and i glowed with pride in spite of myself regardless of an outward show of modesty in the end i had not indulged i had a word with zeb telling him that i thought it best that i continued to search for morag in the hope that my mission might be successful before i or anybody else reported back the bad news concerning our cousins double life zeb did not demur then i had said my goodnights and goodbyes at a still respectable hour and gone to my hammock pleased at not having given in to temptation next morning however i had found myself thinking about hopping on a bus or taking a tube while i walked from kilburn to here in the breaking dawn again i had resisted but all these urges and hankerings were signs that i was becoming infected with the thoughts and habits of the unsaved there is a perhaps perverse pleasure to be had from not taking the obvious course bred into all luskentyrians and diligently developed all our lives the longer i stood on the slip road leading to the motorway and turned down the offers of lifts sometimes successfully waving on one of the other people hitchhiking there to take the vehicle instead the better i felt about this latest leg of my mission i was experiencing an odd mix of emotions elation at my feats of guile and arms the day before relief at leaving the big city a nagging homesickness and general feeling of missing everybody at the community disquiet that unless either i or the young man at la mancha had entirely got hold of the wrong end of the stick my cousin morag seemed to have developed an antipathy towards me and might even be avoiding me and an undercurrent of paranoia that one or more of the men id attacked with the pepper sauce yesterday might for some reason drive past while i was standing here and jump out and attack me i kept telling myself there were getting on for seven million people in london alone and brentwood was really quite far away and almost directly opposite from the direction id be travelling in but i think it was that fear that finally overcame the prideful feeling of blessed righteousness i was experiencing by turning down all those offered rides and made me accept a lift from a nice young couple in a small old and rather tinny french car they were only going as far as slough but it got me started they commented on my sitting board i started explaining about luskentyrianism and our ascetic tendencies they looked glad to get rid of me i estimated it took me ninety minutes or more first to make my way out of slough and then to get another lift this time in the back of a builders pickup whose cab was crammed with three young men in what looked like football strips they took me as far as reading cement dust flew up in the slipstream and stung my eyes i spent about an hour by the side of the a on the outskirts of reading mostly spent studying my map and brushing cement dust off my jacket and trousers then accepted a ride from a wellgroomed but casually dressed chap heading for an amateur cricket match in newbury he asked about the sitting board too i told him it was a kind of prayer mat which i think just confused him i studied the book of maps in his car and decided against the obvious course of being dropped at the junction with the motorway to continue along the m accepting it as more blessed to stay with the byways i stuck with the man a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company though obviously offduty as it were all the way to newbury and chatted easily enough to him i suspect that i was being flirted with but im really a novice in such matters so perhaps he was just being friendly while walking out of newbury i ate the sandwiches roadkill had given me the previous evening in succession my next hitches took me to burbage with a chain smoker more eye watering marlborough courtesy of a youngish offduty soldier who kept brushing my thigh and hip with his hand when he changed gear until i ostentatiously extracted the sixinch hatpin from my lapel and started picking my teeth with it calne a kindly greying fellow on his way back from what sounded like an assignation chippenham in a delivery lorry with a sorry soul who was to become a father for the first time later that month and due to hear the following morning whether he had lost his job in something ominous called a rationalisation and finally with the light fading fast to a village called kelston with another couple they were rather older and even more chatty than the two whod begun the day they commented on my sitting board too i told them it was to combat a back problem they invited me to stay at their house in kelston i declined politely though i availed myself of a look at their road atlas i slung my hammock in a wood on the village outskirts it rained for a while during the night i used my kitbag as an extra covering but still got wet i woke feeling damp and stiff and cold shortly after dawn and washed my face in the heavy dew that lay upon the grass then climbed the most scalablelooking tall tree i could find partly for the exercise and partly so that i would warm up above the tree tops the sky looked worryingly red but beautiful all the same and i sat there wedged in amongst the branches for a while just watching the soft clouds move and listening to the birds sing and praising god and their creation with a song of my own sung silently in my soul i walked through baths outskirts to the a and after about an hours walk started hitching just past a large roundabout the traffic seemed much busier than the day before and it was only as i stood at the side of the road trying to account for this that i realised today was monday and yesterday had been sunday i cursed myself for a fool not having realised this the day before it made no difference to my journey or quest for morag but i had been slow not to ask myself why so few of the people whod given me lifts the day before had been working it was not unusual for luskentyrians to lose track of the days we work on the natural cycles of lunar month and year not artificial divisions like weeks but i had thought that living in the midst of the norms i would naturally fall into their ways i suppose the squat in kilburn had been less than archetypically bland i thought of home again and everybody there i hoped mr warriston wouldnt be too worried when i didnt turn up to play the flentrop for a while as the traffic roared past on its way back in towards bath i wallowed in a sweet lost feeling of selfpity imagining what everyone back home would be doing now and hoping some of them were missing me i shook off the mood and concentrated on feeling positive and looking pleasant and eager but not seductive within a few more minutes i got a lift from a baker returning home after a night shift i walked from a village called hallatrow to one called farrington gurney and courtesy of a commuting office manager was in wells before the shops were open wells possesses an attractive cathedral and seemed altogether quite a pleasant holy place i felt a certain pleasing fitness that i had ended up here this morning when normally i would have been visiting dunblane and was tempted to stay and take a look around but decided to press on a traffic warden gave me directions for clissolds health farm and country club which was less than ten miles away near the village called dudgeon magna i started walking west and kept my thumb out as i left the small town behind a strangelooking van stopped within a minute barely a furlong beyond the speedlimit sign the vans bodywork appeared at first sight to be constructed of bricks the back door opened to reveal a group of motleydressed young people sitting on sleeping bags rucksacks and bedrolls headin for the gig one called no a place called dudgeon magna i said there was some muttering amongst the young people finally somebody up front looked at a map and the message came back to hop in i sat on the ridged metal floor yeah pparently it used to belong to a company that sold stone cladding and wall coverings and stuff said the lass i was sitting next to who was about my age id commented on the vans odd appearance the old vehicle had sheets of artificial brick stuck to the inside as well as the outside the ten young people it contained were on their way to some sort of party in a field near glastonbury i thought back to the map id looked at the night before isnt this a rather strange route to take to glastonbury i asked voiding the filth the chap at the wheel called back cheerfully i nodded as though i knew what he was talking about whats in dudgeon magna one of the others asked my cousin i told her she was dressed like the others in layers of holed ragged but colourful clothes she wore sensiblelooking boots that had obviously seen a few fields in their time the six young men all had dreadlocks id asked roadkill what they were called and the four young women all had part or all of their heads shaved i wondered if perhaps they were part of some order shouldnt that be dudgeon alto or something another lass asked passing me a can of cider i smiled i suppose it should be really shouldnt it i said tasting the drink in the can oh fuck said our driver what are they doing here roadblock the fellow in the passenger seat said bastards various of the others got up and crowded round the area just behind the seats making noises of disappointment and annoyance its the pigs somebody muttered back to those of us still sitting as the van slowed to a stop the girl across from me whod passed me the cider rolled her eyes and sighed loudly the driver wound down his window whats the matter reason to believe i heard a deep male voice say the others started speaking and i only caught snatches of the rest but way to a trespassory assembly aw come on man serious disruption to a community not doing anything were not harming anybody justice act that you may be mean whatre we supposed to have done why arent you out catching rapists or something back the way you came look were just going to visit friends for fucks sake hereby deemed to be unfair i mean its just so unfair at that point the vans back doors were hauled open by two policemen wearing overalls and crash helmets carrying long batons right come on out one of them said i got out with the others amongst much complaining what appears to be the problem officer i asked one of the men stand over there we were told ahead on the road was a police van with blue lights flashing we had been pulled in to a layby where other wornlooking vans a couple of old cars and a decrepit coach had also been stopped there were more police vans and cars perched on verges nearby and lots of police moving around some dressed in ordinary uniforms some in overalls we stood on a grass verge while the van was briefly searched and the police checked its tyres and lights our driver had to show some documents some of the vans and cars which had been stopped were made to turn round and head back the way they had come others seemed to be the objects of disputes between their occupants and the police a few small groups of people some of them in tears tramped back up the road carrying sleeping bags back packs and plastic bags meanwhile another tiredlooking old minibus was stopped and more people forced to get out and stand on the grass smartish looking cars and other types of traffic were allowed to carry on past the roadblock right back the way you came we were told by a policeman after the police left our van and went on to the minibus but look the man whod been driving protested were just youve got one very borderline tyre son the policeman interrupted pointing his finger in the young mans face want us to check the spare if its there you got a jack yes no want us to check that tyre again very borderline it was you understand what im saying look fuckin police state somebody muttered get in the van get out of here get out of avon understand the policeman said poking the driver in the chest and if i see you again youre nicked he turned and walked away this ones goin back harry he shouted to another policeman who nodded and then read the vans licence number into a handheld radio shit somebody said as we trooped back to the van im still going were still going arent we snot far fuckin is good ten miles bastards na well get a bit closer cross the fields job i got my kitbag out of the back of the van why exactly are they stopping everybody i asked theyre the fucking pigs man its their fucking job the fucking fascist antifun police bastards somebody said from inside the van theyve spilled all the drink there were groans as people watched rivulets of pale yellow liquid trickle out the rear doors you not coming with us the girl whod given me the cider asked dudgeon magna i said pointing youll be lucky one of the young men said thank you go with god i said they closed the doors the van started up and turned round heading back towards wells i waved to the people looking out the back windows and set my face to the west again and where do you think youre going asked an overalled crashhelmeted police officer standing directly in front of me the village of dudgeon magna i said to see my cousin morag whit at clissolds health farm and country club the officer looked me down and up no youre not he said yes i am i said trying not to sound too indignant no he said pressing me in the chest with his truncheon youre not i looked down at the truncheon and put one of my feet out behind the other so i could better control my centre of balance i leaned into the truncheon where i come from i said slowly we treat guests with a little more courtesy than this youre not a guest love youre just a fucking nuisance as far as were concerned now fuck off back to scotland or wherever it is you come from he pushed at me with the truncheon my chest was hurting where he was pushing but i was standing my ground sir i said looking him in the eyes beneath the pushedup visor of the crash helmet im not entirely clear why youre intercepting all these young people but whatever it is you think they are going to do i am not interested in it i am going to visit my cousin at clissolds health farm and country club the officer took the weight off the truncheon then started tapping me in the chest with it in time to his words and i just told you youre not he said finally pushing me hard and forcing me to take a step backwards now do you want to turn round and fuck off or do you want to get into serious fucking trouble because ive just about fucking had it with you people i glared at him through narrowed eyes i raised my head i want to speak to your superior officer i said frostily he looked at me for a moment right he said standing to one side and motioning with his baton this way thank you i said taking a step past him i think he tripped me to get me off balance the next thing i knew he had me on the ground my cheek ground into the damp gritty tarmac of the layby his knee in the small of my back and one of my arms pushed so far up my back i let out an involuntary shriek of pain it felt like my arm was going to break all right i screamed dave he said calmly search this bag will you i saw boots appear to one side and my kitbag lying on the ground beside me was wrenched from my hand youre going to break my arm i shouted the pressure eased a little until it was merely very uncomfortable i felt my face flush as i realised how easily id been first fooled and then brought down any selfsatisfaction id felt at my exploits in essex two days earlier was being wrung out of me now whats that my attacker asked what the other one said that there whats that bottle of something yeah and that yeah could be something couldnt it the pressure came back on my arm again and i sucked in breath trying not to cry out i sensed the policeman who was pinning me down lower his head to mine then felt his breath on my neck i think weve found a suspicious substance here young lady he said what are you talking about i gasped i was dragged upright and held still painfully in front of the one whod brought me down as the second policeman held two of my vials in front of me i could feel my hat crushed between my back and the policemans chest whatre these then the other one asked i grimaced that on the lefts hearth ash i said i was having to work hard at not appending you oaf or you idiot to a lot of these utterances the contents of my kitbag had been strewn over the tarmac the bag itself had been turned insideout harthash said the one holding the vial you mean hashish the one behind me said no ash from a hearth i said seeing some other policemen walking over towards us its for a ceremony the other jars for my mark the mark on my forehead cant you see it these are religious substances holy sacraments the second officer was taking the top off the ash vial sacrilege i yelled the second officer sniffed at the ash then dipped a moistened finger in desecration i screamed as the other policemen came up towards us i struggled the grip on my arm tightened as i was lifted onto my tiptoes pain surged through my arm and i shrieked again steady on bill one of the other officers said quietly weve got a telly crew back there right sarge the one behind me said the pain eased again and i gulped some deep breaths now then young lady whats all this about i am trying i said through clenched teeth to make my lawful and peaceable way to visit my cousin morag whit in clissolds health farm and country club in dudgeon magna this person behind me was most insulting and when i asked to speak to his superior officer to report his unmannerliness he tricked me and attacked me suspiciouslooking substance sarge the one with the vial said presenting it to the older man who frowned and also sniffed it that is gross irreverence i yelled hmm he said he looked at the kitbags contents on the ground anything else other jars and stuff here sir one of the others said squatting and picking up the vial of dried river mud a crunch sounded from under his foot as he rose he looked down and moved something sideways with the edge of his shoe i saw the remains of the tiny zhlonjiz jar my god what have you done i screamed now now somebody said heresy impiety desecration may god have mercy on your unsaved souls you wretches this could be something too the desecrator said rubbing the dust between his fingers are you people listening i shouted i am the elect of god you buffoons put her in the wagon the sergeant said nodding his head sounds like she might have escaped from somewhere what how dare you and get this stuff bagged for checking out the sergeant said tapping the vial of hearth ash and turning over the limp kitbag with his foot as he turned away let me go i am an officer of the true church i am the elect of god i am on a sacred mission you heathens by god you will answer to a higher court than you have ever glimpsed for this insult you ruffians let me go i might have saved my breath i was marched off past numerous other vehicles groups of people white lights and flashing blue lights and bundled into a police van some way up the road still protesting furiously in the police van i was handcuffed to a seat and told to shut up a burly policeman in overalls and crash helmet sat at the far end of the passenger compartment twirling a baton in his hands and whistling the only other people in the van were a sorrylooking young couple who smiled at me nervously and then went back to holding each other tight the van smelled of antiseptic i found myself breathing quickly and shallowly there was a queasiness in my stomach i flexed my wrists and scowled at the officer then closed my eyes and arranged my limbs as comfortably as i could i attempted to do some deep breathing and might have succeeded had we not shortly been joined by some loudly protesting youths who were bundled into the van by a clutch of overalled crashhelmeted policemen shortly thereafter we were driven off at high speed the true church of luskentyre underwent something of a schism albeit an amicable one in when we were gifted the estate at high easter offerance on the floodplain of the river forth by mrs woodbean who had become a convert three years earlier mrs w was about the dozenth full convert lured to the now quietly flourishing farmcommunity at luskentyre by my grandfathers reputation for holiness and lack of interest in taking money off even the richest of his followers an aspect of his renown which he had realised early on only made people all the more generous another example of the contrariness of life it was sadly a tragedy which spurred mrs w to act the woodbeans had a son called david their only child mrs w had been told after his birth that she could not bear another baby and so the boy was all the more precious to them and was kept cosseted and pampered in when he was seven he walked through a glass door in a shop in stirling he wasnt mortally wounded but he lost a lot of blood and an ambulance was called to take him to hospital it crashed en route and the boy was killed mrs woodbean took this as a sign that the modern world was too saturated with technology and cleverness for its or her familys own good and decided to renounce the majority of her worldly goods and devote her life to faith and allegedly to having another child at all costs an ambition which was fulfilled years later when she gave birth to sophi at the age of fortythree though at the cost of her own life mrs ws extraordinary act of charity was unique in its scale but converts were bountiful in smaller ways all the time though by all accounts salvador produced a great show of grumpy reluctance when accepting a gift and made sure the donor always knew that he was doing it for the good of their soul on the grounds that it was indeed more blessed to give than to receive and salvadors soul was already doing quite well thank you and so could afford to be generous when it came to accepting tribute people heard about our order through the media very occasionally sometimes through the warnings of sincere but misguided priests and ministers who had not heard the adage concerning the nonexistence of bad publicity but most often just by word of mouth it has to be admitted that no attempt to spread the word through the commercial distribution of the orthography has ever been successful as i have said there is a sense in which we were the first hippies the first greens the first new agers and so a few brave souls who were in the vanguard of social change and at least twenty years ahead of their time were sure to be attracted to a cause that would shake the world in various guises a few decades later in the years following the establishment of our order my grandfather gradually stopped looking for the by now almost mythic canvas bag and settled down to the life of what we now call a guru dispensing wisdom experiencing visions which helped guide our faith and providing a living example of peaceful holiness the sisters continued to share my grandfather and have his children most notably and wonderfully my father born on the th of february and with gaps for pregnancies continued with their mobile shop business until the year of the schism mr mcilone elected to remain at luskentyre which was after all his though he insisted that salvador accept his entire library as his parting gift by this time there were five full converts that is people who had come to stay at luskentyre to work the land and fish the sea and be on hand to listen to our founders teachings there were perhaps another dozen followers like the fossils who would come to stay usually providing their own keep in some form or another for a few weeks or months at a time two of the more ascetic full converts apostles as they called themselves by now decided to stay at the farm on harris after the gifting of high easter offerance and grandfather doubtless wisely put no pressure on anybody to go or to stay grandfather and the sisters had seen many photographs of high easter offerance and some silent ciné film too projected onto a sheet in the parlour of our only other sympathiser local to harris whose house happened to have electric power still it must have been an adventure for them when in the spring of they finally packed all their belongings in the exmobile library now exmobile shop and drove to stornoway where the van was driven onto a huge net on the quay side and then winched aboard the ferry for the long rolling journey to kyle of lochalsh from there they headed slowly south on the narrow winding roads of the day away from the fractured geometries of the stormflayed western isles to the comparatively balmy climes of central scotland and the abundant expanses of smoothsloped hills coiled river breezerustled forests and sunny pastures of the forths broad run mr and mrs woodbean had already moved out to the little turreted house over the iron bridge from the main farm my grandfather the sisters their children and assorted followers including the fossils who had come along to help with the move held a service and then a party to celebrate the relocation installed themselves and their modest possessions in the mansion house and old farm added mr mcilones library to the already impressive if underused one which existed in the mansion house and in the weeks months and years that followed got down to the business of renovating the farm buildings and restoring the neglected fields to productivity mrs woodbeans brother had made a fortune after the war dealing in scrap and army surplus he toyed with the idea of becoming a convert for a while and during this period either generously donated to the order several pieces of potentially valuable exservice equipment which would in many cases later be pressed into previously unthoughtof practical applications or used the farm as a dump for useless junk on which there was no quick profit to be made depending who you listen to the only things he did provide which really were useful i suppose the deivoxiphone doesnt count were a couple of shortwave radio sets mounted on sturdy if wheelless army trailers mr mcilone was persuaded to accept one and both were eventually persuaded to work powered by wind generators the radios provided a link between the two outposts of our faith which was both fairly reliable and relatively secure my grandfather was starting to worry about the attentions of the government and at one stage appeared to be convinced there was an entire whitehall agency called the department of religious affairs or dora for short which had been set up specifically to spy upon us and disrupt our every dealing though he laughingly dismisses this as an exaggeration nowadays a parable taken literally of course the radios had a very definite air of clutter and newfanglehood about them but perhaps because the radio provided such a perfect image of the human soul grandfather had always had a soft spot for the device and was more inclined to suffer the presence of one of them than any other symptom of the material age the radio also provided a new aspect of one might even say weapon for our faith when grandfather awoke one morning from an obviously divinely inspired dream with the idea of radiomancy whereby one tunes the radio at random then turns it on and uses the first words one hears either immediately or as a result of sweeping gradually further and further along the frequencies to either side as a means of prediction and divination so we were not so remote from our original home but more importantly with our relocation to this leafy arable alcove just off the central industrial belt it was easier for potential converts to visit and make up their minds whether they wanted to believe or even to come and stay and work and believe a slow trickle of people young and old mostly british but with the occasional foreigner paid court to my grandfather listened to his teachings read his orthography conversed with him and thought about their own lives and in some cases decided that he had found the truth and so became saved grandfather thought up the festival of love in it occurred to him that it might not be wise to rely entirely on providence to provide leapyearians who were now seen very much as prophets and perhaps potential messiahs indeed it might even be seen as impious to expect the creator to ensure a child was born on any given th of february it could be thought of as taking god for granted which did not sound like a good idea grandfathers faith had embraced something very like the idea of free love from the start thanks to aasni and zhobelias generosity and he had had revelations which certainly appeared to sanction the extension of his physical communing beyond the two sisters and to allow his followers the same leeway with their partners providing those concerned were agreeable and sufficiently enlightened to reject possessiveness and unreasoning unholy jealousy which had been revealed to be a sin against gods bountiful and forgiving nature so if the order was to give nature a gentle helping hand with producing a child at the end of february in a leap year it obviously made sense to encourage those ready willing and able to assist in this matter to enjoy themselves as much as possible nine months earlier our founder therefore decreed that the end of may before a leap year should be the time for a festival a festival of love in all its forms including the holy communing of souls through the blessed glory of sexual congress the month before should be a time of abstinence when the believers ought to deny themselves the most intense of pleasures in order to prepare for and fully appreciate the advent of the festival itself of course the cynics apostates and heretics and those sad souls who hold it an article of their own perverted faiths that everybody elses motives can never be any better than their own will point to the presence of several attractive young women amongst grandfathers followers at this time as some sort of reason for our founders idea concerning the festival well we have grown to expect such shameful drivel from the ranks of the profoundly unsaved but it has been pointed out by no less than salvador himself that even if the beauty he saw around him at that time did somehow lead his thoughts towards such a happy and festive conclusion what was that but an example of god using the fair to inspire the wise not coincidentally i think the first real attempt by the press to sabotage our cause occurred around this time and confirmed to our overseer that he was right to shun publicity and refuse cameras access to the estate aasni and zhobelia seem not to have been discomfited by the concept of the festival they apparently felt secure in their joint relationship with salvador and had devoted themselves both to the upbringing of their children and the upgrading of their home they had also made friends with mr and mrs woodbean and seemed to draw comfort from that as well the sisters had not ceased to develop their culinary and condimentary skills now that they were free of the need to travel the islands peddling their wares in the ancient van they could devote even more time to the expansion and refinement of their range of sauces pickles and chutneys at about this time too they began to experiment with other more substantial dishes and made their first tentative excursions into the strange and exciting new world of crosscultural cuisinecombining as though through such provisional promiscuity and the amalgamation of the scottish and the subcontinental they could participate in their own terms in the freshly formulated festivities it was then that the process really began that would lead to such dishes as lorne sausage shami kebab rabbit masala fruit pudding chaat skink aloo porridge tarka shell pie aloo gobi kipper bhoona chips pea pulao whelk poori and marmalade kulfi and i think the world is a better place for all of them chapter thirteen briefly i spent the night in the cells in a police station in bristol the police seemed suspicious that i had no way of proving my identity but amused at my name and my protestations of innocence and outrage at least until they got upset with my persistence and told me very rudely i thought to shut up the following morning i was told i was free to go and that there was somebody to see me i was too surprised to say anything i was led down a corridor between the cell doors towards the desk at the front of the station trying to work out who could possibly be waiting there for me not just that how could they have found me it must i supposed be morag my heart lifted at the thought but somehow nevertheless i suspected i was wrong a few steps before i entered the office i knew i was goddammit a strident female voice rang out ahead of me call yourselves policemen you havent even got any goddamn guns i felt my eyes widen grandmother i said incredulous my maternal grandmother mrs yolanda cristofiori five foot nothing of bleached blonde leatherskinned texan flanked by two tall but cowedlooking men in suits carrying briefcases turned from berating the duty sergeant and fixed a dramatic smile on me isis honey she exclaimed she strode over oh my look at you she squealed she threw her arms around me lifting me off my feet as i struggled to respond hugging her in return grandmother i said feeling dizzy almost overcome by surprise and yolandas perfume i was so astonished i hadnt even remembered to make the sign oh its so good to see you how you doin are you okay i mean have these bozos treated you good she waved at the two men in suits shed been standing between at the counter i brought some lawyers do you want to file a complaint or anything she put me down i well no im ah i said somewhat lost for words my grandmother yolandas face was less lined than i remembered it as still painted with makeup her hair looked like spun gold except harder she was dressed in highly decorated alligatorhide cowboy boots embroidered jeans a silk shirt in what looked like barcode tartan and a little suede waistcoat studded with pearls yolandas two lawyers looked on smiling insincerely the duty sergeant shed been talking to seemed exasperated right he said you two belong to each other he didnt wait for an answer he pointed to the door with one hand and with the other reached down produced my kitbag and plonked it on the counter out he said yolanda took my hand firmly in hers come on honey well discuss filing a suit against these jerks over a margarita or two they fed you yet you had breakfast well go to my hotel get them to fix you something she marched me to the door glancing back at the lawyers get the childs bag would you george grandmother yolanda originally came to high easter offerance in the summer of with her first husband jerome she was eighteen he was sixtytwo and suffering from cancer he had just sold some sort of oil company mud logging whatever that is and had decided to spend some of his millions travelling the world investigating cancer clinics and indulging a recently developed interest in sects and cults in general i suppose technically were a cult though at the time some people still considered us to be a christian sect it took a while to get that misunderstanding cleared up when yolanda and jerome left after a few weeks yolanda was pregnant she came back to the community with another husband francis and her first child alice in for the second festival of love the first had failed to produce any leapyearians but had otherwise been acclaimed a success by all concerned and continued to visit us every few years often in may for the festival when there was one and in any event usually with a new husband in tow yolandas second husband whom she divorced after a couple of years was called michael she once told me michael had made a fortune in malls and then lost it all in las vegas and ended up valet parking in la for four years between two of her visits i had assumed she meant gangsters molls and that valet parking was a specialised form of landscape gardening so had formed entirely the wrong impression of the man her third husband was steve who was much younger than her and something called a garage software wizard apparently he became a multimillionaire overnight while backpacking in europe he died in the andes three years ago while attempting to develop the sport of avalanche surfing which seemingly and obviously i suppose is every bit as dangerous as it sounds yolanda has inherited at least two fortunes then and leads what sounds like an energetic and restless existence i think her daughter and her visits to high easter offerance were almost the only two things that introduced any stability into her antsy life due to those visits my mother and father knew each other as children though they used to meet only every four years my father christopher was the elect of god of course the first leapyearian to be born after the founding of our faith he was used to being spoiled im told that alice my mother grew up teasing him terribly and making fun of the arguably excessively reverent treatment he had become used to receiving from those around him in the community alice was three years younger than my father but i imagine that her usbased but globetrotting life made her seem at least as old as he they became sweethearts when she was fourteen and wrote lots of letters while she was alternately travelling the world with her mother and attending school in dallas they were married by salvador himself in and obviously wasted no time for allan arrived later that year and i was born to orderwide rejoicing by all accounts on the th of february television i said slightly shocked checked in turned on to see what miserable handful of channels you had over here these days and almost the first thing i saw was you being strongarmed into a paddy wagon shouting imprecations good heavens i said i thought about it taking time off from tearing into my breakfast well i suppose the creator can use the works of the benighted to tip the hand of providence should they so desire who are we to question i shrugged and tucked back into my smoked salmon and scrambled eggs pancakes and syrup we were in grandmother yolandas suite on the top floor of her hotel a sybaritically luxurious former mansion on a hill overlooking the city i had just stepped out of the shower in the marble and mahogany bathroom and now sat on the floor of the sitting room wrapped in a huge white fluffy robe my back resting against a beautiful floralpatterned couch yolanda had dried my hair and then wrapped the towel round my head in front of me on the coffee table sat a huge silver tray loaded with food i slurped coffee and chomped salmon looking out over bath visible beyond the tall windows and between the sweeping vertical folds of sumptuous green velvet curtains i felt clean fresh wickedly perfumed from the soap in the shower and just generally submerged in heady opulence meanwhile my stomach gradually filled with food it will not have escaped the more alert reader that my maternal grandmother has never really gone wholeheartedly for the more ascetic aspects of our faith and probably never will even if in her own words we show her a hairshirt designed by gootchy i will confess to feeling a little awkward surrounded by all this luxury but reckoned that it merely balanced out the effects of my night sleeping rough and my night in the cells not to mention my unseemly treatment at the hands of the police yolanda had flown into glasgow on the friday hired a car and driven straight to high easter offerance on her way to gleneagles she had been told i was staying with brother zebediah in london and so drove to edinburgh and flew from there to heathrow and hired another car been unable to work out where the squat was so flagged down a taxi and followed it to the address in kilburn where zeb told her i had left for dudgeon magna yesterday she had taken a train from london to bath and hired yet another car scorpion or something looks more like a dead cod why cant you people build cars supposed to be big but it feels more like a subcompact to me and driven to dudgeon magna i now silently cursed myself for not telling zeb exactly where id been heading whatever instinct had led me not to mention clissolds health farm and country club to him had obviously been a product of unsaved contamination polluting my soul anyway yolanda had turned up no sign of me in dudgeon magna and so had returned to her hotel to work out what to do next when shed seen me being unjustly apprehended on the local television news it had taken until this morning to find out where i was and to hire some lawyers with whom to browbeat the police after dismissing the lawyers and lambasting them for not accepting payment by american express card on the spot shed spent the blurringly fast drive from bristol to bath regaling me with what shed been up to since id seen her last an athletic young swimming pool cleaner from los angeles called gerald seemed to figure rather prominently as did a running battle with whatever authority supervises the waiting list for rafting expeditions down the colorado river through the grand canyon grandmother seemed to find the idea of a fiveyear queue for anything in the united states to be not just criminally obscene but tantamount to treason to the american dream a hanging matter i mean are these people communists for gods sakes with that out of her system she was then free to concentrate on giving me her itinerary over the last few days with particular attention to detailed critical notes on the various institutional inefficiencies and organisational absurdities she had encountered along the way while trying to catch up with me you cant even make a right well a left on a red light here i did it this morning and the goddamn attorneys nearly bailed out on me whats wrong with you people while my grandmother held forth i checked my kitbag to make sure everything was there my vials have been interfered with id wailed great well sue their asses yolanda had said flinging the car into another distinctly adventurous overtaking manoeuvre are you in a rush then granny i asked wiping the plate with a pancake child yolanda said throatily putting one hand heavy with precious metals and stones onto my towellinged shoulder never call me your granny sorry grandmother i said twisting my head to grin cheekily up at her this is something of a ritual with us each time we meet i went back to my pancakes and syrup as it happens yes i am yolanda said crossing her legs and resting her alligatorhide boots on the coffee table leaving for prague on wednesday to look at a red diamond heard theres one there might be for sale a red diamond i said in a pause that seemed to require some response yep ordinary diamonds are common as cowshit just debeers keeps the prices artificially high anybody who buys an ordinary diamond is a damned fool but red diamonds are scarcer than honest politicians only about six in the whole damn world and i want at least to see one of them and hold it in my hand just once even if i dont get to buy it blimey i said prague prague chekland or whatever the hell they call it these days you wanna come i cant i have to look for my cousin morag yeah what is all this shit about her your grandaddy gone soft on her or somethin whats goin on up there anyway they seemed real frosty to me when i was there you done something wrong they angry with you what eh i said turning to frown up at her no shittin honey she said i didnt get to see the dear leader but i talked to your brother allan and erin they acted like salvador was angry with you or somethin angry with me i gasped wiping my fingers on a starched white napkin and sitting up on the couch with my grandmother i was so shocked it was some minutes before i realised i hadnt used my sitting board i think the carpet had been so soft there was little sensation of change what are they angry about beats me yolanda said i asked but i wasnt told there must be some mistake i said feeling funny in my insides all of a sudden i havent done anything wrong my mission was going fine until yesterday i was very pleased with it well hey maybe i picked them up wrong yolanda said drawing her feet up underneath her turning to me and starting to towel my hair again dont you listen to your crazy old grandma i stared towards the window but what can have happened i could hear my own voice faltering maybe nuthin dont worry about it hey come on whats happenin with morag i explained about my cousins importance to the communitys missionary work and her letter informing us she was leaving our faith and would not be returning to us for the festival okay so you havent been able to find her yolanda said well hire a detective im not sure that would really be appropriate grandmother i said sighing i was personally charged with the task does it matter as long as you find her i suspect so yes yolanda shook her head boy you people she breathed there is another problem i said yeah i explained about the video and my discovery morag worked under the name fusillada debauch as a pornographic film artiste what yolanda yelled youre shittin me she slapped both her designerjeaned thighs at once i think that had she been wearing a stetson or a tengallon hat or something shed have thrown it in the air whoo that girl oh boy she laughed towards the ceiling you dont think salvador could have found out about morag being fusillada from zeb or somebody do you i asked wondering if that might account for his displeasure no yolanda said it didnt seem like it was anything to do with her hmm oh dear i said frowning and putting my hands to my lips dont worry about it honey my grandmother said you going to keep looking for morag yes of course i said okay so am i allowed to help you oh id think so i said good well see what we can do together maybe morag will turn up yet she sat forward reaching for the telephone on the coffee table lets have a margarita yes i said absently still troubled by what might be wrong at high easter offerance god has a way of providing when one most needs yeah hi i need a pitcher of margarita and two glasses and dont forget the salt okay in a saucer or whatever thats right and a fresh repeat fresh lime and a sharp knife thats all thank you she put down the telephone you really didnt get any idea what might be wrong at the community i asked my grandmother none at all honey i just thought they seemed a bit pissed at you she held my hand but i could have been wrong oh dear i said biting my lip yolanda hugged me dont you worry now hey come on what do you want to do want me to call this health farm place and get fusillada she said grinning and wiggling her head from side to side i dont know i said playing with the cord of my dressinggown i got the impression she might be trying to avoid me maybe oh goodness knows i threw up my hands and then stuffed them under my armpits well lets just head on down there what do you say what now soon as weve had our margaritas and soon as we can find some clothes for you suppose itll take the hotel laundry at least overnight to clean that stuff of yours i had already used my one change of clothes things seem to get dirty very fast in london and had not managed to get the others washed i thought there was still a couple of days wear in what id been wearing but my grandmother disagreed and is not the sort of person to argue with in such circumstances so i needed new clothes yolandas method of shopping was to bring the shop to us she rang a clothes boutique in town and ordered them to bring the articles id asked for socks undergarments white shirts black trousers and black jackets my hat though battered would do as it was as i wasnt sure what size i was she made them bring a selection an hour or two later my head buzzing slightly from the three margaritas id had i was dressed i dont think either of us were really happy i felt the clothes were too fine and dressy while my grandmother thought they were far too severe on the grounds of colour alone the boots then she said tramping through the piles of discarded clothes boxes and voluminous wrapping material strewn about the floor as she looked me up and down the shop assistant shed had come out to us kneeled on the floor looking tired dont you think those boots are just awful sam yolanda asked the assistant they are a bit sort of agricultural yolanda supplied yah agricultural yah i count that as praise i said aint meant as such honey yolanda said shaking her head why dont we find somewhere that does proper boots like these she lifted up one foot to show me her alligator hides cowboy boots i exclaimed even sam looked shocked i thought well sure yolanda said real boots with a heel i dont know how you can wear those things must feel like youre walking uphill all the time excuse me i said primly these boots are fine these boots and i are used to each other i will not part with them stubborn child sure you wont try on the red velvet jacket positive the black skirt certainly not the gaultier dress its horrible its black its black and horrible its black and beautiful nonsense it is too and hes a lovely guy ive met him jeanpaul a cuddly bear youd like him wears a kilt i dont care the leather trousers then oh i said exasperated go on just try them theyre you honey really well these trousers creak i said shifting my bottom on the sitting board we were in yolandas latest hire car heading south for dudgeon magna at high speed theyre fine you look great in them hell you smell great in them honey we hurtled round a corner the car lurched and i had a strange sense that it was pivoting yolanda swore and chuckled at the same time and did something fancy with the steering wheel what was that i asked glancing at her bad camber tightening bend she said tersely when will you people learn to build roads properly at least i said these trousers dont let me slip around so much on the sitting board when you go round corners yeah my grandmother chuckled sounding like she was enjoying herself keep those buns well anchored haw haw haw i gripped the sides of the seat as we went round another bend i looked down what are these buttons for yolanda glanced over seat adjustment electric i nodded impressed that disabled people were so well catered for in ordinary automobiles i grabbed the sides of the seat again for the next bend and duly found myself rising and tipping back in my seat i giggled then gasped as we just missed an oncoming car ah this bit isnt dual carriageway grandma i know that why are these people flashing their lights at me well i dont think its because they know you wimps the big dark blue car swept into the drive of clissolds health farm and country club we had encountered a few police vehicles and passed a layby where they were checking an old decrepitlooking coach but we hadnt been stopped the health farm and country club proved to be a mansion with what looked like a giant conservatory tacked onto the back i suppose i had been expecting something more farmlike the mansions grounds looked old neat and manicured just like the receptionist im afraid miss whit checked out this morning oh drat shit did she say where she was going i asked well i wouldnt be able to tell you if she had but oh for gods sakes this is her cousin and shes my yolanda broke off and looked at me frowning hell what is morag to me i shrugged greatniece grandniece yolanda turned back to the receptionist yeah whatever she said with convincing decisiveness well she didnt anyway sorry the receptionist smiled she didnt look very sorry was she due to check out today i asked trying to look sweet and reasonable and in need of help let me see the receptionist said lifting a pair of glasses from round her neck and placing them on her nose she keyed something into her computer then consulted the screen no she was due to stay until the end of the week damn hmm i said oh i remember the lady said replacing her glasses on her cardigan i do believe she said shed changed her plans because of something shed seen on the local news last night yolanda and i looked at each other chapter fourteen i know you think im just a complaining old woman isis not at and i know you dont drive but you must see what i mean well i mean it stands to reason you go into a gas station and you get gas you get served somebody fills your tank maybe gets their hands dirty checks your oil washes the bugs off your windshield kicks the tyres whatever you pay the bill and thats all very fine but you pull into a gas station you serve yourself you get your own hands dirty maybe break a nail for gods sakes no oil check no windshield wash unless you do it yourself and you pay the same amount of money now really i mean come on does that seem reasonable to you do you think thats right put like that im only asking you because maybe you can be objective because you dont drive and maybe you havent ever thought about all this maybe youve never noticed all this i mean youve never bin to the states have you no no exactly so you dont expect service pumps and selfserve pumps and because youre a good little orderite youve never even seen movies about the states either right right right unusual in this day and age believe you me so you grandma what honey i laughed is all this important i mean to say does it really matter well hell yes service matters this country used to be cute and quaint and kinda socialist its got a bit better now since your mrs thatcher people are more polite they know their jobs are on the line and there are other people wholl do them they know there are other corporations wholl do the same thing for less money or just plain better so youre sort of on the way you know but you still got a long way to go and you lost a lot of the cuteness along the way believe me you abandon cuteness you better make damn sure youre pretty goddamn efficient or youre down the tubes baby and all this ye olde fuckin heritage shit aint gonna fool people forever is that a blue flashing light behind us say what ah sheeit now you see that was a case in point if you had onthespot fines those traffic cops could have taken me for a couple of hundred bucks help pay for that fancy bearmobile there instead what do i get a tickingoff i mean thats sad i think being american helped i said watching the needle swing back up across the speedometer are american miles really shorter than british ones i think so arent they same with gallons i think yolanda waved one hand dismissively what the hell it worked they let us go probably thought of all the paperwork involved hmm anyway id been thinking is efficiency really the best way to measure this sort of thing what well if you can do a job more efficiently with fewer people thats all very well for that one particular company but if you all still have to live in the same society does it matter we could probably do a lot of things more efficiently with fewer people at the community but that would just leave the people put out of work hanging around feeling useless whats the point in that you cant throw people off the farm or lock them up or kill them so why not let them all have a job even if thats less efficient yolanda was shaking her head honey thats what the communists used to do and look what happened to them well perhaps that happened for other reasons what im saying is that efficiency is a strange way to evaluate how a society is doing after all the most efficient thing to do might be to kill everybody as soon as they grow old so they wont be a burden but you cant do that either because the eskimos the goddamn inuit they used to do exactly that yolanda said but it wasnt when you got to a certain numerical age it was once you couldnt pull your weight if you looked after yourself you could go on a long time maybe they had no choice but my point is that morality outranks efficiency and anyway extreme efficiency would dictate less choice in the end the most efficient thing would be for everybody to drive the same sort of car due to the economies of scale or for there not to be any private cars at all you wouldnt like that would you yolanda grinned and shook her head you dont really understand capitalism do you isis from what ive heard the best economists in the world dont understand capitalism either or do they all agree nowadays and there are no more booms and slumps just a steadily rising growth rate child no system is perfect but this ones the best we got thats the point well i think our system works better i said settling myself primly in my seat with my hands clasped in my lap the high easter offerance estate is a model of archaic working practices inefficiency overmanning and jobduplication and everybody is extremely happy yolanda laughed well good for you guys isis but i dont know that would scale up too successfully perhaps not but it is my belief that contentment speaks for itself and has no need to worship at the altar of monetary efficiencys false and brazen idol whoa yolanda said glancing over at me with narrowed eyes you speaking excathedra there oh elect one lets just say that when the community passes into my charge as it sadly must one day there will be no change in the way the farm and the order is run good for you honey you do it your way dont let me persuade you no different whatever you say i said we had returned to bath from dudgeon magna to discuss what to do next we had another margarita we suspected that morag might have returned to la mancha mr leopolds home in essex yolanda attempted to call the house but the number was exdirectory and i had not thought to look for the number when id had the chance in the hallway by the phone when tyson was distracting the young man how fars essex yolanda asked a hundred and fifty miles i hazarded beyond london wanna go or dyou want to head north now i dont know i confessed pacing up and down the sitting room of grandmother yolandas suite my hands clasped behind my back i was in a quandary i really didnt like the sound of the way things were going back at high easter offerance and my first instinct was to return there as quickly as possible to discover what was going on and do whatever sorting out might be required nevertheless i was here on an important mission and moragfusilladas trail had not yet gone totally cold my duty remained as it had been to attempt to track and intercept my cousin and reason with her i continued pacing my new leather trousers creaked and squeaked and i kept wanting to giggle at this which reminded me i stopped and looked yolanda in the eye are you fit to drive grandma yolanda raised her glass almost up to operating level maybe we should get the train nonsense but where are we going essex i decided i stuck my hands in the pockets of my fancy trousers do you think my old clothes are ready yet la mancha was dark silent and locked it was evening by the time we got there and wed have seen any lights on inside there was no sign of tyson or the young man or anybody else we stood on the back lawn looking into a smokedglass conservatory which held a huge round bath the light faded slowly from the skies above theyre outa town were outa luck yolanda growled oh dear we stepped back and walked round the side of the house a small bright light came on under the eaves ahha i said ahha nuthin yolanda said shaking her head those are security lights child automatic must of just got dark enough oh we returned to the car past the painted plough cartwheel and buggy which i realised now were just ornamental the gate had been padlocked so we had to get back over as wed got in over the top well hell grandma yolanda said settling into the drivers seat of the hired car well just be forced to go into london stay at the dorchester eat at le gavroche catch a show and party the night away in some grotesquely expensive club drinking vintage champagne she made a clicking noise with her mouth and fired up the car i hate it when that happens hows your head it feels like the china shop just after the bulls paid a visit what full of bull shit haw haw haw i opened my eyes and gave my grandmother what was supposed to be a withering look she glanced at me over the top of her wall street journal and winked the greysuited chauffeur slid the car a jagwaar according to yolanda into a gap in the midmorning traffic near harrods we were heading for heathrow airport i shifted on my sitting board making the leather trousers squeak id had little choice over what to put on that morning the hotel in bath had not been able to extricate my old clothes from the laundry in time for us leaving for london we had left the orders address and been assured they would be forwarded but it meant i had to wear the gear my grandmother had bought for me which didnt seem altogether suitable for a return to the community however i was in no state to try to find different clothes yolanda wore boots dark blue culottes and a short matching jacket oh dear i said i think im going to you know how to open the window yolanda said urgently its this button here oh i said farting audibly inside my leather trousers sorry i said sheepishly grandma yolanda sniffed the air she shook her head then buried it in the newspaper hell child smells like a skunk crawled up your ass an died as ive indicated our faith is happy with tipsiness but frowns upon drunkenness taken to the point of incapacity inarticulacy and insensibility nevertheless it is recognised that people who normally only ever get slightly intoxicated may occasionally become utterly inebriate and that one state can lead to the other unless this starts to happen rather too frequently the hangover will itself be seen as quite sufficient punishment for the transgression and nothing will be said occasionally when a luskentyrian has a bad hangover they are inclined to wish that salvador had been instructed to ban the use of alcohol entirely when he was being given the rules which would govern our faith in fact right at the start that is exactly what did happen for a whole week as my grandfather scribbled down the results of his having tuned in to gods frequency there was a commandment there is no other word for it written on page two of salvadors original notes which stated that strong liquor had to be avoided strenuously it was crossed out during week two of our founders revelations around the time when mr mcilone started giving my grandfather medicinal measures of whisky reminding salvador that there was a place for such things and causing him to realise that what hed heard when he thought he was being told to prohibit drink was in fact a false signal before id left high easter offerance id been helping my grandfather with his latest revisions to the orthography our holy book and repository of all salvadors wisdom and insights part of this process had comprised weeding out false signals the results of dispatches our founder had been the medium for which had turned out not fully to represent gods message i regard it as a sign of strength and the influence of a higher truth that our overseer is happy to look back and admit that some of his pronouncements were flawed or at least capable of improvement of course this wasnt really his fault he has consistently tried to report the voice which he hears as accurately and faithfully as possible but he is only human and to be human is to err but to be human is also to be flexible and adaptable and if the individual does not succumb to the terrible influence of pride it is also to be capable of admitting one has been wrong and to try to make corrections so having originally held that god was male our founder later realised that the voice he had heard had only sounded male because he himself was male he had been expecting a male voice he had grown up in a christian society which took it as read that god was male and always depicted god as a man and so it was understandable that while undergoing the revelatory whirlwind which had swept through him my grandfather had missed the fact that god was not as hed been brought up to believe it is true that we can only take so much revelation at one time only bring on board a certain amount of change otherwise we simply become confused and start to lose context we must have some sort of framework to understand ideas within and when the ideas you are using are so powerful and so important that they threaten to change the nature of that framework itself you have to be careful to change only a little at a time or you risk losing the pattern for the whole fragile artifice that is human understanding so it might even be grandfather has hinted that god deliberately misled him or at least made no attempt to correct him when it became clear that he was making such mistakes because to have done so would effectively have been saying everything you have believed until now has been false which if it had not caused my grandfather to doubt his very sanity might well have caused him to take the easier course of ignoring what god was telling him dismissing the voice as some aberration just some banal medical condition not a profound paradigmshift in the spiritual history of the world and the birth of a fresh and vital new religion however it may have been it is the case that having put in place the skeleton of salvadors faith god later fleshed out this new creation and gradually revealed to our founder the tripartite nature of their being both male and female and sexless this was what god had been saying to christians but they had misinterpreted it as father son and holy ghost because of the nature of society of the time which was profoundly patriarchal similarly salvador originally thought that there was a devil old redtop as he sometimes referred to him and that there was a hell too a place submerged in eternal darkness whose walls were made of glass where tormented souls burned like a billion scattered embers on a million blackly towering levels forever sliced and cut by the razorsharp edges of their frozen prison later he was able to separate this fevered fearful vision from the quiet calm articulation of perfection that is the true voice of god and realise that again what he had been experiencing was something from inside himself these were his visions not gods they were the result of the fear and terror and guilty dread that exist in everyone and which certain faiths especially christianity prey upon and exaggerate the better to control their flocks my grandfather was a new voice bringing glad tidings of joyful ultimate hope and a whole new way of looking at both the world and god but he still had to speak in the tongue hed been taught as a child and which other people understood and that language itself carried with it a host of assumptions and prejudices telling its own old stories even as salvador was using it to reveal his brandnew one the idea that there is a devil is obviously a powerful one and common to many different cultures but i think our founder is right in emphasising the satanfree nature of our faith we have no need of bogeymen to frighten our children with and do not believe in giving adults any excuse for their own faults ours is a modern faith born after the wars great bloodletting in the midst of our century of pain when humanity finally revealed itself as the ultimate devil just as there is both fear and comfort to be drawn from devils the fear speaks for itself the comfort comes from being able to absolve oneself of responsibility for ones actions so there is inversely both comfort and fear to be drawn from the realisation that there are no such things after all of course this means that we must shoulder more responsibility for our lives than other religions would allow and one of the other errors in this area my grandfather has cleared up over the years includes the heresy of prudishness the heresy of prudishness was a result of grandfather originally teaching that while it was wrong to restrict sexual relations between people of the same generation it was right to do so between generations he later amended this to specify that only if one full generation lay between the two people concerned should their love be forbidden again i think one can see the divinely inspired but still humanly limited prophet struggling to hear the creators voice above the clutter of a hypocritical and morally constipated society whose restrictive teachings still echoed in his ears let cynics find their own shortcomings and denied desires in what they blame our founder for i believe he has only ever tried to tell the truth as best he can and if the truth leads him as our leader to a better fuller personal life then we ought all to be grateful both for him and for ourselves there is an afterlife and our faiths ideas on that too have evolved over the years originally incorporating the idea of heaven and hell it was fairly conventional and recognisably christian in inspiration however as grandfather has tuned in more and more accurately to what god is saying the afterlife in the shape of the allabsorbing godhead has become more complicated and more sophisticated indeed it might almost be more true to say that what we live in is the prelife a sort of minor overture to the grandly symphonic opera that follows a scrawny solo before the richly glorious massed choir most religions have some sort of angle on the truth in this regard but i think it obvious that luskentyrianism with elements of almost all of them decisively outdoes the lot i did not enjoy my flight from london to edinburgh which was the first i had ever made for one thing i did not feel well and the various movements and changes of pressure involved in flight seemed almost designed to introduce a reeling of discomfort even without the effects of far too much alcohol the night before in addition though there are various mistakes and errors of practice and etiquette one can make when travelling by aircraft and i think i made all of them grandmother yolanda found my gaffs most amusing the businesssuited fellow sitting to my other side was less impressed my first mistake was to tell him in a spirit of vigilant and caring friendliness and general camaraderie to study his safety instructions when the conductress told him to he looked at me as if i was quite mad my final mistake on the plane itself anyway was a result of trying to show off how often is that the case the cup of tea i asked for after my miniaturised meal was a little hot and id noticed that above each seat was a small swivelling nozzle which dispensed cold air i decided to redeem myself in the eyes of the businessman at my side by using the stream of air to lower the temperature of my tea this was a fine idea in theory and would undoubtably have worked perfectly well if i hadnt ostentatiously held my cup right up to the nozzle and twisted it fully on producing a fierce and highly directed pulse of air which displaced the tea in the cup and showered it over the businessman and the person in the seat behind him yolanda found the whole episode quite hilarious and even stopped complaining about the lack of first class for a few moments yolandas good mood evaporated rapidly when we got to edinburgh airport and she couldnt remember where shed left her hire car thought itd be quicker just leaving it here instead of turning it in and having to hire another one she said stamping down another row of cars i followed pushing a trolley what sort of car was it i asked not that it would make much difference to me cars are cars dont know yolanda said small well smallish doesnt the car key tell you something i left the keys inside the exhaust pipe she said with a hint of embarrassment saves carrying zillions of keys around id noticed that some cars had stickers in the back window identifying hire companies can you remember what company it belonged to no theyve got these letters on posts all over the car park was it near cant remember i was in a hurry what colour was the car red no blue shit yolanda looked frustrated can you remember what cars it was parked between get real isis oh yes i suppose they might have moved but maybe theyre still here range rover one was a range rover one of those tall things we checked all the range rovers in the car park before yolanda thought to check her credit card slips there was no sign of a car hire from glasgow airport probably left it in the car she admitted oh the hell with this lets hire another one what about the one thats here fuck it theyll find it eventually wont you get charged let them sue thats what lawyers are for if our faith had a golden age it was probably between the years to that was when our order grew from just a few people many of them related in one way or another to a fully functioning religion with a complete theology an established base indeed two established bases the original at mr mcilones farm at luskentyre and the new one at high easter offerance a settled succession of leapyearians through my father christopher and then myself and a steadily growing number of converts some of whom came to stay and work at the community and some of whom were happier in the outside world though remaining committed to the order and pledged both to come to its aid if required and to act as our missionaries to the unsaved then in two disasters befell us one affecting each of our two spiritual and physical homes on harris in april mr eoin mcilone died to our astonishment and it has to be said to our founders fury he died intestate and his farm was inherited by an unsaved mr mcilones vile stepbrother from the town of banff who was interested only in selling the place as quickly as possible and making as much money as he could he had no sympathy with our faith and as soon as he took possession of the property he turned out the brothers and sisters who lived and worked there some of those people had been there for thirty years working the land and maintaining the fabric of the buildings putting three decades of sweat and toil into the place for no more reward than a roof over their heads and food in their bellies but they were ejected without a thought without as much as a thank you or a byyourleave as though they were criminals we were told that mr mcilones stepbrother went to church every sunday but by god there was little christian charity in the man if his hell was true hed rot in it of the five brothers and sisters who were living at luskentyre when mr mcilone passed on two came to us at the community one stayed in the islands to work on another farm one remained there to fish and one returned to her original family in england our world was suddenly smaller and for all that high easter offerance was a fine productive place and far more balmily easeful than luskentyre still we felt i think the loss of our original home as though we had lost an old friend of course i was barely three when this happened and can remember little or nothing of the time but im sure i must have been affected by the mood of the people around me and surely joined in the mourning in my own childish way luskentyre remained and remains a holy place for our order and many of us have been on pilgrimage to the area i myself travelled there last year attended by sisters fiona and cassie though we are denied access to the farm itself by its current owners and must content ourselves with staying in local bed and breakfasts wandering the coastline and the dunes and surveying the remnants of the ruined seaweed factory our grief at losing luskentyre proved to be only a presentiment of what was to come however at the other end of the year i have to be in prague tomorrow yolanda said as we finally made the motorway that would take us to within a few miles of high easter offerance sure you dont want to come grandma apart from anything else i dont have a passport shame you should get one ill get you one i think it causes problems when we apply for passports ill bet what do you expect from a country where they not only wont let you bring a gun into the country but wont even let you buy one when you get here she shook her head will you be coming straight back nope then i head for venice italy i thought about this i thought your other house was in venice california yolanda nodded ive a house there and an apartment in the original venice doesnt that get confusing does for the irs yolanda said glancing over at me and grinning i was shocked arent they some sort of terrorist organisation grandmother yolanda had a good laugh at that kind of she agreed come to think of it now that russias opened up i might buy places in both georgias that would confuse the hell out of them too do you think youll ever settle down grandmother not even in an urn child i want to have my ashes scattered to the four winds she glanced at me you could do that for me maybe if i left you instructions in my will would you um i said well i i suppose so dont look upset i might change my mind anyway get myself frozen instead they can do that nowadays you know really i had no idea what she was talking about anyway yolanda said prague venice then scotland again she pronounces it skatlind im goin to try and get back for the end of the month oh for the festival well no not specifically but what is happening with that for you personally i mean i shifted uncomfortably in my seat and looked at the scenery of fields and hills how do you you know what i mean isis she said not unkindly i knew what she meant i knew so well that i had been trying hard not to think about it for some long time by then and this whole excursion to look for morag had itself provided a way of not thinking about it but now that morags trail had finally gone cold and there seemed to be some sort of problem requiring my presence at the community i had no choice but to confront the question what to do isis are you happy taking this part in this lovefest or not its my duty i said lamely bullshit but it is i said im the elect of god youre a free woman isis you can do what you please not really there are expectations fooey i am the third generation theres nobody else as far as leapyearians go im it i said i mean anybody can be a leapyearian it doesnt have to be somebody in the family or even somebody in the community just somebody in the order but it would be neater if it was kept in the family grandfather hoped it might be morag who provided the next generation but if shes not even part of our faith any more that doesnt mean you have to try to produce the next generation now if you dont want to my grandmother looked over at me do you is do you want to be a mother now well i had the sinking feeling that yolanda wasnt going to look back at the road until i answered her i dont know i said looking away and watching the spire of linlithgow palace appear round the side of a low hill to my left i really cant decide what to do isis dont let them put pressure on you if you dont want to have a child yet just tell them hell i know that old tyrant i know he wants another elect to keep this well to keep the order going but youre just young theres still plenty of time theres always the next goddamn festival and if you decide its never going to be the right time then but by the next festival the pressure will be even worse i cried well then yolanda began then glanced at me frowning wait a minute you sure is a leap year yes of course i thought if the years divisible by four its a leap year unless its divisible by four hundred when it isnt a leap year no i said wearily we had all this drummed into us preschool at the community its not a leap year if its divisible by one hundred but if its divisible by four hundred it is a leap year oh anyway i said i dont think salvador believes hell see lets cut to the chase here is the question is are you ready to be a mother or not thats what they expect of you isnt it yes i said miserably thats what they want well are you ready i dont know i said louder than i meant and looked away chewing on a knuckle we drove on in silence for a while the smokes and steams of grangemouth oil refinery swung past to our right you seeing anybody isis yolanda asked gently you got anybody special i swallowed then shook my head no not really you had any boyfriends yet no i confessed isis i know you seem to develop slower out here but shit youre nineteen dont you like boys i like them fine i just dont my voice trailed off as i wondered how to put it you dont want to fuck them well i said blushing i dont think so what about girls yolanda sounded a little surprised but mostly just very interested no not really i leaned forward elbows on thighs chin in hands staring glumly at the cars and trucks ahead of us on the motorway i dont know what i want i dont know who i want i dont know that i want well then gods sakes isis yolanda said waving one hand around all the more reason to tell salvador to take a hike christ almighty get yourself sorted out first no one who loves you is going to give a damn if youre gay or want to stay celibate but dont get pregnant on the off chance youll drop on the twentyninth of february just to keep that old letch happy grandmother i said genuinely shocked you mean salvador who the hell else he is our founder you cant talk about him like that isis child yolanda said shaking her head you know i love you and god help me i even have a lot of time for that old rogue because i think basically hes a good man but he is a man i mean hes human and hes very male you know what im saying i dont really know that hes anything holy at all im sorry to say that because i know it hurts you but grandmother now just hear me out child ive seen just about every damn cult and faith and sect and religion and pseudoreligion the world has to offer in my time and it seems to me maybe in some sense your grandfather is right about one thing they are all searching for the truth but they never find it not all of it not any of them and that includes you people youre no more right than anybody else i was sitting with my mouth hanging open appalled by what i was hearing id always known grandmother yolanda wasnt the strictest adherent of our order but id like to think that somewhere underneath all this restless rootless wasteful consumerism there was still a core of faith and you know what i think i think its all a load of crap i dont doubt there is a god although maybe even thats more habit than true faith god knows but i dont think anybody in any religion has ever said one damn useful thing about him or her or it you never noticed religions always seem to get invented by men when you ever hear of a cult or a sect started by a woman hardly ever women have the power of creation in them men have to fantasise about it create creation itself just to compensate ovary envy thats all it is yolanda nodded with selfcertitude while i looked on know what decided me on all this she looked at me i shrugged too choked to speak koresh she said remember him i dont think so what waco we aint comin out were you on the moon or something you must have seen yolanda rolled her eyes no i guess you didnt wait i said yes i think my friend mr warriston might have told me something about it wasnt that in texas town called waco my grandmother confirmed about a hundred miles south from dallas drove down there the day it happened day it ended saw the embers made me mad as hell goddamn government doing that not that it was right to bomb oklahoma city mind but the point was koresh she said wagging one finger at me they showed film of him from before holding a bible and leading his followers in some marathon worship session and said he wanted to be a rock star tried to be one in fact but didnt get anywhere became a prophet instead and how did he end up living worshipped thats how in a place where he could have any woman he wanted and smoke dope and drink all night with his buddies hog heaven he got the rockstar life without having to become one he got what he really wanted sex and drugs and worship he was no more holy than i dont know frank zappa or somebody but he got to pretend he was got his own farm all the guns he could play with and at the end he even got to become some sort of dumb martyr thanks to the feds and that fat dick clinton frankly i didnt care koresh died or care very much that his followers did though i probably should you like to think they knew the choice they were making and were just plain stupid and if youd somehow gotten into the same situation youd have been smarter no it was the children that made me cry isis it was knowing they died knowing they suffered and werent old enough to have made up their own minds about whatever insane fucking powertrip that egotistical asshole koresh was taking his people on i stared at my grandmother she nodded as she looked ahead thats my thoughts on the subject granddaughter seems to me women have been falling for this holyman shit down through all the centuries and we aint stopped falling for it yet jesus the kkk koresh khomeini kahane well to hell with the lot of them all the fundamentalists and that aum shitface gang from japan too yolanda shook her head angrily worlds more like a goddamn comicbook every fuckin day i nodded and thought the better of asking my grandmother exactly what she was talking about she took a deep breath and seemed to calm herself somewhat she smiled briefly at me all im saying is isis dont be in too big a hurry to join up too you get your head sorted out but remember men are a bit crazy and a bit dangerous and theyre jealous as hell too dont sacrifice yourself for them because they sure as shit wont do it for you fact is theyll try and sacrifice you i watched her drive for a while eventually i said so are you apostate too grandmother hell yolanda said looking annoyed i was never really part of your order in the first place is i just went along with it jerome was interested in trying to save his soul i found salvador charismatic at first then later i just got to know all the people at the farm and then alice married christopher that tied me in tight she glanced over at me again then you came along she shrugged looked back at the road id have taken you from them if i could is she looked at me again and for the first time ever i thought she looked uncertain if you hadnt been born the day you were well i might have been allowed to take you they might have let me after the fire however she shrugged once more and concentrated on the road again i turned to watch the road unwind towards us the traffic like little purposeful packets of metal glass and rubber containing their fragile cargoes of humanity chapter fifteen high easter offerance was beautiful that day the breeze was warm the air was clear and filled with the sound of fresh young leaves rustling sunlight made each leaf a green mirror we parked the car at the semicircle of pitted weedstrewn tarmac in front of the rusted gates sophis morris was not there so i guessed she was at work yolanda and i walked down the curving drive its crumbling mossy surface a long carpet of shadow and restless flickering light beneath the overarching trees my leather trousers squeaked the long black jacket yolanda had bought me felt light and elegant especially over the silk shirt the closer to the farm i got the more overdressed i felt and the more contaminated by the sybaritic antics of the previous night i fingered the little black bead that was the head of the hatpin yolanda had given me years before and which i had remembered to remove from my old jacket and insert into the lapel of my new one i had taken great delight in the fact that the police had not discovered it i rubbed its smooth black head between my fingers like something talismanic i briefly considered dirtying my jacket but that would have been ridiculous i was glad id kept my old boots though i was starting to regret id cleaned both them and my old hat jeez you make all your roads so narrow yolanda said stepping round a bramble bush that pushed itself out into the middle of the road its just overgrown i told her shifting my kitbag over my other shoulder i felt a mix of emotions elation at returning home and trepidation at the prospect of what yolanda had hinted might be a frosty welcome yeah but you do anyway yolanda insisted some of those roads up north i mean dont you like tarmacadam i thought the scots invented the damn stuff the woodbeans house stood sentinel at the steep river bank in front of the old iron bridge i looked up at the quiet house yolanda stood shaking her head at the holes in the bridges deck and the narrow pathway of odd assorted planks that led across it thirty feet below the river swirled slowly hold my hand she said putting her hand out behind her i stepped forward and took her hand as she set one tentative foot on the first of the planks gettin so you have to be indiana fuckin jones just to git to your place the drive left the trees and rose a little heading between the wall of the apple orchard to the left and the lawn in front of the greenhouses to the right a couple of the goats looked up from their tethered munching on the lawn to watch us approach we saw the primary children filing out of the greenhouse in an orderly fashion one of them noticed grandma yolanda and me and shouted in a moment they had broken ranks and started running towards us brother calum appeared at the end of the line of running children looking at first concerned then pleased then concerned again yolanda and i were surrounded by a small field of cropheaded children all jabbering and smiling and raising up their arms to be lifted and held while others pinched and stroked my leather trousers and made ooing and ahing noises over my jacket and shirt calum stood by the open door of the greenhouse waved once and nodded cautiously then disappeared through the gateway into the farm courtyard yolanda and i followed each holding hands with half a dozen children and trying to answer a whirlwind of questions we met brother pablo as we entered the courtyard standing holding the bridle of otie the donkey while sister cassie brushed her several of the children left our sides to go and pat and stroke the donkey which blinked placidly sister isis pablo said lowering his eyes as he returned my sign pablo is a couple of years younger than me a tall stooped quietly spoken spaniard who has been with us for a year he usually had a smile for me but not today it seemed hi isis sister cassie said nodding she left the brush hanging in oties coat and let her hands rest on the heads of a couple of the children hey you look really elegant thanks cassie i said then introduced yolanda and pablo we met honey last week yolanda told me oh yes sorry i said as more people appeared in the courtyard from the buildings i waved and returned various greetings allan appeared from the mansion house and hurried through the crowd brother calum exited shortly afterwards and followed him sister yolanda sister isis allan said smiling and took our hands welcome back pablo please take sister isiss bag and follow us yolanda allan pablo and i walked over to the mansion house everybody else stayed outside how are you sister yolanda allan asked as we climbed the steps i looked at the poster advertising my cousin morags fictitious concert at the royal festival hall felt better felt worse yolanda told him when we got to the landing between the order office and salvadors quarters allan hesitated a finger tapping at his lips grandmother he said smiling salvador said he was sorry he missed you the other day and he would love to see you now would you like a chat he motioned towards grandfathers quarters yolanda put her head back a little and looked at my brother through narrowed eyes you dont say yes allan said he put one hand to the small of yolandas back well just have a word with isis sort of a debriefing he nodded at the office doors well just be in here does i began and had been about to say doesnt grandfather want to hear what i have to say but yolanda was there before me fine ill sit in she said oh allan said looking awkward well i think salvadors expecting you hes waited two years he can wait another few minutes i think yolanda smiled narrowly well allan began come on faster we are less time we keep him waiting my grandmother said stepping towards the office doors i saw allans jaw set in a tense line as we followed sister erin stood up from her desk as we entered the office sister isis sister yolanda hello erin how ya doin thank you pablo allan said taking my bag from him and putting it down by the secretarys desk pablo nodded and left closing the door behind him yolanda and i sat in front of allans desk he brought a chair over from beside the smaller desk erin remained there behind us so isis allan said sitting back in his seat how have you been im well i said though in fact i still felt hungover and was starting to wonder if i had a cold coming on however i have to report that my mission to find sister morag has not been successful oh allan said looking sad i started to detail my journey turning round once out of politeness to include sister erin in my audience only to discover that she must have slipped out of the office i hesitated then went on as i told allan of my adventures and he took notes leaning forward over a pad on his desk i realised that my kitbag had vanished too allan had left it lying at the side of the other desk but it wasnt there any more a porn star allan coughed calm demeanour and voice cracking at once fusillada debauch i confirmed good grief he made a note how do you spell that i explained about my visits to mr leopolds office la mancha in gittering clissolds health farm and country club and my return to la mancha yolanda nodded now and again and grunted when i got to the bits that included her i left out falling through ceilings attacks on racialists and visits to night clubs unfortunately i couldnt easily evade being arrested or being seen on television i mentioned attempting to use the zhlonjiz to ask god what to do and taking the cannabis cigarette for the same reason when the zhlonjiz didnt work allan looked awkward and stopped writing ah he said looking pained yes we heard from the fossils about the zhlonjiz why his voice cut off as his gaze flicked behind me towards the door yolanda glanced round then swivelled in her seat she cleared her throat i turned round to see my grandfather standing in the open doorway erin stood behind him salvador was dressed in his usual white robes his face surrounded with white hair looked red grandfather i said rising from my seat yolanda turned round in hers but stayed sitting my grandfather strode into the room straight up to me he did not return the sign he held something small in his hand he leaned past me and slapped whatever it was on the desk in front of my seat and what he hissed is that i looked at the tiny piece of bakelite the top of the zhlonjiz vial grandfather i said perplexed im sorry its all i got back from the police i used a little my grandfather slapped my cheek banging my upper and lower teeth against each other i stared shocked into his furious livid face my cheek burned like some fleshly mirror of his rage i was aware of my grandmother standing quickly at my side shouting something but gradually the view narrowed down to my grandfathers enraged face while everything else seemed to darken and evaporate away at the edges until even the angry crimson of salvadors face appeared to go grey and the various voices i could hear dissolved into their own audible greyness roaring incoherently like a waterfall i felt hands on my shoulders and then the firm wood of the seat beneath me i shook my head feeling as if i was underwater and everything was happening very slowly the hell gives you the right mine my flesh and blood salvador yeah shes mine too so fuckin what she doesnt belong to you she is ours you dont understand what shes ah you always were a goddamn bully grandmother if you and you always were a bloody interferer woman look at the way youve got her dressed like some city hoor salvador what hell you got no right to talk about whores you old fraud what grandmother if you could please what did you stop it stop it stop it stop it i shouted struggling to my feet and having to hold onto the front of the desk to stop myself falling i turned to grandfather involuntarily putting my hand to my cheek why did you do that what have i done by god salvador bellowed ill he stepped forward raising his hand but erin held it while yolanda stepped in between us what have i done i shouted almost screaming salvador roared and lunged forward reaching and picking up the cap from the zhlonjiz jar this is what youve done ye stupid wee bitch he flourished the fragment of cap in my face then threw it at my feet and pushed past me and yolanda he stopped at the doors and pointed back at us youve no right being here he told yolanda well fuck you grandmother said in a reasonable voice and you he said pointing at me you can dress properly and think about coming on your knees as a penitent if you can find some excuse for your treachery he walked out i caught a glimpse of sister jess in the hall outside then the door slammed shut the noise echoing round the wood panelling of the room i turned to yolanda then erin and then allan tears welling up in my eyes what is all this i said trying not to wail but failing erin sighed stooped and picked up the cap of the zhlonjiz vial she shook her head why did you do it isis she asked what i said take the zhlonjiz yes erin said tears in her eyes now thats what it was there for i exclaimed i thought thats what i was supposed to do with it oh isis allan said heavily and sat down in his chair did you think you heard god tell you to erin said as though confused no i said it was my decision then why erin implored because it seemed like the right thing to do what else was i supposed but that wasnt up to you to decide why not who on earth could i ask zeb zeb erin looked confused no your grandfather of course how was i supposed to ask him i yelled simply not understanding what she was talking about hey yolanda began i think you two are what do you mean how erin shouted to his face of course i was in london how could i london erin said what are you talking about im talking i said slowing and trying to keep my temper about taking the zhlonjiz in london how was i supposed to well im talking about taking it from here erin said how could you how could you just take it how could you steal it from us ah i heard allan say jeez yolanda said shaking her head and sitting on the edge of the desk i i began then stopped what i asked steal what are you talking about isis erin said a wisp of greying brown hair had dissociated itself from her bun she blew it away with the side of her mouth what we all want to know she said glancing at allan who nodded wearily is why you took the zhlonjiz in the first place i stared at her for a moment and it was as though the floor beneath me tipped somehow i thought the room itself the mansion house and whole community suddenly creaked and leaned to one side my legs almost buckled and i had to hold onto the edge of the desk again i felt grandma yolandas hand on my arm steadying me i didnt take it i said the note i had lost the note i didnt take it i repeated shaking my head feeling the blood leave my face as i looked from erin to allan and then to yolanda i was given it it was in my bag my kitbag i found it in there i found it really i sat down again my legs wobbly oh dear allan said running fingers through his hair erin put her hand over her eyes shaking her head isis isis she said looking away what is this stuff yolanda said this one of salvadors holy ointments its the holy ointment allan said sounding tired he looked at yolanda for a moment then gave a shrug what it actually does he said awkwardly i mean its very old its probably the point is he said leaning forward over the desk grandfather believes he regards he knows in his own heart that it is effective allan glanced at me he hit his chest with his fist in here salvador knows that it works we respect that he glanced at me we all respect that i didnt take it i said it was in my bag i found it there was a note what erin said allan just closed his eyes a note i said a note from salvador a note erin said i could see the disbelief in her eyes hear it in her voice yes i said well it was signed with an s allan and erin exchanged looks what did this note say erin sighed it just said in case you need it i told them then an s they exchanged looks again it did i said i think something like that i think those were the words or it was just in case s something something similar do you have this note erin asked i shook my head no i admitted no it disappeared i think the police dont isis erin said shaking her head and walking away with her hand over her eyes again dont please dont do this dont make it worse allan muttered something and shook his head but its true i said looking from erin to yolanda who patted my hand i know i know honey i believe you isis erin said coming back over to me and taking one of my hands in hers i really think youd be better off just admitting you took the look yolanda said if she says she didnt take the goddamn ointment she didnt okay sister yolanda and i aint your goddamn sister isis erin said earnestly turning from my grandmother to me and taking both my hands in hers dont do this your grandfathers terribly upset if you just confess what are you fucking catholics now isis erin said ignoring my grandmother i had looked at yolanda and now erin jerked my hands turning me back to her isis make a clean breast of it just say you took it on impulse say you thought it was something else say you but none of thats true i protested i found the vial in my bag with a note tied to it well not tied to it it was a rubber band isis erin said shaking me again stop youre only digging yourself in deeper no im not im telling the truth im not going to lie erin threw my hands down and walked off to the smaller desk she stood there one of her hands up at her face her shoulders shaking yolanda patted my arm again you just tell it like it is kid you just tell the truth and the hell with them all isis allan said leadenly i turned to him still with a sense that things were happening in some strange slowing fluid that was all around me i cant he took a deep breath look he said ill he glanced at the doors ill have a word with salvador okay perhaps hell have calmed down a bit later then maybe you and he could you know talk you have to decide what youre going to say i cant tell you what to say but he is really really upset and well you just have to decide whats best i he shook his head stared down at his hands clasped on the desk i dont know what to make of all this its just its like everythings he gave a small despairing laugh we must all just pray and to trust to god listen to them isis listen to what they say yes i said drying my eyes with my sleeve and then with a handkerchief yolanda produced i straightened yes of course allan glanced at the office clock high on one wall wed better give him till this evening will you be in your room he asked i nodded i may go for a walk first but later yes okay he raised his flat hands from the desks surface and let them fall back again well see what we can do thank you i said sniffing and handing my grandmother back her handkerchief i nodded to her and we turned to go erin was still standing staring down at the desk by the door i paused dug into my jacket pocket and took out a roll of pound notes bound with a little rubber band i placed the roll on the desk and added two onepence pieces from a trouser pocket erin looked at the money twentyseven pounds two pence i said well done erin said flatly yolanda and i left the room i guess a lawyer wouldnt be appropriate yolanda said as we went downstairs i dont think so grandma well first thing we should do is drive to the hotel or into stirling at any rate and have us some lunch i need a margarita thanks grandma i said stopping to face her as we got to the bottom of the stairs i squeezed her hand but i think id just like to you know be by myself for a bit she looked hurt you want me to go is that it i tried to work out how to say what it was i wanted to say i need to think yolanda i need i breathed in hard gaze flickering over the walls the ceiling and back down the stairs again until i looked at my grandmother again i need to think myself back into the person i am when im here do you know what i mean she nodded i guess so youve done so much for me i told her i hate forget it you sure you dont want me to stick around really no i gave a brave smile you go and see prague go and see your red diamond fuck the diamond and prague will still be there honestly itd be better i wont feel ive disrupted your life totally too i gave a small laugh and looked around with an expression that spoke of an optimism i didnt feel thisll all get sorted out just one of those daft things that comes along in a place like this where everybody lives on top of each other all the time storm in a tea cup storm in a thimble i fashioned what i hoped was a cheeky grin yolanda looked serious you just look out isis she told me putting her hand on my shoulder and lowering her head a little as she fixed her gaze upon me it was a curiously affecting gesture it aint never been all sweetness and light here honey she told me youve always seen the best of it and its only now youre getting the shitty end of the stick but its always been there she patted my shoulder you watch out for salvador old zhobelia once told me she hesitated well i dont rightly know exactly what it was she was trying to hint at to tell the truth but it was something for sure something your grandfather had to hide something she knew about him they were they were married i said falteringly the three of them were married i imagine that they had lots of little secrets between them hmm yolanda said obviously not convinced well i always wondered about her heading off just disappearing like that after the fire seemed kind of suspicious you sure she is alive pretty sure calli and astar seem still to be in touch i cant imagine theyd lie okay well look im just saying there might be more than one hidden agenda here you will take care now wont you i will i swear and you mustnt worry ill be fine you come back in a week or two come back for the festival and ill have everything running back on track again ill sort it out promise there was a deal to get sorted isis even before this like we were talking about in the car today i know i told her hugging her just have faith thats your department honey but ill take your word for it one night in november a fire destroyed half the mansion house it killed my mother alice and father christopher and grandmother aasni and it might have killed me too if my father hadnt thrown me out of the window into the garden fishpond he might have saved himself then too but he went back to look for my mother they were eventually found huddled together in the room i had shared with allan overcome by smoke allan had escaped on his own grandmother aasni died in her kitchen in the house seemingly the victim of her own culinary experimentation the fire engine called from stirling that night could not be taken across the already holed and tumbledown bridge by the woodbeans home the community put out the fire itself mostly with some help later on from a portable pump brought over the bridge by the fire brigade my grandfather had always known that with the number of candles and paraffin lamps we used especially in winter the risk of fire at the farm was high accordingly he had always treated fire prevention with the utmost seriousness had bought an old but serviceable handpowered pump from another farm and ensured that there were lots of buckets of water and sand stationed at various points throughout the farm as well as carrying out regular drills so that everybody knew what to do in the event that a fire did break out fire officers came the next day to survey the gutted wreckage of the mansion house and to attempt to discover how the fire had started they determined that the seat of the fire had been the kitchen stove and that it looked very much as though a pressure cooker had exploded showering the room with burning oil aasni had probably been knocked unconscious in the initial blast zhobelia distraught weeping incoherent hairtearing zhobelia left off her wailing just long enough to confirm that her sister had been trying to develop a new type of pressurecooked pickle whose ingredients included ghee and a variety of other oils i dont remember the fire i dont remember smoke and flames and being thrown from the window into the ornamental fish pond i dont remember my fathers touch or my mothers voice at all i dont remember a funeral or a memorial service all i remember with a strange static photographic clarity is the burnedout shell of the mansion house days or weeks or months later its sootshadowed stones and few remaining roof beams stark black against the cold blue winter skies i think allan felt my parents loss more he was old enough to know that he would never see them again whereas i could not really understand this idea and just kept waiting for them to come back from wherever it was they had gone i suppose the nature of the community itself made the blow less keenly felt than it might have been in benighted society allan and i would have been brought up much the way we were even if our parents had not perished our care upbringing and education spread out amongst the many faithful of the community rather than left solely to one binary nuclear family i believe it dawned on me that my parents werent coming back only as the burnedout mansion house was rebuilt during the following year as though while the buildings shell was still open to the weather and the skies my mother and father could somehow find a way to return but as the roof was rebuilt and the new beams and rafters hoisted into place the roof boards laid and the slates nailed down that possibility was gradually but irrevocably removed as though the wood and planks and nails and metal fittings that went to complete the house were not making a new place for people to live but making instead a huge toolatelymade mausoleum my mysteriously vanished parents ought somehow to inhabit yet were forever excluded from i have a vague contrary recollection of thinking then that my parents were still there somehow hanging around in a sort of ghostly spectral way snagged there caught by all those fresh floorboards and shining nails but even that feeling gradually slipped away over time and the completed refurbished house became just another part of the community i suppose according to the more facile schools of psychology i ought to have resented the mansion house and especially the library which survived undamaged but which for many many years thereafter had about it the lingering odour of smoke but if anything the effect was quite to the contrary and i came to love the library and its books and its old musty smoky scent as though through that faint aroma of the past i soaked up more than just the knowledge contained in the books as i sat there reading and studying and so was still in touch with my parents and our happy past before the fire i think that for my grandfather the loss of his son was probably the worst thing that ever happened to him it was as if there was a god of the sort he did not believe in a cruel capricious closely involved god who did not just speak from some great passionless distance but moved people and events around like pieces in a game a greedy spiteful manipulative handson god who took as much as he gave and provoked or simply to prove his power fell upon the lives and fates of men like an eagle upon a mouse if my grandfathers faith was shaken by his sons death he gave no sign at the time but i know that to this day he still grieves for him and still wakes himself from sleep every few months with nightmares of burning buildings and shouts and screams inside rolling flamelit billows of black smoke things never were quite the same again they are still good and we thrive or i thought we did but they are good in a way that must be quite different from the way they would have been good had alice and chris survived and aasni and zhobelia grown old together with salvador instead three of them died and zhobelia at first withdrew within the community and then withdrew from it my greataunt mourned prodigiously extravagantly epically she tore her hair out by the roots which you hear about people doing but ill bet you never actually saw neither have i but i have seen the evidence and it was not pretty zhobelia stopped eating stopped cooking stopped getting out of bed she blamed herself for the fire she had gone to bed that night instead of staying up with aasni to carry on with their pressurised pickling experiment and anyway felt that the accident would not have happened if she had ensured the pressure cooker had been properly cleaned both she and aasni knew that some of their earlier experiments had blocked the safety valves and caused dangerous pressure buildups in the cooker zhobelia had been more concerned than her sister had appeared over the safety implications of this development and blamed herself for not staying to make sure that aasni did not put herself in danger zhobelia recovered slowly she started to get up and to eat though she never again cooked not even as much as a popadum calli and astar zhobelias daughters moved smoothly and quietly into the gap left by their aunts death and their mothers domestic secession jointly taking over the mistresship of the kitchen and the stewardship of the whit family zhobelia entered a kind of selfimposed exile within her own home having nothing to do with its running and taking little apparent interest in its welfare she existed there but she seemed to have little to say to anybody and nothing that she wanted to do a year to the day after the fire she left high easter offerance without warning we found a note from her saying that she had gone to visit her old family who were now based in glasgow in the hope of effecting a reconciliation we later heard that some form of rapprochement had been arrived at but that zhobelia had been looking for forgiveness and understanding only and not a new home she left there too and well there seems to be some confusion over where she ended up after that astar calli and salvador all seem vaguely sure that she is still alive and being well cared for somewhere but the two sisters become sadly uncommunicative if pressed on the details while grandfather just gets tetchy i think the fire changed my grandfather by all accounts the least important aspect of it was that he took to dressing in white not black but more importantly he seemed to lose some of his energy and enthusiasm for a while im told by those who were around at the time our faith seemed uncertain of its way and a mood of despondency settled over the community morale recovered eventually and grandfather rediscovered some of his drive and vitality but as i say things were never the same again though we have prospered well enough i know the fire changed me my memories begin with that vision of aching empty blueness the smell of dampened smouldering and the sound of my greataunts grief the gift of healing came upon me two years later chapter sixteen i have always had my secret places within and around the policies which form our lands they are part of that private internalised landscape every child imposes upon their surroundings which sometimes survives into adulthood if we stay in the same place and the world does not change too much around us unlike the retreats of many children mine had been havens almost for the sake of it as i had had nothing at the community to wish to escape from unless it was too much loving attention as children both allan and i were pampered by everybody around us children have a pretty good life in the community anyway revered as the product of two souls communing and respected for their unblemished new soul but my brother and i were given a particularly easy ride because of the tragedy of our orphanhood being a leapyearian and the elect of god i suppose i had one increment of indulgence more even than my brother though such was the obvious determination by all around to recompense us for the sadness of our plight through diligent applications of love and the gratification of all but our most outrageous wishes that i doubt allan ever suffered because of my superior rank unless it was the selfinflicted pain we call jealousy i think all this would have applied to any community children who had lost their parents when they were so young but certainly it can have done us no harm that we were grandchildren of the founder and that he transferred so much of his love for his son and his sons wife onto us and took such an interest in our upbringing that any kindness extended to us was almost as good as a tribute paid directly to salvador himself in one way it was actually better as it did not smack of sycophancy all this is not to say that any child may simply ran riot within the community far from it but providing you are not seen as exploiting your privileged position with too ruthless a degree of opportunism and do not directly challenge adult authority it is possible to live so well as a child at high easter offerance that when an adult tells you these are the best years of your life you can almost believe them i sat on the rusted wreck of an old truck its russet body lying perforated and submerged by grasses and weeds surrounded by gently swaying young pine trees a couple of miles west of the farm i was sitting on the old lorrys roof gazing out over the brown glinting back of the gently flowing river on the far bank beyond the weeds and nettles a herd of friesians cropped the green quilt of the field moving slowly across my field of vision from left to right images of unthinking contentment engrossed in their methodical absorption i had seen grandma yolanda back to her car still making reassuring noises and gently refusing her offers of further help she hugged and kissed me and told me that she would be staying in stirling that night to be nearby in case i needed her i assured her i wouldnt and told her to do whatever she had been going to do she insisted this had been her plan all along and that she would drive the few miles into the town check in and then phone to leave the name of the hotel with the woodbeans i had not the heart to refuse her so agreed that this was a good and helpful idea she left with only a few tears i waved her away and then returned to the farm i went up to my room in the farmhouse it is a small room with a single dormer window and sloping ceilings it contained a hammock a small wooden desk and chair one chest of drawers with a paraffin lamp on it and an old wardrobe sitting slightly lopsidedly on the old uneven floorboards in one corner aside from these things there were a few clothes very few as those being sent from bath hadnt turned up yet and one or two small souvenirs of my modest travels that was more or less it how little i had to show for my life looked at from this perspective i thought and yet how rich i had always felt it was all my life all my worth and being were invested in the rest of the community in the people and the lands and the buildings and the continuance of our life here that was what and where you had to look to find the measure of me not at these few paltry personal comforts it was a while thinking about all this before i realised that i hadnt got my kitbag back it had been left over in the mansion house well there was nothing in it i needed immediately i changed into a coarse white cotton shirt with a collar and cuffs that had seen better days and donned my one other jacket an old tweed thing with worn leather elbow patches it had probably been a fishermans when it had been brought back from the charity shop in stirling for me there was a small fishing fly lodged deep in the corner of one pocket i kept the leather trousers on i only possessed the two pairs id taken with me on my journey and they were both with luck still en route from the hotel in bath i restraightened the brim of my travelling hat and hung it up behind the wardrobe door then i went for a walk and ended up sitting on the roof of the old truck a few miles up the river bank i suppose you could label what passed there as meditation but that might be to dignify it over much really i was just letting everything that had happened recently wash through me and from me imagining that the river i gazed at was the stream of events i had been submerged in for the last nine days and it was all now flowing away leaving no more than a thin deposit of memory behind like a skin of river mud i wanted to feel washed clean absolved of whatever i had been accused of before i went back to the farm and my grandfather i could not understand what had happened i had held the tiny zhlonjiz jar in my hand for the first time in the house of gertie fossil i knew i had not stolen it i had read the note that the vial had come wrapped in i could recall exactly the feel of its paper between my fingers see the writing on it enough like salvadors for it certainly not to be in any way suspicious and almost smell it i had thought the unctions inclusion in my kitbag a gesture that was both practical and sweet it had never occurred to me that it might be a trick i tried to think why it had been done and by whom i had to face the fact that there might be poisoned thoughts behind the smiling faces of my fellows in our order i was the privileged one after all brought to my exalted prominence by a simple accident of birth certainly i had the gift of healing to recommend me to my fellow faithfuls favour but that has always seemed extra something that never sat entirely square with our faith in its purest form part of our creed promoted the idea that those born on the th of february became different and better because they were led to realise how much this mattered and symbolised rather than emerged already semidivine from the womb otherwise how does one account for the fact that those born on that date in the past have not been especially gifted or wise in a sense it is just luck that determines who is born a leapyearian even though there is a hint in the orthography that god has a fingertip on the scales if not a hand in the whole business so might not one or even some of my fellows feel aggrieved at my rank and suspicious of my uncanny power convinced in their own minds that they were both more deserving and more pure in theory they ought to feel glad for me support me and if not actually worship me honour and venerate me and accept that god would be unlikely to have let somebody utterly lacking in worth be born into my position or receive my gift but i cannot deceive myself that in such matters theory always carries the day in the depths of the human soul or that our followers are somehow immune from irrationality jealousy and even hate i found it hard even to imagine that my grandfather himself could be behind this perhaps only the memory of that sudden shocking slap to my face made it remotely thinkable could salvador himself feel envious of me it hardly made sense his whole life since his rebirth on the stormscoured harrisian beach that night had led towards the exalted state that first his son christopher and now i occupied and would perhaps pass on to my offspring not that it had to be me a luskentyrian leapyearian is a luskentyrian leapyearian after all but we had made it a direct infamily line so far and such seeming coincidences tend to develop a momentum and a tradition even a theology of their own but who was to say how rational he was being as he came to appreciate the imminence of his own death allan was another man with cause to resent me under a different system all the community and order might fall to him on grandfathers death though how did one take account of brigit and rhea and calli and astar and even uncle mo after all neither of salvadors original two marriages had been sanctioned by the state or established church but what could he stand to gain nothing could alter the fact of my birthdate the event had been observed by half the women of the order or shake what was one of the central tenets of our faith what were we if we did not believe in the interstitial outoftheway nature of blessedness exemplified by that one day in one thousand four hundred and sixtyone allan already controlled much of the daytoday running of the order he had more power than i could imagine wanting for myself and we had never really disagreed over the way we saw the order going when the sad time came that meant my accession to attack me was to attack the order itself and the very faith through which allan drew his influence threatening everything calli astar together or alone they might see me as a threat to their authority but they too stood to lose much more than they could possibly gain erin jess somebody else who somehow felt confident of producing a leapyearian next year and wanted me out of the way or at least compromised beforehand none of these possibilities seemed to make much sense as for how it had been done getting the vial itself would have been easy it normally resided in the unlocked box on the altar in the meeting hall which itself was always open getting it into my kitbag would hardly have been more difficult i recalled packing the bag in my room and leaving it there while i met with my grandfather allan and erin again later i went across the courtyard to brother indras workshop to see how the innertube boat was progressing and then returned to my room to fetch the bag and leave it outside the meeting hall in the mansion house while we all convened again to pray and sing anybody could have slipped up to my room or dropped the vial into my bag while it was outside the meeting room there was no lock on my room door i dont think there is a functioning lock anywhere in the farmhouse and we are anyway simply unused to guarding property or caring much about chattels there is no culture of watchfulness or wariness in our order that would raise suspicions in the first place the last opportunity somebody would have had to put the vial in my bag would have been that morning as i was getting into the innertube boat who had carried my bag from the farm how many people had handled it before it was delivered into my hands i recalled that id found the zhlonjiz vial at the bottom of my kitbag implying that it had been hidden by somebody with plenty of time to place it there rather than having been simply dropped into my bag but the jar had been tiny and jiggled and bounced around as id walked from the coast into edinburgh it would have had plenty of time to work its way down from the top to the bottom of the kitbag id opened the bag twice after id packed it in my room i thought for food and for the vial of river mud so maybe i would have seen the little vial sitting on top of the other things packed in there but again due to its size maybe not i was a very poor investigator i thought i had failed to confront morag and now i was failing to work out when how and why somebody had made it look as if i was a common thief i shook my head at my own dreadful incompetence and rose with creaking trousers if not joints to dust myself down bid farewell to the river and return to whatever it was i had to face at the community i returned to the mansion house at about six in the office allan said that salvador had eaten early and was having a nap hed call me if and when grandfather wanted to see me i went to the farmhouse for the evening meal eaten in the kitchen with various brothers and sisters in an unusual and strained atmosphere which was only relieved by the children being barely less boisterous and loud than normal sister calli who was supervising the kitchen that evening did not speak to me and made a point of not serving me my food astar was kinder if still as quiet as ever just coming up to me and standing by me patting me on the shoulder a few of the younger ones tried to ask me questions but were hushed by calli or calum i went back over to the mansion house i told sister erin i would be in the library and sat in there trying to read passages from the previous edition of the orthography in a restless unsettled manner until i gave up and just sat looking round those thousands of books and wondering how many i had read and how many more i still had to read i picked up the prince and read a few of my favourite passages then i returned to erin and said id be in the meeting room the mansion houses old ballroom where the organ was i sat there at the old organ playing it silently save for the click and clack of my fingers on the keys and my feet on the pedals pulling out stops and sweeping my hands over the keyboard caressing it and pummelling it humming and hissing to myself on occasion but mostly just hearing the music in my head its flowing pulsing power and bodyshaking reverberations existing only between my ears i played until my fingers hurt and then sister jess came to fetch me jess left me in the sitting room of grandfathers quarters while she checked he was quite ready to see me she reappeared from the bedroom closing the door on the dark space behind hes having another bath she said sounding exasperated hes in a funny mood today do you mind waiting no i said jess smiled he said to break out the drinks shall we why not i said smiling sister jess opened the drinks cabinet i declined a whisky having not long since got rid of my hangover from the previous night and settled for a glass of wine sister jess chose the whisky well watered we settled down on a couple of seatboarded but otherwise quite plumply luxurious couches and talked for a while sister jess is a doctor she is slim and has long black hair she wears in a single long plait she is about forty and has been with us for nearly fourteen years her daughter helen is thirteen and salvador may or may not be the childs father i have always got on fairly well with jess though i sometimes wonder to what extent she feels that i usurp some of her powers with my ability to heal i told her of my trip down south she said that at the time shed thought i was mad to travel to edinburgh by innertube but congratulated me on getting there she took a dimmer view of interfering with train signalling systems but let it pass there was no embargo i had been told of regarding the things i had found out in england so while i did swear her to secrecy until we both knew how widely salvador wanted such facts to be disseminated i felt free to tell her about morags alter ego fusillada she blinked rapidly at that point and almost choked on her whisky you saw one of these videos she asked by sheer luck yes she glanced at the closed door to salvadors bedroom hmm i wonder what he feels about that i take it allans told him all this she leaned over towards me with another glance at the door i think he overheard quite a bit from outside the office door she said quietly oh i said lets have another drink she said about time the lamps were lit too we lit the lamps and recharged our glasses how is salvador i asked her has he been keeping all right she laughed quietly strong as an ox she said hes fine been tiring himself out a bit recently and drinking too much whisky but i think thats just all this revising hes doing oh i said hes managing all right with that himself allans been helping him him and erin sometimes oh well thats good its keeping him busy she said glancing at the door again i think hes getting impatient for the festival i suppose everybody is a bit some with better reason than him she said quietly leaning forward and with a conspiratorial grin i did my best to reciprocate the expression but anyway she said sitting back what happened after you were arrested she held her hand up over her mouth giggling i regaled her with the rest of my story settling into the swing of its telling with by now practised ease grandma yolanda was about to make her appearance and jess was still laughing at the thought of me being arrested and being televised in the process when we realised our glasses were empty again jess listened quietly at the bedroom door then tiptoed away with her finger to her lips and whispered singing still in the bath as she made her way to the drinks cabinet thanks i said accepting my refilled glass cheers mud in your eye you have been with yolanda havent you she does rather rub off on you i admitted as we resumed our seats i took up the threads of my story i had almost finished when there was a ringing sound the springhung bell up in one corniced corner of the room went on jangling as jess straightened her plain grey shift and went to the bedroom door i undid the laces on my boots she stuck her head round i heard grandfathers voice then jess turned and nodded to me i drained my glass and ascended into the bedroom the door closed behind me grandfather sat at one end of the room against a huge pile of cushions candles burned on the shelf that ran all around the dark space filling it with their soft yellow light and the heady fumes of their scent josssticks were fanned out in a small brass holder on the shelf near salvador my grandfather was plump pale voluminously robed and his face was surrounded with fluffily dry white curly hair he looked like a cross between buddha and santa claus he sat looking at me i made the sign and bowed slowly to him the bed moved gently underneath my sockclad feet like a gentle oceanic swell salvador nodded briefly when i straightened he pointed to a place close in front of him to his left by his right hand would have been better but probably too much to hope for i sat where he had indicated crosslegged grandfathers roomsize bed was the one place one was allowed to sit without a sitting board the softness was oddly unsettling when ones buttocks were habituated to the hardness of wood he reached under one of the giant cushions at his back and produced a bottle and two chunky cut glasses he handed one glass to me set the other on the shelf near him and poured us both some whisky more drink i thought ah well he raised his glass to me though his expression remained serious we drank the whisky was smooth and i didnt cough he gave a great long sigh and sat back amongst the pillows he looked at his glass and then slowly to me so isis do you want to tell me why he asked his deep luxuriant voice sounded thick half choked grandfather i said i did not take the vial it was in my kitbag i didnt know it was there until i found it when i was at gertie fossils he looked into my eyes for a long time i returned his gaze he shook his head and looked across the room so you had no hand in this at all no idea it had been put there none well then who do you want to accuse isis i dont want to accuse anybody ive thought about who could have done this and it could have been anybody i have no idea who ive been told that you claim there was a note he said pronouncing the last word with the effect of somebody picking something distasteful up by the corner between thumb and forefinger it said in case you need it or something similar i cant remember the exact words it was signed with an s but this has disappeared of course yes werent you even slightly suspicious he asked a sour look on his face didnt it seem odd to you that i might have given you our most precious substance our last link with luskentyre to take into the midst of the unsaved i looked down at my glass i took it as a compliment i said my face felt warm i was surprised and i was flattered but it never crossed my mind to be suspicious i thought that you were giving me your blessing and trying to ensure the success of my mission by giving me something which would both succour me and be of practical value and was it of practical value i mean no you took some i did it i was not able to make use of it i dont know why i hoped to hear more clearly the voice of god but so you then tried one of the unsaveds illegal drugs i did which didnt work either it did not he shook his head and drank the rest of the whisky in his glass he looked at my glass as he reached for the bottle i finished my drink too he refilled both glasses i cleared my throat eyes watering and am i to understand isis that our sister morags fame does not come from holy music or even music in any form after all but from performing the sexual act to be recorded on film and sold to whosoever of the benighted might wish to purchase such a thing it would seem so youre sure quite positive there was one closeup of her face in quite bright sunshine she was sucking yes well well believe you on this for now isis but i dare say we shall have to confirm this for ourselves unpleasant though the task might be that may be possible without having to harbour a television set amongst us one of brother zebs colleagues called boz was sure that he had seen a pornographic magazine which featured morag grandfather was shaking his head sadly i think its worth mentioning i said that while i was unable to discover any evidence that morag still plays music in public it is still not impossible that she does so though oh enough he said angrily well it could still be what difference would it make anyway he said loudly he gulped at his whisky i sipped mine it could still be seen as holy work in a sense grandfather i said certainly it is done for profit and involves the means of the dissemination of lies and clutter but still the act itself is a holy one and oh he said sneering at me over his glass and what would you know about that isis i felt my face colour again but i did not let my gaze fall from his what i know is what you have told me what you have told us all in your teachings i said he looked away teachings change he said his voice rumbling like thunder from those dense clouds of hair i stared at him he was looking into his glass i swallowed they surely cannot change to the extent that we join the benighted in their fear of love i cried no he told me thats not what i meant he sighed then nodded at my glass drink up well find the truth of this yet i drank gulping the whisky down and almost gagging was this some strange new ceremony did we now believe that one could find the truth at the bottom of a bottle what was going on what was he talking about he refilled our glasses again he set the bottle down with a thump on the shelf between two heavy flickering candles isis he said and his voice was suddenly small and almost plaintive his eyes glittered isis is any of this true all of it grandfather i said leaning forward he reached out and took my free hand holding it he shook his head in an angry frustrated way gulped some whisky down and said i dont know isis i dont know there were tears in his eyes im told one thing im told another thing i dont know who to believe whos telling the truth he drank some more i know im old im not young any more but im not confused im made confused you see i hear people say things and i wonder if they can be true and i listen to the voice of god and i wonder sometimes if what they say can be right though i know it must so i wonder is it something in me but i know it cant be after all these years i just know you see do you see child i think so grandfather he squeezed my hand which he still held on the covers good girl good girl he drained his glass shook his head and gave a watery smile you and me isis were the ones arent we you are my grandchild but you are the elect special like me arent you i nodded hesitantly by the grace of god and by your teaching yes i believe so of course you believe in god you believe in the voice he said anxiously urgently squeezing my hand even tighter it was starting to hurt yes i said yes of course you believe in what is said what is heard what i am told with all my heart and soul i assured him trying to flex the hand he gripped then why are you lying to me he roared throwing his glass to one side and throwing himself at me i fell back toppling over as he thumped into me and pushed me down pinning me down by the shoulders my stillcrossed legs pressed up into my chest by his belly i had to put my hand holding the whisky glass out to one side to avoid spilling it while my other hand lay on my chest clutching involuntarily at the neck of my shirt i stared up at my grandfathers furiously livid face im not lying i cried you are child admit you are open your soul let out this poison his body pressed down on mine forcing my knees into my chest he shook me by the shoulders i felt whisky slop out of my glass onto my hand chilling it i felt around trying to find anywhere i could leave the glass without it tipping over and spilling its contents so i could have two hands free but all i could feel was rumpled bedclothes nowhere firm what poison i gasped breathless from the pressure on my chest there is no poison my conscience is clear dont lie to me isis im not lying i shouted again it is all true why persist he roared shaking me again why add to your sin his breath was warm and smelled of whisky i am not there is no sin to add to you took that sacrament you stole it no no why should i because you hate me he yelled i dont i gasped painfully i dont i love you grandfather why are you doing this please get off me he slid off me to one side falling against the bottom of the tumbled slope of pillows and cushions lying on his side next to me staring at me eyes still wet with tears you dont love me he said his voice hoarse you want me dead out of the way you want everything for yourself now i struggled upright onto my knees put the whisky glass on the shelf at last and kneeled by him my hand on his shoulder as he lay there wheezing staring away at the far wall dont love me he mumbled you dont love me grandfather i love you for yourself for all youve done for me the way youve looked after allan and me as though we were your own children but i love you doubly i love you as our faiths founder too i cant imagine ever loving anybody half as much not ever not a quarter as much i lowered my face until it was beside his please you must believe me youre the most important person there will ever be in my life no matter what happens i love you beyond everything he turned his face from me into the bedclothes no he said his voice muffled but steady and calm no i dont believe that is so i have listened to gods voice and they have given me the measure of your love for me it has been beyond everything but it is not now though i think it is beyond you indeed i didnt understand grandfather you are everything to all of us you are our light our guide our overseer we rely on you without you we shall all be orphans but with your teachings with your orthography and your example we shall at least have hope no matter what the future holds i know i can never be you and never equal you i would never even attempt to do so but perhaps as the elect and as your sons daughter i can reflect some part of your glory without disgracing it and with your teachings as my guide eventually grow to be a fit leader of the order that is my he turned his head to look at me eyes bright with tears in the soft yellow candlelight these are fine words isis but you have known an easy life we have kept you away from the harshness of it from sacrifice and doubt and pain i am ready for all of them for my faith his eyes searched mine i doubt it he said giving the smallest shake of his head you say so but i doubt it you only think you have faith i do have faith untested isis mine has been tested yours test mine then i cannot he said god can and would do through me but id risk losing you what i cried pressing closer to him what have they said he looked away again face in the bedclothes do you trust me with my life i said hugging him fiercely he turned to me again do you trust me i do his gaze shifted across my eyes isis he said he seemed to hesitate what i said hugging him will you trust me he whispered i will trust you will you believe me i will believe you he gave a deep deep sigh and rose slowly almost painfully up from the bed covers i helped him up and he nodded in thanks he stood facing the shelf where the whisky bottle sat between the scented candles and the josssticks burned in their brassy holders standing there on that unsteady shifting surface with him my head was filled with the intoxicating warmth of the perfumed room he took a step forward and blew out several candles leaving one burning by the whisky bottle he stepped to one side and blew out more of the candles dimming the room he went along the wall blowing out all but one other candle then started blowing out the candles on the shelf beside the door to the sitting room beyond i turned watching him wondering he blew out all but two candles on the far wall beneath the heavily curtained windows by the door to the bathroom he paused his back to me we must disrobe he said disrobe i asked he nodded disrobe he said and leaning forward blew out another candle i swallowed i could barely think what else was i to do i had said i believed i had said that i trusted i did not know what it might be grandfather had in mind what he had been told to do by god but i knew that it must be holy and blessed and to my shame i thought of it i confess at least i knew that it could not be what the most prurient minds might imagine for that was banned by the orthography of course i said i took off my jacket and placed it folded on the bed at my feet i began to undo my shirt buttons grandfather took a deep breath and blew out another line of candles not looking at me as i took off my shirt and then undid the button and zip on my leather trousers he extinguished a last couple of candles there were only half a dozen left burning round the walls of the whole large room now their frugal light reducing everything so that where there had been soft light there was now shadow and where there had been shadows there was now darkness my mouth was dry as i slid my trousers off and placed them with my shirt and jacket grandfather faced away from me turned towards the huge pile of pillows he crossed his arms reached down to his waist and with a grunt and a slight stagger pulled his robe up over his head underneath he was quite naked i had taken off my socks and now wore only my knickers seen from behind grandfathers body was bulky and solid not as fat and soft as id thought certainly it was an old mans waist bowing out not narrowing but there was a bulllike flatness across the small of his back that i doubted many men his age could boast we must be quite naked he said quietly still facing away from me addressing the wall i felt my heart thud in my chest my hands were shaking as i slipped off my undergarments he looked upwards as if inspecting the rooms ornate plaster frieze the creators ways are many and strange he said as though talking to the shelf we question we think and we question our thinking trying to determine what is right what is true and what is false what is given from above and beyond and what comes from within i saw him shake his head slowly we cannot ever know completely and eventually we have to stop questioning he fell silent he stood for a while then nodded again slowly his shoulders quivered and he put his hands up to his eyes oh isis he said his voice breaking is god always right i have always believed that they are but his head bowed and his shoulders shook i stood and watched for a moment then stepped forward terribly aware of my nakedness and stretched out my arms to put my hands on his shoulders he clamped his hands on mine then turned quickly and faced me pulling me closer until his full belly touched my flat one we are wisps isis he hissed taking me by the shoulders and gripping me tightly we are reeds caught in the storm pulled away by the flood who are we to stand in their way i shook my head hoping that my eyes werent too wide i dont know i said for want of anything better he looked down in between us and nodded vigorously let us sit isis he said we sat i in the lotus position he on his haunches with his arms resting on his knees he looked me up and down and i felt good and fine and pure and brazen at the same time flushed with alcohol and god knows what he shook his head ah isis you are the very vision he breathed i am gods image as are we all in our own fashion i replied my voice shaking no no more than that he said breathlessly still staring at my body what god has said he looked up into my eyes and slowly spread his arms wide isis he said thickly come to me i parted from my lotus position and kneeled forward tentatively extending my arms he took my hands in his and pulled me forward to him enfolding me in his warmth and pushing my arms out above and to the side isis isis he said burying his head between my breasts breathing in hard grandfather i said into the clearing in the thicket of his hair that was his bald patch what has god said isis he said again raising his head to mine and hugging me tighter so that i could feel each fold and roll of fat on his torso as i was pulled into him isis he said rubbing his head from side to side between my breasts we are in their power under their control we must do as they say his hands cupped my buttocks kneading them he raised his head and brought his face up to mine we must join our souls child we must commune together he pushed his mouth towards mine what i yelped bringing my arms up to his shoulders to try and push him away but grandfather i know he cried hoarsely as his head turned this way and that trying to bring our lips together i know it seems wrong but i hear their voice but its forbidden i said straining at his shoulders still trying to push him back he was forcing me over and down now onto the bed beneath we are two generations apart it was forbidden it isnt any more that was a mistake the voice was clear about that he pushed me down so that my back thumped onto the bed i managed to wriggle my legs to one side so that i was half on my side to him he held me tightly round the waist still trying to kiss me dont you see isis this is meant we are the elect the chosen ones the rules are different for us this is holy this is ordained by god but youre my grandfather i cried bringing one hand up to my face to push his seeking probing lips away one of his hands was trying to push down to my belly i held it with my other hand isis we dont have to take any notice of the unsaveds stupid rules were marked out were special we can do what we want and what god decrees what have their stupid rules and regulations got to do with our holy purpose i was still wrestling with his hand as it tried to push down to my groin his bearded face was panting and sweating above me he kissed my lips for a moment but i twisted my head away but i dont want to do this i wailed want he laughed bitterly what has what either of us want got to do with this we do what god tells us to do we both have to submit to their will isis we both have to submit we both have to trust trust and believe you promised to trust you promised to trust and believe remember but not this is your love of god conditional then isis he asked breathlessly still trying to work his sweatslicked hand between my legs his breathing was very quick and urgent now and his face was bright red do you only do what god insists you do when it suits you is that it is it no i spluttered my own breathing becoming difficult as his weight bore down on me but this must be a false signal god would not demand this what an act of love what is that to demand did buddha hesitate to renounce all his worldly goods did mohammed hesitate to take up arms and make war did abraham not take his son to the mountain to kill him because god demanded it would he not have done so if god had not stopped him all they demand here is an act of love isis an act of love to prove we are both true we both must submit he gave a grunt and twisted his hand free of mine it dived between my tightly clenched legs trying to finger my sex i heaved and wriggled out from underneath him rolling away over the bed he grabbed at me catching my ankle as i tried to stand bringing me down on all fours submit isis submit prove your love for god he tried to mount me from behind but i wrestled him off this is not you i shouted and scuttled away grabbing up my clothes as i stood on the beds unsteady surface god could not ask this my grandfather kneeled on the bed his engorged manhood poking up at the underside of his belly like a supporting strut his face set into an expression i had never seen before a look of furious seething loathing that produced a terrible feeling of emptiness and sickness in me you would deny god then isis he said thickly i backed into a closed door it was the one to the bathroom not the exit to the sitting room he was between me and it he spread his arms wide you would deny the sacrament that is the holy joy of souls communion i leaned back against the door and pulled on one leg of my trousers if god wanted this they would have spoken to me as well i said they spoke to me he roared thumping himself on his chest with one fist he lunged at me as i stood on one leg to put my other leg in the trousers id half expected he would and so was ready for him i jumped to one side and escaped him but dropped my jacket and socks onto the bed i hopped across the bed dragging on the trousers and pulling them up my shirt wedged under one armpit i had a clear run at the door to the outside now i stood there breathing hard and looking at him as he stood up by the bathroom door a pale shadow in the flickering candlelight his chest and belly heaved with every breath his penis had gone limp now he wiped his face with one hand you judas he breathed grandfather please i began pulling on my shirt you heathen he rasped a tiny fleck of spittle arcing through the air caught in the candlelight apostate infidel misbeliever you unsaved wretch this is not fair grandfather i said my voice almost breaking i tucked in my shirt tails you are fair he said grimacing loading the word with sarcasm what is fair god does not deal in fairness god commands you have no right to deny them i do not believe i am i said trying not to cry you do not believe me he whispered i believe you have been misled i said biting my lip oh you do do you youre barely more than a child what do you know of gods word enough to know they would not ask this not without telling me as well as you you vain child isis you have sinned against god and against your own faith he shook his head and padded across the bed to where his robe lay while he slipped it on over his head i retrieved my socks knickers and jacket i think we ought to forget this grandfather i said putting on my socks he looked about then picked up the glass he had thrown across the bed he poured himself another whisky i cant forget this he said god cant either i dont know if this can ever be forgiven or forgotten i put on my jacket well i think it would be for the best if we both forgot whats happened here you are a thief and a misbeliever child he said calmly not looking at me but studying his whisky glass critically it is not in my power to forgive you i am not a thief i am not a misbeliever i said and then despite myself started to weep the tears stung my eyes and flowed down my hot flushed cheeks i was furious at myself for behaving so girlishly you are the one in the wrong not me i said angrily speaking through my sobs i have done nothing nothing wrong i am falsely accused and all you can do is try to to have your way with your own granddaughter he gave a single scoffing laugh you are the one who needs forgiveness not me i told him sniffing back my tears and wiping my cheeks with my knickers he waved one hand dismissively still not looking at me you stupid selfish foolish child he said shaking his head get out of my sight when i look on you again it will be to accept your confession and apology i sucked in my breath grandfather i cried despairing what is wrong with you what has changed you why are you being like this isis child if you can accept your guilt and answer it in front of me before the festival you may yet be able to take your proper part in that celebration he said still studying his glass he finished his whisky and then walked across the bed to the bathroom door he opened it golden lamplight spilled from the open door and closed it behind him i stood there for a moment then wept a little more i stuffed the knickers in my pocket and left the room the sitting room beyond was unoccupied one lamp shone on a desk by the drinks cabinet i took my boots and ran out sitting to do up my laces on the top step of the stairs by the light of a wall candle sniffing and blinking i walked down the stairs and out of the silent mansion house chapter seventeen the sky over the courtyard was deep deep blue scattered with the brighter stars and enthroning a nearfull moon the monthly service to mark the full moon would be only a few days away now voices came from the lit windows of the farmhouse and the sound of muffled hammering from the workshop by the forge woodsmoke and cooking smells tugged at my attention comforting and banal i walked across the courtyard cobbles in a daze my steps led to the archway facing the path that led to the river and the bridge i stood beneath the archway with the community around and above and behind me gazing out across the lawn and the curving path that sloped down towards the trees that marked the line of the river moonlight cast a faint shadow of the orchard wall across the path and reflected off the glass of the greenhouse on the other side i looked up at the dark swell of the hills to the south piled against the indigo of the sky like a huge wave i could hear singing and the sound of a guitar coming from behind me and childish laughter far away quickly gone a wind rustled the tops of the trees i walked down the path not sure where i was really going or what i was meaning to do the path was dark under the rustling trees over the river it was a little lighter again and the old bridge looked deceptively solid and whole bowed over the dark waters beyond a sliver of yellow electric light came from a curtained window of the woodbeans little turreted house i made my way to the middle of the bridge and then stepped gingerly across the holed timbers to its downstream edge i stood at the centre there just behind the rusted iron shield that held the indecipherable coat of arms facing east i put up my arms and held onto the rough grittyfeeling surfaces of two girders and watched the river it seemed solid and unmoving in the darkness only the occasional muffled gurgle betraying its slow untroubled current after a while i thought i could make out the faintest of watery shadows on the waters as the moon shone through the bridge in the increasing gloom i could see it only when i looked away and when i tried to see myself in that shadow waving one arm slowly over my head could not an owl hooted in the trees around the driveway and a cars engine sounded in the distance the note faintly rising and falling as it passed unseen on the road a couple of tiny quick shapes flitted under the bridge barely glimpsed and must have been bats oh god i whispered help me i closed my eyes and stood there in the darkness listening with my soul trying to call up the clear calm voice of the creator abandoning myself to the silence so that i might hear them i heard the river like darkness liquefied beneath me as it flowed the owl soft and distant and mysterious a cry of hunting that sounded like longing the susurrus of air shivering the branches twigs and leaves the faraway grumble of engine noise dying on the wind i heard my own heart beat twinpulsed isis isis isis images came snatches of conversation crowding jostling their way to the front of my mind grandfathers body grandfathers voice i shook my head slowly heavily my thoughts were still too noisy drowning out anything else i felt that god was there that they were listening to me but i could not hear them for all that there was quietness and peace around me the slow river the hushing breeze there was a furious torrent and a shrieking gale in my mind and i would hear no word of god until they abated i stepped carefully back to the wooden pathway that zigzagged over the bridges corrupted timbers and walked on to the drive in front of the woodbeans house i looked up at the thin toylike house with its single small coneroofed turret the light i had seen earlier came from the sitting room downstairs i walked up to the door and knocked i still didnt know whether i was going to try to contact grandmother yolanda or not sophi opened the door surrounded by light holding a book her long fawn hair spilling over her shoulders is she said smiling hi i heard you were are you all right i could not speak i tried to but i could not instead i started to cry again soundlessly hopelessly helplessly she pulled me to her across that threshold dropping the book from her hand and taking me in her arms isis isis isis she whispered bonny braw and bigboned sophi is my comfort and has been so for almost four years one day i know she will find the good kind man she yearns for and go off with him to be wifely and have babies we shall be no more after that and i hope that i am wise enough to accept this and make the most of the friendship we do have for as long as we have it i have asked myself if i love sophi and i think the answer is yes though it is genuinely the love of a sister not a lover i have asked her if she loves me and she has said she does with all her heart but it is a big heart i think and there will always be a place for others within it perhaps ill never entirely vanish from that place but i know that my position there will one day be overwhelmed by that good kind man i hope not to be jealous i hope she finds him but i hope she finds him later rather than sooner mr woodbean was out that night i lay in sophis arms on the couch in the sitting room her blouse wet from my tears her long hair curled across her breast her bluejeaned legs entwined with mine sophi has hair the colour of fresh straw her eyes are blue with brown flecks like ocean worlds with islands scattered she stroked my head calmly and slowly the way i imagined a mother would i had sobbed into her shoulder for a while after she had brought me into the sitting room then she had sat me down on the couch and i had pulled myself together enough to tell her about my trip and my adventures that alone had calmed me and we even laughed a few times then id come to the events of this evening and i had broken down once more throwing the story up as if it was sickness spitting and hacking it out between great coughing sobs until all that bile was finally out of me and i could wash it all away with tears oh isis she breathed when i was done are you sure youre all right oh far from it i said sniffing she handed me another tissue from the box shed fetched when shed realised that my tale would involve a lot of blubbing but im unharmed if you mean that he didnt hurt you no i coughed then cleared my throat i dried my eyes with the tissue except i feel like ive been eviscerated like everythings been pulled out of me like theres just a huge space inside me where there used to be i shook my head everything my life my faith my family the community what are you going to do now i dont know part of me wants to go back right now and make my case before all of them another part just wants to run away stay here tonight eh she said raising my face to hers she has a broad tanned face graced with soft brown freckles she pretends to hate is that all right course it is she said hugging me i laid my head on her breast again he said he wouldnt see me again unless it was to confess and apologise but i cant you better not she growled with mock severity squeezing me i dont know what hell say to the others what hell tell them i want to believe hell come to his senses realise that whatever he thought he heard was a false signal that he will repent and ask my forgiveness that oh sophi i dont know i said lifting my head and staring into her eyes could he have put the vial in my bag meaning to lead to this was that his purpose all along i cant believe that but what else is there is there a devil after all and its in him youre the theologian she said dont ask me i think hes just a dirty old man but hes our founder i protested sitting up and taking her hands in mine hes done everything for us revealed so much truth brought us the light i still believe that i still believe in our faith i still believe in him i just cant believe this is really him it is like hes possessed hes old though isis sophi said softly maybe hes frightened of dying what i exclaimed but he will be in glory an adventure awaits him on the other side that will make all this life look a small insipid selfish thing death holds no fear for us even holy people have doubts sophi said squeezing my hand dont you ever wonder if youve got it wrong no i said well yes but only because we are told to think of such things by the orthography we must have faith but not blind faith but such theoretical doubt only strengthens our belief how can salvador himself really doubt what hes created well sophi said crinkling her nose as she looked thoughtful maybe thats it you all have him to turn to but he only has god you know tough at the top and all that buck stops with him sort of thing he has all of us to turn to i said though i saw what she meant anyway holy men are still men perhaps hes just got used to having any of the women in the order he wants but its not like that i protested oh come on isis its not far off it but theres never been any coercion its just natural ours is a faith of love in all its forms were not ashamed of that and he is has been still is i suppose an attractive man charismatic everybody finds him so women have always been attracted to him i mean they still are i said i ran my fingers through my hair lordy he has no need of me forbidden fruit maybe sophi suggested oh i dont know i wailed and fell upon her breast once more clutching at her perfumed warmth morag avoiding me grandfather pursuing me somebody traducing me introducing you she said sounding confused traducing me defaming me the whole thing with the zhlonjiz oh whats happening to my life i said whats going on sophi shrugged and i could feel her shaking her head the telephone rang then out in the hall we listened to it not one of yours then she said after the seventh ring she patted my back better get it might be dad wanting a lift back she went out to the hall hi then a pause hello hello she put her head round the edge of the door looking in at me and grinning the telephone handset to one ear dont know what she said then frowned she shook her head long hair making a sine wave in the air i can hear music sounds like something sort of something scrabbling around clunking she made an odd expression raising her eyebrows turning down the corners of her mouth the tendons on her neck standing out she held the phone out to me and just as she did so i heard something clatter metallically from the handset and a tiny voice shout something sophis expression changed to one of bemusement she held the handset away from her and looked dubiously at it then carefully brought it to her ear i got up from the couch there had been something about the tone and cadence of that voice sophi held the phone away from her ear a little so that i could listen in my cheek against hers dropping the damned thing said a miniaturised mechanised voice it sounded very odd and both thick and slurred i think this is right number are you there sophi put her finger to her lips looking amused ach is the answer machine thing i just there was some more clattering that is the voice deteriorated into mumbling that is right number isnt it yes yes looks famil familia familiar im sorry very very but bit but bit bit worse for wearing you know i am just call to say i have got your message and i am to be there tomorrow is this all right well be there i will i mean you know this now i i am hoping this will silence a muffled curse and another clatter sophi put her hand over the mouthpiece god she whispered he sounds drunk doesnt he hmm i said i was sure i recognised the mans voice we listened in again there was a scuffling sort of noise something redolent of fabric and friction then bounced under the flippink sideboard this time most vexing i i think i go now are you still well i mean oh well anyway tomorrow there was heavy breathing for a moment tomorrow i come for her goodnight then a clunk and nothing sophi and i looked into each others eyes weird eh she said laughing a little nervously i nodded she leaned out into the hall replacing the phone wrong number i suppose she said i bit my lip standing with my back to the edge of the doorway arms crossed sophi put a hand on my shoulder you all right im fine i said but i think i know who that was you do sophi laughed oh should i have said something i dont know i admitted and indeed i didnt i think it was my uncle mo i said to her what the one in bradford the actor well spayedthwaite but yes yes thats the one sophi looked thoughtful so who was he calling who indeed i nodded who did he think he was calling and whos this her hes coming for sophi leaned against the other edge of the doorway also folding her arms and drawing one leg up under her backside we looked at each other for a moment you she said quietly eyebrows flexing me i said wondering chapter eighteen i stayed with sophi that night lying chastely in her generous arms while she breathed slowly and made little shiftings and mutterings in her sleep her father returned about one in the morning she stirred when she heard the door woke and rose padding downstairs i heard their muffled voices and then she returned giggling quietly as she took off her dressinggown drunk as a monkey she whispered slipping back in beside me these golf club meetings she snuggled up to me at least he gets a lift home i stroked her hair as she fitted her chin into the angle of my neck and shoulder she jerked a couple of times apologised once then went quiet again i think she was asleep within the minute i heard mr woodbean come up the stairs and experienced the fluttering trepidation id always felt when id stayed over at sophis frightened that he would burst in and discover us together however innocently as ever his heavy tread creaked on past sophis door and along the landing to his own room and i breathed easily again sophi dreamed beside me her hand clenching around mine her breath hesitating then speeding up a little then dropping back i lay there unable to sleep despite being deathly tired i had been late to bed the previous night had not so much slept then as fallen into an alcoholic stupor and had subsequently undergone all the trials and tribulations that had overtaken me it already seemed like a week must have passed between sitting in the jaguar car as it glided past harrods department store in london and standing on the dark bridge watching the bats fly and hearing the owl call while i listened in vain for the voice of my god still i could not sleep but kept turning over and over in my head all the oddnesses of my recent life morags apparent avoidance of me the zhlonjiz business my grandfathers lecherous attention and now uncle mo calling on the telephone implicated and implicating filthy drunk seemingly thinking he was talking to a telephone answering machine when the woodbeans had never had such a thing and now presumably on his way coming for somebody me what was going on what was happening to my life there had been enough untowardness and nonsense without uncle mo getting involved uncle mohammed is the brother of calli and astar a darkly handsome but prematurely aged earlyforties actor who left the community on his sixteenth birthday to seek fame and fortune in where else london and achieved a degree of fame before i was born when he landed a part in a mancunian television soap opera an unkind metropolitan newspaper critic not remotely as impressed with mos talent as mo was once accused my uncle of putting the ham in mohammed which caused something of a fuss in the moslem community of which mo apostate was now a part and eventually required an apology and retraction mo was written out of the television story almost a decade ago and now exists in spayedthwaite near the northern city of bradford finding acting work very occasionally and rumour has it waiting on tables in an indian restaurant the rest of the time to make ends meet i think my grandfather was more upset by mo making his living on television than by his conversion to another faith but im sure both hurt the record of that first generation of those born into the faith has not been a good one with brigit and mo joining other religions and rhea surrendering maritally to the cult of fundamentalist blandness in basingstoke so much had depended on calli and astar and my father and then he was taken from us by the fire the full burden fell on my stepaunts replacing him in some ways as well as their mother and aunt i think it is fair to say that but for their dedication and sense of purpose our order might have stumbled and fallen i had met uncle mo a few times and thought him a sad creature we do not ban or banish people even if they renounce their faith so he was still welcome to visit us and he has done so for each festival he had a surface presentability and heartiness which proved brittle and easily broken underneath was desolation and loneliness i think he might have rejoined us and even come back to stay in the community but he had too many ties in the north of england by then and would have felt uprooted and alien wherever he went and by whatever algebra of longing and belonging he applied to his situation had decided to remain with his chosen allegiance rather than his original persuasion the last time he had been here had been for the festival of love four years ago when he had told me frankly he was looking for a wife but did not find one id assumed indeed id been quite certain at the time that he was joking when hed asked me if i would marry him wed both laughed then and i am still sure he was only kidding but now he was on his way here was he not i come for her hed said for whom for me morag maybe somebody else more to the point why and at whose behest i held sophi like a drowning man holds a lifebelt so that i squeezed her and made her grunt and mutter she stirred in my arms not quite waking i relaxed content with the tactile reassurance that she was there it seemed i could feel the world spinning around me out of control meaningless mad and dangerous and she was the only thing i had to hold on to the sound of the toilet flushing came from along the landing i tried to turn the noise into a drain for my swirling thoughts consigning my confusions woes and fears to the same watery emptying and so leaving my head empty and ready for the sleep my body craved but then the image struck me as absurd and i found myself shaking my head in the darkness chiding myself for such tortured foolishness i was even able to raise the hint of a smile sleep came for me eventually after many more reviewings of the long involved and fractious day and many more attempts to stop thinking about all the mysteries surrounding me i dreamed of a wide unsteady landscape of shaking bed clothes and pursuit by something i could not see forever just over the quivering horizon but terrifyingly near and threatening i was vaguely aware of disturbance and a warm kiss but when i awoke properly sophi was long gone and i was alone with an already halfaged day of brightness and showers mr w had gone too i used the woodbeans bath and made myself some toast and tea i read the note in sophis hand that grandmother yolanda had left for me the previous day giving me the number for her hotel in stirling and telling me that she had booked a twin room so i was welcome to come and stay shed detailed her flight number and departure time today too i glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece she would be at the airport by now i let a shower pass then walked back to the community under dripping trees i nodded to a few brothers and sisters who nodded back warily it seemed to me i went straight to the office in the mansion house where sister bernadette sat typing slowly at the desk by the door sister isis she said looking confused she stood smiling nervously sister bernadette i said is allan about hes with the founder she said shall i ask him please she turned to go oh i said and do you know where my kitbag is i think allan said ill look sister isis she said and went quickly out the door and across the hall i glanced at the letter she had been typing it looked like a request for money it was addressed to aunt brigit the one in the millennialist cult in idaho there was a pile of similar letters on one side of the typewriter and a long list of names and addresses in an old school exercise book on the other with ticks down to brigits name the list didnt seem to be alphabetical i glanced up and down the list then found cousin morags name just as i heard footsteps out in the hall morags old address in finchley had been scored out as had her old telephone number la manchas full address had been added by hand the footsteps were almost at the door and there was a telephone number no there were three telephone numbers beside the essex address i felt my jaw drop in astonishment i stepped away towards the windows a moment before allan came into the room carrying my kitbag he closed the door behind him placing the kitbag to one side i tried to collect my scattered thoughts isis allan said putting the bag down by the door he had abandoned his suit and was dressed in a robe not dissimilar to salvadors he indicated the seat in front of his desk please he said he sat behind in his swivel seat i stayed where i was between the tall windows a quick shower threw raindrops against the glass i said good afternoon allan i came to find out where i stand ah he said tenting his hands together and looking at them what did grandfather say about last night i asked he he seems to feel that you need to confess allan said with what looked like a pained smile that your soul is muddied by by something youve done he gave a great sigh salvador feels youve betrayed well yourself certainly but also him and i suppose all of us in a way do you see i didnt take the vial i said and if anyone ought to feel betrayed after last night it should be me what allan looked genuinely puzzled his fair handsome face coated with a single layer of puzzlement how do you mean i looked at my boots i cant tell you i told him im sorry thats up to salvador he shook his head well im afraid he just doesnt want to see you until you apologise and admit you did wrong he seems pretty determined about that like a bear with a sore head this morning believe me how are the revisions going he looked startled just for a moment oh he said smoothly shrugging well enough you know hmm i said giving him time to say more if he wanted to apparently he did not i said i hope im not being kicked out or anything oh no allan said shaking his head no i think salvador feels that that a time of reflection and prayer may be called for retreat even you may want to contemplate things here in your room in the library he looked thoughtful for a moment as though just having an idea he raised his eyebrows perhaps a pilgrimage to luskentyre if you wanted to travel perhaps what about cousin morag allan exhaled loudly putting his head to one side another sore point he admitted salvador feels terribly deceived he shook his head i dont know how hell jump there im not sure morag will be welcome here for the festival at all she has made us look foolish but am i to stop looking for her i suppose so you said the trail had gone cold anyway all wed need would be i shrugged a telephone number or something and then i or somebody could well allan said looking regretful we had her number for her flat but he held his open hands out to each side she isnt there any more weve no other contact numbers for her no hmm what about her place in the festival it seemed very important a couple of weeks ago isnt it any more isnt anyone to try to find morag well allan said nodding with that pained expression on his face again perhaps on reflection we overreacted to the situation what its just that he stood up spread his arms wide weve had time to think review he came round from behind the desk i think we all got a bit panicky that day dont you he came up and stood before me smiling he looked fresh and clean and wholesome the situation isnt quite as desperate as we thought back then he told me do you see what i mean i nodded slowly yes i think i do anyway he said gently taking my arm and walking us both towards the door you dont need to worry about all that you should get some some time to think heres your bag sorry about all that yesterday you know how he can be get yourself unpacked and so on give yourself some time to think and if you do need to get any sort of message to him just let me know im well im desperate to help isis really i am he handed me my kitbag then leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek see you soon isis and dont worry he winked at me oh and you can keep the kitbag he said and smiled thanks allan i said and gave a brave smile i went downstairs with the bag over my shoulder thinking my instinct was to sit in my room meditating or immerse myself in an improving book or go for a long walk instead i went round talking to other people forcing myself to ignore the embarrassment both they and i felt knowing that i had fallen into disfavour i started by finding brother indra in his workshop and thanking him for the successful alterations he had carried out on the innertube which had borne me safely to edinburgh indra is a quietly cheerful type shorter than me and slim but muscled with a lot of his mothers appearance in him he seemed a little wary of me at first but once we got talking about my trip to england he lost any reserve and we parted cheerfully i spoke to everybody i could find just trying to remind them that i was who i was not some demonised thief i used my journey as the excuse normally somebody coming back from such an important trip and with so much to tell would have been expected to stand up in front of a meeting of the whole community and tell everybody at once but it seemed i was not to be asked to do so on this occasion it had also not escaped my notice that there had been no ceremonial washing of my feet which was positively insulting i went through my story altering the weight given to each strand and detail according to whom i was talking when i spoke with a frowning calli and wearylooking astar in the farm kitchen i dwelled shamelessly on bland food the encouraging prevalence of asian people and businesses and what people had been wearing in london with my sisters in general when i came to the events of the previous evening i did mention sometimes with a little perhaps regretful smile that grandfather had been a little overaffectionate at one point last night but left it at that dismissing it with a shrug if anybody wanted to know more about the zhlonjiz i answered their questions honestly only dissembling when asked if assuming that i hadnt taken the vial i had any theories on who might have done so in all this and in something of a daze for the full enormity of my predicament had not yet dawned upon me i felt that i was somehow playing the part of the unjustly accused even though that was exactly what i was i wasnt sure why this should be but the impression lingered and was still there when i had finally talked to just about every adult singly or in small informal groups often as they worked in the community i didnt feel bad about this but the feeling wouldnt go away still i felt cheered as the evening approached indeed i was half looking forward to the evening meal when i would be able assuming i was asked the right questions to continue pressing my case i had been hoping that out of all the people i spoke to there would be somebody who would ask me to perform the laying on of hands to cure some ache or other condition that they or a child of theirs was suffering from which they had been waiting on me to return to cure i had never been away from the community for more than a day without this happening but nobody did i suppose it was naive of me to expect anything else but nevertheless i was at first surprised then confused and finally saddened then i heard through sister erin that salvador intended to make one of his rare appearances at the evening meal and would greatly prefer it if i was not there i had no real choice and so agreed to eat later perhaps in my room if salvador got into storytelling mood after the meal proper was finished i decided to visit sophi again and walked in a light shower down to the bridge and across but there was nobody home in the woodbeans house a thought occurred to me and so i walked on up the darkly dripping drive and discovered sister bernadette at the drive entrance sitting on a section of broken wall beside the gates looking out over the semicircle of weedcovered tarmac holding a furled umbrella sister bernadette was wrapped up well but still looked cold she was gazing the other way at the road as i approached sister bernadette i said she jumped up snagging the umbrella in overhead branches oh is i didnt she said sounding flustered she looked up then pulled down on the brolly creating her own tiny but drenching rainstorm as the leaves and branches above dropped their load of moisture on her she hauled again but the entangled brolly was stuck fast and she tore its fabric oh bugger she said then looked horrified oh pardon she blushed pushing a hand through her damp disturbed red hair and then pulling again at the umbrella let me help you with that i said and unhooked the offending implement from the branches she brushed some water off her face and head and nodded to me as she folded the umbrella thank you she said she looked around wet isnt it a bit showery i agreed i looked at the sky seems to be going off now i sat down on the broken wall she looked as though she was going to sit down too for a moment but then didnt she took a deep breath and moved her shoulders as though they were tired staring down at me with a broad false smile are you going for a walk she asked i shrugged just wandering i said and sat back drawing one leg up until i could wedge my boot heel on the rock bernadette looked alarmed oh i see she said and you i asked im waiting for the delivery van which is bringing the fireworks for the festival she said quickly ah i see i rested my back against the stones behind me ill give you a hand oh no she said her voice high with stress but a smile still fixed on her face no no need for that she said and then laughed no the van might be a long time yet id rather do it myself really i would she nodded emphatically her rosy face shining with moisture actually truth be told is im quite enjoying the feeling of being alone gives you time to think gives you time to contemplate things it does oh i said pleasantly would you rather i left ah jesus im pardon me im not saying that isis good i smiled so sister bernadette how have you been anyway what she said glancing wildly at the road as a truck went past heading west and then staring back at me ah sorry i was just asking you how you were ah fine and yourself well i said crossing my arms i was fine too really until yesterday everything seemed to be going well apart from the problem of finding cousin morag ah but im getting ahead of myself i said smiling bernadettes smile became even broader and even shallower than it had been ah she said but you dont want to be bothering yourself telling i got down to edinburgh without any problems i said the innertube worked very well as i was telling brother indra earlier the worst bit of the river journey was probably going down the weir you know the bit where the river becomes tidal i said settling back even more comfortably i took my time bernadette stood looking at me with a smile so broad and stretched you could see right through it to the terror underneath while her wide round eyes moved desperately around like a pair of caged animals seeking escape the sound of a larger vehicle approaching on the road brought an even tauter look to her face and produced a sort of tic in her head as she tried to look at me and watch the road at the same time while her gaze flicked back and forth with impressive speed like somebody desperately trying to signal no with their eyes after a while however i think a degree of resignation crept in a glazed expression settled over sister bernadettes face and i was left with the impression that her brain had stopped talking to her facial muscles perhaps complaining of overwork i had got to the flight north with grandma yolanda when the bus arrived bernadette was so far gone she didnt notice the bus drew away and uncle mo was standing there looking small and dapper a camelhair coat draped over his shoulders and a leather bag in his hand it was only when i waved over to him that bernadette seemed to come to oh look i said theres uncle mo golly what a surprise what she said turning as i rose i started off across the weedy tarmac towards uncle mo bernadette ran after me sisters niece uncle mo said dropping his bag and holding out his arms as we approached you shouldnt have come just to meet me we didnt honest squawked bernadette as i hugged and was hugged by uncle mo he smelled strongly of cologne isis he said beaming he kissed my cheek since i had seen him last he had grown a little pencil moustache and a little chubbier so good to see you hello uncle this is most unexpected ach a whim dear girl to arrive early for the festival ah sister mo said shaking bernadettes hand mary isnt it ah no bernadette uncle mo snapped his fingers bernadette of course he tapped one temple then held out one hand and looked up at the sky what did i call you he asked mary she said there you are meaning to say bernadette it comes out mary there you are so now are you both well how is everybody fine bernadette said as i picked up uncle mos bag bernie looked annoyed as though she should have thought of doing that niece uncle mo laughed holding out both hands to the bag in my hands please i am not yet so old as to be totally incapable let me carry it uncle i said it would be an honour well well if you yes well there you are why indeed not he cleared his throat so isis i hear youve been on your travels yes uncle i saw the fossils in edinburgh and brother zeb in london zeb uncle mo said nodding yes of course i remember why i havent seen zeb since he was this high he held out a hand at waist level and so how is zeb oh hes just shooting up these days uncle i said excellent excellent so we are all well yes everybodys well uncle i told him as we walked towards the little gate though to be honest with you im having a few problems myself just at the moment but im keeping well how are you most hale and hearty thank you isis but what are these problems you talk of we were at the gate well uncle i said holding the gate open for him he stood to one side to motion that bernadette should go first she nodded and walked through i let uncle mo follow then with an expression of innocent surprise on my face said sister bernadette she looked at me i looked back out at the road then back to her what about the delivery van she frowned the she went crimson oh ill she looked back down the drive it can ah i know i said ill accompany uncle mo to the house then if you want ill come back and help you with the delivery ah she shook her head in frustration oh never mind it she said and turned away when she looked back she was smiling desperately again uncle mo and i looked at each other and exchanged that momentary lifting of the eyebrows that is the faces equivalent of a shrug somebody not quite knowing all the details of what was going on might have thought we were acknowledging that of the three of us there were only two halfdecent liars and one total incompetent and perhaps in a way thats just what we were doing lets both go then i said there you are i shall have a beauty on both arms uncle mo said with some satisfaction this is a surprise uncle mo i said emphatically as we walked yes he said yes but there you are the moment has always been my spur i bet that delivery comes later anyway bernadette blurted ill go back and get it later good idea sister quite so there you are and so with our various lies we walked down the drive to the farm i told uncle mo the quick version of my travels and explained about the zhlonjiz i made an exception for him despite the fact he was a man by including the coy line about grandfather becoming a little overaffectionate the previous night he gave a small frown then looked surprised then finally seemed to dismiss it with a slightly puzzled smile as though we obviously had misunderstood each other bernadette looked startled she tripped on the drives pitted surface saving herself with the umbrella which bent i think your umbrella will have seen better days uncle mo said she looked disconsolately at it and nodded uncle mo took a halfbottlesized hip flask from a coat pocket and took a long drink as we approached the community buildings medicine he explained to us he took his bag from my hand as we entered the farm courtyard bernadette seemed to want to head for the mansion house at first but changed her mind i saw her and uncle mo to the door of the kitchen then wished him well youre not coming in he asked on the threshold i could smell cooking and hear a babble of talk turning to a chorus of loud and friendly hellos i lowered my head and smiled sadly ive been asked not to i admitted uncle mo put his hand on my elbow and squeezed you poor child he said looking and sounding most serious not to worry uncle i said i brightened anyway im sure therell be a place free for you have a good meal ill see you later ill see what i can do isis he said projecting quietly thank you i whispered i stepped back then turned and walked away i kept my head down for a few smaller slower than normal steps then brought it proudly up as my stride lengthened and i pulled my shoulders back how much of this little performance uncle mo was able to appreciate i really dont know but i was reasonably pleased with it myself i heard a door close and then the sound of footsteps behind me as i got to the gateway i looked back and saw allan appear from the mansion house and hurry across the courtyard to the farm chapter nineteen so isis it seemed to me that all things being as they are and with your best interests to heart you might wish to come with me to stay in spayedthwaite just for a while what do you think hmm i crossed my legs and clasped my hands we were in the office again allan erin uncle mo and i it was late and the lamps were burning i had been called here from my room by sister bernadette obviously you might want to think about this allan said but if you did want to take up uncle mos offer well you could always return at any time im sure we can stretch to a return ticket he smiled yes i see i said i was only making the pretence of thinking about this id guessed why uncle mo was here conjectured upon what might be suggested thought about what i ought to do and so already knew what i was going to say there is a friend of mine in spayedthwaite who has a theatre uncle mo said really i said a theatre indeed a theatre uncle mo said well it became a cinema later ah mostly it is used for the playing of bingo nowadays well entirely actually uncle mo admitted but then brightened however it has an organ a very splendid one i might say which rises from the beneath of the screen i have heard that you are interested in playing the organ isis i forbore to make any smart remarks about morag and just smiled and said hmm again apparently thinking that he hadnt thrown enough organs into the battle to convince me to accompany him home uncle mo snapped his fingers and hoisted his eyebrows dramatically i have another friend a colleague who also has an organ in his home he said really i asked yes it is freestanding and has two keyboards two good heavens indeed perhaps isis would rather stay here erin suggested patting her bunned hair as though a single filament would have dared stray well said allan reasonably yes she could of course of course he tented his fingers brought his forefingers up to his mouth and tapped them against his lips nodding certainly i had learned to appreciate the finer side of allans phrasing and body language many years before and had rarely if ever heard him say no quite so decisively it suddenly struck me that my brother could probably say hello with a note of finality that is true he said holding out one hand to erin on the other hand he said holding his other hand out flat in balance salvador does seem rather upset with is to the point of not wanting to see her sad to say he said looking at me sympathetically now with him staying in his quarters so much of the time this need not be such a terrible obstacle but obviously when he does want to do something like lead a meeting or come along to break bread with us there is a problem and we have to ask is to stay away and hes aware that we have asked her to stay away and that distresses him by itself similarly he may even feel slightly trapped one might say in his quarters as he doesnt want to leave on the off chance he might bump into is and so that too keeps whats happened at the front of his mind a lot of the time obviously another look at me not a good thing so allan tented his fingers again and studied the ceiling so there does certainly exist an argument that the best thing to do would be for isis to depart briefly and let salvador relax a little maybe get this whole sorry thing sorted out certainly let him think and let us be frank he looked from erin to me and back let us work on him so that perhaps we can well finally get this sorted out he said and coughed as though using the sound as a way of covering up the repetition i see i said and it would be a holiday as well uncle mo put in well of course i said agreeably still erin said sister isis has only just come back from her travels perhaps she is tired she smiled at me not in the least i said well then uncle mo said as though it was therefore all settled i nodded well i can see it might be a good idea to go away for a while but id like to think about it allan nodded good idea sleep on it jolly good uncle mo said erin glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece behind allans desk well its late she said we all agreed it was late and time for bed as we left the room i took another look at the desk by the door where id seen the list of names and addresses earlier but the desk had been tidied and was bare of paper after wed all left the study allan locked the door behind us i lay in my hammock in my room in the farmhouse my mouth dry my hands sweating and my heart thumping i had waited in a state of increasing dread and excitement for what i hoped was about two hours but now i had to act and i felt as nervous as i think ive ever felt in my life god i whispered into the darkness forgive me and help me in what im going to do i still had not heard the voice i knew that god was still there still talking or at least able to talk to me if only i could calm my troubled soul i was not sure there was any point in asking god for help they do not tend to interfere at such a level of events but if it kept them trying to talk to me perhaps i would hear something that might help me over the course of the next hour or so it could do no harm my grandfather once compared the voice of god speaking to a human soul to the reflection of the moon on water if the water is perfectly calm the moon is seen clearly undistorted if the waters of the soul are slightly disturbed the moon will still be visible and recognisable but it will seem to move and shiver and it may not be possible to make out any features upon it if the waters of the soul are in torment tossing stormily about then the moons single bright face will be broken into a million sparkling points of light casting up a meaningless clutter of scattered light which an observer might not even be able to identify as moonlight well the surface of my soul just then was riven and agitated indeed and i should not have been surprised that i could not detect the voice still i felt the loss keenly and one petulant childish part of me interpreted it as just another abandonment i sighed here goes i whispered though not this time really to the creator and got up i dressed used my penknife to cut an inch of candle then pocketed the knife the stub of candle and a box of matches i had a pencil and a sheet of paper in another pocket i put on an old flat cap i hadnt worn since i was about fourteen it was slightly too small for me but that meant it wasnt likely to fall off and it did cover my fair hair quite effectively i put my ear to the door listening but could hear nobody about i left the room and went to the toilet i had meant to using the noise of the flush to cover my footsteps heading further along the corridor but in the event i would have had to have gone anyway so affected by my trepidation had my entire system become i knew from long experience where each and every loose floorboard was along the corridor and could avoid them easily even in the total darkness on the stairs i hugged the sides of the steps and near the bottom to avoid five noisy stairs without the noise created by jumping i slid down the banister rail the farms back door is in the old kitchen now used as a washroom it has the quietest door i closed it gently behind me and was out into the cool night and the smell of freshly moist foliage the southfacing greenhouse to one side the sky was threequarters clouded and the wind smelled damp but the rain held off i kept near the wall as i crept away heading north clockwise round the buildings of the community round the outside of the orchard i climbed over a wall into the formal garden behind the mansion house glanced up at the sky and hid behind a bush the moon came out from behind the clouds for a few moments and let me see the route ahead as the darkness returned i padded along the grass beside the path until i got to the dark bulk of the house the blocks of sandstone which line each window space of the house have little horizontal notches cut into their top and bottom edges creating a channel it is possible to wedge fingers and the welts of boots into i climbed until i could reach the windowledge of the storeroom behind the office then hauled myself up and kneeled on the narrow shelf of stone pulling out my penknife i slid the blade up between the top and bottom parts of the sash and felt it connect with the window catch bless us for our happy indifference to security the bottom section of the window proved reluctant to move the top slid down easily enough however and i stepped over and was inside i pushed the window back up it made a tiny squeak and a faint rumbling noise at the same time but was probably not audible outside the room the storerooms curtains hadnt been drawn but the minuscule amount of light coming from outside wasnt enough to give me any idea of the rooms layout though i knew roughly where the door to the office must be and had the vaguest impression out of the corner of my eye of bulky shadowy shapes i crossed to the door walking backwards slowly my left leg collided with something on my second step i felt down and around and sidled past what felt like a desk i bumped into another couple of obstacles with my calves and hoped my shins were appreciating such thoughtfulness then my bottom connected softly with a shelf which i felt wobble there was a faint rattling sound from above and i grimaced hunching instinctively and putting a hand over my cap waiting for something to fall on my head the rattling subsided i relaxed and felt along to the door which led to the office i didnt imagine it would be locked like the door from the office to the corridor but it did occur to me it might be and then what was i to do i got down on all fours to look under the door and make sure there was no light coming from the office beyond the door was not locked it swung open the office was even darker than the storeroom the curtains drawn over the tall bay windows i closed the storeroom door took out my inch of candle and lit it quickly waving the match out i went over to the desk by the door the drawers were locked i ground my teeth screaming curses inside my head i looked around the desk there was a recessed handle above the top righthand drawer i pulled it out to reveal a shallow plastic tray whose various compartments held pencils pens paperclips and rubber bands in one small compartment there were two keys i offered up a silent prayer of thanks pointless or not each key opened all the drawers on one side of the desk there were various bundles of unused envelopes a box of typing paper and a cardboard folder of carbon paper in one deep drawer there were lots more cardboard folders many of them stuffed with what looked like correspondence and in another drawer there was a promisinglooking bundle of loose papers i set the candle on top of the typewriter case and started going through all the various papers and folders footsteps on the stairs coming down i froze instantly i realised i should have opened one drawer at a time not left them all out and open i started stuffing the folders and papers back into what i hoped were the right drawers in a frenzy of silent desperation feeling my hands shake and my guts clench somebody was at the door i slid the drawers back in as quickly as i dared once again howling imprecations at myself inside my head one drawer stuck momentarily i pulled it back out and slid it back in at a slightly different angle my whole body quivering with fear i heard the sound of a key in the lock i grabbed the candle stub off the top of the typewriter the flame flickered and nearly went out hot wax spilled over my fingers i almost cried out the door handle squeaked i moved in two long strides to the nearest bay window and slipped behind the curtains blowing out the candle as the door creaked open i put out my hand to stop the curtains waving from side to side and realised as i saw light come into the office that id left a small gap between the curtains as id moved between them i stared in horror not daring to close them properly for fear the movement would be seen by whoever was coming to investigate why had they come had i made a noise was there some silent alarm system id never heard about i held on to the curtain the wax cooled and hardened on my fingers while my poor bowels felt they were doing exactly the opposite as if in recompense through the fingerwide gap between the curtains i saw allan come into the room holding a small paraffin lamp he wore the same simple robe he had on earlier and carpet slippers he locked the door behind him and went towards the desk yawning i relaxed a little he didnt seem to be here because hed heard something i carefully let go of the curtain and stepped back so that my face was further away from the lamplight coming through the gap in the curtains i felt the cool glass of the window behind me i could still see allan he felt for the small chain round his neck bringing it out and slipping it over his head then held something small on the end of it and bent to the top drawer of his big desk in front of the fireplace it must have been a key he opened the drawer and brought out something that looked i thought like an electronic calculator or a remote control unit for a television set he yawned again and moved towards the door to the storeroom id made my entrance through then he stopped turned round and looked almost straight at me a frown on his face i thought i was going to faint he sniffed the air the match i thought the match id used to light the candle he could detect its treacherous sulphurous smell ice water seemed to run in my veins allan sniffed the air again glancing down at the fire then the frown disappeared and he shook his head he went into the storeroom closing the door after him i breathed out half delirious with relief and id even thought to close the window in the storeroom too though i hadnt locked it after me i waited wiping sweat off my brow my heart seemed to shake my whole torso it felt like it was trying to escape from my chest i wondered if nineteen was too young to die from a heart attack several minutes passed my heart slowed i picked the solidified wax off my hand and put the bits in my pocket i licked the smarting skin underneath waving my hand about to cool the moistened area then i thought i heard a voice coming from the storeroom allans voice as though he was talking to somebody i hesitated it would be madness to go and listen i could never get back here in time when he returned to the study it was obviously insane and it would be tempting fate i had only just managed to set the desk by the door back in order before allan came into the room id already used up all my luck i ought to stay here keep quiet let allan do whatever he was doing let him leave and then continue with my search i turned and looked away from the room out into the darkness where the courtyard and the farm buildings were invisible in the night of course it would be stupid idiotic to go over to the storeroom door i dont know what made me do just that but i did i left the comparative safety of the curtains and with a clear image in my mind of how the room had looked while illuminated with the glow from allans paraffin lamp stepped smartly across the floor and through the darkness to listen at the door to the storeroom told you shes obsessed i heard allan say then i know i know why have you had any more letters no no she doesnt ah didnt find out no youre all right there well i dont know how but she ah she didnt well she didnt say anything no wouldnt be like her i dont know you did yes so did that old bat yolanda yes she brought her back he was talking on a telephone it took me that long to work it out it was such an unthinkable thing to have a telephone in the community and here right at its heart he had one of those portable wireless telephones that was what he had taken out of the drawer in the desk he was talking to somebody on it the deception of the man and to think i had felt bad felt like a sinner dammit for making a couple of calls from a telephone box in gittering for shame brother i had half a mind to burst in on him and denounce him to his face but luckily that particular rush of blood to the head didnt last very long well not for long allan said i asked uncle mo to come up here looks like weve persuaded her to take a holiday with him so mo had been calling allan my uncle must have dialled the wrong number in his cups having the vague idea that he was ringing the community but getting the woodbeans number not allans so did wireless phones have answering machines too i supposed they must have or could link into one somewhere else perhaps that accounted for the few minutes of silence when allan had first entered the storeroom he had been taking his messages well of course he couldnt be seen with the phone couldnt carry it around and have it ringing while he was amongst us spayedthwaite oop north allan said putting on a funny accent tomorrow with any luck why what were you really flumes well its not spain i suppose but spain hadnt morag been due to go there with mr leopold her agentmanager good grief was he talking to morag then why i abandoned speculation to continue listening oh i see really well everybody should have a hobby they say so we might see you yet for the festival it was a joke i dare say she will too oh getting crazier latest thing was she had a private audience with the old man and offered herself to him tried to get him to screw her can you believe that what i felt my mouth fall open as i stared at the door black in front of my face unable to believe what i was hearing what was i being accused of now attempting to seduce my grandfather when in fact he had practically tried to rape me if i had felt there was ice in my veins a few minutes earlier i could believe it was superheated steam now the treachery of it the calumny the mendacity this was this was evil i know i know allan said well of course nobody else was there morag but i believe grandfather dont you well quite yes i dont no no idea yes me too sorry about the lateness of the hour what no i dont suppose it is really not for you but it is for us well ill say id heard enough i wasnt quite so sure of my route back to the curtains as i had been from them to the door but i got there without bumping into anything i slipped back behind them again and adjusted the gap until it was the same as it had been before the storeroom door opened and allan reappeared with the paraffin lamp and the little portable telephone different centuries in each hand he put the phone back in the drawer of the main desk locked it and apart from one sniff at the air which seemed to satisfy him left the office without further ado i heard the key turn in the lock and listened to his footsteps fade as he climbed the stairs back to his room i stood for a while trembling as though cold so my brother was spreading lies about me to morag i had the distinct impression that they were not the first either and how long had he been able to call her why had i been sent to find her at all why had he made no mention of her apostasy the world seem to tip around me again out of kilter out of joint out of its head i stepped out from the curtains with a strange feeling of numbness i made faces of disbelief into the darkness had i really heard what i had just heard i shook my head here now was no place to stand wondering what was going on i pulled myself together as best i could and relit my candle waving the matchs cloud of smoke away with one hand then returned to the typing desk by the door the piece of paper i was looking for was in a folder in the deepest drawer i noted down the numbers for morag in a kind of insensible daze my mind still reeling with shock at what id heard i almost put the sheet of paper back in its folder straight away and on such a trifle at that moment did the whole fate and future course of our faith potentially hang instead of putting the paper away then i looked at the other names and addresses and saw that there was an entry for greataunt zhobelia whom we had always been told had gone off to find and perhaps effect a reconciliation with her original family and then effectively disappeared greataunt zhobelia whom grandmother yolanda was convinced had once hinted at something something for sure shed said by god i would welcome anything sure in my world just now there was no actual address for zhobelia just a note that said she was care of unc mo i looked at it transfixed now what i half expected to find full addresses and telephone numbers for aunt rhea or even salvadors original family but there were no more surprises i looked through a few other folders and riffled through all the loose papers in case there were any more revelations but i think my courage was running out at that point my hands were shaking i put the desk back as id found it and lifted the candle carefully this time i stopped at allans desk and tried its drawers but they were all locked and i couldnt find a key anywhere i strongly suspected that the only key was the one hanging round his neck my teeth were starting to chatter though i wasnt cold the mantelpiece clock said the time was half past midnight i decided it was time to retreat i considered keeping the candle aflame when i went back through the storeroom but i really did feel i had entirely used up my quota of good fortune for the night and it would be just my luck for there to be a luskentyrian or two wandering around out there in the formal garden or beyond so i blew out the candle i forgot to walk backwards through the storeroom and banged a shin so hard i swear i actually saw lights think it was because i closed my eyes so hard it was that or cry out doubledup limping and rubbing my shin i got to the window muttering quiet but vehement curses under my breath it was only as i was climbing out of the opened window and saw starlight reflected in the pond on the ground below that it occurred to me that this was probably the window i had been thrown out of by my father on the night of the fire sixteen years earlier suddenly realising that i experienced a second of dizziness as i straddled the opened sashwindow and for a moment i was terrified that i was about to totter and fall certainly i was quite far enough above the ground to break my neck if i did the moment passed but my tattered nerves already stretched to their limit could have done without the scare i started to tremble again perhaps because i was shaking so much getting down to the ground proved more difficult than climbing up had been and i hung on my fingertips for a good halfminute desperately trying to fit the welt of my boots into a crack but i made my way down eventually and got back as far as the orchard wall before i came up with an idea i looked down the road towards the river is whats wrong are you sophi said looking out from the hall with an expression of concern on her sweet face she wore pyjamas and a dressinggown im fine i said in a whisper sorry its so late can i come in of course she stood aside dads in bed she said good i kissed her cheek she closed the door and hugged me can i use your phone of course i might not wait up till youre finished though she said smiling i shook my head this will be a proper call voice she looked pretendshocked are you allowed to do that she asked lifting the telephone off its table and pulling it through to the sitting room not really i said but these are desperate times god they must be she pulled the telephones wire under the door and then closed it quieter in here she said putting the phone on the sideboard need a chair no thanks i said pulling from my pocket the sheet of paper id written morags numbers on i explained to sophi what id done is she squealed in delight youre a cat burglar theres worse i said and watched her expression change to horror and then anger when i told her what allan had said to morag that slimy bastard she said her jaw set in a firm line is that who youre going to call morag yes she might hang up on me if she does will you call her back be a sort of character witness certainly ill go make us some tea eh id rather you stayed here she might want somebody to put a good word in for me anyway my pleasure is she sat on the arm of the sofa i dialled the first number and got a voice telling me id got through to la mancha i thought the voice sounded particularly distorted and so narrowly avoided the embarrassment of trying to hold a conversation with an answering machine i left no message after the beeps i dialled the next number hello it was her it was morag i knew that voice i had heard it going yes yes oh yes just a week ago well enough to tell from just that one word i swallowed morag i said gulping please dont put down the phone but its isis there was a pause then coldly what i glanced at sophi for some moral support which arrived in the shape of a wink did allan just phone you another pause whats it to you morag please i think hes been lying to you i just heard him lying to you how what how did you hear well overheard how i took a deep breath then shook my head oh its a long story but the point is i did i heard him say that i had tried to seduce grandfather something like that said the cold distant voice it didnt surprise me not considering what youve been doing to me what what have i done i asked hurt and confused sophi was biting her bottom lip face creased into a frown oh for gods sake isis morag yelled making me jump i jerked the handset away from my ear startled following me stalking me all round the country for a start but i was told to i protested i was on a mission oh yeah i suppose you heard voices no i was told to i was sent on the mission to find you sent by grandfather by the community everybody dont lie isis god this is so pathetic im not lying ask anybody in the community they all came to see me off we had a meeting two meetings subcommittees ive just been talking somebody from the community isis allan well apart from him i mean hes even spoken up for you in the past when all this crazy obsessive stalking stuff started what crazy obsessive stalking stuff i cried what are you talking about i was feeling terribly emotional there was a prickling behind my eyes sophi sitting on the couch in her dressinggown looked concerned and slightly alarmed too for gods sake isis all the letters asking me for what letters isis are you having blackouts or something all the letters youve sent me pledging undying love sending me your knickers asking me for my used knickers for gods sake what i screeched sophi flinched and glanced upwards she put her finger to her lips morag i said you have to look i mean i i like you i always have im that is were friends as as well as cousins but i dont have a crush on you or anything im not obsessive about you please believe me i havent sent any sort of letter for about four years soon after you started sending the open letters to everybody when you got busy with well at the time we thought it was playing the baryton but i suppose it was um actually the ah films really but dont lie isis she began then broke off wait a minute she said what do you mean films i grimaced sophi returned the look as though reflecting my feeling of embarrassment i cleared my throat as ah fusillada you know there was a long pause ah morag i said thinking she had somehow rung off silently you do know about that she said sounding wary yes i said i well its another long story i suppose but allan just told me you hadnt found out she said flatly i caught a sniff of victory thats what im telling you allans a liar i said how many people know about the films well everybody i confessed oh shit look morag i dont think theres anything wrong in what youre doing its your body and you can do what you want with it and the act of love is holy under any circumstances unless there is coercion involved commercial exploitation is irrelevant in that respect and the reaction of unsaved society is largely a result of its deepseated fear of the power of sexuality and the repressed is is yeah right got all that jeez youre sounding like some girl on the game whos just got an open university degree sorry its all right but none of this explains why you were chasing me round the fucking country in the first place i told you i was on a mission for what to talk you back into the fold of the saved and restore your faith in the order eh i repeated what id just said what are you talking about morag i saw the letter you sent what letter the one you wrote two weeks ago where you said you didnt want to be part of the order or take part in the festival the one where you said you had found another faith morag laughed hold on hold on i wrote ages ago saying i wasnt coming to the festival after i started getting the weird letters from you but i havent written in a couple of months as for finding some new faith i know im not the best luskentyrian in the world but im not lapsed or anything i stared at sophi she looked back her expression half trepidatious half hopeful so i said into the telephone somebodys been sending both of us faked forged letters yeah if all this isnt you being a really clever stalker she said but didnt sound serious oops im getting battery low showing here you got any other bombshells you want to drop i dont think so i said but look can i meet you can we talk some more about this wherever you want well i dont know i heard from allan you were going to stay with uncle mo whats that got to do with anything look ill come to essex or london anywhere but im not stalking you for goodness sake well the thing is as you were going to be heading south well the north of england but you know what i mean and as were stalled here with franks ah business dealings ah yes the vat problems i nodded how do you oh never mind i heard her take a breath okay look yes well meet but im going to bring ricky the cute guy you saw at the house with tyson thats right and itll be a public place okay fine by me right well the thing is were going to be in edinburgh tomorrow edinburgh i exclaimed believe it or not why its a long story lets meet at the royal commonwealth pool right royal commonwealth pool i repeated across from me sophi looked surprised afternoon okay morag asked perfect three oclock ill be there shall i bring my costume yes well be at the flumes the whats the flumes i frowned isnt that a thing they send logs down in the canadian northwest originally is yes god you really are out of touch up there arent you and proud of it i said feeling relatively cheerful for the first time in days nothing changes morag sighed oh and look you wont be saying anything to allan in the meantime will you absolutely not right same here see you tomorrow then indeed tomorrow goodbye cuz bye the phone clicked off i put down the handset and grinned at sophi i took her hands in mine and watched with joy as her face gradually lost all traces of worry and doubt and bloomed into a beautiful broad smile expressing what i felt i laughed quietly light at the end of the tunnel i said chapter twenty it is dreams you see isis dreams uncle mo took another drink from his little plastic tumbler nodding to himself as he watched the grass cliffs and sea slide past our window dreams can be terrible things oh yes terrible terrible things i thought they were called nightmares when they were like that i said uncle mo laughed in a watery way and leaned over the table to me patting me on the forearm ah isis bless you child you are so young you see things so simply but that clarity is gone from me this is what life does what dreams do you are not to know how terrible dreams can be i he said tapping himself softly on his waistcoated chest i am not old i am not an old man i am in my middle ages no more but i have lived enough for an old mans memories i could be old for all that matters ah dreams i see i said not seeing at all the train banked round a fast corner tipping us towards the view of redcliffed coastline and fractured rocks washed by a lazy ruffled sea on the pale blue horizon a grey speck was a ship the sky was swathed in quiet layers of pastel cloud we were on the eleven oclock train from edinburgh to london kings cross due to change at york for manchester i was supposed to meet morag at three in edinburgh and right now i was heading south for england getting further and further away from my cousin all the time i had thought seriously about giving uncle mo the slip in waverley station and had worked out a plan to do just that but i had changed my mind i had another plan now the timing was a little tight and there was no guarantee of its success anyway but i judged it worth the effort and the risk dreams uncle mo said unscrewing the top of another miniature bottle of vodka and tipping the bottles contents into his plastic tumbler he added a little soda from a larger bottle shaking his head in time as he shook the miniature forcing the last few drops out of it dreams dreams of ambition dreams of success are terrible my lovely niece because they sometimes come true and that is the most awful of things for a man to suffer oh i said that sort of dream i thought you meant dreams when one is asleep those as well dear child uncle mo said sitting wearily back in his seat we had a fourperson table to ourselves on the eastern side of the train i was on my sitting board of course still wearing the leather trousers which i was growing to like and the jacket that grandma yolanda had bought me uncle mo was dapper in a threepiece suit and flamboyant tie his camelhair coat carefully folded and placed liningoutwards on the luggage rack overhead he did not use a sitting board claiming that he had a medical condition and in any event was a moslem now and had quite enough to worry about what with remembering his prayer mat i had pointed out that muslims were not supposed to drink that is different he had said defensively i was a luskentyrian then an alcoholic then a moslem you see id said id seen but bit my lip on a remark about which of his three faiths he seemed most devout in serving but i shall beat the demon drink he insisted be in no doubt i drink and drink and drink and then he made a sweeping cutting motion with the flat of his hand i stop you will see i said i saw all dreams can destroy a man he said staring with heavy deeply lidded eyes at the calm vistas of sea and shore unreeling beyond our window i was glad id chosen this flank of the train i had not travelled on the line before but i knew from maps and the tales of other travellers that this was the best side for the view just men are destroyed by dreams yes and i say that as a man who is not a chauvinist no i am aware of the equalness of women in most matters and celebrate and sanctify their ability to bring forth life in this much i am in advance of many of my coreligionists i dare to admit though well the west is not the end all of being he leaned over the table again wagging the same finger and staring intently at me what good is equality if it is just the equality of being disrespected just as much as men and violence done violence against i nodded noncommittally you may have a point there i have indeed he looked up as though checking his camelhair coat was still there then he looked back at me what was i saying dreams doing terrible things to men mostly exactly he cried waving his finger in the air because men are the obsessivists isis men are the driven half of our kind they are the dreamers the creatives who have brains in recompensation for not being the creationists with their wombs we are even you might say the slightly mad half of the human races because we are tormented with our visions our ambitions our ideas he slapped the table with his hand i was trying to think where id heard this sort of stuff before recently oh yes grandma yolanda it is men who are afflicted the worst by dreams he told me that is our curse just as women have theirs he looked hurt and touched his forehead with one set of fingers closing his eyes then held out one hand to me i am sorry i did not mean to be indelicate your pardon isis that is quite all right uncle he held up the plastic tumbler with its almostmelted ice and its cargo of liquid perhaps i am drinking a little too much he said smiling through the plastic at me were just enjoying ourselves i said nothing wrong with that it passes the journey i raised my own tumbler which was half full of beer cheers cheers he said swallowing i sipped uncle mo had started drinking at the buffet bar in stirling station after wed been dropped there by the bus i had returned to my own room after my phone call to morag from the woodbeans i had already decided i would be departing for somewhere in the morning and tempted though i was to stay again with sophi i felt it appropriate and fitting to spend a night at last in my own old hammock in my own room in the community after so long away from it it had taken a good hour for my feverish thoughts to subside sufficiently to let me sleep but i awoke at my usual time dressed packed and went down to the kitchen where i informed a blearyeyed uncle mo that i would be coming with him to spayedthwaite the atmosphere in the kitchen became glacial the moment i entered much worse than the day before when i made my announcement to uncle mo in the sudden silence there was a muttered good riddance from somebody at the far end of the table and no voice raised in my support i knew then that all my politicking yesterday had been in vain and the scurrilous lie about the attempted seduction of grandfather had already been disseminated i made to leave but stopped at the door and looked back in at them you have been deceived in this i told them wickedly deceived i was able to keep my voice low the kitchen had probably never held such numbers and such silence at the same time i was unable to keep the sadness and the hurt from my voice with gods help i will prove this to you one day and reclaim your good regard i hesitated unsure what more to say and aware that the longer i stood there the greater became the possibility that somebody perhaps the one who had wished me good riddance would rob me of my chance to say my piece i love all of you i blurted and closed the door and walked quickly away across the courtyard a strange high keening ringing in my ears my fists clenched painfully nails digging into my palms and my teeth clenched together so hard my nose hurt it seemed to work no tears came i ascended to the office to tell allan i was leaving i was given five pounds spending money uncle mo would get my ticket for me i found it surprisingly easy to look allan in the face though i suspect he found me cold and oddly unconcerned at leaving the community again so soon i should perhaps have made a show of regret or even distress but could not bring myself to do so he assured me again that he would be doing all he could to help restore my reputation and my standing in the community while i was away and would both keep in touch and be ready to call me back on the instant that the situation improved and grandfathers humour ameliorated please god that would not be long i just nodded and said i agreed polite restrained dissembling i stood there with an aspect outwardly quite banal but in my heart in my deepest soul it was as though great cold stones slid grinding and grating across each other into some dreadful new configuration like a vast lock fit to secure one continent to another but now undoing freeing its great ladings to the demands of their different influences different courses different velocities and to the catastrophes incumbent upon their now opposed and antagonistic movements within me there was now set in place a cruel desire a will a determination to seek the lode of truth amongst this flinty wilderness of lies and follow its path and its consequences wherever they might lead i would seek to do no more than lay bare the truth to mine the gold from this mountain of leaden falseness but i would expose that vein of truth utterly and without fear favour or qualification and if the result of its revelation meant the destruction of my brothers reputation and his place within our order even if it meant the humbling of my grandfather then i would not shrink from it nor hesitate to pursue this course to the very limit of my abilities no matter what balances my actions shook or what structures my excavations threatened and i decided there and then in the community office in the mansion house at the epicentre of my hoursold astonishment and wrath with that key still hanging round my brothers neck that locked drawer with its treacherous cargo not more than a few feet away i would embark upon my mission sooner rather than later before the trail or the dish grew cold and before the results of these most recent infamies became too set in stone to suffer amendment my brother and i parted with an insincerity only i knew was quite mutual as i left the office i met sister amanda coming downstairs with her and allans child mabon in her arms amanda is a few years older than allan a slim redhaired woman ive always been on good terms with i said hello to her but she just hurried past me averting her head and clutching the oneyearold to her chest as though i was a monster who might rip the infant from her arms and tear it asunder the child looked back at me over her shoulder his big dark eyes full of what looked like dismayed surprise he and his mother disappeared into the office the bus took uncle mo and me into stirling half an hour later brother vitus was sent to see us off he carried our bags and seemed monosyllabic with embarrassment or shame he waved back once perfunctorily as the bus took us away and i was left thinking that the contrast with the last time i had left high easter offerance upon the slow rolling river in that misty dawn with the wellwishes of all the community sounding hushed but resonant in my ears could not have been much greater i might have cried then but there was something cold and stony and sharp in me now that seemed to have frozen all my tears when we got to the station at stirling we had twenty minutes to spare before our connecting service with edinburgh arrived which time uncle mo informed me even allowing a couple of minutes for making our way to the appropriate platform was exactly the decent minimum for drinking a large and comforting vodka and soda at a civilised pace without unseemly gulping towards the end and an undignified gallop along the platform it more or less behoved him so to do therefore and he wondered if i would join him in a fastbreaking drink it being a very early hour in the morning for him all things and current style of life considered i accepted an orange juice and a sandwich uncle mo pronounced the vodka a particularly good one for a public bar and knocked the drink back as if it was water he ordered another one must make hay while the sun shines isis he said as he paid the bar lady grab ones opportunities seize the time he seized the glass and sampled that vodka too it turned out to be equally worthy of note i ate my sandwich quickly but paced my sips of the orange juice so that i finished it a couple of minutes before our train was due uncle mo managed to cram in another vodka and soda before we heard the train arrive and had to quit the bar quickly to run for the train he purchased my ticket on board it was a single i noticed i mentioned this he looked discomfited your brother gave the money he said he will send additional funds for a ticket back later along with some money for your keep i nodded saying nothing there proved to be a trolley service on the train from stirling to edinburgh uncle mo found this out by asking another passenger for a while he sat fretting and turning to look back up the aisle every few moments then he announced he was going in search of the toilet he reappeared a few minutes later with four miniatures of gin a larger bottle of tonic and a small can of orange i bumped into the buffet trolley he explained setting his supplies down on the table and passing the orange juice to me no vodka tsk hmm i said i was already starting to reconsider my plans at waverley having dispatched the four gins with the swift contempt they apparently deserved for not being vodkas uncle mo still did not seem particularly drunk though he was slurring his words slightly on occasion and his turn of phrase tricky and illcambered at the best of times seemed to be tightening there was a halfhour to spare it seemed only natural to repair to the bar uncle mo appeared to have hit a plateau by that time and managed to cruise through the thirty minutes on nothing more than a brace of vodkas obviously not counting the twelve that went into his hip flask straight from the optic on the discovery that there was no offlicence in the station we left the bar i picked up a timetable for the eastcoast line from the information centre and then we boarded the train which was due to take us to york my original plan had involved getting on the train with uncle mo and then saying i was going to the toilet or the buffet car just before the train was due to depart i deliberately stowed my kitbag on the luggage shelf at the end of the carriage near the door and claimed the seat that faced in that direction from uncle mo after he sat in it originally claiming that i got sick if i didnt have my back to the engine all this meant that i could leave my seat collect my bag and get off the train just before it left and not even risk being seen as the departing train went past me however i had been thinking despite the obvious importance of everything else i had had to take on board over the last twelve hours cousin morags allegations and revelations the promise that at long last i might catch up with her allans sacrilegious use of a piece of hightechnical electronic equipment within the community his lies to morag his lies to me his lies to the whole community and the sheer selfish greed for power that these symptoms hinted at not to mention my grandfathers profane misguided weakness and his attempt to seduce me i could not stop thinking about that note on the address list in the desk the note alongside my greataunt zhobelias name care of unc mo i remembered yolandas words something for sure it spoke of the corrupting atmosphere engendered by the deception that had been revealed to me that what had once seemed innocent or at any rate of no great consequence i now found deeply suspicious greataunt zhobelias decision to seek but her original family and her effective disappearance as far as the community was concerned had always seemed odd before but certainly well within the normal parameters of human contrariness people are constantly doing things we find incomprehensible for what they regard as good and obvious reasons and i had never really wondered about zhobelias decision any more than i had about brigit or rhea becoming apostate accepting that people just did do strange even stupid things sometimes but now in the infecting climate of mistrust and apprehension brought about by my discovery of allans mendacity and the realisation that behind the curtain of familial and religious trust and love was hidden the machinery of perfidious malevolence much that i had previously taken blithely on trust now set me thinking what sinister purpose might be concealed therein greataunt zhobelia care of uncle mo i wondered i felt a moment of dizziness just as i had the night before perched on the storeroom window the moment passed as it had just the night before when i had teetered on the fulcrum of that window at the back of the mansion house leaving me in a moment of giddy clarity i made my decision my mouth felt dry and there was a metallic taste in it heart thumping again this was becoming habitual what the heck i would stay on the damn train the timetable said i could get off at newcastle upon tyne and catch a train back to waverley in time to get to the swimming pool for my rendezvous with cousin morag if everything ran to time that was id risk it the train started off an announcement informed us the buffet car was open for the sale of light refreshments soft drinks and alcoholic beverages i think that means the bars open uncle mo i said brightly would you like me to go and get us something what a good idea niece uncle mo said and took out his wallet chapter twenty one dreams uncle mo repeated sadly obviously getting into his stride with this theme dreams can destroy you you see isis really oh yes he said and sounded bitter i had my dreams isis i dreamed of fame and success and being an admirable person a person people would recognise without ever having met me do you see isis he reached across the table and grasped my arm i wanted all this for myself you see i was young and foolish and i had this idea that it would be wonderful to be loved without reason just because people knew oneself from stage or film or the dreaded gogglebox the television but i was too young to see that it is not really you that they love it is your part your role your persona and in that much you are at the mercy of writers he grimaced as though he had just bitten into something sour producers directors editors and the like liars egotists all of them they control the character you play and they can destroy you with a few sentences typed on the typewriter a few lines scribbled on a memo a few words over a coffee break he sat back shaking his head but i was young and foolish then i thought everyone would love me i could not understand that there is so much cynicism and selfishness in the world especially in certain professions of a socalled artistic bending the world is a wicked place isis he said sombrely fixing his watery gaze on me and lifting his plastic tumbler a wicked wicked place he drank deeply i am starting to find that out uncle i said i am finding wickedness and selfishness even in the heart of our it was ever thus niece uncle mo said with a wave of his hand that sour expression on his face again you are the innocent now you have your dreams and i hope they are not the source of bitterness that mine were for me but now is your time and you are finding what we all find no matter where we go thereis much that is good in our faith well your faith but it is still part of the world the wicked wicked world i know more than you know i have been around longer i have kept in touch even though i was not there you see ah so i have heard much perhaps more than if i had stayed in the community he leaned forward chin almost on the table again and tapped his nose i leaned forward too but this time i led with my other arm the one hed been grabbing until now felt bruised and sore i know things isis he told me you do i said in my most breathlessingénue manner and widened my eyes oh yes uncle mo said and sat back again nodding his head he straightened his jacket patting the bulge over where his wallet was oh yes mysteries rumours he appeared to think for a moment things golly not all sweetness and light isis he said finger wagging not all sweetness and light there have been darknesses along the way i nodded looking thoughtful as the train swung briefly away from the coast to enter the town of berwickupontweed it slowed but did not stop as it passed through the station we both watched the view unfold as the train curved out along a long arched stone viaduct across the river revealing the jumbled old town on the steep north bank the later more uniform houses on the flatter south side and the sloping road bridges between the two outlined against the distant sea and clouds our faith has had i said eventually our share of sadness i suppose uncle mo watched the view nodding i refilled his glass with the last of the four miniatures the loss of luskentyre i said my parents death and grandmothers death and one might even say the loss of your mother my greataunt zhobelia who is supposed still to be alive but is lost to us all the same all these thi ah you see uncle mo sat forward taking my arm in his hand again i know things there things i am sworn to secrecy on you are indeed for the good of all he sneered so i am told then i hear what is supposed to have happened he looked as though he had thought the better of saying any more and took a long swallow from his tumbler instead he finished his drink and looked around the bottlestrewn table shall i get us some more refreshments uncle i asked quickly draining my beer well he said i suppose but i am drinking rather quickly today i dont know perhaps i should have a sandwich or something maybe well i said holding up my empty plastic tumbler i think ill go and get another beer anyway so if you oh very well but i must slow down and have a sandwich or something here he said digging inside his jacket for his wallet he felt around inside then had to open out his jacket with his other hand and look within to guide his seeking fingers before finally taking out the wallet and carefully extracting a twentypound note from it here thank you uncle how many would you like oh well i shall slow down but best to stock up in case they run out say he waved his hand weakly and shook his head whatever that will buy and whatever you wish of course right you are i said perkily i tidied the table shoving some of our debris into the little brown paper bag i included my beer can which was still halffull i lifted out the can when i deposited the rest in a litter bin on my way to the buffet car i had kept a little of the change from the last order i kept all the change from this one wolfed down a sandwich at the bar and came back swigging beer from the same can id taken away here we are i said plonking down another rattling brown paper bag onto the table ah there now i see well there we are ah you fine child uncle mo said his hands waving like tendrils towards the bags little folded paper handles allow me i said outside lindisfarne the holy isle slid past beyond undulating meadows and long shallow dunes of golden sand and gently waving grass between the land and the island were empty acres of sandy tidal flats which in places were already inundated by the rising tide a car was risking the crossing on the causeway across the sands waves lapping at the roadway a small castle rose dramatically in the distance on the islands only piece of high ground a smooth linear swell of rounded rock towards the isles southern limit beyond on the land facing the island two huge obelisks rose before the miles of low dunes and visible on the seaward horizon bulked a hazy prominence that if i remembered my maps correctly ought to be bamburgh castle did you get any sandwiches uncle mo asked plaintively as i emptied the bag and poured him a drink oh did you actually want a sandwich im sorry uncle mo shall i i started to rise from my seat again no no he said motioning me to sit down never mind its not necessary he slurred look i got some ice in a separate glass i said putting a couple of lumps into his drink you are a good child he said raising his tumbler and slurping at his drink dribbles ran down his chin oh my goodness i passed him a napkin and he dabbed at his chin he put down the glass spilling a little but did not seem to notice he fixed me with his bleary diluted dilated gaze you are a very good child isis very good not that good i thought to myself and had what i hope was the decency to feel guilty for my mendacity and for my cynical use of uncle mos weakness for the drink i sighed i often think of greataunt zhobelia i said innocently i hardly ever think of my mother and father because i was so young when they died i suppose but i often think of zhobelia even though i cant remember her very clearly isnt that strange uncle mo looked like he was going to cry zhobelia he said sniffing head bowed looking into his drink she is my mother and i love her as a dutiful son should but it must be said she has grown cantankerous with age isis difficult too very difficult and hurtful most hurtful also you wouldnt no but there you are terribly hurtful terribly i think now she likes especially to hurt those who love her most i have tried to do my best for her and been the good steward for her charge he sniffed sonorously and dabbed at his nose with the napkin id given him there is some i dont know i think they were always i think those two knew more than they let on isis i know they did what two uncle zhobelia and aasni my mother and my aunt yes there you are they knew things about things i dont know i would catch things they said to each other when they werent talking in the old countrys language or the island language which they also knew something of you know oh yes indeed i would catch a look or a start of a sentence or phrase and then they would switch into khalmakistani or gaelic or that mixture of those and english they used which nobody else could understand and i would be lost but oh he waved a hand at me i am ramp i am rambling now i know i im sure you think im just an old man but im not isis you know at the last festival when i asked well didnt really but thought of asking well did ask i suppose but not such that that but you he shook his head his eyes full of tears and his lips working in a strange fluidly disconnected way flippink dreams eh isis he said sniffing hard again and looking at me he shook his head looked into his tumbler again and drank i gave him a while to compose himself then i got up and taking my sitting board went round to sit next to him putting an arm round his shoulder and holding his other hand life can seem cruel sometimes uncle mo i said i know this now though you have known it longer you are older and wiser than i am and you have suffered more but you must know in your heart in your soul that god loves you and that they or he your prophets god if you will that god can be your comfort just as your family and friends can comfort you too you do know that dont you uncle mo he put down his drink and turned to me in the seat putting out his arm i leaned forward so that he could put his arm between me and the seat we hugged each other he still smelled of cologne i hadnt realised how slight he was shorter than me and somehow packaged bulked out with his fine clothes to look more substantial than he actually was i was aware of his wallet pressing into my breast and with my left hand could feel what was probably the hardness of a portable telephone in another jacket pocket you are such a good child isis he assured me again such a good good child i patted him on the back quite as though it was he who was the child not i and you are a good uncle i said and i am sure you are a good son as well im sure zhobelia must love you and must love to see you ah he said shaking his head against my shoulder she has little time for me i cannot get to see her as often as i would like anyway isis they keep her up there away from me ha i have to pay my savings youll notice mine my money from my savings and the few parts i get and the restaurant money it is a fine good restaurant isis i dont actually own it you probably guessed that if i ever gave that impression i didnt mean didnt mean deceiving but it is the best in the city a most estimable place where one might lavish oneself and i am the maître de you see isis i am the first public face of the establishment and so most highly important and influential with the minds and hearts of the diners you see we have a most extensive wine list and i was a fine wine waiter a fine wine waiter i tell you as well and still can fill in in the most exemplary manner your mother should be proud of you she is not she calls me a liqueur moslem innocent and sweet on the outside even chocolate coloured but open me up and i am full of alcohol it is her family her other family her other family i said shifting my hand to stroke uncle mos head the asis family she says she wants to be in that home but she was happy in spayedthwaite they persuaded her turned her against me made her say she wanted to be nearer to them and yet i still pay i get some help from them and a little from your people but i pay most i me mr muggins mcmuggins here they talked about responsibility and blood ties and they wanted her near them and they made her say that she wanted the same thing too and so she away went most unfairly it isnt fair isis he squeezed my hand you are a good child you would have been good to your poor mother and father i dont know i should be doing this for your brother really he holds the wallet strings you know that but i dont know that i should be taking you away like this it is so hard to do the right things i try but i dont know you must forgive me isis i am not so strong a man not so strong as i should like to be then who is you are a woman isis you would not understand such strength please understand he put his head down upon my breast and sobbed then and after a moment or two i could feel my shirt getting wet i looked out of the window trees whizzed past the train rocked us the trees parted dramatically like a great green curtain upon a stage revealing a small steep valley with a river curving through beneath a flock of birds burst from somewhere underneath us and turned as one a greyblack cloud of fluttering movement sweeping through the air between the banked walls of the trees the trees rushed back up in a green blur i looked upwards to the creamy layers of cloud where did they take zhobelia uncle mo i asked quietly mo sobbed then sniffed hard so that i felt his whole body shake and vibrate im not supposed oh what does youre not supposed id love to know uncle mo i might be able to help you know slanashire he said wheres that its lanca lanarkshire a horrid little town in lanarkshire he said that was a relief id thought he was going to name somewhere in the hebrides or even back in the subcontinent id so much like to write to her i said softly whats her address oh the what is that word again gloaming indeed there the gloamings the gloamings nursing home wishaw road mauchtie lancashire lanarkshire he said i got him to repeat the towns name too near glasgow he went on just outside well near bloody horrid little place it is oh excuse me dont go miserable write she would love to hear you hear from you she would love to see you perhaps well maybe she seems not to want to see us very much her own son but well who knows who ever knows isis nobody ever knows nobody ever knows nothing at all all dreams just dreams terribledreams he gave a single great ragged sigh and settled closer into me i held him for a while he seemed very small after a while i shifted one of my hands to uncle mos head and gently placed my palm over his hair cupping his head like some delicate goblet i closed my eyes i settled into the steady rhythm of the rushing rocking train letting its hurtling movement become stillness and its shimmering steely racket become silence so that i found in that stillness and that silence a place to prepare myself and gather my powers and await the awakening sensations that were the presentiment of my gift it came eventually tingling in my head and in my hand and i became a conduit a filter a heart an entire system i felt my uncles pain and sadness and broken dreams felt their spare bleak numbing terror felt the choking fullness of his emptiness and felt it all flowing into me circulating through me and being cleaned and neutralised and made good through me and then flowing back out through my hand and into him again as something made wholesome from poison something made positive that had been negative giving him peace giving him hope giving him faith i opened my eyes again and flexed my hand the trees outside the window gave way to farmland then houses i watched the houses for a while uncle mo breathed on easily now and nestled against me like a child the guard announced we would soon be arriving at newcastle upon tyne uncle mo didnt stir i thought for a moment then looked at my hand the hand that i had touched uncle mos thoughts with oh uncle mo i breathed too quiet for him to hear im sorry i did some quick mental arithmetic and a bit of estimating then i looked around to make sure nobody could see and shifted uncle mo a little in my arms then asking god for their forgiveness as i did it and feeling quite wretched and triumphantly predatory in equal measure yet excited as well i took uncle mos wallet from his inside jacket pocket he had eighty pounds i took half then gave him change for twentynine from the funds i already held most of which admittedly uncle mo himself had unwittingly provided i pocketed the notes replaced his wallet and shifted him again pushing him gently away from me so that he rested with his head partly against the side of the seat and partly against the window i thought a little more then reached into his other inside pocket and took his portable telephone he muttered something but seemed otherwise oblivious i scribbled a quick note on a napkin and put it under his tumbler on the table in front of him the note said dear uncle mohammed im sorry by the time you read this i will be on a train to london thank you for all your kindness all will be explained forgive me love isis ps posting phone back i got up as the train was slowing took my travelling hat down from the overhead luggage rack lifted my sitting board and walked up the carriage to collect my kitbag i passed an elderly couple sitting in seats whose reservations labels read from aberdeen to york and pointed uncle mo out to them asking them to wake him before york and make sure he got off they agreed and i thanked them there was a train like ours pulling into newcastle station from the south just as ours arrived from the opposite direction i talked to an official on the platform who told me the other train was a delayed edinburghbound service i sprinted over the footbridge and was back heading north even before the train carrying uncle mo set off again chapter twenty two i arrived back in edinburgh with an hour to spare it was a pleasantly mild day under high patchy overcast i went to the main post office purchased a padded bag and posted uncle mos telephone back to his address in spayedthwaite then i walked to the royal commonwealth pool stopping at a bookshop en route to search a motoring atlas for the town of mauchtie in lanarkshire it was there indeed not far from the town of hamilton i continued on to the pool in the shadow of arthurs seat i took a walk round it and saw what had to be the flumes at the back of the building huge coloured plastic pipes which looked a little like the rubbish chutes one sees on buildings under renovation there were four of these tubes a broad meandering white one with an upper section which was either transparent or opaque two steeper convoluted flumes in yellow and blue and an abrupt black example which looked almost as steep as a rubbish chute i sat on the grass on the slopes of arthurs seat for a while looking out across the buildings and soaking up a little soft cloudfiltered sunlight then presented myself at the ticket office of the pool descended to the changing rooms squeezed carefully into my tired and tight old costume it was once yellow but after years of swimming in the silty old forth it had long since turned oatmeal and after some difficulty stuffing my kitbag into the narrow locker i had been assigned spent the next twenty minutes swimming lengths admiring the sheer size of the place and taking an interest in the flumes the four of which were entered via a tall circular staircase and three of which decanted into their own small pool the fourth flume which appeared to the one with black tubing id seen outside earlier deposited its patrons into a long waterfilled trough judging from the occasional shrieks and the speed with which people were ejected from the black mouth of this last flume i gathered that this one was the most thrilling id been keeping an eye on the exits from the changing rooms and after twenty minutes saw somebody i was reasonably certain was the young man cousin morag had called ricky whom i had met at la mancha a week earlier his trunks were brief and he presented a fine figure of a man he was tanned blond and muscled and i was far from the only female looking at him i imagined a fair few males were sizing him up too most with jealousy he walked halfway along the edge of the pool and stood at the side his feet spread his arms crossed bulkily beneath impressive pectorals there was a frown on his face as he stared round the pool i did the backstroke past him a couple of times but he didnt seem to notice cousin morag appeared five minutes later and drew even more stares she wore a onepiece as i did but there the resemblance ended her costume was glossy black it rode high on the hip and featured sheerlooking black mesh side panels which rose from hiphem to armpit huggingly displaying her narrow waist the swimsuit possessed what was technically a high neck the concealing effect of which was however entirely undone by another deep and wide seethrough panel which exhibited the swelling tops of her considerable breasts she joined the young man at the side of the pool gods amongst mortals they both looked out over the swimmers and those walking or sitting around the side morag glanced up at the flumes she wore her long chestnut hair gathered up into a bun held with a black band i raised my hand and waved as her gaze swept past me she waved back an uncertain smile on her face i turned onto my front and swam over to them reckoning that if she still believed herself to be in some way threatened by me morag would feel less so if i was in the water and beneath her and the young man i pulled in at the side morag squatted the young man remained standing looking down frowning hello i said nodding and smiling at both of them hi is youve met ricky havent you yes hello again i said cheerily hows tyson he scowled and appeared to think all right he said eventually good im sorry if my friends and i alarmed you back at la mancha wasnt alarmed ricky said indignantly i should have said annoyed i said apologetically sorry if we annoyed you all right ricky said apparently appeased so hows things cuz morag asked with a small smile oh pretty traumatic i said smiling bravely but im surviving good she said standing she nodded across the pool to where the circular stairs led to the flumes entrance shall we flume she asked why not i said morag dived gracefully overhead entering the water behind me with a dainty splash ricky launched himself a moment later creating a disturbance hardly any greater i kicked away from the side and splashed inelegantly after their sleek shapes flumes are like life see cousin morag said as we neared the end of the queue on the spiral steps and approached the platform which supported the entrances to the four flumes an attendant in white shorts and tshirt was supervising the people mostly children already damp who were queuing for the fun like life i said shuffling forward and talking round rickys bulk he had insisted on standing between morag and me seemingly not yet content that i wasnt in fact a stalker with murderous intent though quite where he thought i could have secreted a weapon i couldnt really see perhaps he suspected i was going to upend morag over the side of the spiral railings and send her hurtling to the tiles below yes morag said round rickys impressive biceps as she came to the front of the queue you can take the short fast fun route like the black chute here or the long slow leisurely route like the white one or something in between know what i mean sort of i said morag got the nod and padded over to the mouth of the black tube watched all the way by every pair of eyes within range she lifted herself athletically into the gaping mouth of the black hole lights above the tunnel mouth changed from red to green she pushed herself away and down disappearing with a joyous whoop ricky turned to me grinning she always does that he said then he strode across the moist tiles to follow her hurtling silently down into the blackness a little later i thought it would seem churlish not to take the same route i settled myself in the mouth of the drop grabbing the chrome handles at the side of the flume entrance when the red light went off i let myself go terror it only lasted about three seconds but for those moments i felt scared witless air rushed around me one shoulder burned with friction water rushed up my nose i was twisted this way and that and then hurtled from near vertical to perfect horizontality in a single bodyjarring thud and blasted into the waterfilled trough id observed earlier i skidded to a stop near the end of the trough coughing and spluttering and with a chlorineburned nose my swimming costume had tried to insert itself into my womanhood i also suspected i now knew what receiving an enema felt like i waved my arms around redfaced and coughing morag and ricky pulled me out laughing i thanked them stood stooped spat out a little water and pulled my swimsuit into a more modest configuration wow i said beaming at them again said morag again i cried in most flumes just sit up to go slower morag said explaining how to apply the brakes though that wouldnt really work in something like the black run here she giggled also you can put out your arms or theres a way of lying down but arching your back so you get a vacuum between your back and the flume floor but going slower isnt the point is it she shook her head at me if you want to go faster you cross your ankles and put your hands round the back of your neck forcing down your shoulder blades that way youve got one heel and both shoulders in contact minimum friction theres more to it than that naturally for really fast runs you have to throw yourself into the curves know what i mean flex into the right shape try to minimise collisions youve got to think yourself down it thats how to score really low times you carry a stop watch i asked as we moved spasmodically up the spiral steps not allowed any jewellery morag said displaying elegantly naked wrists in front of me ricky was ahead of us content that i was not such a bad egg after all a lot of fast flumes have a button you hit as you set off you go through a beam or something at the bottom and your times displayed on a clock at the exit pool really good fun it is oh i watched over the edge of the railings as somebody exited into the splash pool beneath us do you do a lot of this sort of thing i asked her oh god yes ive been to all the major flumes in england the costa del sol and the balearics we were due to go off to the canaries last week ive heard there are some good ones there but then this thing with franks vat came up hmm i said i take it allan knew you were supposed to be going on holiday yeah he knew of course and if all had gone according to plan id have got to london finally found out that morag was away on holiday and if i hadnt decided to wait on my own initiative would doubtless have received instructions to do so from high easter offerance when i reported back by phonecode how long were you going for i asked a month morag said but then frank had to talk to the customs and excise guys and i thought well ill do the scottish flumes then except i was a bit worried about you i was going to give stirling a miss reckoned they were a bit too close to home for comfort so theres lots of places with flumes then god yeah hundreds i mean these ones here are all right but you should see some of the big ones they got abroad the big outdoor ones fuckin brilliant they are right goin for the black hole again right ricky said getting to the front of the queue right lover morag said holding him by one shoulder and then patting his behind when his turn came so rickys your boyfriend i asked her yeah she smiled broadly hunk or what eh oh a hunk i agreed how does he feel about you you know in the films she put her head back and laughed is he jealous na i think hes proud and he likes watching anyway besides she lowered her head to mine and dropped her voice dont tell him right but sometimes right doing the porn i just pretend im faking it she giggled winking at me i looked at her frowning you mean you fake faking an orgasm i said confused yeah she said nudging me dont want to hurt his feelings do i she glanced round see you at the bottom terror again but this time i kept my legs crossed and hence avoided any orificial invasions i was starting to appreciate how for morag fluming might present a refreshing contrast with her day job how did you become a porn star i was giving a concert the baryton yeah of course i was doing all right with that too though it wasnt like you could get many people to come along very small scale and select it was but i was on the tube train going there kind of dolled up i suppose when this guy came up and gave me his card and asked would i like to have some photos taken for a magazine and i said what sort of magazine and he said a mens magazine but one of the class ones like well i wasnt bothered one way or the other but then he mentioned the money and i said well id have to think about it thought about it called him next day said okay went to this stately home a week later where they were doing the shoot took off me togs the photographer recommended frank as a manager and he got me into the films simple as that really i know i should have said something written or something but the communal letters kept telling me how proud everybody was of me playing the baryton and i felt id be letting people down and i mean after all i had started off doing what id said id do and i still do the occasional concert every few months like and so i reckoned it was sort of all right and maybe even kind of ordained anyway because if it hadnt been for the baryton and me going to that concert and meeting the guy on the tube train then i wouldnt have got into porn in the first place would i hmm i said obviously formulating elaborate justifications for deceit was not an area in which i held a monopoly do you enjoy it i asked frowning what the porn yes she looked thoughtful you know what she said nodding at me i love it she shrugged i like lots of sex i like being admired and i like the money sure beats working for a living she laughed ill give it another few years then i think i might open my own chain of exotic lingerie shops she looked thoughtful her gaze directed far away or go into flume design or something she shrugged again and went on filing her fingernails i mean its kind of technical and cluttered right enough but its very pure really we sat wethaired in the cafe watching the pool and the swimmers i am sure i looked bedraggled morag looked like some fresh glowing bluejeaned mermaid ricky was at the counter queuing to fetch us our drinks we had each tried the other three flumes though morag and ricky both kept going back to the black hole i didnt preferring the two convoluted medium tubes because they gave you time to appreciate the ride rather than just be terrified by it i even liked the broad shallow white tunnel the slowest of the lot which morag and ricky tried because they felt they had to for completeness sake but declared was really there for wimps and sportive oldage pensioners but which had the additional attraction of having a view for the first halftransparent section and a damn fine view at that of salisbury crags and arthurs seat rearing up all green and brown against the blues and whites of the sky after a couple of hours of intense fluming producing raw heels shoulders and other pointy bits we did a few lengths of the pool for exercise and then decided to call it a day once wed changed wed headed for the café morag put away her nail file in her little shoulder bag and sat back in her seat stretching with lithe magnificence her hands at the back of her neck pulling her damp hair away from her blouse lifting her arms like that had a dramatic effect on her bosoms the effect it had on those present however seemed to obey a sort of inverted inverse square law she gave no sign whatsoever of noticing i wasnt about to either but men sitting at nearby tables stole furtive glances males further away looked on with appreciative directness and those surrounded by toddlers and damp towels twenty yards off across the cafe floor suddenly sat up straight and adjusted the position of their little plastic seats for a better view i gave a small laugh leaning over the table so cousin do i take it youve absolved me of being a stalker or an obsessive or whatever it was you thought i was yeah she said looking a little bashful well im sorry about that but it wasnt my fault right no i know i said i think i know whos to blame ricky returned from the counter with a tray i had a little pot of tea morag a black coffee and a mineral water and ricky a cola and a cheeseburger so what do you thinks going on then morag asked me in a businesslike manner at the community i asked she nodded im not certain i admitted but i think allan wants to take over she frowned but hes not a leapyearian how can he hes the one helping grandfather with the revisions at the moment that might even be the whole reason for getting me out of the way in the first place i cant see how he can remove leapyearianism from the faith entirely and leave anything worth believing in but he might be able to persuade salvador that a real leapyearian is male and so i dont count or that there should be a division between the elect of god whod be just a a sort of figurehead and the executive id suppose youd call it whoever actually runs the order and the community theyd hold the reins i looked over at ricky who was staring at me over his cheeseburger his jaws wrestling with the food morag saw me looking and glanced at him too its all right rick she said just god talk he nodded mollified and redirected his concentration back to the cheeseburger maybe its just me i said shrugging maybe he feels ive wronged him somehow and he wants to destroy me personally i shook my head no no i think hes doing it for himself and for mabon his son maybe hes frightened of you i opened my mouth to protest that this could not be the case but then thought of allans face and the expression i had seen on it too many times to count the first time on the day i brought life back into the fox lying dead in the field by the road i closed my mouth again and just looked down shrugging or what about salvador morag asked sure it isnt the old man behind it all not sure but fairly so i think he just took advantage of the situation i laughed bitterly to try to take advantage of me old bastard morag said ricky looked up again please morag i said he is still the founder still my grandfather its just the man and the drink maybe got the better of the prophet in him thats crap cuz morag said he gave us everything morag i told her our whole way of life ill not deny the treasure he found just because the hand that opened the chest was human and soiled very poetic morag told me but youre too bleedin generous thats your problem it was probably the least perspicacious statement she had made that afternoon well i said i dont intend to be very generous with allan once i have my case ready to present before the order good she said with relish will you help me i asked her how she looked neutral ricky looked suspicious come to the community back up my story i mean simply tell the truth about these letters and allans phone calls and what hes told you how hes lied will you think theyll listen to me she sounded doubtful i think so we mustnt let allan suspect anything or hell attempt to discredit you with everybody else beforehand as he has me but if we say nothing about us having met we should be able to surprise him if we had it all out in front of a meeting everyone attends a full service there should be no opportunity for him to poison peoples minds with rumours and lies we ought to be able to denounce him without retort but what about the porn morag asked warily well it is hardly the most blessed of professions certainly but it was your apparent apostasy that alarmed us most and i think there would be more rejoicing over your return to the fold than resentment due to the fact that your fame derives from an artistic area other than music were you to return i said with only a little more conviction than i felt salvador is upset apparently at the deception more than the true nature of your career i suspect but i think hell come round i smiled youll charm him i can try morag said with a smile that would have charmed blood from a stone it might be best i said thinking it through as i sat there if you and i didnt turn up together at around the same time certainly but not obviously together well maybe all right whatever its a deal but when she asked i nodded still thinking the next big service would be on sunday evening for the full moon that was only two days away and so probably too soon but you never knew lets keep in touch but it might be as early as day after tomorrow morag sat back looking thoughtful were here tonight she said glancing at ricky who had finished his cheeseburger and was now picking little bits of melted cheese and blobs of pickle off the surface of the tray he looked up guiltily leven and dundee tomorrow morag continued we were going to go to aberdeen next but we could make it perth instead and do stirling as well now ill give you the hotel numbers where well be staying howd that be i thought fine it might take a few more days though whatever morag said nodding and looking determined what have you got to do next it crossed my mind to lie shame upon me but it also occurred to me that there comes a point in such a campaign when you just have to trust and let it be known that you trust im going to visit greataunt zhobelia i said morags eyes widened you are i thought shed disappeared me too uncle mo held the key did he now and hows he i looked at the wall clock hungover probably chapter twenty three if you travel the same route as everybody else all you will see is what they have already seen this has expressed our faiths attitude to travel and interstitiality for many years and so it was with some regret that i reviewed the course of my recent journeys as i sat on the train from edinburgh to glasgow the evening after i had met morag and ricky it had long seemed to me that the best way one of our faith might travel from edinburgh to glasgow or vice versa would be to walk the route of the old forth and clyde canal and i had travelled that route a few times in my mind and on maps while i sat in the community library yet here i was taking a train from east to west just like any normal bland my only and rather pitiable concession to the principle of indirectness had been to take the slow rather than the express line from one city to another the fast route takes a trajectory via falkirk the stopping service bellies south through shotts i would change at bellshill for the hamilton loop so in a way this route was frustratingly more not less direct however it was slower than heading straight for glasgow and changing there which alleviated the mundanity somewhat morag and ricky had invited me to stay for dinner with them they would be eating at an indian restaurant that evening id been sorely tempted but id thought it best to head straight for mauchtie in the hope of obtaining an audience with greataunt zhobelia that evening morag and i had parted with a hug at waverley station ricky had shaken my hand grudgingly but gently morag had asked me if i needed any money id thought about it i had determined early on in the community office that monday almost a fortnight ago in fact that twentynine pounds was a blessed and significant amount to carry but that had been before id realised i was up against a brother prepared to use something as underhand and outrageous to our principles as a portable telephone in the heart of the community and i had certainly never been under any illusions about the importance of adequate finance in this cruelly acquisitive society i said id be grateful for a loan of twentynine pounds morag laughed but coughed up the train ride through the sunrubbed landscape of assorted fields small towns industrial ruins faraway woods and still more distant hills was the first chance id had to concentrate on all that had happened over the last couple of days before i had still felt shocked or i had been with people or on the train journey back from newcastle i had been rehearsing what i would say to morag trying to plan out the conversation we might have especially if she had returned to her former scepticism and distrust i still had a similar interview with my greataunt ahead but its parameters were so vague that there was little to hang a serious obsessive fugue on so i could stop and think at last i reviewed my actions so far to date i had stolen lied deceived dissembled and burgled i had used the weakness of a relative to winkle information out of him i had scarcely talked to my god for two weeks and i had used the works of the unsaved almost as they did themselves telephoning travelling by car and bus and train and plane entering retail premises and spending an entire evening enjoying a large proportion of all the exorbitantly hedonistic delights one of the worlds largest cities could provide though admittedly this last sin had been while in the company of a forceful and determinedly sensualistic relative from an alien culture where the pursuit of fun profit and selffulfilment was regarded practically as a commandment beyond all that i had made an adamantinely pitiless commitment to myself again standing in that office in the mansion house that i would use whatever truth i could discover like a hammer to lay waste all those about me who were vulnerable to its momentous weight without knowing what fragility might exist even in those i loved what a pretty alteration had taken place in me i thought i shook my head as i looked out across that motley landscape i wondered for the first time oddly enough whether i really could go back to my old life i had stood in my little room in the farmhouse just two days ago thinking that my life was represented not by my possessions but rather entirely defined by my relationship with the people of the community and the order and with the farm and the lands around us but now i had been exiled from all that not as successfully in terms of distance as my brother had intended but determinedly and with a continuance of illwished intent that i did not doubt and i wondered that i did not feel more abandoned and ostracised even excommunicated than i did certainly i had my gift but its uncanny and now spurned ability to cure others hardly constituted much of a comfort by itself rather it provided another criterion by which i might be judged different set apart perhaps it was that i did not intend to stay cast out for very long and that i nursed a fierce but perversely comforting determination to return gloriously wielding the fiery sword of truth with which to smite those who had wronged me perhaps it was simply that my upbringing had forged in me a strength and independence that while undeniably in part a result of all the support and affection i had received from my family faith and surroundings now possessed an autonomy from all of them just as the tender sapling shielded from the winds harsh blast by the encircling forest grows gradually to adulthood and is later found should those sheltering trees be felled no longer to need their help capable of standing alone secure in its own vigour and fortitude and itself capable in turn of providing protection for others should that time come so i mused at any rate as the train puttered through little stations rumbled between the green walls of cuttings and threw its shadow down the northern faces of embankments to the roads fields forests and hills beyond taking me closer i hoped to my greataunt zhobelia my plans for the evening were to see zhobelia and then either sleep rough near the village or perhaps find a bed and breakfast it had occurred to me that if there was time to catch a train back i might repair to glasgow and look up brother topee who was a university student there but i was not sure about this topee is a friend as well as a relation his mother is sister erin his father salvador and i could probably rely on his discretion regarding the fact that i had turned up on his doorstep rather than going with mo to spayedthwaite or heading to london as id intimated in my note to my uncle however i wasnt sure it would be right to implicate topee in my deception unless i had to especially as his mother seemed to be allans lieutenant the train was warm i closed my eyes trying to recall the exact layout of the map i had seen in the bookshop in edinburgh so that id know which way to walk out of hamilton i fell asleep but woke before bellshill and was able to change trains after a halfhours wait i followed road signs from hamilton to mauchtie and arrived there before nine on a fine clear blue evening the gloamings nursing home was a substantial old building of red sandstone which had been inelegantly extended to either side with square ugly wings covered with roughcast the house stood a little way out of the drab main village in a garden of grass and sycamore a lane between the gloamings and a similar unextended house led to farmland on the low ridge beyond an electricity substation lay on the other side of the home pylons humming over the flank of the hill the gloamings looked out over more fields on the other side of the road i took the ramp that led to the front door rather than the steps yes said the harassed young woman who came to the door she wore a blue overall like a real nurse and had wildly frizzy black hair large round red glasses and a distracted appearance good day i said tipping my hat im here to see ms zhobelia whit née asis zhobelia the girl said her face screwing into an exasperated expression thats right may i come in no im sorry dear she said ye canny she had a high nasal voice her glasses went up and down with each word she glanced at her watch its past time so it is i gave her my most tolerantly condescending smile i dont think you understand young lady it is very important i said allow me to introduce myself i am the blessed gaiamarie isis saraswati minerva mirza whit of luskentyre elect of god iii she looked blank i continued i believe i am expected our lawyers did send a letter to

this evening i regret to say that if i have to i am instructed to authorise an interdict to be issued which would require that you give me access to her but obviously the proprietors of this establishment and indeed i would rather avoid such legal action if it can be avoided aw wait a minute the lass said looking so tired and hurt that i felt a pang of guilt at subjecting her to this nonsense look ahm no allowed tae let ye in hen its as simple as that its more than ma job ye know what ah mean theyre dead strict wi the staff here so they are all the more reason to let me there was pale movement in the dark hall behind the girl is that my johnny said a weak and faltering old voice and an ancient face like translucent parchment stretched over bleached bone peered round the girls shoulder i could smell antiseptic naw its naw miss carlisle the girl shouted get back tae yer seat is that my johnny the old lady asked again her thin white hands up near her face fluttering like two weak chained birds naw its no your johnny miss carlisle the girl shouted again in that flat even raising of the voice that indicates one is talking not in anger or for emphasis but to somebody who is deaf now you away back tae yer seat ahll be through to put you to your bed soon all right the girl turned miss carlisle around gently with one hand and carefully blocked her from the doorway half closing the door look the girl said to me ahm awfy sorry hen but ah canny let ye in ah just canny ahve got ma hands full here as it is ye know are you sure its not my johnny dear said the faint shaky voice from the hallway well i said im just going to stay here until you do let me in but ah just canny honest ah just canny ahm sorry there was a crash from the background and the lass glanced behind her ahve got tae go now ahve just got tae sorry look youre risking civil proceed i began but the door closed and i heard a lock snick i could just make out the muffled words from behind the door naw miss carlisle its no i decided to wait i would try again later and see if sheer persistence paid off i wondered if this girl was the night shift or if she would be replaced i put down my kitbag on the step and sat on it i fished out my copy of the orthography and read a few passages by the slowly fading light from the still clear sky i couldnt settle though and after a while got up and walked round the house there was a locked gate to one side but a clear passageway on the other tall wheeled rubbish bins in grey and yellow were lined against the roughcast wall beneath a black metal fire escape the back garden was full of white sheets and grey blankets hung out to dry and dangling limply in the still air i walked round the back of the house i tried the back door gently but it was locked then i heard a tapping noise i expected it was going to be the girl in the nurses uniform shooing me away but it was the same old lady whod appeared behind the nurse earlier miss carlisle she was wearing a dark dressinggown standing at a small window to the side of the wing that overlooked the farm lane she tapped again and motioned to me i went over and stood under the window she fiddled with something at the bottom of the windowframe after a while the window cracked open pivoting horizontally about its centre line she lowered her head ssh she said putting one thin milkcoloured finger to her lips i nodded and mirrored the gesture she motioned me in i looked around it was getting dark and hard to see well but there didnt appear to be anybody watching i pushed my kitbag through first then scrambled over the sill her room was small and smelled of old person of bodily wastes that were somehow genteel because the failing system had done little processing on their raw materials so that the offensive became unobjectionable there was a faint scent of something pleasant too lilacs i thought i could make out a wardrobe drawers a dressing table and a small chair there was a narrow single bed its covers disturbed as if shed just got up i always knew youd come back dear she said and gave me what was probably meant to be a fierce hug she was tiny and so frail really she just leaned against me and put her arms round my back her tiny head was against my breast i looked down into translucent wispily white hair as my eyes adjusted to the gloom i could see that the skin on her scalp was very pale pink and covered in little faint brown patches she gave a sigh i put my arms round her and gave her the gentlest of hugs fearful of crushing her dear johnny she sighed at last i closed my eyes holding her lightly to me we stayed like that holding each other for a while until it gradually dawned on me that she had fallen asleep i pulled carefully back unclasped her hands from the small of my back and laid her gently down on the bed pulling out the covers to slide her feet and legs in adjusting her trailing nightie and tucking her in properly she gave a tiny snore and turned onto her side from what i could see there was a smile on her face i opened the door there was a light on in the corridor no noise there was a faint smell of institutional cooking miss carlisles door had number on it and a little plastic apparatus at about eye level which contained a slip of white cardboard with her name on it i relaxed a little that ought to make things easier i looked back into the room through the window i could see the girl in the nurses uniform in the garden bringing in the washing grabbing the sheets and blankets off the line and throwing them into a wash basket i hoisted my kitbag and went silently out into the corridor closing the door quietly behind me i checked all the names in that corridor no sign of zhobelia there was a fire door with a glass and wiremesh window to one side off the corridor leading to the main house i peeked through to a dimly lit hall the door creaked as i went through i paused i could hear music and then a mans voice distorted and professionally cheery then more music i went on and found another couple of rooms with names on them looking to the front of the house the first one i looked at said mrs asis i looked around gave the gentlest of knocks for forms sake then slowly opened the door and stepped into the darkened room it was bigger than miss carlisles i saw two single beds and worried that zhobelia might be sharing that would complicate matters i need not have worried initially there was nobody in the room i was wondering what to do when i heard slow footsteps and two voices approaching there were two wardrobes i opened one to find it almost full trying to squeeze myself and my kitbag in would probably take minutes and cause a commotion anyway the other was locked i tried the nearest bed it was solid underneath with drawers the voices were at the door now i pulled up the cover on the second bed bliss it was an old ironframed thing plenty of room i pushed a plastic chamberpot out of the way and disappeared underneath five seconds or so before i heard the door open the carpet under the bed smelled of old dust and very faintly of vomit i dont want to go to bed horrible child said a voice that i thought i recognised a curious feeling half familiar half dizzyingly novel ran through me now mrs asis yeve got tae get yer beauty sleep havent ye im not beautiful im old and ugly dont be stupid youre very stupid why are you putting me to bed now whats wrong with you its not even dark yet aye it is look thats just the curtains the light clicked on there ye are thats better now isnt it will we get ye tae yer bed now eh i am not a child you are the child i should have stayed with the white man he wouldnt treat me like this how can they do this to me now now mrs asis come on lets get that cardie off ach there followed a stream of what might have been gaelic or khalmakistani or a mixture of both i have heard that there are no real swearwords in gaelic so from the sound and force of the utterances directed at the unfortunate lass either zhobelia was making up her own or she was speaking the language of her ancestors i stopped listening after a while not so much from boredom but because i was having to concentrate very hard not to sneeze i pushed my tongue forcefully into the top of my mouth and forced one finger hard up underneath my nose until the pain alone brought tears to my eyes this worked as usual but it was a closerun thing eventually zhobelia was installed in the other bed and the girl bade her goodnight turned off the light and closed the door zhobelia muttered away to herself in the darkness i was now left with the ticklish problem of how to let my greataunt know there was somebody there in the room with her without either giving her a heart attack or causing her to scream blue murder at the top of her lungs in the event the dilemma was taken out of my hands by my own lungs or my nose anyway the urge to sneeze returned more powerfully this time i tried to prevent it but to no avail i kept my mouth shut and closed my throat with my tongue so that the sneeze backfired repulsed into my lungs despite my attempts to silence my sneeze however it was still loud zhobelias mutterings stopped abruptly chapter twenty four a charged uneasy silence hung in the air zhobelia mumbled something greataunt zhobelia i said quietly she muttered something else greataunt i said i am im hearing voices now she muttered oh no greataunt its me isis your grandniece im going to die that must be it hearing little isis itll be her next then him greataunt youre not hearing voices now theyre lying to me telling me im not hearing them what have i done to deserve this greataunt sounds like calli not isis just a child itll be them next aasni and then the white man i wonder what theyll say please greataunt zhobelia it really is me its isis im under the other bed im going to come out now please dont be alarmed no its still her thats funny i thought dying would be different i got slowly out from under the bed on the far side so that i wouldnt suddenly emerge right in front of her i stood the room was dark i could just make out the dark masses of the furniture and sense my greataunts bulk in the divan bed greataunt over here i whispered i sensed movement at the head of her bed and heard skin or hair move on fabric oooh she breathed oooh i can see it now its a ghost ye gods it was like being miss carlisles johnny again i am not a ghost greataunt its isis im really here i am not a ghost now the ghost is saying its not a ghost whatever next greataunt i said raising my voice in frustration for goodness sake will you listen i am not a ghost oh dear ive upset it oh no oh greataunt please listen to me i said stopping at the foot of the other bed its isis your grandniece ive come here from the community at high easter offerance i have to talk to you i am as human as you are and not a supernatural apparition there was a silence then she muttered something in what i suspected was khalmakistani then in english youre not little isis shes just little oh good grief grandaunt i am nineteen years old now the last time you saw me i was little but im not any more i am a fully grown woman are you sure what youre not a ghost no i mean yes im sure im not a ghost i am real i would like to talk with you if you dont mind im sorry i had to hide in here in order to get to see you but the young lady would not let me in may i talk with you talk with me please may i hmm she said i sensed her moving touch my hand i moved forward then squatted near the bed and put out my hand eventually finding her hand it felt warm and small the skin was loose and very soft and smooth oh she whispered youre warm see not a ghost yes i see youre not a ghost are you no im real im isis little isis not little any more i stood up slowly still holding her hand then squatted again are you really isis yes isis whit i was born on the twentyninth of february nineteen seventysix my mother was alice cristofiori my father was christopher whit my brothers first name is allan you are my greataunt zhobelia asis your sister was aasni who i had been going to say who died in the fire that killed my parents but i thought the better of saying that and after a moments hesitation said who was my paternal grandmother she was silent believe me now i asked squeezing her hand gently i think so why are you here have they sent you away too i thought here was only for old people well yes i suppose i have been sent away but not to here i came here to see you you did that was very nice of you mohammed comes to see me sometimes but not very often he drinks you know the girls have been calli and astar and the glasgow ones they talk the old language i cant understand them usually i keep telling them they must talk slower but they dont listen people never listen you know especially young people ill listen greataunt will you youre a good girl you were very good as a baby you hardly cried did you know that other people have are you really isis yes greataunt she was silent for a long moment i missed you growing up she said though without obvious emotion unless it was mild surprise i wished i could see her face i was sorry you went away i told her i think we all were i know perhaps i shouldnt have this is very strange talking to you like this what do you look like shall we put on the light wont the nurse see the light is on yes she can see it under the door i have an idea i said patting her hand zhobelias clothes had been laid neatly on the bed i had been hiding under i moved them to the top of the chest of drawers and pulled the cover off the bed i rolled it up and placed it at the foot of the door here zhobelia said grunting there was a click and a little yellow electric lamp like a miniature striplight came on above the bed i stood up smiling at my greataunt she sat up in the bed blinking her nightie was pale blue with little yellow flowers she looked a little puffy and pale about the face not as asiatically dark as i remembered her hair was frizzy quite long and still surprisingly black though shot through with thick crinkly white hairs she felt on the bedside table and found her glasses she put them on and squinted at me the room seemed to spin about me as the feeling of halffamiliar dizziness id experienced earlier struck me again zhobelia seemed oblivious you look like your mother she said quietly nodding she patted the bed come and sit here i went shakily forward and sat on the bed we held hands why did you leave greataunt oh because i couldnt stay but why it was the fire it was terrible i know but do you remember it not really i remember the aftermath the shell of the mansion house its been rebuilt now yes i know she nodded blinking good im glad but why did you leave afterwards i was afraid people would blame me i was afraid of aasnis ghost besides id done my bit blame you for what the fire yes but it wasnt your fault it was i should have cleaned the pressure cooker and burning the money was my idea i saw it after all my fault but you werent pardon the pressure cooker i should have cleaned it properly the valve that was my job and i saw the money would cause a disaster i knew it what money were you talking about she looked as confused as i felt her eyes their dark brown irises surrounded by yellowy whites magnified by her thick glasses looked watery money she asked you said burning the money was your idea it was she said nodding what money greataunt i asked squeezing her hand gently the money salvadors money salvadors money i asked then glanced back at the door afraid that i had spoken too loudly the money he didnt have zhobelia said as though all this made perfect and obvious sense what money he didnt have greataunt i asked patiently the money she said as though it ought to be selfevident im sorry greataunt i dont understand nobody understood we kept it secret she said then turned down the edges of her mouth and shook her head looking away suddenly a smile lit up her face revealing long thin teeth she patted my hand now tell me all thats happened i took a deep breath perhaps we could come back to this mysterious money later well i said when when did you last talk to somebody from the community was it recently oh no she said i mean since i had to leave i cant remember what theyve said to me no no she frowned a little and gave the appearance of racking her brains then apparently gave up and smiled broadly expectantly at me it felt as though my heart slumped at the prospect but i smiled gamely and squeezed her hand again let me see i said well as i said the mansion house was rebuilt the old organ remember the organ in the farm parlour she smiled happily and nodded yes yes go on that was installed in the mansion house to give us extra room in the farm we always meant to have it properly looked after but we never did get round to it anyway salvador moved back into the mansion house lets see astar had pan of course erin had diana im cold zhobelia said suddenly id like my cardie she pointed at the pile of clothes on the chest of drawers its there oh right i said i got her cardigan and settled it round her shoulders plumping up her pillows and generally getting her comfortable there we are she said now she clasped her hands and looked expectantly at me right i said well as i was saying erin had her second child diana i went through the litany of births death and marriages and the various comings and goings of communites and orderites trying to recall all the important incidents and events of the past sixteen years zhobelia sat nodding happily smiling and cooing softly or widening her eyes and sucking air in through her pursed mouth or frowning and clucking her tongue as she felt appropriate for each related occurrence the story of our family and faith led me naturally through to more recent events and i gradually sharpened the focus of my tale to the point of my visit i had little idea of how much my greataunt was actually retaining of all this but i felt i had to make the effort the zhlonjiz she said when i got to that part of the story she laughed i glanced back at the door again ssh i said putting a finger to my lips she shook her head what a fuss all a lot of nonsense too that was something else we never told the white man she chuckled what i asked puzzled we could have made that she told me it was easy to make the main thing was now what was it what do they call it i should know this oh old age is so ah tcp she said triumphantly then frowned and shook her head no thats not it she looked down at the bed cover brows furled mouth pursed muttering in what i guessed was khalmakistani she switched to english what was the blinking stuff again i should know i should know she cast her gaze to the ceiling sighing mightily ah she pointed up with one finger sloans liniment she cried out i reached forward and gently placed my hand over her soft lips greataunt i whispered urgently with another glance at the door and coriander and other herbs and spices she whispered leaning closer our grandmother old hadra sent us the recipe you know but it was all a lot of old nonsense anyway she nodded clasping her hands and sitting back looking smug zhlonjiz i asked it was sloans liniment zhobelia confirmed rheumy eyes twinkling embrocation you rub it in chemists sell it not mail order she reached forward and tapped me sternly on the knee stuff and nonsense you know i nodded slowly not knowing what to think i wondered what the other herbs and spices were i wondered if it made any difference my greataunt tapped my hand keep going she said i like this its interesting i continued my tale as i had been telling it i had been turning over in my mind both how much detail to go into regarding allans duplicity and whether to mention my grandfathers sexual advances to me i considered mentioning both only in passing but in the end i told the full story much as i would have done to a close friend though i did say that cousin morag made exotic rather than erotic films i confess i also did not reveal the full extent of how i used poor uncle mos weakness for the drink and will not pretend that such diplomacy was principally for his benefit when i had finished zhobelia just sat there hands clasped looking unsurprised well she said thats him he was always like that youre an attractive girl he was always a one for the ladies we knew that didnt begrudge him it it was just his nature as well have complained that he snored he couldnt help it couldnt help himself she nodded helped himself yes helped himself wouldnt want me now im old and dried up prunes they give us for breakfast sometimes yes no good for you little isis she looked up at the ceiling frowning and seemingly trying to remember something that mohammed you know what i call him she asked sitting forward and fixing me with a stern look and tapped me on the knee do you do you know what i call him a liqueur moslem i ventured no she barked so that i put my finger to my lips again i call him a very silly boy she said in a hoarse whisper thats what i call him i think hes sorry i told her mohammed doesnt want to upset you he wants to give up drinking but he cant not yet anyway perhaps he will one day huh when i see it i will believe she said dismissively she looked away shaking her head this allan though she looked at me squinting such a quiet child colic as a baby you know yes but after that very quiet always watching always thought he was listening knew more than he let on had a funny look sometimes sly she nodded sly thats it sly she seemed very happy with this word and looked at me with an itoldyouso sort of look i despaired of ever getting my greataunt to appreciate the seriousness of the situation well my situation anyway i felt exhausted it must have taken a good hour to tell the recent history of the order and community and the full tale of my adventures over the last fortnight i had to stifle my yawns clenching my jaw and pretending i was just stretching zhobelia gave no sign of noticing the thing is greataunt i said hes lying about me allan hes telling lies about me and i think he wants to take over the order im not just worried for myself im concerned for everybody at the community for the whole order i think allan wants to change it make it less than what it has been more commercial perhaps they have started to send out letters begging for money i said trying to bring us back to that subject we have never done that can you imagine greataunt us asking for money isnt that disgraceful tsk she said nodding in agreement root of everything and such tut hmm yes we have always managed to do without money from others that is what is so terrible terrible yes hmm terrible she said nodding money has played almost no part in our faiths history i persisted feeling desperate and slightly underhand greataunt zhobelia sat there gathered her cardigan around her and leaned forward tapping my knee again do you want me to tell you about the money yes please do tell me you wont tell anybody else she whispered glancing to either side what to say she might not tell me if i refused to give such an assurance yet if this somehow affected my situation i might need what she could tell me as ammunition i wondered what the chances were of her finding out if i promised and then broke my promise and started calculating the odds then some part of my brain further up the chain of command put a stop to such faithlessness im sorry i cant make that promise greataunt i told her i might need to tell somebody else oh she looked surprised oh well i shouldnt tell you then should i greataunt i said taking her hand i will promise not to tell anybody else unless to tell them is make things better for all of us i didnt feel that really said what i meant and zhobelia looked confused so i fell back and regrouped for another try at it i will promise not to tell anybody else unless telling them is to do good you have my word on that i swear hmm well i see she looked up at the ceiling brows gathered she looked at me again still puzzled what was i talking about the money greataunt i said wringing my poor tired brain of its last drops of patience yes she said waggling my hand holding hers up and down urgently the money she looked blank what about it she asked her face like a little girls i felt tears prick behind my eyes i just wanted to lie down and go to sleep i closed my eyes briefly which was a mistake because it seemed to encourage my tears leaving me with blurred vision where did this money come from greataunt i asked wearily in a kind of befogged daze the money you were talking about from the time of the fire where did it come from royal scotland she nodded royal scotland i said baffled the royal scottish linen bank i stared at her trying to work out what on earth she was talking about thats what it said on the bag she said back in her isntitobvious attitude what bag greataunt i said sighing i had the impression actually was already asleep and this was just me sleeptalking or something the bag the bag i asked yes the bag a feeling of déjà vu intensified by tiredness swept over me where did the bag come from royal scotland i suppose i felt like one of two people rowing a boat only my partner wasnt actually rowing just stirring their oar in the water so that we kept going round and round in circles where did you find the bag greataunt i asked flatly on the she began then sat forward and beckoned to me i leaned towards her so that her mouth was at my ear i forgot she whispered forgot what greataunt we dont have it any more we burned it saw what would happen and thought wed get rid of it im sorry but where did you get the bag greataunt you said from the chest the chest our special chest the one he didnt have a key to thats where we kept it and the book the book here i thought we go again but no ill show you i still have a box you know the chest we lost in the fire but i saved the book and the other things she clutched excitedly at my shoulder well done i whispered thank you would you like to see it yes please its in the wardrobe you get it for me theres a good girl i was directed to the full wardrobe which was stuffed with colourful saris and other plainer clothes at its foot amongst a litter of old shoes and fragrant white mothballs there was a battered shoebox secured with a couple of dark brown elastic bands the box felt quite light when i lifted it and brought it over to zhobelia who seemed quite animated at the thought of what was inside she bounced up and down on the bed and motioned me to bring her the box for all the world like a child waiting on a present she pulled the elastic bands off the old shoebox one band snapped seemingly just of old age she put the lid of the box down on the bed beside her and started sorting through the documents newspaper cuttings old photographs notebooks and other papers inside she handed me the old photographs here she said the names are on the back she shuffled through the other stuff in the box stopping to read occasionally while i looked at the old snaps here were the two sisters looking young wary and uncertain in front of their old exlibrary van here they were with mr mcilone whom i recognised from the few other photographs that we had at high easter offerance here was the farm at luskentyre here the old seaweed factory before and after renovation and before and after the fire there was only one photograph of grandfather sitting in bright sunlight on a kitchen chair outside what i guessed was luskentyre turning his head away and putting his arm up to his face in an action the camera had captured as a blur it was the only representation i had ever seen of him apart from a couple of even more blurred newspaper photographs he was barely recognisable but looked very thin and young ah here now zhobelia lifted a small brown book about the size of a pocket diary but much thinner from the shoebox she looked inside the little book taking off her glasses to read a piece of white paper fell out she picked it up and handed it to me i put the photograph of my grandfather down on the knee of my leather trousers ahha she said matteroffactly i unfolded the piece of paper it felt crinkly and old but also thick and fibrous it was a banknote a tenpound note from the royal scottish linen bank it was dated july inspected it turned it over smelled it musty zhobelia tapped my knee again having attracted my attention she gave me a stagy wink as she handed me the small brown book i put the banknote on my knee along with the photograph of grandfather the little brown book looked faded and worn and very old it was warped too as though it had once been saturated with water there was a british royal crown on the front cover it was really just two bits of card one thinner piece placed inside the other thicker cover and not secured the inner card carried a list of dates and amounts of money expressed in pounds shillings and pence the last date was in august that piece of card was marked ab part two i put it down on the bed cover the other piece of card was marked ab part one it seemed to be some sort of pass book it belonged or had belonged to somebody called black moray rank private serial number he was five feet ten inches tall weighed eleven stone five pounds and had dark brown hair no distinguishing marks born the rest was a description of injections he had received and what sounded like army punishments fines detentions and losses of leave perhaps it was just tiredness that meant i didnt haul up short at the date of birth for i found myself thinking that i had no idea what any of this had to do with anything until i looked from the book to the photograph of my grandfather as a young man still on my knee the world tipped again my head swam i felt faint dizzy and sick a terrible shiver ran through me as my palms pricked with sweat and my mouth went dry my god could it be height weight hair colour of course the scar wouldnt be there and the birthdate to settle it i looked up into the eyes of my greataunt i had to attempt to swallow several times before i had enough saliva in my mouth to make it possible to speak my hands started shaking i rested them on my thighs as i asked zhobelia is this him i held up the small brown book is this my grandfather i dont know my dear we found that in his jacket the money was on the beach aasni found it the money i croaked the money zhobelia said in the canvas bag we counted it you know you counted it oh yes there were twentynine hundred pounds she gave a sigh but its all gone now of course she looked at the tenpound note sitting on my knee we burned all the rest in the canvas bag she nodded at the white tenpound note resting on my leg thats the last one left chapter twenty five i sat with my greataunt gradually piecing together the story going over it from what seemed like slightly different angles in her memory the story of my grandfather being found on the sandy ground outside the mobile shop at luskentyre on the night of the storm was all true but what we had never been told was that the sisters had found an army paybook inside the jacket he had been wearing they had also kept quiet the fact that the next day after the storm aasni had walked along the beach at luskentyre and found a zippered canvas holdall washed up on the sands it contained a pair of brown leather shoes sodden with sea water and a money sack containing two hundred and ninety tenpound notes all from the royal scottish linen bank they wondered if perhaps there had been a shipwreck during the storm and grandfather and the money had been washed ashore from the foundering ship but when they asked mr mcilone and some other locals then and later nobody had heard of a ship going down that night off harris my grandfather had been in no fit state to appreciate all this lying with his zhlonjiz poultice over his head wound hallucinating when he eventually woke up days later and claimed to be called salvador whit the sisters thought the better of disabusing him of this notion while he was in such an obviously fragile and fevered state they had already agreed to hide the money in their special chest worried that the small fortune they had found washed up represented the proceeds of some nefarious exploit when grandfather started pleading with them to look for just such a canvas bag they became even more worried by the time my grandfather was well enough to start looking for the canvas bag himself both aasni and zhobelia had rather fallen for him and jointly arrived at the conclusion that if he was given the money whether it was rightfully his or not he would probably disappear out of their lives the two sisters agreed that they would share the white man assuming that that was what he wanted and they would keep the money safe only revealing its existence if there should arise some emergency which could be dealt with in no other way except financially they also agreed that one day they would reveal the truth to their joint husband if it seemed like a good idea and they were certain that he wouldnt beat them or leave them or cast them out somehow that day never did arrive eventually one afternoon at high easter offerance in they decided to dispose of the money altogether after something that zhobelia saw she had so far been very vague as to exactly what it was that had had this effect they originally intended to burn it in the tandoor oven in the farm kitchen but even in the middle of the night people sometimes came down to the kitchen so that might be risky they decided they would incinerate the notes in the stove in the mansionhouse kitchen where the sisters usually carried out their experiments with scottishasiatic cuisine zhobelia didnt actually know what had happened in the kitchen on the night of the fire but had managed to convince herself that the money evil influence to the last had somehow caused the pressurecooker explosion and subsequent conflagration and that it was therefore all her fault she had seen aasnis ghost in her dreams and once a week after the fire she had woken up in her bed in the darkness and been quite fully awake but unable to move or breathe properly and knew that aasnis ghost was there in the room with her sitting on her chest turning her lungs into a pressure cooker for her guilt she knew that aasni would never forgive her or leave her alone so she decided that night that she would leave the community and seek out her old family to ask their forgiveness the asis family had moved too setting up home in the thornliebank district of glasgow from where they ran a chain of food shops and indian restaurants there were still asis family members in the hebrides but they were a younger generation the people aasni and zhobelia had known had all decanted to glasgow and apparently there had been great debate amongst them regarding whether they wanted zhobelia back at all zhobelia had gone to stay with uncle mo instead swearing her son to secrecy in the process while the asis family were making up their collective mind then zhobelia had had a stroke and needed more constant care than mo could provide alone she was moved out to a nursing home in spayedthwaite uncle mo had eventually contacted both our family and the asis clan pleading for support and received guarantees that the financial burden of looking after his mother would be shared by all three parties later the asis family insisted that zhobelia be moved closer to them and the gloamings nursing home mauchtie was the result they come to see me but they talk too fast zhobelia told me calli and astar have been too you know but they are very quiet i think theyre embarrassed the boy doesnt come very often at all not that i care stinks of drink did i tell you that yes greataunt i said squeezing her hand yes you did listen they look after us here that mrs joshua though shes a horror teeth zhobelia shook her head tutting miss carlisle now soft in the head she told me tapping her temple no they look after us here though you can lie in bed and nobody will talk to you sit in your chair the same rushed off their feet apparently the owner is a doctor which is good isnt it not that ive ever seen him of course but still television we watch a lot of television in the lounge lots of young australian people shocking greataunt i said still troubled by something zhobelia had said and starting to link it with a couple of other things id been confused about earlier hmm yes dear what was it you saw that made you want to burn the money please tell me i told you i saw it what did you see i saw the money was going to bring a disaster it just came to me didnt do any good of course these things rarely do but we had to do something do you mean you had a vision i asked confused what zhobelia said frowning yes yes a vision of course i think the gift passed on to you after me except you got it as healing think yourself lucky healing sounds easy compared to those visions i was glad to see the back of them itll pass on from you too eventually only one of us ever has it at a time just one of those things that has to be borne she patted my hand i stared at her mouth agape grandmother hadras mother had the seeing like me then when she died hadra found she could talk to the dead when hadra had her stroke back in the old country it passed to me and i started seeing things i was about twenty then after the fire you started healing she smiled that was it you see i could go then i was tired of it all and anyway i wasnt going to be any more use to anybody was i i knew the seeing would stop after you started healing and i knew everybody else would look after you and anyway i knew aasni would blame me for not seeing it properly in the first place and getting her killed she was annoying that way and shed always gone on at me for not treating the gift with more respect said it would have been better if shed had the visions but she didnt it was me i dont know how long the next moment lasted long enough for me to be aware that greataunt zhobelia was patting my cheek and looking with some concern into my eyes are you all right dear i tried to talk but couldnt i coughed finding my mouth and throat quite dry tears came to my eyes and i doubled up coughing painfully but still trying to keep quiet zhobelia tutted and clapped me on the back as my face lowered to the bedclothes greataunt i spluttered eventually wiping the tears from my eyes and still swallowing dryly with every few words are you telling me that you had visions not grandfather that you saw the fire i saw a disaster coming from the money i didnt know it was going to be a fire but i knew it was coming that was the last thing i saw before that oh lots of things she laughed quietly your poor grandfather he only ever had one real seeing i think i must have loaned him the gift for the time he was lying on the floor of the van covered in all that tea and lard poor dear he thought it was this twentyninth of february thing that made people different there was something special about him though there must have been the only thing that ever really surprised me in my whole life was him turning up like that i hadnt any inkling of that none at all that was how we knew he was special but visions no he had that one and woke up with it and started babbling trying to make something of it just like a man give them a toy and they have to play with it never content all the rest though she set her mouth in a tight line shaking her head all the rest what i asked gulping the visions the seaweed factory the hammock those fossil people mrs woodbean your father being born and then you and the fire i saw all that not him and if i didnt actually see it every time at least i knew what i wanted what aasni and i wanted and got your grandfather to do what we thought was right what we thought was needed for all of us thats the trouble with men you see they think they know what they want but they dont not usually you have to tell them you have to give them a bit of a hand now and again so i told him you know pillowtalk well suggested you cant be too careful but if its a warning of a disaster well there you are you see what happened with the money you foresaw the fire at the mansion house i whispered and suddenly my eyes were filling with tears again though this time not because my throat was sore a disaster dear zhobelia said matteroffactly seeming not to notice the tears welling in my eyes i saw a disaster that was all if id seen it was going to be a fire then of course the last thing id have suggested doing with the money would have been burning it all i saw was a disaster not exactly what sort should have known it would still happen of course she put on a sour face and shook her head the gift is like that you see but you have to try here my dear she said pulling a handkerchief from her sleeve dry your eyes thank you i dabbed at my tears youre welcome she sighed settling her cardigan about her i was glad to see the back of it no mistake hope it hasnt been the burden to you it was to me but if it is well theres nothing much to be done im afraid she looked concernedly at me how has it been for you dear are you bearing up take my advice let the menfolk deal with the consequences theyll take the credit for any good that comes from it anyway but its so nice when it goes thats the blessing you see that only one person has it at a time its such a relief to have surprises again it was a lovely surprise to see you this evening i had no idea you were going to appear just lovely i handed the handkerchief back to zhobelia she stuffed its sodden ball up her sleeve it was the shape of the inside of my fist how long has this gift what dear how long will you have it i dont know how long has it existed is it just in our family just in the women any of the women but only ever one at a time how long i dont know there are some silly ideas ive heard certain daftnesses she shook her head quickly dismissively but you dont want to concern yourself with them people are so credulous you know credulous i said suppressing a laugh and a cough at the same time oh she said tutting and shaking her head you wouldnt believe she reached out and held my hand again patting it absently and smiling at me i sat there looking at her feeling half hysterical with all the things shed told me wanting to howl with despair and rage at the madness of the world and burst out in screams of riotous laughter for exactly the same reason what was i to do what mattered most out of all i had discovered i tried to think while zhobelia sat blinking and smiling at me and patting my hand greataunt i said eventually putting my other hand on top of hers would you like to come back back back with me to the community to the farm to high easter offerance to stay to live with us but her ghost she said quickly eyes childishly wide then she frowned and looked to one side though you werent a ghost she muttered maybe it would be all right now i dont know im sure it would be all right i said i think you belong back with us but if it isnt all right you werent a ghost but what if she is im sure she wont be just try it greataunt i said come back for a week or two and see if you like it if you dont you could always come back here or maybe stay somewhere nearer by us but i need looking after dear well look after you i told her i hope ill be going back soon too ill look after you she seemed to think no television she asked well no i admitted huh never mind she said all the same anyway lose track you know she stared at me vacantly for a moment are you sure theyd want to see me again everybody would i said and felt sure that it was true she stared at me this isnt a dream is it i smiled no it isnt a dream and i am not a ghost good id hate it to be a dream because id have to wake up she yawned i found myself yawning too unable to stop myself youre tired dear she said patting my hands you sleep here thats what to do she looked over at the other bed there have the other bed you will stay wont you i looked round trying to judge where i might sling my hammock the room didnt look promising in truth i was so tired i could have slept on the floor and quite possibly might would it be all right if i stayed i asked of course she said there sleep there and so i slept in greataunt zhobelias room i couldnt find anywhere to hang my hammock so i made a little nest for myself on the floor with bedclothes from the other bed and curled up there in between zhobelia and the empty bed my greataunt wished me goodnight and switched off the light it was quite easy to go to sleep i think my brain had given up reeling by that point it had gone back to being shocked the last thing i recall was my greataunt whispering to herself little isis whod have thought it then i fell asleep i was awakened by the noise of doors slamming and the rattle of tea cups daylight lined the curtains my empty stomach was growling at me my head felt light i rolled over stiffly and looked up to see greataunt zhobelia looking down at me from her bed a soft smile on her face good morning she said youre still real good morning greataunt i croaked yes still real still not a dream or a ghost im so glad something rattled in the hall outside her door youd better be off soon or theyll catch you all right i got up quickly remade the other bed took the cover from the bottom of the door and replaced zhobelias clothes on the bed i ran a hand through my hair and rubbed my face i squatted at the side of her bed holding her hand again do you remember what i asked you last night i whispered will you come back to stay with us oh that i dont know she said id forgotten do you really mean that i dont know ill think about it dear if i remember please do greataunt she frowned did i tell you last night about the things i used to see about the gift i think i did id have told you before but you werent old enough to understand and i had to get away from her ghost did i tell you yes i told her gently squeezing her soft dry hand yes you told me about the visions you passed on the gift of knowing about them oh good im glad i heard voices outside in the corridor they went away but i stood anyway and kissed her on the forehead i must go now i told her ill come back to see you though and ill take you away if you want to come home yes yes dear you be a good girl now and remember dont let the men know ill remember greataunt yes dear i glanced at the shoebox which sat on her bedside cabinet may i take the paybook and the tenpound note with me i promise ill return them of course dear would you like the photographs as well ill take the one of grandfather if i may oh yes take the lot if you want i dont care i stopped caring a long time ago caring is for the young thats what i say not that they care either but you do no you take care i put the photograph paybook and banknote in my inside jacket pocket thank you i told her youre welcome goodbye greataunt oh yes mmhmm thank you for coming to see me i peeked through the curtains to check the coast was clear slid up the sash window dropped my kitbag onto the path beneath and jumped out after it i walked smartly away and was at hamilton station within the hour a train took me to glasgow i sat looking out at the countryside and the buildings and the railway lines shaking my head and muttering to myself i neither knew nor cared what sort of effect this behaviour had on my fellow passengers though i noticed nobody sat beside me despite the fact that the train seemed full zhobelia visions money salvador whit black all this on top of everything else id learned in the last few days where did this stop what extremity of revelation could still lie in store for me i could not imagine and did want to envision my life had changed and changed again in so many ways in such a short time recently everything id known had been exploded thrown into chaos and confusion mixed and tumbled and strewn made nebulous and inchoate and senseless i scarcely knew what to think where to begin trying to think so that i might piece everything back together again if that were even remotely possible at least i had had the presence of mind to ask zhobelia for the tenpound note and the paybook i supposed that i was clinging of necessity to the most practical course that presented itself clutching at reality like a shellfish to a familiar rock while the waves of something unimaginably more vast and powerful washed over me threatening to dislodge my sanity i focused upon the immediate practicalities of the moment and found some relief and some release in thinking through what had to be done now to bring the more mundane problems i was faced with to some sort of resolution by the time the train pulled into glasgow central station then i had decided on the plan for the next part of my campaign chapter twenty six yeah good morning i would like to speak to topee please speaking brother topee it is i isis is well hello there my relation whooped painfully loudly i held the phone away from my ear for a moment really he laughed youre kidding but hey you arent allowed to use the phone are you not normally but these are desperate times topee they are whangydangy no one ever tells me anything where are you anyway glasgow central station yeah wow great hey come on round and meet the guys were gonna have some brekkers and then head out for some jazz breakfast would be appreciated great brilliant hey he said as his voice went echoey and small for a moment its my cousin isis topee and i are not of course actually cousins the real relationship is more complicated but i understood the elision aye shes coming round here i heard a lean chorus of male cheers in the background then topees voice again still echoey yeah the neatlookin one the messiahess aye topee i said sighing dont embarrass me i dont have the emotional resilience just at the moment eh what na dont worry so he said how come youre using the phone is i think i might need some help what with research research in a library or maybe a newspaper i am unused to such things i wondered if you might be able to assist me dunno maybe give it a go i suppose yeah why not you comin over then i shall be there directly ha ha i love the way you talk great the guys are dyin to meet you youve got a fan club here i groaned see you soon you got the address yes ill be about half an hour okaydoke give us time to clean the place up i could only conclude that topee and the three male friends with whom he shared the flat in dalmally street had not bothered to do any cleaning whatsoever or that they normally lived in a state resembling the interior of one of those municipal rubbish lorries which compresses each binload of refuse it picks up the flat smelled of beer and the carpet i first stepped onto in the hall stuck to my feet like something designed to let astronauts walk in a space station topee gave me a hug which lifted both my kitbag and me off my feet the hall carpet only parted with the soles of my boots reluctantly i believe and proceeded to squeeze most of the breath out of me topee is a lively lad tall and skinny with outrageously good looks he has long black naturally ringletted hair which happily for him suits indeed thrives on not being combed or cared for and an electrifyingly dark exquisitely sculpted face with eyes so piercingly blue the impression they give is of cobalt spikes he put me down before i fainted isis he yelled and took a step backwards going down on his hands and knees laughing and salaaming im not worthy im not worthy he was dressed in ripped jeans and a ripped tshirt under a frayed check shirt hello topee i said as tiredly as i felt shes here topee cried out and jumped to his feet dragging me through to the flats living room where three other young men sat grinning at a table playing cards drinking tea and eating greasy food out of cold aluminium containers with spoons i moved a pair of grubbylooking socks off the seat i was offered and sat down i was duly introduced to steve stephen and mark and invited to share their breakfast which consisted of the remains of a communal takeaway curry and ditto chinese from the previous night bulked out by a plate piled high with huge soft floury rolls tea was provided and such was my hunger i found the cold oily debris from the previous night quite palatable the rolls were more appearance than substance seemingly compose mostly of air but at least they were fresh i chatted to the other three young men who all suffered from an interestingly diverse range of spots and related skin conditions they seemed embarrassed by my presence which i might have found flattering if id had the energy to spare they kept on playing cards as they talked and ate roundly abusing and cursing each other as though they were homicidally desperate outlaws gambling for the entire proceeds of a robbery rather than i assumed reasonably good friends and playing apparently for sweets called smarties are those earrings topee i asked as topee finding that some hairs were getting into his mouth as he munched on his lemon chicken and roll flicked his hair back behind his ear and revealed a set of half a dozen or so small studs and rings set into the rearward edge of his left ear he flashed a smile at me yeah cool eh hmm i continued digging into my mostlyair roll topee looked hurt you dont like them he asked plaintively i forbore pointing out that body piercing was frowned upon by our faith just as i had questioning topees lack of a mudmark on his forehead i have always felt i said instead that the human body arrives with a more than sufficient number of orifices out of the box as it were they were all looking at me yeah sniggered the one called mark to name but one the others snorted and laughed too after a moment i just sat and smiled not entirely sure what the joke was topee looked a little discomfited but cleared his throat and asked politely what exactly it was i wanted help with while giving the details a wide berth i explained to topee that i wanted to investigate army records events in as reported in newspapers and possibly old currency even as i spoke the words i felt that just mentioning those three areas was already giving too much away but topees eyelids remained unbatted and i felt i had to involve him i needed to do this quickly i felt and as a student topee ought to know his way round a library oughtnt he listening to the four lads chat and curse as they played cards i wondered if this had been wise but i had made my play now and would have to stick with it aw shit is topee exclaimed when i made clear the need for haste you wanna do this now aw rats man this is saturday is topee said laughing and waving his arms about his pals nodded enthusiastically we have to go out and get steamin and listen to jazz and stuff and do a pub crawl or come back here and drink cans and bet on the football scores and go out and get paralytic and get blackpudding suppers and chips and go to the qmu and dance like maniacs and try and get off with nurses and end up back here having an impromptu soirée like as not and throw up in the garden and throw things out of the window and call for a pizza and play bowls in the hall with empty cans he laughed you cant interfere with a with a monthsold tradition like that just because you need to do this research shit fuck if we wanted to do that sort of stuff wed be writing our essays i mean do we look like sad students come on were trying to resurrect a fine student tradition here we have to party party the others chorused i looked at topee you told me students were all very boring and examoriented these days they are mostly topee said gesticulating we party party the other three chorused again animals are practically an endangered species i cant imagine why i sighed well just oh come is let your i mean get your party party hat on we can do all that stuff on monday topee i said smiling faintly just point me in the right direction ill do it myself you wont come out with us he asked looking deflated thank you but no id like to get this done today its all right ill do it myself not at all if you wont come out with us ill come out with you well do all this stuff well all help except you have to come out for a drink with us tonight right he looked round the others they looked at him and then at me na no dont think so tope nut i wannae to go to the jazz topee looked crestfallen for a moment oh oh well he said with an expansive shrug waving with his arms just me then he laughed fuck talked myself into that one didnt i the others murmured assent to this topee slapped his forehead staring at me i suppose i have to wash your feet too dont i i forgot the others looked up surprised i took a guess at the state of cleanliness of any basin bowl or container suitable for feetwashing the flat might possess that wont be necessary just now thank you topee currency topee said a little later in the kitchen as we tidied away the breakfast things a banknote i told him yeah cool my director of studies collects stamps and stuff i wonder if he knows anybody collects notes ill give him a call he grinned got his home number im always calling in for extensions just chuck the stuff in there he said pointing at one of three black polythene bags by the side of an overflowing bin he strode out into the hall i opened the black bag averting my nose from the smell that emanated from it and dumped the crushed empty takeaway containers into it i tied up the sack and did the same with the other two breathing through my mouth to combat the stench i started cleaning dishes anything to be busy id been right about the washingup basin topee was back a few minutes later he stared at the washingup suds as though he had never seen such a phenomenon before a thesis the state of the kitchen did nothing to contradict oh yeah like well done is what did your director of studies say i asked him we need a notaphilist he said grinning a what a notaphilist he repeated apparently theres one in wellington street he glanced at his watch open till noon on saturdays reckon we can make it i found it quite easy to drag myself away from the washingup we caught a bus into the city centre and found the address in wellington street a little basement shop under a grand tall victorian office building of recently cleaned fawn sandstone h womersledge numismatist and notaphilist said the peeling painted sign the place was pokey and dark and smelled of old books and something metallic a bell jangled as we entered i tried to convince myself that these were not really retail premises there were glass cases counters and tall display cabinets everywhere all full of coins medals and banknotes the latter held in little transparent plastic stands or folders like photographic albums a middleaged man appeared from the back of the shop id expected some little old bentover octogenarian sporting a patina of dandruff and dust but this fellow was my side of fifty smoothly plump and dressed in a white poloneck top and cream slacks morning he said yo said topee bouncing from one foot to the other the man looked unimpressed i tipped my hat good morning sir i brought out the banknote and placed it on the glass counter between us over dully gleaming silver coins and colourfully ribboned medals i wondered what you could tell me about this i said he picked up the note delicately held it up to the dim light from the one small window then switched on a tiny but powerful table lamp and studied the note briefly well its pretty selfexplanatory really he said tenpound note royal scot linen july fortyeight he shrugged they were produced in this form from may thirtyfive to january fiftythree when the rsl was taken over by the royal bank he turned the note over a couple of times handling it the way i imagined a cardsharp did a card quite an ornate note for the time it was actually designed by a man called mallory who was later hanged for murdering his wife in nineteen fortytwo he gave us a suitably wintry smile i suppose you want to know how much its worth i imagined it was worth ten pounds i said if it was still legal tender not legal tender the man said grinning and shaking his head worth about forty quid mint which this isnt if you were selling i could give you fifteen but even thats only because i like round numbers hmm i said well perhaps not then i stood looking down at the note just letting the time pass the man turned the note over on the counter one more time well then i said after topee had started to get agitated at my side thank you sir youre welcome the man said after a moments hesitation i picked up the note and folded it back inside my pocket good day i said tipping my hat yeah the man said frowning as i turned and walked to the door followed by topee i opened the door jangling the bell again ah wait a minute the man said i turned and looked back he waved one hand as though rubbing out something on an invisible screen between us no no im not going to offer you more or anything thats all its worth really but could i have another look at it of course i went back to the counter and handed him the note again he frowned at it mind if i take a copy of this he asked will it be harmed i asked he smiled tolerantly no it wont all right wont be a minute he disappeared into the back of the shop there were a series of quiet mechanical noises he was back a moment later with the note and a copy of both its sides on a large sheet of paper he handed me the note again you got a phone number i can reach you at yes i said topee do you mind eh what oh like hey no no on you go pas de probleme i gave the man topees phone number now what topee asked on the street outside army records and old newspapers there are occasions when i find pieces of technology i cant help liking the fiche reader and builtin copying machine that i was directed to at the mitchell library proved to be one such device it was like a large vertically oriented television set screen but was really just a sort of projector throwing onto the screen the highly magnified images of old newspapers documents journals ledgers and other papers which had been photographed and placed hundreds at a time on pieces of thin laminated plastic in this manner many years worth of broadsheet newspapers that might have filled a room could be condensed into a small filing box that one could carry comfortably with one hand by working two small wheels one could manipulate the glass bed the fiches rested upon and so rove at will across the hundreds of pages recorded on each plastic sheet when one had found a sheet one wanted to record all that had to be done was to press a button and the contents of the screen would be transferred by a photocopying process to a sheet of ordinary paper i suspect it was something about the mechanical nature of the whole business despite the machines obvious reliance on electrical power that attracted me if you held the riches up to the light you could just make out the tiny shapes of the newspapers easily identifying large headlines and photographs by the black and grey blocks they made on the white surface it was obvious in other words that the information was physically there albeit in microscopically reduced form not macerated into digits or stripes of magnetism plastered on a bit of tape or a little brown disk and intrinsically unreadable without the intervention of a machine the fiches could probably be used without the machine if one had a bright light and a very strong magnifying glass and that seemed to me to define the limit of acceptable technology luskentyrians have traditionally had an almost instinctive suspicion of things which boast of having few or no moving parts it makes us incompatible as a rule with electronics but this device seemed just about tolerable i was sure brother indra would like this machine i thought again of allan using the portable phone in the office storeroom and felt my teeth grind as i read the ancient headlines i had come here to inspect i was looking at old copies of scottish and british newspapers from i glanced at one or two from the early months of the year but was concentrating on the second half of the year i was not entirely sure what it was i might find i was just looking for something that caught my eye i sat alone at the machine having given brother topee the task of finding out how one might investigate an individual who had been in the british army he had pointed me towards the mitchell library from an army recruitment centre in sauchiehall street i had left him standing in a queue there i was hoping he wouldnt join up by mistake though with those earrings he was probably safe i had plenty of newspapers to choose from the herald scotsman courier dispatch mirror evening times times sketch i started with the scotsman for no better reason than that was the paper mr warriston took and i had once picked it up and surreptitiously read a few pages on the first occasion id visited his house in dunblane i read of the assassination of gandhi the formation of israel the berlin airlift harry s truman elected president in the united states the founding of the two korean republics the austerity olympics in london continuing rationing in britain and the abdication of queen wilhelmina in holland what i was looking for were shipwrecks bank robberies mysterious disappearances people being washed overboard from troopships or going missing from army bases after a quick look through a selection of months i decided to restrict my search to that of september initially reckoning that the chances were that whatever i was looking for had taken place then i had got to the last september issue of the scotsman without success when topee appeared in the little alcove off the upper gallery where the fiche reading machine was situated any luck i asked he sat down on another chair breathing hard as though hed been running no its been fucking privatised man what the army no the records all the armed forces records used to be some civil service department but now its something called force facts plc and you have to pay for each inquiry and theyre not open over the weekend anyway hilarious eh total he shook his head how about you nothing yet done the scotsman about to start on the glasgow herald if you could take the righthand side of the screen while i read the left well get through this a lot quicker i told him making room for his seat he scraped in beside me glancing soulfully at his watch the guys will be watching the jazz by now he said in a small voice topee i said this is important if you dont feel you can devote your full concentration to the task just say so and run off to play with your pals no no he said pushing back his hair and sitting forward in his chair to peer intently at the screen i took the last scotsman fiche off the glass plate and put the first glasgow herald fiche on topee continued to stare at the screen is what what am i looking for anyway shipwrecks shipwrecks well maybe not actual shipwrecks i said recalling that zhobelia had said there hadnt been any shipwrecks at the time but something like shipwrecks topee grimaced looking up at the ceiling right cool anything else yes anything that rings a bell eh anything that sounds familiar anything that sounds like it might be linked to the order he looked at me you mean you dont know what were looking for not exactly i admitted scanning my half of the display if i knew exactly what it was there wouldnt be any need to look right he said so ive got to look for something like really carefully but i dont know what it is im looking for except it might be something like a shipwreck that isnt thats right from the corner of my eye i could see that topee continued to study me i half expected him to rise from his chair and walk out but instead he just turned back to the screen and pulled his seat closer wow he chuckled like zen an hour went by topee swore he was paying attention but he always claimed to be finished at the same time as me and i know i read very quickly indeed still i had calculated that we would be lucky to finish all the records of all the papers for september by the time the library closed so i had no choice for now but to trust his word after that first hour topee started humming and whistling and making little sibilant noises with his tongue lips and teeth i suspected it was jazz the next hour grew to middle age i tried with all my might to concentrate but occasionally i would drift away from my task and start reliving the previous night hearing zhobelia tell me in her matteroffact way that what i had thought a personal miracle a blessed affliction one wise wound upon another was something i shared through time with generations of my female ancestors including her did that make any more sense of what i felt when i envisioned something i had no idea it put my visions in a sort of context but it made the experience no less mysterious did it mean anything that god chose to order their miracles in this manner i could not shake off the feeling that if there was one thing salvador had got right it was that we are not even capable yet of understanding the purpose god has in mind for us we can only struggle through doing the best we can and trying neither to hide behind ignorance nor overestimate the reach of our knowledge i kept having to drag myself back to the task in hand trawling the past for the key to the present and found it it was in the glasgow courier dated thursday th september it was as well i was sitting down the experience of dizziness induced by a familial revelation did not seem to be a condition i was becoming inured to despite the frequency with which it had swept through me in the past few days my sight seemed to go a bit swimmy for a while but i just sat and waited for it to clear i read on while topee read or pretended to read beside me civilian and military police are today seeking private moray black a private of the dumbartonshire fusiliers who is wanted for questioning in connection with an incident at ruchill barracks glasgow on monday night when it is understood an attack took place on a junior officer in the pay corps and an amount of money was subsequently found to be missing private black who is described as five feet ten inches in height and weighing eleven stone five pounds with brown hair is known to have connections in the govan area the words seemed to dance in front of me i let them settle down mother believed to be an unmarried textile worker in paisley brought up by his grandmother a member of the grimsby brethren a charismatic sect gang member alleged racketeer during war national service finished topee said i turned and smiled wondering that topee did not hear my heart thudding in my chest right i said and put the fiche back in its box topee could you ask a librarian whether it is permitted to have a glass of water or a cup of tea here at the desk im thirsty but i dont want to leave yup he said and bounded out of his seat as though released by a spring i put the fiche back in the machine and took a couple of copies of it while he was away i quickly searched the other papers they had the same story though the courier seemed to have the most detail their reporter had talked exclusively to private blacks grandmother i went to another shelf and selected the box with octobers newspapers in it on saturday the nd of october there was another report in the courier to the effect that black was still being hunted the junior officer who had been attacked in the incident was recovering in hospital concussed on the same page a familiar word attracted my eye it turned out to be the name of a ship it appeared in a report which stated that the ss salvador a general cargo vessel of tons registered in buenos aires which had sailed from govan docks on the morning of the th september bound for quebec new york colon and guayaquil had encountered heavy weather off the outer hebrides on the night of the th and suffered structural damage the ship was now limping back to glasgow amongst its cargo had been railway carriages and other rolling stock bound for south america several carriages lashed to its deck had been washed overboard during the storm my god i read the article about the ss salvador again and looked up at the ceiling my grandfather was washed ashore after a train wreck we got back to topees flat stephen reported drunkenly that there had been a message from a mister wormsludge har har asking me to ring his home number i rang mr womersledge he said the serial number on the tenpound note i had shown him was one of a consecutive batch which had been stolen from the army pay corps in september the note might be more valuable than hed said originally and he could now offer me fifty pounds for it i said thank you id think about it and put down the phone as the final teetering keystone of my belief in my grandfather finally tumbled down about me and the world i had known seemed to fall away like unseasonable sprink before the sudden thaw topee asked hey were we like ready to go out for a drink like yet i of course said yes chapter twenty seven i had thought that i might find release from my tormented thoughts in alcoholic oblivion but it was not to be after making another couple of phone calls i duly went out that evening with topee and his pals but as we sat quickly drinking beer in a bar in byres road apparently the natural and normal preparation before a dance at something called the queen margaret union i found myself slipping behind in the beerdrinking unable to stop myself thinking about the revelation of the inherited bizarrely serial nature of my gift and the treachery and mendacity of those close to me barely had i started to come to terms with the betrayal of my own brother when i discovered that my grandfather was a thief and a liar as well as a potential rapist that particular scrofulously scabrous cat was scarcely out of the bag when it was revealed in an almost offhand manner that i was just the latest in a long line of visionaries faith healers and mediums dating back to whoknewwhen our whole order had been constructed on a base more dangerous and shifting than the sands of luskentyre themselves everybody had been lying to everybody else far from being a single eruption of poison in our placid and serene environment allans lies and machinations suddenly started to look like an unremarkable and even predictable continuance of a vein of evil and mendacity that had been intertwined with the roots of our faith from the very start and indeed which predated it was there no foundation of my life on which i could still rely i tried to comfort myself with the thought that the community and the order had some intrinsic merit independent of their genesis in a sense all i had discovered about my grandfather at any rate made no difference the proof of our faiths worth lay in the hearts and minds of all of us who believed and in the commitment and dedication we displayed why should good not come out of evil was it not a sign of the ineffable bounteousness of god that they wrought the gold that was our faith from the base and toxic ore that had been my grandfathers violence and thievery and my grandmothers and my greataunts deceptions and manipulations it might be argued that the subsequent deceits of my grandmother and greataunt had been the balancing wrong that had redeemed my grandfathers original sins that sometimes two wrongs do make a right and that of all the things aasni and zhobelia might have done reporting the find of money and grandfathers army paybook to the appropriate authorities being the most obvious and strictly correct their actual course of action intrinsically dishonest though it was and including zhobelias exploitation of her own gift and my grandfathers need for guidance had produced entirely the best and most fruitful outcome and a harvest of enlightenment and happiness very few avowedly good and wellintentioned acts ever yielded but ancestry matters in the minds of men and women and symbols are important to discover that salvador had been no more than a common thief on the run after an act of violence and realise that had he been able to find his washedup loot he would probably have disappeared from aasni and zhobelias lives could not fail to alter the whole way people thought of my grandfather and by implication the faith he had engendered we would all feel deceived and our beliefs cheapened it could be argued that the worse grandfather had been before his conversion the more blessed he became in comparison afterwards god may take little credit for turning a man already good into a slightly better one but to perform the miracle of forging a virtuous man from a bad one signified serious divine accomplishment and deserved real appreciation but would such considerations make up for the inevitable feeling of betrayal people were bound to experience how many followers would we lose if this truth came out as i had vowed to myself it must how many more converts could we hope to gain once my grandfathers history became common knowledge ought i now to renounce my earlier oath and like my grandmother and greataunt conceal the ugly truth to favour the general good what then would my word be worth what selfrespect could i claim for myself if a commitment so freshly made so vehemently sworn could be so quickly abandoned when its consequences proved even more wideranging and more grave than i had anticipated well my selfrespect was far from being the most important point at issue i supposed what mattered was the good of the order and the community and the spiritual wellbeing of the great majority of blameless people therein i was confident that should i go back on my vow and keep my grandfathers dreadful secret to myself i could rest easy with such contained knowledge and its cosseting would not contaminate or poison me but would it be right to incorporate what would in effect be another lie into what was already a whole tangled web of them when the truth might sweep them all away and let us start again righteous uncontaminated and without the baleful jeopardising threat of that deceit hanging over us and was i right and had i the right to assume that our faith was so fragile it required shielding from such unpleasant facts in the long term might it not be better to embrace the truth regardless and suffer whatever falling away in belief and support such a course entailed secure in the knowledge that what and who remained would be true and strong and fundamentally trustworthy and proofed tempered against further harm and should i announce i have the gift only me i am the one and the line that comes from my greataunt not my grandfather ought i to take it upon myself to alter the whole emphasis of our faith and point out another false belief we had previously held so dear another area of shifting sand we had before thought immovable bedrock and by god even my gift was not unquestioned in my own mind here i was suffused with selfrighteous anger at my grandfather for having lied to us when there was still a question hanging over the validity of my own renown if people only knew the problem of action at a distance with which i had been struggling for over a decade took on a new shiftier significance in the present climate of poisonous suspicion and suddenly the hope i had clung to that i might have a gift greater than people knew of rather than lesser looked distinctly dubious cheer up isis might never happen topees friend mark said winking at me across the glasscrowded table i gave him a tolerant smile im afraid it already has i told him and drank my beer i fell out of the system of buying rounds unable and unwilling to keep up i went to the dance with the lads and continued slowly drinking beer out of plastic pint containers but my heart was not really in the proceedings i found the music boring and the men who came up to our group to ask me to dance no more attractive than the sounds i could not bring myself to join in the dancing even when topee asked instead i found myself watching everybody else dance reflecting what a strange and comical activity it could appear how odd that we should get such pleasure just from moving rhythmically i supposed you could link the urge to dance to the sexual drive and certainly there was both a correspondence between the regularity of the movements the two activities tended to involve and an obvious element of something between courtship and foreplay in the coming together of two people on the dance floor but i had watched young children and very old people take part in dances at the community and had myself danced there when i had been convinced there was no aspect of sexuality involved and had seen the obvious delight experienced by young and old alike and felt a kind of transcendent joy in myself that i was even more sure shared nothing with carnality except the feeling that what one was experiencing was good and pleasant the elation i had felt while dancing in fact seemed to have more in common with religious ecstasy as i understood it than with sexual bliss one could feel almost mystically taken out of oneself transported to another plane of existence where things became clearer and simpler and more connected at once and ones whole being seemed suffused with peace and understanding certainly this effect was difficult and took a long time to achieve while dancing i thought of whirling dervishes and african tribespeople spinning through the night and could only ever be a weak reflection of the intense rapture experienced by the believer but one had to say that it would be better than nothing if nothing was the only other choice perhaps there lay the explanation for the attraction so many young people obviously felt for dancing in our increasingly godless and materialist society a strange species humanity i found myself thinking quite as though i was some visiting alien i do not belong here i thought my place is with my people and their future rests in my hands now i suddenly wanted to be away from the noise and the heat and the smoke of this place and so borrowed a key from topee donated the remains of my pint to him and stood and made my apologies and left stepping out into the clear black night and breathing in its cool air as though released from a fetid prison after many years incarceration the stars were mostly hidden by the citys glare but the moon less than a day away from being full shone down almost undiminished and as coolly serene as ever i did not go straight back to the flat but wandered the streets for a while still troubled by my conflicting thoughts my conscience and will buffeted this way and that by the opposing arguments that racked my soul eventually i stood on the bridge that carries great western road over the river kelvin leaning on the stone balustrade and looking down into the dark waters far beneath while the traffic grumbled and roared at my back and groups of people went chattering past a feeling of calmness gradually stole over me as i stood there thinking and thinking and trying not to think it was as though the warring forces in my soul were both so evenly matched and so precisely targeted upon their opposite that they eventually cancelled each other out fighting each other to a standstill to exhaustion and a stop if not a conclusion let what would be be i thought the shape of tomorrow was already half decided and how exactly it would all end i would simply have to wait and see playing events as they fell rather than trying to decide precisely what i would do now at the least i could sleep on my decision sleep seemed a very good idea i thought i returned to the flat extended my hammock between the wardrobe and the beds headboard in topees room both articles of furniture were massive enough to support the weight and both were also of such an anciently elaborate design that there was an almost embarrassing choice of stoutly carved curlicues and knobbly extrusions on which to loop the hammock cords i took off my jacket shirt and trousers climbed into my hammock and fell asleep almost instantly i was only dimly aware of a party going on much later topee crept in and whispered to me hed got lucky and swapped rooms with stephen so that he could be alone with his new conquest but stephen true to topees guarantee did not disturb me during the night and i awoke to stephens unconscious snuffles and snorts bright and early the next morning i arose washed and dressed before anybody else awoke the living room was carpeted with sleeping bodies i stood at the hall table to write a note to topee and a letter to grandmother yolanda then left to find a post box sophi who had been the next person id telephoned after talking to mr womersledge last night arrived in her little morris half an hour later to discover me sitting on the flats doorstep eating a filled roll from a wee shop down the road sophi looked blithe and summery in jeans and a striped tshirt her hair was gathered up in a ponytail she kissed me when i got into the car you look tired she told me thank you thats how i feel i told her i held out the white paper bag id got from the wee shop would you like a filled roll i had breakfast she told me so she clapped her hands where first mauchtie lanarkshire i told her rightyho she said and put the car into gear the day and the last decisive part of my campaign had begun it had crossed my mind that if i did decide that discretion concerning grandfathers misdemeanours was the prudent course then bringing zhobelia back into the bosom of our family and community might prove unwise even catastrophic what were the chances that she would be able to hold her tongue regarding the paybook and the money now that she had broken the dam of that secrecy having her staying with us might well mean that the truth would be bound to leak out eventually and perhaps in the most damaging way over time through rumour and gossip but i could not leave her in that place it had been clean enough at the gloamings nursing home zhobelia had a generously sized room she obviously shared and enjoyed some sort of social contact with the other residents and she had not complained of much there but it had all seemed so loveless so cold after the warmth of the community i had to take her away if doing so forced my hand concerning the telling of the truth then so be it i would not sacrifice my greataunts happiness to such expediency telling the truth was what i had sworn to myself i would do after all even if now my instinct was to conceal rather than to reveal well we would see we drove through the lightly trafficked city i gave sophi an edited version of my short but eventful travels with uncle mo my meeting with morag my audience with greataunt zhobelia and time spent with brother topee i did not for the time being mention the things zhobelia had told me or the paybook and the tenpound note so what were you looking for at the library sophi asked i shook my head and could not look at her oh old stuff i said things i half wish i hadnt found out i glanced at her things im not sure about telling anybody else yet sophi looked briefly at me and smiled well thats okay and seemed happy with that bless her she is my greataunt and shes corning with us look hen shes here in my charge and im not supposed to just let any of these old dears start wandering off she is not wandering off she is coming of her own free will back into the bosom of her family aye well thats what you say ah dont even know you are her great niece i supplied well look why dont we just ask her i think youll find shell confirm everything i say och come on shes not exactly the full shilling is she i beg your pardon my greataunt may appear a little confused on occasion but i suspect that much of what seems to be encroaching senility is simply the effect of having to subsist within the insufficiently stimulating environment which is all that you are able to provide despite what i am sure are your best efforts after some time spent with the many many people who love her and who are able to provide her with a more intense set of emotional and spiritual surroundings i should be most surprised indeed if she did not a show a marked improvement in that regard yeah sophi breathed at my side well said is thank you i said to her then turned back to the plump middleaged lady who had let us into the hall of the gloamings nursing home the lady had introduced herself as mrs johnson she wore a tight blue uniform like the one the young lass had worn the last time id been here two nights ago and unconvincing blonde hair now i said i would like to see my greataunt well you can see her ah canny stop ye seein her but ah havny had any notification shes supposed to be movin out mrs johnson said turning to walk towards the rear of the house she shook her head as we followed her ah dont know ye get told nuthin here nuthin greataunt zhobelia was in a room full of old ladies all perched on highseated chairs watching the television a large tray with tea things sat on a sideboard and many of the old dears zhobelia actually looked the youngest were sitting sipping cups of tea their bony fragile hands shakily clutching robust green china cups which rattled in their saucers zhobelia wore a voluminous bright red sari and a matching red hat in the style of a turban she looked bright and alert ah its you she said the instant she saw me she turned to one of the other old ladies and shouted see you silly old woman told you she was real a dream indeed then she looked back to me and put up one finger as though raising some point of order thought about it made up my mind decided to come for a holiday bags are packed she said and smiled widely mrs johnson sighed deeply a liontamer goodness gracious me said greataunt zhobelia from the back of sophis car as we headed crosscountry towards stirling im not really a liontamer mrs whit sophi said slapping me on the thigh with her left hand then laughing isis just tells people that because she thinks it sounds good im an assistant animal handler an estate worker and zookeeper really what no lions then greataunt zhobelia asked she was sitting sideways across the cars back seat her arm on the back of my seat her bags took up the rear footwells as well as the cars boot oh yes sophi said there are lions but we dont tame them or anything you dont tame them zhobelia said my that sounds worse you must be very brave nonsense sophi snorted yes she is greataunt i told her and dashing too oh stop it sophi said grinning do you have tigers at this safari park yes sophi said indian tigers a breeding pair and two cubs there used to be tigers in khalmakistan zhobelia told us not that i was there ever but we were told yes arent there any there any more i asked oh no zhobelia said i think we caught and killed them all long ago and sold their bits to the chinese they believe tiger bones and such are magic silly people thats a shame i said a shame i dont think so its their own fault they dont have to be silly good merchants though canny yes give them that things are worth what people will pay for them no more no less say what you like found that out all right i meant for the tigers zhobelia hmphed generous with your sympathy they used to eat us you know yes eat people she reached over and tapped sophi on the shoulder hoy miss sophi these tigers in this safari park next door to the farm they arent going to escape are they weve never had an escape sophi said in her most reassuring voice were not next door to the farm anyway a couple of miles away but no they arent going to escape ah well zhobelia said settling back in her seat i suppose i should not worry im as tough as old boots i am a tiger is not going to eat a shrivelledup old lady like me is it not when theres young ones about tender young things like you and isis eh she said thumping me on the shoulder and laughing loudly in my ear nice and juicy young things like you eh nice and tasty eh eh i turned and looked round at her she winked and said eh again and took out a handkerchief from somewhere in her sari to dab at her eyes sophi looked across at me grinning and raising her eyebrows i smiled content we met morag and ricky in the foyer of the same stirling hotel grandmother yolanda had stayed at i had called morag at her hotel in perth the night before after id rung sophi morag and ricky had checked in here for the night hey is morag said glancing at ricky who looked away embarrassed weve decided if you can get this all sorted out we would like to get married at the festival well come back after weve done all the scottish flumes sound cool i laughed and took her hands in mine it sounds wonderful i said congratulations i kissed her cheek and rickys he turned red and mumbled sophi and zhobelia offered their congratulations as well a bottle of champagne was ordered and a toast drunk there was still time to kill the full moon service would not take place until the evening ricky went off to check out the flumes at stirling swimming pool we four took tea greataunt zhobelia reminisced rambling through her memories like a gracious lady through a flourishing but overgrown and unkempt garden morag sat poised in jeans and a silk top twisting a gold chain on her wrist sophi chatted i dissembled nervous zhobelia said nothing to the others of the secrets she had revealed to me at the nursing home though whether this was because she was being discreet or just absentminded it was hard to say either seemed plausible ricky reappeared we had a late lunch in the restaurant greataunt zhobelia yawned and morag offered her the use of her and rickys room for a liedown which she accepted morag and ricky went off to the flumes sophi and i strolled through the town doing a bit of windowshopping and just taking the air walking round the base of the castle and through the strange old cemetery nearby under breezy blue skies and a damp wind looking west across the broad floodplain of the forth we could make out the trees surrounding the bend in the river where the woodbeans house and the community lay i tried not to feel too sick with nervousness we thought wed lost greataunt zhobelia for a few minutes arriving back at the hotel to find morag and ricky on the brink of telephoning the police because zhobelia was not in their room and nowhere else to be seen either then she appeared from the hotel kitchens accompanied by the chef chatting we took more tea i kept asking sophi the time the afternoon wore on zhobelia went back up to the room to watch a soap opera but returned a few minutes later saying it wasnt the same watching it without the old dears there and then it was time to go and we went greataunt zhobelia and i in sophis car morag and ricky in the white convertible ford escort it took less than ten minutes to arrive at the entrance to the high easter offerance estate chapter twenty eight we left the cars at the gates and walked down the shady drive my stomach felt huge and hollow resounding to the beat of my thudding heart want me to come along sophi asked just before we got to her house please i said okay then she said winking at me we helped greataunt zhobelia over the bridge across the forth she chuckled to see how dilapidated the bridge had become oh yes i think were safe from tigers here she laughed we walked slowly up the curving track to the buildings zhobelia nodded approvingly at the repointed orchard wall but tutted over the state of the grass on the lawn in front of the greenhouses and verbally scolded the two goats concerned which lay on the grass chewing the cud and looking at us with insolent unconcern the gate had been drawn across the arched gateway that led into the courtyard this was not uncommon when there was a big service taking place it occurred to me we might be better going round the long way anyway so we opened the door to the greenhouse and walked through zhobelia sniffed a few blooms on the way through and prodded the earth in the flower pots i got the impression she was looking for faults i rubbed my sweaty hands on my trousers a terrible thought occurred to me i let the others walk on a little way while i stopped with zhobelia who was looking at a complicated arrangement of hydroponic pipe work greataunt i said quietly yes dear i just thought did you ever mention that little book and the money and so on to anybody else she looked puzzled for a moment then shook her head oh no never she brought her head closer to mine and lowered her voice glad i mentioned it to you though oh yes been a burden off my back ill tell you best forgotten now if you ask me i sighed fine but my confidence was shaken if i hadnt thought of that until now what else might have escaped me well it was a little late to turn back now sophi ricky and cousin morag waited at the far end of the greenhouse i smiled at them then took zhobelias elbow gently in my hand come on greataunt yes lot of pipes arent there all very complicated yes i said all very complicated we exited the greenhouses humid mustily perfumed warmth beside the door i had crept out of on my way to burgle the office a few days earlier we continued round past the outhouses and some of the old buses and vans which had been converted into dormitories and extra greenhouses zhobelia tapped the bodywork of an old coach with her knuckles bit rusty she said sniffing yes greataunt i said choosing not to point out that the bodywork was aluminium we entered the courtyard from the north the sound of distant singingintongues was sweet and brought a lump to my throat i took a deep breath and looked in through the windows of the schoolroom as we headed for the main doors of the mansion house somebody was standing at the far end of the room drawing on the blackboard with coloured chalk it looked like sister angela the children were sat at their desks watching sister angela some had their hands up little flora sister gays eldest turned round and looked at me i waved she smiled broadly and waved then put up her hand and waved it urgently i heard her shouting out other small heads turned to look at us i walked to the main doors and held them open for greataunt zhobelia sophi ricky and cousin morag okay i asked morag she patted my arm fine you nervous i admitted the singing was very loud in the front hall swelling out of the meeting rooms closed double doors to our left sister angela opened the door on the other side of the hall she looked surprised she looked at ricky and morag then zhobelia her mouth opened sister angela i said ricky sister zhobelia i believe you know sister morag shall we i nodded into the classroom little angela eh said zhobelia as we trooped into the classroom i dont suppose you remember me do you ah not that well yes but ah children children angela shouted clapping her hands she introduced the others to them en masse and the dozen or so little ones dutifully said good evening across the hallway the sound of singingintongues gradually subsided and then ceased would you tell my grandfather that sister zhobelia would like to see him i asked angela she nodded then left the room zhobelia sat in the teachers chair have you all been good she asked the children a chorus of yeses came in return i took a piece of scrap paper from the pile on the teachers desk and wrote a number on it sister angela came back ahm she said seemingly uncertain whether to address me or zhobelia hell she was interrupted by grandfather coming into the room are you sure he said as he entered the room he was dressed in his best creamywhite robes he saw me and stopped looking more surprised than angry i nodded to him and pressed the little sheet of paper into his hand good day grandfather what he said looking round glancing down at the bit of paper and then staring at zhobelia she waved hello my dear grandfather started over to her zhobelia he said he looked at sophi and ricky and then stared at morag who was half sitting on the teachers desk arms folded i kept near grandfathers shoulder i think you should look at that bit of paper grandfather i said quietly what he looked back at me his face reddened as his expression turned from shock to anger i thought youd been told i put my hand on his arm no grandfather i said quietly and evenly everything has changed just look at the paper he scowled then did as i asked id written a number on the scrap of paper for a while i was worried that it was too subtle a way of getting through to him that too much time had passed and hed simply forgotten he stared down in silence at the number on the paper looking mystified damn i thought its just a string of numbers meaningless to him now what had i been thinking of he probably hadnt thought of that number in fortyfive years he certainly wouldnt have seen it is is you idiot the number my grandfather was looking at was his old army serial number eventually after what seemed like a long time to me and while i was still cursing myself for a damned fool and wondering how else i might get through to him his face changed and slowly lost that look of anger for a moment he visibly sagged as though deflated but then seemed to drag himself back upright even so his face seemed crumpled and he looked suddenly five years older i swallowed down a feeling of sickness and tried to ignore the tears pricking behind my eyes he stared at me with big bright eyes his face looked as white as his hair the sheet of paper dropped from his fingers i stooped and caught it then as he swayed took him by one arm and guided him back towards the desk morag moved away as he sat down on the edge staring at the floor breathing quickly and shallowly zhobelia patted grandfather on his other arm are you all right dear you dont look that well you know my weve got old havent we grandfather took her hand and squeezed it then looked up at me will you he said quietly then looked round at morag sophi and angela would you excuse me he stood he did not seem to notice my hand still supporting him he looked into my eyes for a moment a small frown on his face for all the world as though he had forgotten who i was and for another moment was terrified that he was going to have a heart attack or a stroke or something awful then he said would you come and pushed himself away from the desk i followed him he stopped at the door and looked back at the others ah excuse us please in the hall he stopped again and again seemed to pull himself upright perhaps we could take a turn round the garden isis he said the garden i said yes thats a good idea and so we walked in the garden in the lateevening sun my grandfather and i and i told him what i knew of his background and where i had found it though not what and who had led me there i showed him a copy id taken of the newspaper report and said that i had sent another one in a sealed envelope to yolanda to be kept by her lawyers he nodded once or twice a slightly distracted look on his face i told him too that allan had been deceiving all of us and that his lies would have to be dealt with grandfather did not seem very surprised or shocked by that at the far end of the formal garden there is a stone bench which looks down a steep grassy slope to the weeds rushes and mud of the river bank beyond the fields stretched to a distant line of trees with the hills and escarpment beyond under a sky patched with cloud my grandfather put his head in his hands for a moment and i thought he might be about to weep but he merely gave a single long sigh then sat there hands hanging over his knees head bowed staring at the path beneath us i let him do this for a while then tentatively put my arm over his shoulders i more than half expected him to flinch at my touch and throw off my arm and shout at me but he did not i did a bad thing once he said quietly flatly i did one bad thing isis one stupid thing i was a different man then a different man ive spent the rest of the time trying to trying to make up for it and i have i think i have he went on like this for a while i patted his back and made encouraging noises now and again i still worried in a distant kind of way that he might suffer some attack or seizure but mostly i was simply surprised at how unaffected i felt by all this and how cynical my attitude seemed to have become i did not comment on his claim that everything he had done since his crime had been to atone for it instead i let him talk on while i turned over in my mind again my choice between the destructive truth and the protective lie i felt like samson in the temple able to tear it down i thought of the children in the classroom with sister angela and wondered what right i had to bring the stones of our faith tumbling down on those innocent little heads well i supposed no more than i had the right to decide for them they should be brought up within a faith founded on a great lie perhaps i should just behave as everybody else seemed to behave here as elsewhere and settle the matter according to my own selfish interests except i could not even decide in which direction that would take me either part of me still wanted to take my revenge on the faith by shaking it to its very foundations to exercise the power the real power i knew i now possessed just by having discovered what i had and bring as much as possible of it crashing down about those who had wronged me leaving me to look on from outside from above at the resulting chaos ready to pick up the resulting pieces and rearrange them however i saw fit another part of me shrank from such apocalyptic dreams and just wanted everything to go back as much as was possible to the way it had been before all this had started though with a feeling of personal security based this time on knowledge and hidden authority not ignorance and blithe naivety another part of me just wanted to walk away from all of it but which to choose eventually my grandfather sat upright so he said gazing at the mansion house not me what is it you want isis i sat there on the cool stone feeling calm and clear and detached cold and still as though my heart was made of stone guess i said speaking from that coldness in my soul he glanced at me with hurt eyes and for a moment i felt both cruel and petty im not leaving he said quickly looking down at the gravel path at our feet it wouldnt be fair to everybody else they rely on me on my strength on my word we cant abandon them he glanced back to see how i was taking all this i didnt react he looked up at the sky now i can share you and i we can share the responsibility ive had to live with this he told me all these years had to live with it now its your turn to share that burden if you can i think i could cope i told him he glanced at me again well then thats settled we dont tell them he coughed for their own good of course and allan he asked still not looking at me the breeze brought the noise of birdsong across the lawn flower beds and gravel paths to us then took it away again i think it was he who put the vial of zhlonjiz in my bag i told him though he may have got somebody else to carry out the actual physical act it was certainly he who forged the letter from cousin morag he glanced at me forged she hasnt written for two months its true she wasnt going to come to the festival but the rest was all a fabrication i explained about the holiday morag and her manager had arranged which had only been postponed at the last minute i told him about allan lying about me to morag so that she would avoid both me and the community he has a portable phone does he grandfather asked when i got to that part he shook his head i knew he crept down there most nights he said sighing and wiping his nose with his handkerchief i thought it was a woman or maybe drugs or something he sat forward hunching over elbows on his knees he wound the handkerchief round and round in his hands i hear since ive been away hes been helping you with the revisions to the orthography i said he looked round at me but then could not hold my gaze and had to look away again tell me what changes has he inspired grandfather grandfather seemed physically to grope for words his hands waving in the air he he began we let me guess i said trying to keep the bitterness out of my voice you have heard god tell you that primogeniture is back that allan and not i should inherit the control of the order when you die i gave him time to answer but he did not choose to do so is that right i asked yes he said quietly something like that and leapyearians what of us where do we figure in this new regime to be respected he said still not looking back at me i heard him swallow but but without power he didnt speak but i saw him nod i sat there looking at his back for a while he was looking down at the handkerchief still winding it round and round in his hands i think that all has to be changed back dont you i said softly so thats your price is it he asked bitterly if you want to put it like that yes i said restoration grandfather my restoration thats what i want he looked back angry again i cant just he began his voice raised but again he could not maintain his gaze and looked away from me his words dying on his lips i think grandfather i said slowly and softly if you listen hard enough for the voice of god you may well hear it tell you something which could have the desired effect dont you he sat for a while then looked round his eyes moist i am not a charlatan he said and indeed sounded genuinely hurt i know what i felt what i heard back then back at the start its just since then i nodded slowly for a few moments wondering what to say about zhobelias visions eventually i said i didnt accuse you of being a charlatan he looked away again went back to winding the handkerchief round his fingers for a moment then stopped made an angry noise and stuffed the hanky back in a pocket what do you want of allan i told him what i wanted he nodded well he said and sounded relieved well have to put that to him wont we i think we ought to i agreed your brother has ideas you know he said sounding regretful what like asking our followers for money not just that he has a vision for the order for the faith according to him we have to move ahead into the next century we have the opportunity to build upon what we have here to evangelise and expand and learn from other cults send out more aggressive missions build up bases overseas almost like franchises in europe america the third world we could go into the specialist food market and capitalise on his voice trailed off as i slowly shook my head no i said i dont think so grandfather he opened his mouth as though he was going to argue then his head dropped his shoulders rose and fell as he sighed well he said and that was all he shook his head have those the begging letters gone out yet i asked not trying to keep the contempt out of my voice he glanced at me not yet he said sounding tired we were going to wait and see who turned up for the festival approach them personally if possible good i dont think we should do any approaching of that nature or send the letters do you he hunched over his knees again i suppose it isnt necessary any more good i said im afraid i wont be taking a fully active part in the festival of love either not that i need to morag and ricky will be getting married at the festival i dont feel ready for that myself yet i dont know that ill ever feel ready for that well see i paused then continued im sorry he seemed not to have heard me then just shrugged and shook his head whatever you want he said quietly good i said and felt a strange hard elation course through me so i said putting my hands on my knees shall we head back yes he said standing when i stood in the skies above us a lark trilled well go to the library and call allan to us there i said see which way hes going to jump all right all right he said his voice flat good i started down the path then became aware that he wasnt following me i turned and found him looking at me with a strange halfsmile on his lips yes grandfather i said he nodded as though to himself and his eyes narrowed i felt a twinge of fear thinking that perhaps he was taking this all too calmly and that he was about to break down to shout and scream or even to try to attack me physically i tensed ready to run his smile widened and his gaze roved over my face as though he was only now really seeing me for the first time with what might have been admiration in his voice he said aye he nodded again aye youre my grandchild all right arent you we looked into each others eyes for a moment then i smiled and held out my arm he hesitated then took it and we walked slowly arminarm back to the house chapter twenty nine what allan shouted confession i said calmly or exile i want you to stand in front of everyone this evening and confess you tricked them and manipulated them lied about me lied to me lied to morag lied to our founder lied to everybody well fuck you little sister allan roared storming away from where i stood by the windows with morag sophi and ricky and striding from one end of the library to the other his splayed hand tearing through his hair he turned and whirled round by grandfathers seat grandfather was sitting in a chair by the closed door to the hall zhobelia was still in the schoolroom talking to the children the meeting for the full moon service was still in abeyance calli was reading from the orthography while we had our conclave in the library next door to the schoolroom i felt good here surrounded by the books and their lingering musty smell allan dropped to his knees in front of our grandfather and put his hands on the arms of his chair shaking it salvador founder grandfather he shouted dont let her do this cant you see what shes up to grandfather shook his head and looked away he muttered something but i didnt catch what it was allan threw himself back up and came striding towards me one fist clenched and raised by his shoulder ricky who had apparently accepted that allan was the bad un in all this growled and stepped forward allan stopped a few paces away he was dressed in grey robes of a similar cut to grandfathers i looked my brother in the eye keeping my expression neutral and my voice steady i want you to admit you took the zhlonjiz and put it in my kitbag allan i continued and youll admit youve been using a portable phone here in the heart of the community to arrange all your lies and deceptions and manipulate people like morag and uncle mo ha allan said laughing i will will i and thats all is it no i said i also want you to confess you lied about my attempting to seduce grandfather and that you tried to influence him and the revisions of the orthography for your own selfish political purposes youre mad he exclaimed his voice rising in pitch he looked round all of us his eyes wide his face shining with sweat his chest heaving in and out he laughed again shes mad he told sophi morag and ricky he turned back and looked at salvador who was gazing at his grandson now shes mad shes fucking mad im telling you do you hear what shes saying i mean are you listening to all this do you deny any of it salvador asked coldly all of it allan yelled spinning round to glare at me i looked slowly at morag who was standing at my side she was frowning at allan her arms folded allan looked from morags face to mine and then back he blinked rapidly perhaps grandfather i said youd like to ask my brother for the key to his desk in the office it was on the chain round his neck last time i saw it well allan grandfather said allan turned round to face our grandfather again look he said and took a deep breath he gave a small nervous laugh look all right i have got the phone yes i mean big deal big fucking deal ive used it for everybodys good everybodys plus its there for emergencies and yes all right there might have been some crossed lines with the letters from morag but grandad i found myself striding down the room to him he must have heard me coming he turned round and my forearms thudded into his chest as i gathered two balls of material from his robes into my fists my momentum carried him two tottering steps backwards until his shoulders thumped into the library door just to the side of where grandfather sat i glared up into allans face his eyes were wide his breath rushed out of his open mouth and struck my face i pressed into him my whole body quivering with rage listen brother i hissed grasping his robes tighter and shaking him i dont think youve really understood the situation i know what youve been doing i know what your plans were and now so does grandfather everything im doing now and everything im saying now has grandfathers authority everything is that right grandfather i said without looking at him i watched allans eyes tear their gaze away from mine to look imploringly down and to the side quietly our grandfather said yes thats right isis allans gaze swung back to me i could see sweat on his top lip now his eyes looked very big is it starting to register now big brother i asked its every damn thing i say or nothing theres no negotiations no talks no compromises no deals you just do exactly as i say exactly as grandfather says or youre out i pushed him back against the door banging his head off the wood understand i shook him again i think i was trying to lift him off his feet but he was too heavy for me it was only my anger and his surprise that was letting me pin him here at all he stared into my eyes he looked pale his breath smelled of mint he swallowed i felt him bring his hands up to mine trying to free his robes from my grip hey is he said his voice small and shaky come on youre taking this kind of hard arent you i mean you piece of shit i said the rage shining like a white star inside me you tried to destroy my life here you want to pervert everything this communitys stood for and youve lied to every single one of us all for your own slimy ends and you think im going to take it as a joke i let go with one hand but just to pull down on his robes with the other fist so that my free hand could grip the chain with the key on it i pulled the chain off he yelped as it parted somewhere behind his head i stepped back and he stood there rubbing his neck and glaring at me muscles quivered at the hinges of his jaw beneath his ears well heres the joke allan i said feeling a tingling in my eyes and hearing a high keening noise in my ears i weighed the key and its chain in my fist either you confess in public now to everything or youre out brother forever with nothing because if you dont tell everybody everything we grandfather and i will well take your phone and well have the office searched your rooms searched well have the whole damn place searched plus well be there at the bank in stirling first thing tomorrow just in case you were thinking of making off with any funds you know i think all that kind of makes your position whats the word untenable thats the sort of corporatespeak you understand isnt it brother allan put shaking hands to his chest and smoothed his robes back down he looked again at salvador who was sitting with his hands on his knees his head down grandfather allan said and sounded like he might be about to cry what about the new revelations for the orthography the ones we were going to reveal down the drain brother i told him like the rest of your plans he ignored me grandfather he said again shes gone crazy he said with another nervous laugh you arent going to let oh for gods sake boy grandfather bellowed not looking up still his voice filled the room even i jumped the effect on allan was more dramatic he staggered and shivered as if run through grandfather looked slowly up and round at my brother just do he said what she says he shook his head briefly dont protract this he muttered he looked down again allan stared down at our grandfather then looked back up to me his eyes were staring his face white his mouth worked for a moment before any noise came out and what he said hoarsely then stopped to swallow a couple of times and what would you leave me with if i if i did agree to to this ridiculous confession i breathed deeply in and out i looked at grandfather for a moment so you can have most of what you have at the moment allan i told him well most of what we all thought you had i think a penitential pilgrimage to luskentyre might be in order but when you come back you can have control of the daytoday administration of the farm as youve had before of course from now on id want full access at any time i want it to all the books and accounts to everything in fact most importantly ill want to sign all the cheques and authorise any expenditure but thats more than grandfather does allan protested i know allan i said but its what i want i paused while you look after the farm i shall be taking over the daytoday running of the community and the order grandfathers position will not change in that he remains our founder and our overseer equally there will be no need for him to be troubled by all the details youve been looking after until now ill supervise that aspect of our affairs and i think well have to make it clear to everybody in the community that theyre accountable to the founder and to me i shrugged and perhaps to a more formal structure like an elected board or committee well have to think about that ill be asking everyone for suggestions youll be welcome to contribute after you return from your pilgrimage allan looked almost comical now he opened and closed his mouth and blinked trying to take all this in he gave one last despairing glance down at our grandfather grandad he said voice faltering grandfather continued to look at the floor whatever beloved isis wishes he said quietly allan stared at the older man i turned towards the windows ricky looked bored morag still had her arms crossed she was frowning but gave me a small smile sophi looked half terrified but then when i winked at her broke into a relieved if nervous smile i turned back allan brought his arms up from his sides until they were straight out and level his face still white his eyes still huge his voice seemed to come from somewhere a long way away whatever you say he breathed i sat on the small wooden chair on the podium looking out over a meeting room full of astonished faces my brother kneeled before me he put the basin full of warm water to one side accepted the towel from my grandfather and began to dry my feet allans face was still wet after weeping during his confession which grandfather had announced his admission of guilt had been brief but comprehensive i didnt think hed left anything out it had been greeted with utter silence and then when it was over with a rising tumult of noise that had taken all my grandfathers authority and volume to quieten again grandfather had asked for silence once more while the ceremony that had been unjustly neglected on my return a few days earlier was belatedly carried out now then asked morag to bring forward the bowl of water and the towel there were a few gasps when she walked forward from the back of the meeting room soon hushed by a scowl from grandfather as my brother dried my feet in the stunned silence fresh tears fell from his eyes extending his task by a few seconds soon it was over though and after allan had gone to sit in the body of the kirk again and i had risen to stand barefooted at the lectern my grandfather called once again for quiet then left the podium to me and sat in the front row of the pews there were more gasps of astonishment and mutterings at this unprecedented action i waited for them to pass when they did i looked out over my people and smiled i gripped the smooth polished wood of the podium and felt the hard surface beneath the papery softness of my skin suddenly i remembered the way the fox had felt in my hands when i had lifted it from the field all those years ago that tiny feathery hint of a beat there as soon as id picked it up i had always been unsure whether it had been my own pulse id been feeling or the animals and then beyond that if it had indeed been the foxs heartbeat id sensed uncertain whether the animal had simply lain there unconscious until wed come along and allan had poked it with his stick or whether it really had been dead and my gift working at a distance without touching doubly miraculously had brought it back to life was my gift real was it genuine could i be certain all these questions or that one question in those different guises had come to depend in my mind on the precise physical state of that small wild animal that summers day with allan in the stalkstubbled field when i had been a child i had never known the answer for a time i had thought that i might come to know it but now i could accept that i never would and in that acceptance found a liberating realisation that it didnt really matter here was what mattered here looking out over these stunned bewildered awed even fearful faces here was action at a distance here was palpable power here was where belief selfbelief and shared belief could truly signify truth i thought truth there is no higher power it is the ultimate name we give our maker i took a deep breath and an abrupt fleeting dizziness shook me energising and intoxicating and leaving me feeling strong and calm and able and without fear i cleared my throat i have a story to tell you i said end
