christian cameron tyrant bc the sky above the dust was blue in the distance far out over the plain mountains rose in purple and lavender the most distant capped red by the setting sun up there in the aether all was peace an eagle best of omens turned a lazy circle to his right closer less auspicious birds circled kineas felt that as long as he kept his attention on the realms of the heavens he would be safe from his fear the gods had always spoken to him awake in omens and asleep in rich dreams he needed the gods today noise and motion to his right distracted him and his eyes flicked down from the safety of the empty spaces to the banks of the pinarus river the flat plain the scrub the beach the sea and directly in front of him separated only by the width of the river waited thirty thousand persian horsemen their files so thick that they had raised a sand cloud so deep that their rear ranks were visible over the cloud on the lower slopes of a distant hill across the pinarus his stomach clenched and rolled he farted and grimaced in embarrassment niceas his hyperetes gave a grunt that might have been a laugh look out kineas he said pointing to the right its the boss horsemen a troop of twenty or so their cloaks flashing with gold ornament their chargers heavy and magnificent cantered along the plain toward the edge of the beach where the allied cavalry waited for their doom only one was bareheaded his blond curls as bright as the gold gorgons head that pinned his purple cloak his horse covered in a leopards skin he led them across the hardpacked sand to the general of the left parmenio just half a stade away parmenio shook his head and gestured at the hordes of persian cavalry and the blond curls shook with laughter the blond shouted something lost on the wind and the thessalians in parmenios bodyguard roared and shouted his name alexander alexander and then he cantered back along the beach until he reached the allied cavalry six hundred horsemen all alone to the front of the left wing despite himself kineas smiled as the blond rode towards him behind him the men of the allied cavalry began to cheer alexander alexander it made no sense few of them came from cities with any reason to love alexander alexander rode to the front right of the allied cavalry and raised his fist they bellowed for him he smiled exhilarated beamed at their approval theres the great king men of greece and at the end of this day we will be masters of asia and he will be nothing remember darius and xerxes remember the temples of athens now hellenes now for revenge and he rode easily his back straight his purple cloak rippling in the breeze every inch a king cantering across the front of the cavalry stopping to say this to one that to another kineas our athenian he called kineas saluted raising his heavy machaira across his breastplate alexander paused holding his horse with his knees a horse that was a good two hands taller than kineass and worth a hundred gold darics he seemed to notice the great host of persian cavalry for the first time so few athenians with me today kineas be worthy of your city he squared his shoulders and his horse sprang forward as he crossed the front the cheers began again first the allied horse and then the thessalians and then along the plain to the phalanxes alexander he stopped to talk again motioned with his arms his head thrown back in the laughter that every man in the army knew alexander and then he was riding faster releasing his white horse into a gallop with his escort streaming behind him like the cloak around his neck and every man in the army was screaming it alexander parmenio grunted dismissively and rode over he motioned for the allied hipparch and his officers to join him he too gestured at the mass of persians too deep too packed together let them get to the edge of the stream and charge all we have to do is hold until the boy does the work kineas was younger than the boy and he wasnt sure that he would hold his food down much less stop thousands of medes from pouring over the plain then forcing their way into the flanks of the phalanx he was excruciatingly conscious that he was here as a commander of a hundred horsemen because his father was very rich and very unpopular for his support of alexander and through no merits of his own the attican horsemen behind him included a number of his boyhood friends he feared he was going to lead them to their deaths diodorus and agis laertes and graccus and kleisthenes and demetrios all the boys who had played at being hippeis while their fathers made the laws and sold their cargos parmenios voice snapped him back into the present you understand me gentlemen his macedonian greek grated even after a year of hearing it the instant they reach midstream you hit them kineas rode back to the head of his squadron almost unable to control his horse anxiety and anticipation by turns wasted and intoxicated him he wanted it to be now he wanted it to be over niceas spat as he rode up were being sacrificed he said fingering the cheap charm he wore around his neck the boy king doesnt want to lose any of his precious thessalians and were just rotten greeks anyway kineas gestured at his troop slave to bring him water he caught diodoruss eye and the tall redhaired boy winked he was not afraid he looked like a young god and beside him agis was singing an ode to athena he knew all the great poems by heart laertes tossed his throwing spear in the air and caught it with a flourish making his mount shy and graccus smacked him in the side of the helmet to get his horse back in line the troop slave brought him water and his hands shook as he drank it far away to the right there were shouts a long cheer and the sound of greek voices singing the paean that could be either side plenty of greeks over there probably more athenians with the great king than with alexander kineas looked to his front tried to put his mind back in the aether but the macedonian phalanxes were moving to his right shaking the ground more a disturbance to be felt than anything he could see through the haze of dust they raised with their first steps the battle haze the poet spoke of it and now kineas could see it it was terrifying and grand at the same time and it rose to heaven like a sacrifice or a funeral pyre but he couldnt get his mind above the dust and into the blue he was right there on the beach and the persians were coming and despite the shaking of his hands his mind followed the actions of the battle he could see the macedonion taxeis in the centre moving through their clouds of dust he could hear the shouts as the king moved the companions forward and he felt the battle through all his senses as it flowed up the distant ridge and the crash came as the centre engaged the great kings greeks standing like a wall against macedons pikes the persians to kineass front took their time kineas was able to watch the phalanx roll into the riverbed and struggle to cross the gravel and climb the bank on the other side time to watch the greeks and the persian infantry meet them at the top of the bank and stop them cold dead men falling back down the steep banks to trip the men in the next rank as they climbed cheers on the wind from farther to the right eyes front said niceas he kissed his charm just a stade ahead of him a single persian rider trotted into the stream and began to pick his way across he waved and shouted and the mass of perisan cavalry moved slowly down the shallow bank and into the pinarus river phillip kontos the macedonian noble who commanded the allied cavalry raised a hand in the air kineass whole body gave a great shake and his horse shied a step and then another his tension communicated to the beast through his knees hed faced persian cavalry just once before he knew they could ride better than most greeks and that their horses were larger and fiercer he prayed to athena niceas started to sing the paean in five words every man in the front rank had caught it up the volume of sound swelling and spreading like flame in an autumn field a fire of song that sent sparks shooting across to the thessalians behind them the persian cavalry was at midstream a solid front of horsemen kontos dropped his hand the allied cavalry began to walk forward the horses excited heads up tails lashing kineas transferred his light javelin from his bridle hand determined to perform a feat of arms he had practised for five years to throw his first javelin and fight with his second all at the gallop he measured the ground to the front of the persian cavalry the mass of greek cavalry began to move faster through a trot and into a canter the paean shredding away as the hooves of the horses pounded out the sound kineass mount left the sand and started down the shallow gravel bank of the pinarus he clenched his fist signalling the charge and niceass trumpet rang out he was done being an officer now he would be a warrior the wall of medes in front filled his eyes and the tension in his shoulders and his gut fell away his mares head stretched out with her stride reaching a gallop he jammed his knees and thighs like a clamp on her back and rose his back straight and flung his javelin at the closest persian and his weapon hand travelled down following through grabbing his second javelin and bringing it up as his horses hooves bit into the water of the stream and she collided almost head on with the mount of the man hed killed his javelin through the mans body his little mare like an equine javelin knocking the larger persian horse down into the water its hooves flailing a blow against his unshielded left side connected with his helmet and his arms pain kineas lunged at a big man with a red beard swinging the head of his fighting spear like a long club parried and his own spear broke at the impact the bronze head cutting the persians cheek as they passed so close that their knees touched and red beard was now behind him and he was unarmed his horse was up to her knees in the water her momentum spent and one of the persian horses slammed into her chest to chest and head to head so that both beasts rose out of the water like duelling personifications of the river god droplets a fountain of fire in the sun the persian stallions rider lunged with his spear and kineas twisted away and lost his seat in an instant he was under the water the riot of sound cut off in a beat of his heart kineas had his feet under him despite the weight of his armour and his sword found its way into his hand as his head returned to the air and the din his mare was gone pushed aside by the bigger persian horse above him towered a huge grey kineas hacked at the riders leg a clear blow blood blew from the wound and then the rider was in the water and kineas was scrambling to mount one hand locked in the greys long blond mane the other with a death grip on the hilt of his sword the water dragging at his legs and his heavy breastplate pressing him down at every attempt to mount a weapon rang off his helmet turning it so that he was blind a blade scored across his upper arm scraped across the bronze of his cuirass and then bit into his bridle arm the grey startled bolted forward and dragged him out of the stream and up the bank he had so recently left hanging from her mane which panicked her so that she tossed her mighty head luck and the strength of her neck dragged him a hands breadth higher than his best effort had reached before so that he got a knee over her broad back another horse rammed into his side the blessing of the goddess as the new opponent served to push him up on to his new mounts back although the stallions teeth wreaked a toll on the bare flesh of his thigh he struck out blindly across his own body with his sword and it bit into flesh with his bridle hand he ripped the helmet clear of his head and flung it at the enemy he could now see with his sword hand he cut again this time with intent and his man was down kineas couldnt reach the reins his knees were locked on the big mares back but he couldnt get her turned and his back was to the enemy his breastplate a sure sign that he was a hellene and an enemy he couldnt even see another greek he cut at a man coming behind him with a levelled spear and missed completely almost losing his seat again but the man with the spear rode by reckless or hopeless kineas leaned out across his new mounts neck and grabbed at the dangling reins again missed again had them too hard a pull and his mount was backing rearing then down on four feet he turned into the stream and cut at a persian the man shied kineas thumped his heels into the flanks of his horse and she moved deeper into the stream bit savagely at a stallion in her path while kineas killed his rider pushed further forward into the mass of persians and then he was on gravel across the stream pressed into a mass of enemies who could neither advance nor retreat because of their numbers he was an evil surprise to them pressed so close that their javelins were useless and even his sword was too long and his arm burned with effort every time he raised it he was deep in their formation he didnt think or plan he hacked and hacked and when the heavy sword was wrenched from his hand by the weight of a victim and the fatigue of his hand he took his dagger from his belt pressing his next enemy close so that he could smell the cardamom on the mans breath as he rammed his dagger into his armpit he hugged his victim to him like a tired wrestler and the body was struck a mighty blow that rocked him back on his mount he let go and the body fell between the horses a javelin hit kineas at the edge of his breastplate the head punching into the sinew of his neck muscles before falling free he tried to parry another blow but his left hand wouldnt obey and the man struck his cuirass with a sword so that it bruised his side and then his horse pushed ahead and the man was gone he was at the top of the bank he had crossed the river and he felt as unafraid as if his spirit was high in the aether or already on the road to elysium detached aware in the last instants of his life that he was alone in the midst of his enemies wounded ten times the instants stretched this is how the gods feel time and he was not dead or perhaps he was he could only see as if down a long hall so that it was difficult for him to feel threatened by the persian he could see at the end of the tunnel in his head he wanted to shout back across the minutes to the boy who had started the charge we will be a hero you and i the thought made him smile and then the tunnel spun and he felt a great blow on his back sharp pain biting on his neck and heels he didnt know until later that his boyhood friends diodorus and laertes stood over his body like ajax and odysseus and kept the persians off until the battle was won he didnt know until later that his action had broken the persian cavalry he recovered quickly but not quickly enough to wear the wreath of laurel that alexander awarded him as the bravest of the allies or to hear his name cheered by the army the wreath was pressed between boards of cedar in his baggage two years later another pair of cedar boards was pushed in beside it pressing another wreath one that cost him a scar five hands long down his right leg he learned about war about how much pain his body could endure about cold and heat discomfort desease friendship and ambition and betrayal at guagemala he learned that he had a gift for seeing the battlefield as an organic whole the way a physician might see a body diagnosing its ills and proposing remedies he read the persians well enough to save his part of the front when the persians pressed close and all seemed lost and again he took a wound that put him down a prostitute saved him from an ugly death on the battlefield and he kept her for a while and then a while longer and then they pursued the great king to ectabana where barbarian traitors brought the great kings head to alexander in a sack and the army knew that asia was theirs and theirs alone ectabana smelled of smoke and apples the smoke came from the campfires as the whole army of conquest concentrated there after the death of darius the apples were everywhere brought for the pleasure of the great king and taken as spoil by the first units that came up the passes for the rest of his life kineas loved the smell of apples and freshpressed cider kineas was one of the first and because of it there were another hundred gold darics in his baggage he had a fine sword with a gold handle and he lay on a couch his lemans breast under his hand drinking cider from a silver cup like a gentleman instead of standing by a campfire drinking it from clay or horn like ten thousand other hellenes his woman wore a perfume that had come out of the palace a scent that caught in his throat like the woodsmoke he was happy they all were they had beaten the greatest empire in the world and nothing could ever stop them kineas never forgot the feeling of that night the smell of smoke and apples and her perfume like a tangible nike lying in his arms and then his boyhood friend diodorus who had ridden with him from issus to ectabana an athenian gentleman with a mind like a fox and red hair to match it came in from his stint on guard duty drank his cider and said they were going home the war of the hellenes is at its end alexander said he sat on an ivory chair and wore a diadem kineas loved to follow alexander but the chair and the diadem made him look like a stage tyrant he stood impassively with the other allied officers if alexander meant to impress them his words fell flat you have served the league brilliantly there is a reward here for every one of you if any of your men choose to stay they will be enrolled with the mercenaries alexander raised his eyes from the sacks of coins on the ground by his chair he had heavy circles under his eyes from drinking but the spark was still there dancing away as if something inside his head was on fire kineas wondered for an instant if there had been a mistake in phrasing if he too would be welcome to remain and conquer the rest of the world and then alexanders eyes met his and he read his dismissal the officers were to go home alexander spoke on ringing phrases of praise rendered empty by the bags of gold at his feet im done with you go he lingered by the door of the kings tent when the other allied officers filed out hoping for a kind word an exception but alexander rose without another glance and left by another door so kineas wondered if alexander knew how much political poison smouldered among his precious macedonians but he clutched his thoughts close he kept his own counsel when his leman left him for a macedonian cavalry officer one of many phillips rather than travel home with him and he was laconic when a deputation of his men came to him and asked him to remain and command them some suggested that they remain together and take service with alexanders regent in macedon antipater kineas had no interest in serving antipater in a day he had realized that he had loved alexander not macedon he packed up his darics and his wreaths sold most of his booty retained some fine cups for friends in athens and a wall hanging for his mother he kept the sword and the heavy grey horse and his stained cavalry cloak and prepared to be a rich farmer he had been away for six years he would return a wealthy man take a wife the athenians went with him kleisthenes and demetrios were rotting in the ground or walking in the groves of elysium but laertes and agis and gracus and diodorus had survived battle and disease and misery and hardship and niceas nothing could kill niceas they rode towards home together and no bandit dared ambush their convoy when they reached amphilopolis on the greek mainland none of the other young men were ready to press on they lingered in the wineshops kineas hurried home he found that he neednt have hurried in attica he found that his father was dead and that he himself had been exiled for serving alexander he fled north to platea where there was a community of athenian exiles hed only been there a day when he was approached by an athenian with a proposition of course the man came from the same faction that had arranged his exile but kineas had grown up with athenian politics so he smiled and negotiated and that night he sent diodorus a letter and another to a friend of his fathers another exile on the euxine part i the shield of achilles therein fashioned he also two cities of mortal men exceeding fair in the one there were marriages and feastings and by the light of the blazing torches they were leading the brides from their bowers through the city and loud rose the bridal song and young men were whirling in the dance and in their midst flutes and lyres sounded continually but around the other city lay in leaguer two hosts of warriors gleaming in armour and twofold plans found favour with them either to lay waste the town or to divide in portions twain all the substance that the lovely city contained within iliad book the same squall that broached the pentekonter knocking her flat against the waves and filling her sail with water swamped the smaller trading ship to the south the smaller traders cargo shifted and she sank the screams of her crew carried clear on the wind the pentekonter lay broached the standing sail a testimony to the inexperience of her trierarch and the unshifting cargo a tribute to her sailing masters skill the ship should have gone down anyway lost on the euxine with all hands except that the sailing master hurled himself over the side at the mast taking a bronze knife from a sheath around his neck and sawing at the lashings that held the sail to the yard under the awning in the stern the trierarch lay in horrified paralysis against the stem unable to cope with the consequence of his disastrous decision to leave the mast stepped the chaos on the rowing benches was as immediate a crisis as the sodden sail the trierarch had ordered the rowers to set the sweeps just before the squall hit vainly trying to use the oars to keep her head before the wind and when the ship broached the winddriven water had forced the long wooden shafts back in through the tholes ripping them from the rowers hands and crushing heads and ribcages two men were dead one of them the oar master the ships only passenger a gentleman from athens had also lost his feet when the ship tipped but not his head he threw himself up grabbing at the other side of the ship as it curved away from the stem above him getting his feet under him a glance showed him that the cargo had not shifted another that the oarsmen were panicking hard in there he bellowed oarsmen larboard side his voice carried over the wind of the dying squall with ease the habit of command and the expectation of obedience as strong as the sound itself every man in the waist who had any command of himself obeyed men scrambling over each other in the rising water to grasp the side that was still out of the water the sailing master cut the sail free the passenger could feel the weight change felt the deck move through a tiny arc towards an even keel he flung himself over the gunwale hanging by his arms with his whole weight outboard and a few of the oarsmen copied him adding their weight to his the water in the waist shifted the starboard gunwale rose above the surface and the sailing master kicked himself clear of the sail and swam to the bow he swims shouted the sailors and the oarsmen to whom the ship was a man every sign of success rallied more men amidships bail shouted the passenger two of the veteran oarsmen already had the olivetree pump rigged and water began to spurt over the side like arterial blood other men used helmets pots anything that came to their hands by the time the passenger hauled himself inboard the benches were no longer awash the sailing masters attention was on the sea beyond him another gust and were dead i have to get the bow up to the wind he said with a murderous glance at the trierarch he shouted orders at the oarsmen and the sailors who began to cut the mast itself away one of the seams in the larboard side had opened when the ship broached water was coming in with every wave and a crosswave with the impetus of the wind behind it flooded the waist again over the benches the lack of an oar master told the oarsmen hesitated their hope destroyed by the second wave the passenger flung himself into the waist taking his own helmet from his baggage in the stern as he passed and scooped water over the side bail he ordered and then as men turned to the task he started pushing men to their benches he didnt know their names or where they belonged but the force of his will was sufficient to move them a long minute was wasted dragging unbroken oars from the larboard side across to the starboard and feeding them into the tholes and still the ship swam at the first hesitant pull to the passengers ringing shout the ship moved a fraction of its own length pull he bellowed again taking his timing from a bandyarmed professional on the bench under his feet only six oars a side in the water the ship full of water and her bottom filthy with weed and again the ship barely moved he sloshed to another bench pushed two frightened men down on to it and put the oar in their hands opposite there was a corpse filling the bench he lifted the corpse heavy beyond anything he could remember and another pair of hands helped him fling his burden clear of the side even as he called pull again the oar shaft free of the corpse moved like a live thing and struck him a glancing blow in the shoulder that knocked him on to the bench the man who had helped him caught it lifted it clear of the water and sat on the bench in one continuous motion the passenger caught it on the return stroke added his strength and called pull as the oar reached the top of the stroke around the shaft went and down the blade biting the water firmly the oar felt alive under his hands he raised his head and saw the sailing master aft standing by the steering oar he caught his eye and the sailing master took up the call for the stroke leaving the passenger to pull his smooth wet hands already feeling the weight of the oar pull called the sailing master the fourth stroke or the fifth and the man at the steering oar called he steers and the sailing master gave him an order then came an hour of physical hell for the passenger without the rush of overwhelming danger just the pain in his shoulders and the sight of his hands turning to bloody pulp as he pulled on and on water rising around his feet and then his thighs another squall hit them and then another they made no distance indeed the sail was visible to starboard with every rise of the waves all the oars could do was keep the head of the waterlogged vessel up to the wind so that no wave could poop her they did all that men could do and they prayed to the gods and just when the oarsmen were flagging and the heaves to keep her bow up to the wind were increasingly desperate just when the second larboard oar caught a crab that threatened to endanger the stroke the wind dropped and before the passenger could look again at the ruin of his hands the sun appeared between clouds and then the clouds themselves were rarer and then they were rising and falling in the swell of a sunny day on the euxine and they were alive it was only when the wind fell off that the passenger could hear the thin cries from starboard over the rail where some poor soul was struggling with the sea rowed of all shouted the sailing master his voice as raw as the passengers hands he was not used to calling the stroke for so long the oars were tossed and pulled in a ragged motion but an efficient one so that they crossed the benches and tucked their handgrips under the opposite thwart their blades held clear of the water the passengers bench mate fell forward on the headrest thus provided his arms over the oars his cheek against their shafts he breathed in and out the passenger heard another cry from starboard he pulled himself from under the crossed oar shafts the residual salt water burning his hands like fire his bench mate looked up at him and smiled well pulled mate theres a man in the water the passenger replied pulling himself up on an empty starboard bench the hold beneath their feet was undecked and there was water over most of the cargo they were still barely afloat the sailing master was seeing to it he had the sailors the deck crew throwing bodies and anything else he deemed of no use over the side every minute lightened the ship placed the thwarts a fraction higher out of the water the passenger looked under his hand at the empty blue sea the sun reflecting with blinding intensity from the wavelets and listened for another cry when he heard it it was closer than he had expected a man swimming weakly but still afloat just a ropes length from the bow he dove before he thought the action through and swam as best he could through the now smaller waves the salt water chilling him and burning his hands all over again he reached the survivor quickly but the man tried to fight him surprised at the touch and fearing perhaps that poseidon had come for him at last the passenger shouted at him took his long hair in a fist and began to pull him towards the ship the mans struggles endangered them both but he took in a lungful of water and his struggles ended the passenger got him to the side he was surprised at the hesitancy of the oarsmen to pull the man inboard but they did the man lay across an empty bench alternating breathing and vomiting for a long time the passenger came aboard helped by more willing hands to see the leather bag that held his armour and most of his tack being lifted towards the side slow from the seas grip he was still fast enough to get himself between the ships side and his baggage dont he gasped everything own the sailing master stripped the bag from his crewmans hands and tossed it on the deck with a bronze clang we owe ye that much he rasped he pointed his chin at the longhaired man puking over a bench in the waist they dont like him sailors dont take the prey from poseidon shipwrecked men he left his thought unfinished probably too superstitious to speak the belief aloud the passenger was athenian he had different views on poseidon lord of horses and his prey ill look after him well need every man on the benches to get this boat on to a beach the sailing master muttered something under his breath a prayer or a curse the passenger went back to his bench it was only when he had wiped the longhaired mans face clean of vomit and heard a gasp of lakedaemianaccented thanks that he realized that the trierarch was no longer aboard they bailed and rowed all day until they were once again in sight of the land to starboard this shore of the euxine was notorious for its lack of beaches just endless rock alternating with ugly low marsh the sailing master didnt try to force the men to get the ship ashore despite the slow bleeding of seawater from the open seam they ate dried fish sodden with salt water and felt better for it they slept in watches even the passenger and pumped and bailed through the night and the sun rose the next day to more of the same breakfast was skimpier than dinner small trading ships beached at night and carried little in the way of provisions the amphorae of fresh water were point down in the sand of the hold and most of their waxed caps were open showing their empty innards to the blue sky the passenger had no idea of the distance to their next port but he had the sense not to discuss it by midday the rescued man was better bailing with a will he was careful when he moved and quiet obviously aware of his unwelcome status with the sailors and the oarsmen clearly intent on earning a place by hard work the fact that he was repeatedly seasick whenever the swell increased didnt help him he was a landsman and he didnt belong on the sea he too had smooth hands and had never pulled an oar and he had spartan written on his head in every curling hair the passenger arranged to take his turn at the pump with the stranger he had to do most of the work the spartan was weak from seasickness and ordeal and nearing the point of allowing events to overwhelm him im kineas he said on the upstroke of the pump of athens honesty forced him to add until recently the spartan was silent on the downstroke putting all of his strength into it philokles he gasped of mytilene gods of nowhere he gasped again as the pump handle went up kineas pushed down save your strength he said i can pump just move your arms the younger mans blood rushed to his face i can pump he retorted do i look like a slave not to honour my obligation to you suit yourself said kineas they pumped while the sun burned down on them for more than an hour and they didnt exchange another word by nightfall the last of the food and water was served out and there was no hiding that the sailing master was at his wits end the mood of the oarsmen was ugly they knew the way of things and they knew that the trierarch was gone and they didnt approve however much they might have paid for his error with the mast kineas had a lot of experience with men men in danger and he knew their mood too well and he knew what the sailing master who had already murdered the owner would do to keep command he took his bag to the bow early in the evening and sat on the bench there ostentatiously cleaning the seawater from his cavalry breastplate and rubbing oil into his boots before putting an edge on his heavy cavalry sword and wiping the heads of his javelins it was a display of deliberate intimidation he was the best armed man on the ship and he had his weapons to hand and he lost new friends in the crew by letting them know it oblivious to what was happening the spartan lay opposite him on the bow bench his anger spent in pumping cavalryman he said surprised his first word in hours he pointed at the heavy boots so alien to greeks who went barefoot or wore only sandals wheres your horse he gave a fraction of a smile kineas nodded his eyes on the men in the waist and the sailing master talking to two veteran oarsmen in the stern they intend to throw you overboard he said quietly the longhaired man rose to a sitting position zeus he said why they need a scapegoat the sailing master needs one too or hell be the sacrifice he murdered the owner do you understand the younger mans face was still green and his mouth looked pinched and thin kineas wondered if he was taking any of this in he went on more to think aloud than make conversation if i kill the sailing master i doubt well get this pig of a ship into a port if i kill sailors theyll drag me down in the end he stood up balancing against the swell and hung the baldric of his sword over his shoulder he walked sternward apparently unworried by having half the crew at his back until he knew he had the sailing masters attention how long until we make port sailing master he said silence fell all along the benches the sailing master looked around gauging the mood of the crew clearly unready for the conflict if there was to be one passengers should mind their selves not the working of the ship he said kineas nodded as if he agreed i was silent when the trierarch raised the sail he said pointedly look where that got me he shrugged raised his hands to show the bloody welts trying to win over some of the crew he got a few chuckles a thin sound i have to be in tomis in a tenday calchus of athens expects me he looked around catching the eyes of men in front of him worried about the men behind him because he knew from experience that frightened men were usually beyond persuasion he couldnt say it more clearly if i dont reach tomis important people will ask this crew hard questions he saw it hit home with the sailing master and prayed prayed that the man had some sense calchus of athens owned half the cargo on this vessel we got no water said a deck crewman we need oars and that seam is opening like a whore in piraeus said one of the veteran oarsmen they were all looking at the sailing master now kineas felt the momentum change before they could ask more dangerous questions he stepped up on a bench is there anywhere on this shore to beach and come at the seam he asked the question in a light tone but his position above them on the bench helped his authority i know a place a days easy row from here said the master stow it you lot i dont discuss orders maybe the passenger has more to say kineas forced a good smile i can row another day he said and stepped down from the bench in the bow the sick spartan had a javelin across his arm the throwing loop on his thumb kineas gave him a smile and then a shake of the head and the longhaired man relaxed the javelin well need every man kineas said conversationally to no one in particular his bench mate from the first hours after the broaching nodded other men looked away and kineas sighed because the die was cast and they would live or die on the whims of the gods he walked into the bow his back to the sailors and the sailing master called you there and he stiffened but the next was like music to him you two fools by the mast back to the pumps you whoresons the two men by the mast obeyed like the first motions of the ship when the oars began to pull the feeling on the deck moved a fraction then a fraction more and then despite the muttering the men were either back on their benches or bailing kineas hoped that the master really knew where he was and where they could beach because the next time he didnt think his voice or his sword would be enough to cut the tangle of animosities on the deck the two old men who kept the harbour light at tomis saw the pentekonter well out in the offing hes lost his mast said one ought to have er stepped in this wind rowers is done in too hell have a job of it making the mole fore dark said the other they sat and shared their contempt for a sailor so foolish as to have lost his mast gods on olympus look at her side said the first as the sun crossed the horizon the pentekonter was well in with the land her bow only a dozen lengths from the mole her side was fothered with a length of linen and roughly painted in tar a pitiful sight thems lucky to be alive his companion had a pull at the nearly empty wineskin they shared gave his cousin a black look and wiped his mouth pity the poor sailors mate truer words never spoke said his cousin the pentekonter pushed her bow in past the mole before full dark her deck silent as a warships except for the call of the oar beat the strokes were short and weak and discerning eyes all over the port could see hed pulled long past the ability of his oarsmen to look sharp or keep up speed the pentekonter passed the long wharf where the traders usually berthed and ran her bow well up the pebble beach that fringed the rivers mouth only then did the crew give a cheer a sound that told the town all they needed to know about the last four days tomis was a large town by the standards of the euxine but the number of her citizens was small and news travelled fast by the time kineas had his baggage over the side the only man he knew in the town was standing with a torchbearer on the pebbles under the bow and calling his name calchus by the gods he shouted and dropped on to the shingle to give the man an embrace calchus gripped him back first hugging him then grasping for a wrestling hold so that both men were grappling down on the gravel in the beat of a seagulls wing calchus reaching around kineass knees to bring him down kineas grappling the bigger mans neck like a farmer wrestles a calf and then they were both standing laughing calchus adjusting his tunic over his muscled chest and kineas rubbing the sand off his hands ten years said calchus exile seems to suit you responded kineas it does too i wouldnt go back calchuss tone implied that he would go back if he could but that he was too proud to say it you got my letter kineas hated demanding hospitality the lot of every exile dont be an idiot of course i had your letter i have your letter a string of your horses and your hyperetes and his little gang of louts ive fed them for a month something tells me you dont have a pot to piss in kineas bridled i will repay you he began of course you will kineas ive been where you are he indicated kineass baggage with a negligent hand to his torchbearer who lifted the bag with a heavy grunt and a long sigh dont get proud kineas your father kept mine alive we were sorry to hear that he died and you exiled of course athens is a city ruled by ingrates but we havent forgotten you besides the helmsman says you helped save the ship thats my cargo i probably owe you he looked past kineas in the dim torchlight as another man leaped over the side to the beach the spartan bent his locks swinging to hide his face and loudly kissed the rocks of the beach then he came up behind kineas and stood hesitantly at his shoulder kineas gestured to him philokles a gentleman of mytilene his pause was deliberate he could see the confusion even the anger on calchuss face hes a spartan kineas shrugged im an exile said philokles i find that exile has this virtue that no exile can be held responsible for the actions of his city hes with you calchus asked his sense of hospitality and etiquette had eroded in the euxine kineas could see calchus was used to being in charge the athenian gentleman saved my life pulling me from the sea when my last strength was nigh spent the spartan was plump kineas had never seen a plump spartan before hadnt remarked it when they were at sea but here in the torchlight it was obvious calchus turned on his heel a rude gesture at the best of times a calculated insult now and waved up the beach fine he can stay with me too its late to be out kineas ill save all my whatever happened to soandso questions for the new day if the spartan was offended he didnt show it very kind sir despite days of physical labour and several restless nights kineas woke with the last of the night and walked outdoors to find the first sleepy slaves carrying water from a well into the kitchen philokles had spent the night on the porch like a servant but it didnt seem to have affected him much since he was still asleep snoring loudly kineas watched the dawn and when there was light enough to see he walked down the lane behind the house to the paddock the pasture beyond had two dozen horses most of which he was pleased to see were his own he walked along the paddock until he saw what he had expected to find a small fire burning in the distance and a man standing near it with a short spear in his hand kineas walked over the broken ground until the sentry recognized him and then all the men were awake nine men with heavy beards and equally bandy legs kineas greeted each in turn they were professional soldiers cavalrymen with dozens of years of war and accumulated scars and none of them had the money or the friends to aspire to the status of the cavalry class in a city antigonus the gaul was more likely to be enslaved than made a citizen in any city and he like his friend andronicus had started with some other mercenaries sent out by syracuse the rest of them had once been men of property in cities that either no longer wanted them or no longer existed lykeles was from thebes which alexander had destroyed coenus was corinthian a lover of literature an educated man with a secret past a rich man apparently unable to return home agis was megaran and athenian a wellborn pauper who knew no other life but war graccus diodorus and laertes were the last of the athenian citizens the last of the men who had followed kineas to asia they were penniless exiles niceas his hyperetes for six years came up last and they embraced niceas was the oldest of them at fortysome years he had grey in his thick black hair and a scar across his face from a persian sword hed been born to a slave in an athenian brothel all the lads who are left and all the horses kineas nodded spotting his favourite pale grey charger out in the paddock all the best of both you all know where were going most of them were still half asleep antigonus was already stretching his calf muscles like an athlete they all shook their heads with little interest the archon of olbia has offered me a fortune to raise and train his hippeis his cavalry bodyguard if he is satisfied with us well be made citizens kineas smiled if he expected them to be moved he was disappointed coenus waved a hand and spoke with the contempt of the true aristocrat citizens of the most barbaric city in the euxine at the whim of some petty tyrant ill just have mine in silver owls kineas shrugged were not getting younger friends he said dont spurn the citizenship until you see the city whos the enemy then asked niceas absently fingering the amulet around his neck hed never been a citizen anywhere the whole idea was a fantasy to him i dont know yet his own people i think not much up here to fight macedon maybe diodorus spoke quietly but with great authority diodorus knew more about politics than the others kineas turned to him you know something just rumour the boy king is off conquering asia and antipater is thinking of conquering the euxine we heard it in the bosporus he grinned remember phillip kontos hes commanding antipaters companions now we saw him he tried to hire us the other man nodded kineas thought for a minute his head down on one fist as he did when something puzzled him and then spoke ill get you the wherewithal from the house write a couple of your famous letters and get me some information in ectabana and in athens no one ever mentioned that antipater would march diodorus nodded curtly kineas looked them over we lived he said suddenly there had been times when it seemed pretty certain that none of them would niceas shook his head just barely he had a cup of wine in his hand and he hurried to slop a libation on the ground for his apparent ingratitude to the gods heres to the shades of them that didnt they all nodded good to see you all again well ride together from here no more ships for me they all walked out to the horses except diodorus who stayed as sentry it was one of their invariable rules they always had a sentry learned the hard way justified too many times the horses were in good shape their hooves hard from the rock and sand in the soil their coats shiny they had fifteen heavy horses and six light as well as several pack animals a former charger past his best years but still willing two mules theyd captured raiding thracians with the boy king and never quite lost to kineas every horse had a story most were persian chargers from the spoils of the fight at the issus river but there was a bay hed bought in the army market after the fall of tyre and the metalgrey charger the biggest mare hed ever seen had been left wandering riderless after a skirmish at a ford on the euphrates the big horse reminded him of the other grey the stallion hed taken at issus long dead of cold and poor food war was unkind to horses and men kineas found himself moved by how few of them were left but his chest was tight with the joy of seeing them well done all i need a day or two were not due in olbia until the kharisteria so we have time let me get my legs under me and then well ride niceas waved his arms at them leaving in a day lots to do gentlemen tack armour weapons he began to issue suggestions very like orders and the other men most of them born to wealth and power obeyed him although he had been born in a brothel kineas put his hand on his hyperetes shoulder ill bring my kit down and join you this afternoon another habit every man cleaned his own kit like hoplites send diodorus to me im going to the gymnasium niceas nodded and led the rest of them to work in what passed for the city they had three things built of stone the wharfs the warehouses and the gymnasium kineas went to the gymnasium with diodorus philokles joined them as they left and calchus insisted on acting as their guide and sponsor if the size of his establishment hadnt immediately given away his wealth his reception in the agora and the gymnasium was ample evidence in the agora he was greeted with respectful nods and several men solicited his favour as he walked through at the gymnasium the other three men were immediately admitted free of charge at calchuss insistence i built this calchus said with pride he proceeded to catalogue the buildings merits kineas perhaps closer in his mind to athens thought it was satisfactory yet provincial calchuss boasting grated on him nonetheless the gymnasium offered him the best opportunity to exercise that hed had in months he stripped dropping his borrowed garment on top of his sandals calchus guffawed too long in the saddle he laughed kineas stiffened with resentment his legs were a trifle over muscled at the top and his lower legs had never been much to look at to his fellow hellenes who worshipped the male form his legs were less than perfect although he had to go to a gymnasium to be reminded of it he began to warm up calchus by contrast had a hard body carefully maintained although he had the beginning of a roll of fat at his waist and he had long legs he began to wrestle with a much younger man on the sand of the courtyard spectators made ribald comments the young man was apparently a regular kineas gestured to diodorus fancy a couple of falls at your pleasure diodorus was tall bony and ascetic looking he was not any hellenes idea of beauty either kineas circled waiting until the taller man stepped towards him to attack and pushed in to meet him and get inside the mans long reach diodorus took the momentum of the attack into his arms and threw it over his hip and kineas crashed his length in the sand he got up slowly was that necessary diodorus was embarrassed no kineas gave a bitter smile if youre trying to tell me that your wrestling is of a different order than mine i already knew that diodorus raised his hand how often do i get a chance to use that move you walked into it i couldnt help myself he was smiling and kineas rubbed the sore spot on his back and stepped forward for another hold he felt a tiny twist of fear the niggling fear that he carried into every contest every fight he went for a low hold got a piece of it and he and diodorus ended up in an ugly mess on the ground neither man able to pin the other and both coated in sand and grit by unspoken mutual consent they both left off their holds and helped each other up outside calchus had pinned the young man he was wrestling he didnt seem in a hurry to let him up and there was a great deal of laughter from the other citizens kineas faced diodorus again and this time they circled and feinted and closed and recovered at a more normal tempo it was almost dance and diodorus stayed to the movements of his gymnasium lessons which kept kineas comfortable he even gained a fall diodorus rubbed his hip and smiled kineas had fallen atop him a perfectly legitimate approach to the game but one inevitably painful to the victim even even kineas gave him a hand up calchus was standing with the young man and some other citizens he called out come and wrestle with me kineas kineas frowned and turned his head uncomfortable with all these strangers the twinge of fear strong because calchus was bigger a better wrestler and as a boy in athens had liked to use his advantages to inflict a little pain kineas disliked pain ten years of war had not accustomed him to dealing with sprains and bruises and deep cuts that took weeks to heal if anything ten years of watching men live or die at the whim of the gods had made him more afraid he shrugged calchus was his host a fine wrestler and looking to demonstrate his superiority kineas gritted his teeth and obliged him losing the first fall in some carefully fought grappling taking the second fall by a matter of splitsecond timing that was more luck than skill and which surprised both men calchus surprised him again by rising from the fall graciously nothing but praise on his lips and going on without rancour ten years ago the adolescent calchus would have come on for blood the third fall was like the first careful at times more like dance than combat and when kineas was eventually pinned the action caused the spectators to whistle in appreciation calchus was breathing hard and his arm circled kineass waist as he helped him to his feet you give a good match did you all see him he called to the others he used to be an easy mark for a fall men hurried forward to compliment calchus on his victory and to tell kineas how well he had done it was all a trifle sickening a remarkable amount of praise lavished for so small a thing but kineas bore it in the knowledge that he had given a better guest gift than money a memorable fight that left his host looking well the young man that calchus had wrestled earlier was quite beautiful as he came up to pay respectful comments to the wrestlers kineas was unmoved by male beauty but he appreciated it as much as any hellene and he smiled at the earnest young man im ajax the young man said in reply to kineass smile my father is isokles may i say how well you fought indeed i he hesitated swallowed his words and was silent kineas read him easily he was an observant youth he was going to say that kineas had looked the better wrestler a smart boy kineas put a hand on the smooth skin of the boys shoulder i always imagined ajax would be bigger hes heard that stupid joke his whole life said the father i try to grow to fit it ajax returned and there was a smaller ajax too do you box care to exchange a few cuffs kineas gestured at the straps for boxers and the boys face lit up he looked at his father who shook his head with mock indignation dont get too cut up or no one will want to take you home from the symposium he said he winked at kineas or should i say get cut up so you wont get taken home have kids of your own kineas shook his head well its an experience anyway feel free to put a few welts on him diodorus helped them both wrap their hands and then they began starting as if by mutual consent with simple routines blows and blocks and then moving to longer exchanges and thence to sparring the boy was good better than a farm boy in a euxine backwater had any right to be his arms were longer than they looked and he could feint rolling his shoulders to telegraph a roundhouse that never came and then punching short with the off arm he stretched kineas now fully warmed up and eager a short blow to his cheek gave him some personal interest in the contest and suddenly they were at it kineas was unaware that they drew every citizen in the gymnasium his world limited itself to his wrapped hands and those of his opponent his eyes and torso in one flurry each of them jabbed ten or twelve times parrying each blow with an upper arm or taking one high on the chest to deliver one to the head the flurry ended in a round of applause that moved them apart they eyed each other warily still charged with the daimon of combat but the surge of spirit soon dwindled and they became mere mortals in a provincial gymnasium again they shook hands warmly again said the boy and kineas shook his head wont be that good again keep it as it is then after a pause youre very good the boy hung his head with real modesty i was going as fast as i could i dont usually you are better than anyone here kineas shrugged and called over the boys head to his father proclaiming how talented his son was it was an effective way of making friends in the gymnasium everyone wanted to congratulate him on his skill on the beauty of the moment it made him happy but he needed a massage and a rest and he said so declining innumerable offers of further contests until someone said they were all going to throw javelins and he couldnt resist he followed them outside and felt a pang philokles forgotten or ignored was running laps outside around a big field full of sheep kineas didnt know what to do with the spartan who seemed to have become a dependant gentlemen werent supposed to be so bereft but kineas suspected that he himself wouldnt have been much different if he had washed up on an alien shore with no belongings and no home he waved philokles waved back a slave herded the sheep well down the field and the men started to throw it wasnt a formal game older men who were disgusted by their first throw took a second or even a third until they were satisfied whereas younger men had to suffice themselves with one throw it would never have done at the olympic games but it was comfortable as the shadows shortened to lie on the grass mindful of the sheep turds and watch the whole community of men compete kineas was conscious of his legs and the imperfections of his body but hed proven himself an athlete and was one of them now making easy conversation with isokles about the olive harvest in attica and the problems of shipping olive oil calchus threw with a great cry and his javelin came close enough to make one of the sheep move with unaccustomed speed he laughed thats the best so far i have a mind to throw again theyre my sheep we could all eat mutton tonight kineas was to throw next to last and philokles last places of honour because they were guests diodorus had thrown early a good throw with no grunt or cry beaten only by calchus most of the other townsmen had been competent but the youth ajax had surprised kineas by his poor throw isokles had beaten it throwing well if short of the final mark and hed teased his son kineas was used to throwing from horseback and he threw too flat but it was still a long throw again the sheep started as his javelin landed close to them calchus winced youve become an athlete while i run to fat in exile he said philokles picked up several javelins before choosing one he walked over to calchus who was talking business with another man this is scarcely sporting im a spartan he said it with a smile an overweight spartan showing a sense of humor calchus didnt understand he indicated with a flick of his head that he had been interrupted if you can do better than we have lets see it nettled philokles gestured at the sheep how much for the straggling ewe calchus ignored him returning to his conversation and then jerked his head around in time to see philokles throw arching his body and almost leaving the ground the javelin leaped from his hand flew high and descended fast it knocked the ewe to the ground all four feet splayed the bolt from heaven pinning her to the ground through her skull there was a moment of shocked silence and then kineas began to applaud then they all applauded the throw and teased calchus about his ewe suggesting various prices for her some obscene until calchus laughed most of the towns social interaction seemed to revolve around keeping calchus pleased kineas didnt like to watch it isokles pointed down the field lets have a run he said and they set the distances and were off running for a while in a pack until the better runners grew bored and took off they circled the field three times a good distance and finished in the yard of the gymnasium kineas was close to last and took some goodnatured teasing about his legs and then they headed for the baths tired and clean with a couple of bruises and a general sense of eudaimia wellbeing that inevitably came to him from the gymnasium kineas walked beside calchus diodorus had gone off with some younger men to see the market you could do well here calchus said suddenly they like you this fighting you do its no job for a man in defence of your city thats different but a mercenary you squander what the gods have given you and one day some barbarians sword is in your gizzard and there you are stay here buy a farm take a wife isokles has a girl shes pretty enough smart a housekeeper id put you up for citizenship after the festival of herakles by zeus theyd accept you today after that boxing kineas didnt know what to say it appealed hed liked the men the citizens of tomis were a good lot provincial but not rustic given to gross jokes and amateur philosophy and all good sports he shurgged i owe it to my men they came here to join me kineas didnt add that something in him looked forward to another campaign they can just as easily move on and take up service elsewhere you are a gentleman kineas you dont owe them anything kineas frowned most of them are gentlemen calchus oh of course calchus waved dismissively but not any more not really perhaps diodorus could be a factor or your steward and those gauls they should be slaves theyd be happier as slaves calchus spoke with authority and finality kineas frowned again and allowed himself to be distracted by a man lying in the street he didnt need to quarrel with his host a barbarian he asked pointing the man in the street was plainly a barbarian he wore trousers of leather and had filthy long hair hanging in plaits and a leather jacket covered in a riot of colourful decoration and he wore gold his jacket had several gold ornaments and showed spaces where other bangles had been removed he had an earring in his ear and a cap on his head like a thracian and he stank of urine and vomit and bad sweat they were almost on top of him he wasnt asleep his eyes were open and unfocused calchus looked at him with deep contempt a scyth disgusting people ugly stinking barbarians no one can speak their language and they dont even make good slaves i thought they were dangerous kineas looked at the drunk with interest he imagined that at olbia there would be a lot of scyths born to horseback a dangerous enemy this one didnt look like a warrior dont believe it they cant hold wine cant speak cant really walk scarcely human ive never seen one sober calchus walked on and kineas followed him albeit unwillingly he wanted a better look but calchus was uninterested kineas looked back and saw that the drunk was rising unsteadily to his feet then he toppled again and kineas followed calchus around a corner and lost sight of the scyth he heard a lot about scyths at the symposium because he was the senior guest and he introduced the topic the wine flowed the inevitable flute girls and fish courses folllowed each other in the approved manner and then the older men settled in to talk moving their couches together so that the younger men could relish the more amorous of the flute girls with a degree of privacy eyeing a blackeyed girl kineas had a brief pang that he was now considered old enough to make conversation but he pulled his couch to the side and when he was asked he suggested that they all tell him about the scyths on the plains to the north isokles took the pitcher of wine from a slave and looked at kineas youre not proposing we drink in the scythian fashion unwatered wine the young men yelled for it but the older men held the day and the wine was mixed at a sedate two waters to each measure of wine while calchus mixed the wine isokles looked thoughtful theyre barbarians of course very hardy they live on their horses herodotus has a lot to say about them i have a copy at my house if youd care to read it honoured said kineas we read herodotus when we were boys but i had no idea id end up here the thing about them is that they fear nothing they say they are the only free people on the earth and that all the rest of us are slaves calchus snorted derisively as if anyone could mistake us for slaves isokles one of the few men who seemed willing to risk calchuss displeasure shrugged deny it if you will anarchises does that name mean something to you kineas felt as though he was back in school sitting in the shade of a tree and getting interrogated on his reading friend of solon a philosopher he said a scythian philosopher philokles spoke up from the end of the room a very plain spoken man a whisper of laughter honoured his pun just the one isokles nodded at philokles he told solon that the athenians were slaves to their city slaves to the walls of the acropolis nonsense said calchus he started passing cups of wine around the circle of couches oh no not nonsense if i may philokles was leaning on his elbows his long hair framing his face he meant that greeks are slaves to their notions of safety that our incessant need to protect ourselves robs us of the very freedom we so often prate about isokles nodded well put calchus shook his head vehemently crap pure crap slaves cant even carry arms they have nothing to defend nor can they defend anything philokles waved to the butler who had brought the wine service you there he said how much do you have in savings the slave was middleaged he froze at being singled out answer him said isokles he was smiling in fact kineas realized that not only did isokles not mind twisting calchuss tail he positively relished it the slave looked down i dont exactly know a hundred owls sirs philokles dismissed him with a wave just my point i have just lost all of my possessions to poseidon i do not have a single owl and this bowl of wine the gift of my esteemed host will once in my gullet be the sum total of my treasure he drank it i am now as rich as ill be for some time i do not have a hundred owls of silver this slave does may i take it from him calchus ground his teeth as the slaves owner he probably held the mans cash no philokles raised his empty cup no in fact you would prevent me from taking it so it appears that this slave holds property and can defend it and so would anarchises say of us in fact he would say that we are slaves to the very act of holding our property isokles applauded with a trace of mockery you should be a lawyer philokles apparently immune to the mockery replied i have been kineas sipped his wine why are the scythians so free then isokles wiped his mouth horses and endless plains they dont so much defend their territory as wander it when the great king tried to make war against them they melted before him they never offered him battle they refused to defend anything because they had nothing to defend in the end he was utterly defeated kineas raised his cup that i remember from herodotus he swirled the wine in his cup thoughtfully but the man in the street today he paused ataelus isokles put in the drunk scyth his name is ataelus had a fortune in gold on his clothes so they have something worth defending the conversation grew much duller as the merchants present squabbled over the source of the scythian gold after another cup of wine that gave way to a mockscholarly debate on the reality or fiction of the tale of the argonauts most of the men present insisted that the golden fleece was real and debated which river feeding the euxine had the gold philokles insisted that the entire tale was an allegory about grain no one listened to him no one told kineas anything useful about the scythians either he drank four cups of watered wine felt his internal balance change and passed on the next cup you didnt use to be such a woman about wine calchus laughed kineas didnt think he had done anything to react but calchus flinched from the look on his face and the room fell silent in a soldiers camp that would have been an insult demanding blood calchus didnt mean it as such kineas could see although he could also see that the habit of power had robbed calchus of his social conscience kineas bowed and forced a smile perhaps i should go sleep in the womens quarters then he said guffaws outright laughter from isokles calchuss face grew red in the light of the lamps it was his turn to resent an insult the suggestion that his women might enjoy a visit from kineas however oblique kineas saw no reason to apologize he upturned his cup and slipped away the next morning he was up with the dawn again he didnt have a hard head and he didnt like to drink too much wine however good the company once again philokles was snoring on the portico kineas walked past him thinking that the man was certainly a nested set of surprises contrasts within contrasts and he barely knew the spartan fat athlete spartan philosopher he walked out to the paddock one of the gauls was standing sentry this morning kineas raised a hand in greeting and then went out to the paddock and got the grey stallion to come to him with a handful of dates then he was up on his bare back his thighs clenched on the animals ample sides and the chill air of the morning was rushing past him as he cantered the length of the paddock he jumped over the paddock rail without much effort on the stallions part and headed north off calchuss farm and on to the rolling hills of the plains he walked until the sun stood clear and red above the horizon and then he made a garland of red flowers and sang the hymn to poseidon which the grey stallion liked the stallion ate the rest of the dates and spurned the grass as too coarse and then kineas mounted and rode back towards the town gradually pushing the stallion to his extended gallop until he was a god floating on a carpet of speed the stallion was scarcely winded when he pulled up at the edge of the market he dismounted and led the grey along the street until he found an early stallholder with a jug of watered wine for sale by the cup he drank deeply of the sour stuff until he came fully awake the grey watched him waiting for a treat good fucking horse the scythian said he was standing by the stallions rump kineas turned and saw that he was stroking him and cooing the grey didnt resent it thanks i think buy me for wine the scythian asked the phrase rolled off his tongue as though he had said it a thousand times he didnt smell so bad this morning and he fascinated kineas kineas paid for more wine handed a cup to the scyth who drained it thanks you ride for her i see you ride yes not bad yes more wine please kineas bought more wine i ride all the time he was tempted to boast but couldnt see why he wanted the scyth a drunk a beggar but one with the value of a farm in gold about his person to like him thanks rotten wine you ride for all times me too need for horse me he looked comical with his pointed hat and his terrible greek you got more horse more he patted the grey kineas nodded gravely yes the scyth patted his chest and touched his forehead a very alien gesture almost persian i call ataelus you call kineas show horse more horse come along then kineas mounted with a handspring a showy cavalry school mount before he could think about it the scyth was mounted behind him kineas had no idea how he had mounted so quickly now he felt ridiculous he hadnt intended to let the man ride with him and they doubtless looked like fools he took a back street and kept the stallion moving ignoring the glances of a handful of early rising citizens something for calchus to twit him with when he was up they cantered up to the paddock all of his men were awake and niceas had the paddock open for the grey before kineas could call out niceas held the greys head as they dismounted hes been here before seems harmless might make a good prokusatore kineas shrugged i have a hard time understanding him but i think he wants to buy a horse and get out of here diodorus was stretching his legs against the paddock wall his hair was a tangle of medusalike red snakes in the morning and he kept pushing the more aggressive locks off his forehead who can blame him but if hes a scyth hed be a good guide kineas made a quick decision and went over to the gaul cut the whitefaced bay out and bring him here antigonus nodded and started pushing through the horses the scyth walked over to the paddock wall and sat with his back against it his leather trousers in the dirt he didnt seem to mind he seemed content just to watch the horses when antigonus brought him the bay kineas walked it over to the scyth tomorrow we go to olbia he said slowly sure said the scyth impossible to tell if he understood if you will guide us to olbia ill give you this bay the scyth looked at the horse he got to his feet ran a hand over her and leaped on to her back in one stride he was moving at a gallop and off over the wall of the paddock and up the road to the plain for a group of professional soldiers it was an embarrassment how totally he had taken them by surprise he was gone just a thin tail of hoof dust hanging in the morning sun before any of them thought of mounting or getting a weapon uh said kineas my fault he seemed harmless niceas was still watching the dust his hand on his amulet he didnt exactly do us harm he certainly knew how to ride coenus was watching the last of the dust under his hand he grinned the poet called them centaurs and now we know why there wasnt anything useful to be done about it they didnt know the plains and they didnt have the time to chase a lone scyth for days niceas put them all even kineas to cleaning their tack and packing it tight for the next movement they agreed that theyd leave the next morning it wasnt that they were a democracy it was just that they took orders better if they had participated in shaping them of course kineas took a good deal of teasing from the citizens hed lost them their pet scyth didnt he know better than to let a scyth up on a horse would he let a child play with fire and more such calchus just laughed i wish someone had woken me up to see you riding with that drunk the things i miss if he held any rancour about the nights revel it was clearly dispelled by his guests embarrassment of the morning ill be off in the morning kineas was indeed embarrassed and caught his fingers smoothing the hem of his tunic an old habit calchus watched the men around the paddock oiling leather i cant make you see sense and stay kineas turned up his hands i have a contract my friend when it is done and i have a talent or two in silver why then id be pleased to have this conversation again calchus smiled it was the first really happy smile that kineas had seen in two days from the man youll think about it thats good enough for me i have isokles coming tonight and his daughter will visit to sing for us family evening nothing to shock a girl take a look at her kineas realized that calchus for all his overbearing ways was working quite hard to make kineas welcome you a matchmaker calchus put an arm around his shoulder i said it when you first came your father saved our whole family i dont forget youre fresh from the city you think im a big frog in a little pond i see it and i am isokles and i we argue about everything but we are the men of substance here and theres room for more the ponds not that small for calchus that was a long emotional speech kineas hugged him and got a crushing squeeze in return calchus went off to watch slaves being loaded for attica kineas went back to working on his tack he was sitting with his back against the outside of the paddock using the wall for shade with his bridle laid out in pieces and a new headstall to sew on when young ajax loomed above him good day to you sir he said your servant ajax please accept the accommodation offered by this tuft of grass kineas waved to it and passed a skin full of sour wine which ajax drank as if it were ambrosia my father sent this for you to look at he had a bag of scrolls over his shoulder like a student in the agora he hoisted it to the ground kineas opened one glanced at the writing a very neat copyist and saw that it was herodotus it is only book four the part about the scythians because well my father says you are leaving leaving tomorrow for olbia so you wont have time to read much kineas nodded and picked up the headstall i probably wont have time to read the first scroll he said ajax nodded he then sat in silence kineas resumed his work using a fine bronze awl and the backing of a soft billet of wood to punch a neat row of holes down each side of the new headstall he looked at ajax from time to time from under his eyebrows the boy was anxious fidgeting with scraps of leather and bits of thread but silent kineas liked him for his silence he kept working when the holes were punched he waxed a length of linen cord and fitted it to a needle the needle was too large for the job but it was the only good needle in the camp then he began to sew the thing is ajax began but he lost heart and the words just hung there kineas let them dangle for a bit while he finished his length of cord and threaded a new one the thing is he said gently i want to see the world ajax announced kineas nodded laudable nothing ever happens here sounds good to me kineas wondered if he could live in a place where the festivals and the gymnasium were the sum of excitement but on this day facing the loss of a horse an uncertain journey and the tyrant of olbia he felt that a life of certain boredom looked preferable i want to to join your company to ride with you i can ride im not much with a javelin but i could learn and i can box and wrestle and fight with the spear and i spent a year with the shepherds i can sleep rough start a fire i killed a wolf kineas looked up what does your father say ajax beamed he says that i can go with you if you are fool enough to take me kineas laughed by the gods thats just what i expect he said hes coming to dine here tonight ajax nodded vigorously so am i and penelope my sister is going to sing she sings beautifully and she weaves wool better than merchants wool and she is beautiful i shouldnt say it but she is kineas hadnt encountered this level of instant hero worship before he couldnt help but bask in the admiration for a little while but not long i shall be pleased to meet your sister i will talk to your father tonight but ajax were mercenaries its a hard life fighting for the boy king that was soldiering for the city in a way even if we got a rough reception when we came home sleeping rough aye and worse days without sleep nights on guard on horseback in enemy country his voice trailed off and then he said war isnt what what it was ajax there is no battle of champions the virtues of our ancestors are seldom shown in modern war he stopped himself because his words were having the opposite effect from what he had planned the boys eyes were shining with delight how old are you seventeen at the festival of herakles kineas shrugged old enough to be a man ill talk to your father he said and when ajax started to stammer thanks he was merciless by the crookedminded son of cronus boy you could die pointlessly in someone elses fight a street brawl defending a tyrant who despises you or from a barbarian arrow in the dark its not homer ajax its dirty sleepless full of scum and bugs and on the day of battle you are one faceless man under your helmet no achilles no hector just an oarsman rowing the phalanx toward the enemy wasted words he hoped they were not prophetic because he still had some homer in him after ten years of the real thing he dreaded the pointless death in an alley or a wineshop squabble hed seen them happen to other men late afternoon and his tack was clean and neat the horses were inspected the other men as ready as they needed to be the armour and cornellwood javelins packed in straw panniers for the baggage animals hed moved from the paddock to the base of the farms lone oak tree with a blanket to repair but kineas found it difficult to keep his eyes open the coming dinner reminded him of the girl ajaxs sister and what she would have meant home security work and her mere mention reminded him that it had been months since he had lain with a woman probably not since he left the army and the contrast seemed vivid without even meeting ajaxs sister he could see her at least in the guise of his own sisters demure quiet beautiful remote devout cautious intelligent perhaps but certainly ignorant without conversation his longest liaison in the army had been with artemis not obviously her real name she was a camp follower a prostitute although she insisted on being called hetaera and claimed that she would be one in time loud opinionated violent in her loves and hates given to drinking undiluted wine she had seen more war than most of the soldiers for all that she wasnt yet twenty shed stabbed a macedonian filecloser who tried to rape her shed fucked most of the men in his troop adopted them and been adopted she had her own horse could recite whole passages of homer and dance every dance the men could all the spartan military dances all the dances of the gods the night before a battle she would sing like niceas she was born in a brothel near the agora in athens she made the whole company even the corinthians and the ionians learn the anthem of athens to which she was fiercely patriotic come athena now if ever let us now thy glory see now o maid and queen we pray thee give thy servants victory she turned their drab followers into part of the company got them messes dealt with their squabbles and ruled them and gave them value and she had said to kineas one ngiht two things a girl needs to make it in this army a hard heart and a wet cunny thats not in homer but id wager that it was the same for the girls at troy artemis was well known to pick a unit she liked and go to the strongest man in it until he died or she grew restless or he didnt provide for her she wouldnt abide a nonprovider kineas had kept her a year in camp and city shed left him for phillip kontos a macedonian hipparch a good professional move and he didnt hate her for it although it occurred to him behind closed eyelids under a tree on the euxine that he had expected her to stay with him like the women the life he didnt see much hope of becoming a farmer he fell asleep and poseidon sent him a dream of horses he was riding a tall horse or he was the horse and they flowed together on an endless plain of grass floating galloping on and on there were other horses too and they followed until he left the plain of grass for a plain of ash and then they neighed and fell behind and he rode on alone and then they were at a river a ford full of rocks on the far bank was a pile of driftwood as tall as a man and a single dead tree and on the ground beneath his hooves were the bodies of the dead he awoke with a start rubbed his eyes and wondered what god had sent him such a dream then he rose and went to the houses bath handed his best tunic to a slave to press and gave the woman a few obols to do a good job she brought him ewers of warm water to bathe she was attractive an older woman with a good figure high cheekbones and a tattoo of an eagle on her shoulder sex crossed his mind but she was having none of it and he didnt press the issue perhaps because he didnt he got his tunic beautifully pressed with every fold opened and carefully erased the linen shining white so that he looked like the statue of letos son on mytilene she accepted his thanks with a stiff nod and stayed out of his reach which made him wonder about the habits of the house he walked naked back to where the men were camped he had some good things in his baggage to go with his good tunic he had good sandals light and strong with red leather bindings that helped disguise the scar on his leg but the only cloak he had was his military cloak which had once been blue and was now a faded colour between skyblue and dust he did however have an excellent cloak pin a pair of medusas heads in bright silver from the very best athenian sculptor and castor he pinned it to the old cloak with a muttered prayer and slung the cloak over his shoulder anyway out by the fire with diodorus and niceas the other men had gone to the market to drink they hadnt been invited to the symposium and since most of them were as well born as calchus they chose to resent it agis and laertes and gracus had known calchus as a boy they were angry at being treated as inferiors diodorus had a flagon of good wine and he coenus and niceas passed it around while kineas finished dressing niceas held out a good brooch to put on his cloak loot from tyre meant as a guest gift for calchus save the medusas for a more worthy host he said kineas wondered what calchus would think if he knew that the slaveborn athenian on his back farm considered him a poor host probably snort in contempt his ruminations on calchus were interrupted look at that niceas exclaimed kineas turned and looked over his shoulder a lone horseman was trotting to the paddock coenus laughed ataelus bellowed kineas the scyth raised a dusty hand in greeting and swung his legs over the side of the horse so that he slipped in one lithe movement to the ground he touched the flank of the horse with a little riding whip and she turned and walked through the gate into the paddock horse good he said he reached out a hand for the flagon coenus handed it to him without a moments hesitation the scyth took a deep drink rubbed his mouth with his hand then coenus caught the scyth in a bear hug i think i like you barbarian he said kineas shook his head i thought you stole the horse the scyth either didnt understand or ignored the subject where for you go leave tomorrow yes yes yes kineas was conscious of the sounds of conversation from the drive isokles and his family were arriving it was late olbia he said the scyth looked at him he handed the flask to diodorus as if he had always been part of their circle long he said far his greek wasnt barbaric he pronounced his few words well but had no notion of the complex rules of cases that governed nouns ten days asked diodorus thats what the merchants had said the scyth shrugged his eyes were back on the horse youll guide us asked kineas me go for you you go horse good yes i think thats a deal boss niceas nodded ill just keep an eye on the bugger shall i coenus shook his head ataelus and i share a hobby lets go get drunk my friend ataelus grinned think for like you too hellene he said to coenus they walked off together toward the wine shops of town niceas looked at diodorus i guess we get to watch the camp while i go to a dinner party excellent kineas grinned hell make a superb scout if we can keep him niceas waited until coenus and the scyth were out of earshot before going on hes plenty smart kineas had seen some intelligence in the face but he was surprised to hear niceas confirm it smart just how niceas pointed at the horse if he had just stayed here with us would we trust him on the plains but hes already shown he could ride off right stands to reason well trust him more kineas saw it put that way youre as much a philosopher as that spartan kid niceas niceas nodded always thought so and if hes a philosopher im a hipparch in the guards enlighten me kineas was actually standing on the balls of his feet that eager to be in calchuss house on time but niceas was not much given to bursts of conversation and when he spoke it was worth listening to i heard from dio about his javelin throw he swam for an hour maybe more before you rescued him or so i heard it spartan bastard out of shape dont know why but hes officer class spartiate the tough ones fucking killing machines ill bear that in mind kineas said dont marry the girl until weve done our contract said niceas dismissed by his own hyperetes kineas headed for the house he was still thinking about niceass comments when he found himself lying full length on a wide couch with the spartan himself i hope you dont mind sharing with me philokles said i asked calchus to put me here i think he was going to give you ajax thanks the spartans breath was heavy with wine already kineas moved a fraction away you are leaving tomorrow yes for olbia yes thats where we have our contract kineas was finding it hard to talk to philokles a man who seemed immune to social convention while the other guests isokles ajax and a robed and veiled figure that had to be a woman all stood obviously waiting to be introduced to the principal guest before taking their ease will you take me philokles clearly resented having to ask a good deal of suppressed arrogance was very close to the surface can you ride not well but i can can you cook kineas was in a hurry to end this isokles had just shifted his weight they were being very rude to the other guests why couldnt philokles have kept this until the end of the meal but he didnt want to say yes not if you want to eat it otherwise yes kineas raised his eyes to isokles and tried to pass a message i know im being rude im being importuned by someone whose life i saved isokles winked the gods only knew what he thought was happening ill take you it may be dangerous he added weakly too late to make any difference all the better said the spartan goodness were being rude we should greet the other guests isokles and ajax greeted them and took their places on couches the girl had vanished probably taken to the womens rooms on the other side of the house dinner consisted of fish all very good lobster a little undercooked and then more fish the sort of opson filled meal that moralists in athens complained of watered wine made the rounds a series of slaves bearing in the ewers of wine and calchus mixing in the water himself he was the only one alone on a couch and he started conversations to include all of his guests the wars of the boy king of macedon the hubris of the boy king claiming to be a god the lack of piety in the younger generation with the exception of ajax despite his best intentions he tended to launch monologues on his views on each of these matters ajax was silent and respectful isokles didnt rise to the arguments as kineas had expected he would and philokles applied himself to the fish courses as if he didnt expect to eat this well ever again after the last food course basins of water were brought and all the men washed their hands and faces calchus raised a wine bowl this is really a family gathering he said to isokles my rival and brother and to kineas to whom i owe everything i have achieved here he poured a libation to the gods on to the floor and then drank the bowl to the dregs and upended it to show it was empty since we are just family it will outrage no god or goddess for your daughter to sing for us isokles i couldnt agree more said the older man he took a full bowl of wine and raised it to calchus for hosting us to this excellent dinner and to his friend kineas who we all hope will grace us with his presence for long years to come he too poured off a libation kineas realized that it was his turn he felt out of place shy unaccustomedly foreign he took a full bowl and rose to a sitting position to the hospitality of calchus and to the making of new friends for new friends are gifts from the immortal ones on high olympus he drank the cup down philokles took his bowl and stood with it kineas could see on the faces of isokles and calchus that philokles had it wrong he was not supposed to raise a toast any more than young ajax but he did poseidon lord of horses and kineas saved me from the sea and calchuss hospitality made me a man again his libation to the gods was half the cup and then he drank the rest surely there is no bond dearer than guest to host he subsided back on to his couch ajax recognized the quote and applauded isokles raised his bowl in salute even calchus who at best tolerated the spartan gave him a nod and smile of thanks two women entered the back of the room unveiled their hair piled high atop their heads and wearing fine linen the older had to be calchuss wife although this was the first time kineas who had lived in the house for three days had laid eyes on her she was tall well built long of limb and elegant in her movements and she carried her head high her face would not have launched a thousand ships but her expression of pleasure and her obvious intelligence took the place of beauty she smiled at all of them this is penelope she said quietly without raising her eyes daughter of isokles i will just sit by and listen if i may she never raised her eyes never mentioned her own name the very picture of a modest matron except that surely calchus had no children or kineas would have seen them penelope had large round eyes that darted around the room like excited animals she would lower them when she remembered modesty but just as suddenly they would start rise up and seek new quarry kineas decided that she had probably never been out in public before perhaps never seen men having a private dinner he himself had often taken a meal with his sisters and told them the news of the day or the gossip from the gymnasium but not all girls got as much her hair was very black and her skin fairer than most she had a long neck long arms wellshaped hands she was quite attractive obviously the female twin to ajax but kineas found her furtive curiosity disturbing too much like a caged animal and after artemis modesty no longer appealed to him as much he felt a vague disappointment what had he expected she began to sing without any warmup and she had a clear light voice she sang a harvest song from the festival and she sang a love song he had heard in athens and then she sang three songs that were quite new to him and whose cadences sounded foreign her singing was good confident if a little quiet and breathy she sang an ode and finished with a hymn to demeter they all applauded philokles punched his arm and smiled broadly isokles stood not every father indulges his children like this i mean that she sings songs meant for men but it seems to me that she has a gift sent by letos son and that she should be allowed to polish it and even show it off if she does so with modesty which i may be excused for thinking she has done he looked at kineas kineas once again fretted to be the centre of attention he saw that calchuss wife was looking straight at him she had lovely eyes perhaps her best feature they were all looking at him expectantly ive only been here three days and youve cast me in the role of the suitor nothing more suitable or modest in the eyes of the gods than for penelope to show the talents they have given her to friends and family he said he could see from their reactions that he had not hit the right note years of commanding men had taught him to read expressions that quickly and these reactions were not of the best but what was he to say to praise her singing or her appearance would be to break the artificial constraints of this being a family gathering was he supposed to take that plunge moved by a sudden passion and declare himself her suitor sod that he thought suddenly angry philokles shifted on the couch next to him and rose unsteadily to his feet in sparta our women live in public with our men so ill ask you to excuse me if i am uncouth but surely penelope is the very image of modest accomplishment the muses must love a girl who plays so well kineas looked up at philokles who swayed a little as if drunk although he had taken very little wine his compliment was well received calchuss wife for instance smiled and nodded isokles looked pleased well shot philokles kineas punched his arm lightly as he sank back on to the couch and philokles grinned at him with a look that said youre a slow one ill explain all this later you dolt isokles rose again and while im indulging my children i will ask a favour of kineas here since he is my fellow guest and the man of the evening favour me and take my son with you to olbia right in public where i cant refuse by contrast philokles request was the soul of courtesy kineas stole a glance at calchuss wife she looked interested kineas said i am a soldier the life i lead is dangerous and the campaigns are long i fear to take the responsibility for your son and leave his bones in some field i fear the anger of the gods if i take him from you and i fear your wrath if some untoward thing might happen dont men say in peace sons bury their fathers but in war fathers bury their sons isokles was sitting on his couch with his hand on ajaxs shoulders he needs to see something of the world his head is full of achilles and odysseus and nothing but the mud and flies of a real campaign will cure him isokless eyes met his own there is always risk when you are a father i let penelope sing here i have risked her reputation and mine the risk is small the company near and dear i accept it you might say i have known you only three days but i say you are the boyhood friend of calchus and calchus for all we are rivals in everything i speak bluntly to please the gods for all that we are rivals calchus is the closest man to my heart and your reputation precedes you too kineas were you not sent to the boy king with fifty men to be hostages for athens and did you not succeed in winning his praise as a man as a soldier to the credit of your city calchus says that you have made five campaigns in six years and that only the jealousy of the assembly at your fathers wealth sent you to exile i have met you you are a man i could trust with my child or both of them whispered philokles kineas didnt want all the praise nor did he think they knew what little glory hed garnered with alexander trusted cavalrymen were on mighty charges that shattered persian armies greek cavalry were lucky to be assigned to scout a ford on the flank of the army you praise me above my merits i will take ajax to olbia and show him a little war and cure him as you ask kineas sighed philokles hit him in the ribs quite hard with an elbow calchus sprang up enough family business wife be off with you it is time for men to speak of mens things and drink some wine his wife took penelope by the hand and she rose gracefully nodded her head to the guests and withdrew she had never spoken a word she was what fifteen sixteen kineas watched her go and noted the scowl on the face of calchuss wife does ajax have a good horse kineas asked not as good as any of yours ours are lighter really just for a race behind the agora kineas looked to isokles if hes coming with me hell need money to buy equipment in olbia you dont have the items here i looked in the market two heavy chargers and a light horse probably his racehorse is too fine for the work several heavy tunics a big straw hat like slaves wear in the fields the bigger the better two javelins good ones with cornell wood shafts and bronze heads boots to protect his legs when we manoeuvre and a sword id like him to carry a cavalry sword ill teach him to use it he looked at the boy you ride well ajax looked down modestly well enough chair seat on the rump of the horse no like the dacae i learned to ride from one when i was a boy ajax looked up to see if this was the right answer it was good and armour the panoply will be as much as a hoplites heavy breastplate and back and a helmet with cheek pieces isokles was fingering his beard how much i want him to have good equipment and good horses they can keep a man alive kineas nodded sharply all business on familiar ground exactly i have no notion what things cost in olbia but with all the scyths there i hope that good horses are plentiful and cheap still a hundred owls isokles laughed ouch look ajax why didnt you just ask to have a ship built for you he held out his hand no i jest a hundred owls in a purse and another fifty for you kineas against expenses kineas knew it was customary for hipparchs to hold extra money on campaign for the sons of the rich but he had never benefited from it thank you i dont want him to seem poor besides the sons of the rich in olbia send for more if things are expensive calchus rose from his couch i too have something for you kineas he beckoned to the doorway and a young male slave came in this is crax a thracian he claims to be good with horses and he can handle a spear you need a slave a man of your position looks naked without one you are too generous said kineas who had not owned a slave of his own in years he didnt know what to say crax looked more like a potential recruit than a slave good carriage good muscles young and his stance suggested that slavery had not beaten his aggressiveness out of him well i insist we all want you to succeed go please the tyrant win a few talents and come back here and ill be honest crax is a bit much for my foreman to handle nothing for you im sure crax stood like a soldier at attention cavalrymen had a saying no worse gift than an unbroken horse thank you calchus thank you for the hospitality and the care you gave my men and horses and now this ill repay you when i can he gestured to crax fetch my cloak and sandals will you crax marched out of the room so soon you and philokles have so much to add to spice our conversation said isokles i apologize for leaving you so early but ill be riding with the dawn and taking my son well ill enjoy his company another hour kineas nodded to ajax join us when the sun is rising by the paddock ill provide you a horse until we can buy you a string ajax looked as though it was all too good to be true i cant wait until morning kineas looked at isokles and shook his head i can he nudged philokles philokles showed no sign of feeling the nudge ill just stay here and enjoy my last night of civilization he said he raised his wine bowl to have it filled the sun shot over the distant hills between one girth strap and the next and suddenly the light was different and every blade of grass in the yard had its own shadow kineas counted heads all present all looking eager even the old soldiers ajax had a slave with his own horse which he had insisted on bringing a pretty persian mare crax went up on one of the spare chargers as if born to the saddle which he probably was and carried kineass two javelins easily in the same hand as his reins ataelus had a bow on a belt at his hip and a riding whip and he moved his bay around the grass like most men walk the man and the horse a single animal niceas mounted and passed the reins of the baggage animals to the slaves kineas rode with him up and down the column a dozen men twenty horses and baggage too big a target for bandits all the men obviously armed kineas liked the look of them felt happy to have them all he left niceas in the middle of the column with the remounts and the baggage and rode to the head where the scyth waited calchus was not up only a handful of slaves were moving around the house most of them carrying water isokles was there to see his son leave leaning on the paddock wall and chewing grass embrace your father kineas said to ajax ajax dismounted and they embraced for a long time then he came back and vaulted into the saddle kineas raised his hand lets ride he said the road from calchuss farm became a track the width of two cart wheels within a few stades and continued as such all day as it turned inland from the sea and headed north and west at first greek farms lined the road each house set well back amid olive groves and fields of wheat after a few hours the greek farms vanished to be replaced by rustic villages where the women worked in the fields and men wore barbarian dress although there were plenty of greek goods to be seen at every house amphorae bronze goods blankets and wool fabric who are they asked kineas ataelus didnt understand the question until it was repeated with a gesture bastarnae he said he said a good deal more with occasional greek words interposed in his own barbarian tongue bar bar babble smash bar bar bar destroy and bar babble warriors from which kineas understood that they were fierce warriors when roused he had heard as much they didnt seem particularly fierce when the sun was sinking they found a bigger house in the third village and asked for lodging they were well received by an obvious chieftain and his wife and one silver owl of athens paid for fodder and food for the whole party kineas declined to sleep in the house but accepted dinner and despite the barrier of language enjoyed himself philokles declined dinner my fucking thighs are bleeding he said kineas winced youre a spartan philokles swore i gave up on that closedmouth endurethepain shit when i was exiled niceas laughed youll be fine he said in about a week but they provided him with salve and niceas saw to it that the salve made its way to ajax as well in the morning they were away again at first light they continued to ride past villages and fields twice they passed greek men with carts headed into the town they had left with goods for market late afternoon brought them to the ferry at the danube the river just one of its many mouths was as wide as a lake the ferryman had a small farm and had to be summoned to his duty it took them an hour to unpack the horses and pack the ferry and then they were away rowed by the ferryman and his slaves while the horses swam alongside it was a difficult complex operation but kineas and his veterans had crossed too many rivers to be unprepared and they made it without the loss of baggage or horse the mast of the ferryboat cast a long shadow by the time they were across niceas put the men to unpacking and kineas done with the worries of the crossing sat under a solitary oak tree and watched the ferryman took no part in the unloading although he did encourage his slaves to help ataelus didnt touch the baggage neither did he show any signs of drinking wine he recovered his wet horse curried her and mounted then he sat an immobile centaur the ferryman spoke good greek so kineas waved him over can you tell me about the next two days travel the ferryman laughed grimly you just left civilization if you call aegyssus civilization on the north bank its just you and the dacae and the getae and the bastarnae that boy of yours crax hes getae hell run tonight mark my words and cut your throat if he can the getae will want your horses if you keep following the edge of the hills over there and keep clear of the marches youll come to antiphilous in four or five days theres not a farm or a house between kineas turned his head to watch crax the boy was working hard under the orders of antigonus the gaul they were laughing together kineas nodded fair enough your party is too small the getae will be stuffing your heads with straw by tomorrow i doubt it but thanks for your concern the ferryman shrugged ill take you back over course ill have to charge you again but you can wait at my place until another party comes kineas yawned it wasnt feigned he found the ferrymans scare tactics dull in fact he had heard it all before no thanks suit yourself before the sun had dipped another degree the ferryman and his boat were gone they were alone on the north bank kineas called niceas to him camp here watches picket and hobble the horses and watch crax hell try to run tonight says the ferryman niceas glanced at the boy and shrugged what else did he say well all be killed by the getae like as not niceas said philosophically but his hand went to his amulet whats a getae craxs folk thracians with horses kineas looked at the horizon under his hand he beckoned to ataelus who rode over we camp here take antigonus and laertes and ride out check the area come back yes ataelus said its good he patted the flank of his horse she want to run me too he waited for antigonus to mount up laertes the best scout in the company was already up and the three of them rode out on to the plain heading northwest to the horizon the other men built two fires and put their cauldron on one they made up beds from the grass all around they argued over setting up the two tents and niceas made them do it his gravelly voice and imaginative curses a counterpoint to their work kineas took no part barring a crisis he acted the part of the officer and watched them niceas gave most of the orders settled the disputes and allocated the watches the three mounted men came back just before the fall of full night and reported horse tracks in all directions to the north but no immediate threat so easy to forget when he wasnt on campaign kineas mostly remembered the good times and the danger he never remembered the nagging weight of casual decisions and their mortal consequences for instance double the watch and double their chances of detecting an attack with the consequent fatigue for all of them tomorrow or keep normal watches and know that any one man could fall asleep and the first theyd know of an attack was the rush of hooves and the spike of iron in the belly he compromised always an added danger and ordered that the last watch at dawn be doubled and put himself on it then he summoned crax and ordered him to put his blankets down next to kineass own placed antigonus on the other side and dismissed the subject they ate quickly set their watches and lingered too early in the campaign to go to sleep automatically instead they sat up with their last amphorae of wine from tomis telling each other stories of their own exploits reliving and laughing ajax sat and watched silent and polite his eyes wide as if he were sitting with jason and the argonauts agis recited lines from the poet but come now change thy theme and sing of the building of the horse of wood which epeius made with athenas help the horse which once odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile when he had filled it with the men who sacked ilios if thou dost indeed tell me this tale aright i will declare to all mankind that the god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of divine song so he spoke and the minstrel moved by the god began and let his song be heard taking up the tale where the argives had embarked on their benched ships and were sailing away after casting fire on their huts while those others led by glorious odysseus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the trojans hidden in the horse for the trojans had themselves dragged it to the citadel so there it stood while the people talked long as they sat about it and could form no resolve nay in three ways did counsel find favour in their minds either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze or to drag it to the height and cast it down the rocks or to let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods even as in the end it was to be brought to pass for it was their fate to perish when their city should enclose the great horse of wood wherein were sitting all the best of the argives bearing to the trojans death and fate and he sang how the sons of the achaeans poured forth from the horse and leaving their hollow ambush sacked the city of the others he sang how in divers ways they wasted the lofty city but of odysseus how he went like ares to the house of deiphobus together with godlike menelaus there it was he said that odysseus braved the most terrible fight and in the end conquered by the aid of greathearted athena they cheered his performance as the veterans always had and made jokes comparing redhaired diodorus to wily odysseus the first watch was done before any of them were in their blankets except philokles who all but fell from the saddle straight into bed kineas caught ajax as he rolled in his cloak youll want this he said and nudged ajax with a sword ajax took it hefted in his hand and tried to look at it kineas said sleep with it under your head or in your hand he smiled invisibly in the dark you get used to it after a few nights kineas was asleep as soon as he was under his cloak it was like being home he had a dream of artemis neither long nor precise and certainly not one of those dreams that aphrodite sends to men but a happy dream none the less and he awoke when the watch changed and men shifted in the tent alert as soon as his eyes opened and then relaxing remembering the dream and wondering if some hint of her was in his cloak he smiled and went to sleep again and awoke with a start when something heavy fell across his legs he remembered a loud noise he had his heavy sword in his hand and he was on his feet before he was awake the sword clear of the scabbard antigonus spoke softly at his ear its nothing kineas nothing your slave boy tried to run and i knocked him cold hell be sore in the morning the weight that had landed at his feet was crax the boy was deeply unconscious and other sleepers were now awake pushing him from where he had fallen they wrestled him into his own blankets where was he headed i didnt wait to see when i saw him get up i knocked him flat with my buttspike kineas winced i hope he isnt dead wake me for next watch never fear you can have rosyfingered dawn all to yourself kineas fell asleep thinking that antigonus who couldnt read or write probably hadnt ever read the iliad he was awakened the third time to throw water on his face and hands his hands swelled at night and his joints ached when he woke and waking up seemed harder every year campaign aged a man too quickly he took the heavy javelin from antigonuss hand ajax was up too kineas had decreed a double watch for dawn and niceas had put kineas on with the least experienced man and the most expendable decisions decisions before you turn in find him a javelin kineas said to antigonus who burrowed in the equipment and came out with one he handed it to ajax who looked quite selfconscious with it in the first grey light of morning as if he were wearing the wrong costume for a party he also looked absurdly young pretty and wellslept and kineas thought ill bet his joints dont swell anything to report kineas asked antigonus peered off to the north i heard something distant could have been a wolf taking a buck but it was heavy movement it was an hour back he gestured at a dim shape by the tree dont trip over our barbarian hes asleep with his horse kineas nodded and pushed the other man towards his sleeping spot it was light enough to crawl into the tent without waking everyone else and antigonus was snoring before kineas had walked the perimeter of the little camp ajax followed him clearly at a loss as to what to do kineas took him around the camp again showed him the two slight rises which would give a sentry a few stades more view stopped with him to smile at the sight of ataelus asleep with the reins of his horse in his hand ready for instant action then kineas told ajax to build up the fires when thats done curry the horses ajax gave kineas the first look of displeasure kineas had ever seen him wear curry the horses ill wake my slave kineas shook his head build up the fires and then curry the horses yourself do a good job then you and i will take a little ride before we wake the others and ajax dont imagine you can discuss orders ajax hung his head but he said other men do kineas laughed and swatted him when youve killed a dozen men and stood sentry a thousand nights you can debate with me he liked being on watch and he stood under the tree immobile and watched the grey horizon to the northwest he listened to the rising birds watched a rabbit move across the light grass where the ferry had landed and then watched a falcon stooping out over the estuary of the danube he felt they were safe in wild places it was usually easy to feel the approach of an enemy for an hour he watched ajax bring up the horses one at a time curry them and then hobble them again the lad was thorough although he had a rebellious set to his back that kineas hadnt seen before but he checked hooves rubbed each horse with straw looked in their eyes and their mouths he knew what he was about kineas went back to watching the horizon and he was surprised when ajax started walking towards him with a pair of horses the time had flown by but his hands were back to normal his neck felt less strained and he was ready for a ride once mounted he walked his horse to the near tent and tapped the poll with the butt of his javelin niceas put his head out were riding a dawn patrol have the slaves start the food well ride in an hour niceas buried a yawn with one of his big hands im on it kineas turned his horse and rode out with ajax at his side he rode straight north along the river staying in low ground when he could and showing ajax what he was doing at every step keeping the rising sun from silhouetting him and his mount using the brush along the river for cover and background coming to a dead stop when he had to cross a rise they made their way along the bank and then kineas led them inland almost due north until they reached some high ground that he had seen while he was standing watch they were almost a stade from the camp and he slid to the ground tossed his reins to ajax and crawled to the crest on his hands and knees he was showing off for the boy but the cause was good the boy needed to see how to do a dawn patrol correctly from the crest he could see an enormous arc of ground all of it empty of course every fold of it could contain a scythian horde but kineas knew from experience how hard it was to keep men and animals in ambush without motion and dust for any length of time he slid back down to ajax hobble your mount and keep watch up there until i come for you ill have your slave bring you something to eat if you see movement run like the furies were on you ajax nodded very serious am i in trouble certainly not this is what we do on the dawn patrol i have work to do you already did yours so you can loaf up here watch the whole horizon and wait for the men to have breakfast itd be the same if i had diodorus here ajax let a smile break through oh good ill watch then kineas rode back to camp by a different route still keeping his silhouette away from prying eyes he ate a bowl of reheated soup from the nights dinner recurried his own charger and then put her into the remounts choosing a smaller lighter horse for his days work he told diodorus lykeles and graccus to be prepared to hunt they were eager for it crax was working on the baggage animals under the careful eye of niceas he didnt seem the worse for his misadventure but when kineas checked the baggage he found that every girth the boy had done was loose or sabotaged kineas summoned the boy with a wave and knocked him flat on his back with a single blow of his fist i dont like to hit a slave kineas said evenly he paused to lick some blood where he had split the skin over a knuckle you tried to run last night fair enough if i were a slave id run for home too then you rigged the baggage to slip lost work and a late start for us bad job both times if you try something like this again ill just kill you you didnt cost me a copper obol and i dont need a slave understand the boy looked dazed probably was after two heavy blows but i do need more cavalrymen show me you can do the job and take the crap and ill put you up as a groom in olbia and free you in the gamelia or die i hate to waste manpower but i dont like sloppy knots kineas turned away and rolled heavily on to the back of his light horse he didnt feel like vaulting and his split knuckle hurt like fire he sent ataelus to bring ajax in and then they were off across the plains of the getae they made good time after they started although crax remained dazed and he had to be tied over a horse by noon they were clear of the marsh to the east and riding on a board flat grass plain dominated by a line of low rocky hills to the west lines of wind moved the tips of the grasses in waves the sea of green rolled on and on over hummocks and low hills all the way out to the horizon it was terrain built for horses by the gods and kineas stopped at the top of the first low ridge and looked out under his hand while the sun crept up a fingers breadth the magnitude of the view kept them silent and then ataelus dismounted knelt and kissed the ground before giving a screech that vanished in the vastness of the sky someones home said coenus with a grin when they found some tracks ataelus rode all the way to the base of the hills and came back with a heavy black arrow that he handed to kineas without comment getae kineas asked ataelus shrugged expressively and rode out ahead in early afternoon they flushed a small herd of roebuck in a deep gully cut by a small stream and the three hunters rode ahead of them cut out a big buck and brought him down with javelins it was a pleasure to watch and the aristocrat in kineas appreciated how professional cavalrymen had mastered the mounted hunt in a way that few aristocrats would ever see much less learn he rode on thinking of xenophon whose works on horses and hunting he had read in his youth coenus an educated man and often out of place in a company of mercenaries doted on xenophon and could quote great swathes of his works seeing the returning hunters he rode up next to kineas pointed and said therefore i charge the young not to despise hunting or any other schooling for these are the means by which men become good in war and in all things out of which must come excellence in thought and word and deed somehow that reminded him that he still had isokless scrolls of the fourth book of herodotus and that pained him because he couldnt imagine having the time to read and he dreaded the scrolls getting soaked to illegibility philokles came abreast of him is this spot sacred or may i ride here kineas snapped to full awareness sacred he said only niceas ever rides with you or ataelus i suppose and coenus when he needs a vent for his scholarship and im bored and my thighs are burning and a little gentle conversation might get another few stades out of me kineas was looking over the spartans head i think youve come to the wrong place for gentle conversation niceas he raised a hand halt chargers and armour now the orderly column fell apart the old soldiers were the fastest niceas was in his armour and up on his best warhorse while ajax was still fumbling at a basket pannier for the sword hed been lent philokles had no armour so he sat on his horse and watched kineas don his own what did you see he asked ataelus hes coming in towards us at a flat gallop and shooting behind him a nice trick if you can learn it no farther away look up the valley kineas had his breast and back plate fastened his helmet locked and the hinged cheek pieces down and was trying to get control of his charger who was not having any of it another minute passed as men forced their helmets on or fought with straps and buckles niceas served out javelins kineas finally got up on his warhorse embarrassed by looking like a new recruit in front of his men the grass here grew in heavy tufts that formed small mounds and made walking nearly impossible and mounting even more difficult horses on the other hand seemed to walk easily among the tussocks from a distance the hilly plain stretched away to the hills beyond like a rippled green cloth with no sign of the treacherous ground under the lush green grass ataelus was one grassy rise away and kineas could see riders pursuing him a few stades back they were small men on small horses a few had bows most had javelins and none had armour there were quite a few of them even as they watched ataelus changed direction riding wide of kineass troop and heading north beyond bowshot diodorus take take ajax and support the scyth get on their flank and harry them if they ignore you the rest of you knee to knee now two lines and move he had ten fighting men a tiny number but they had some advantages and the scyth had brought the getae in close he thought that hed have one chance to charge them and scatter them force them into close action where his big grainfed military horses would overpower their ponies on me trot the getae were still coming on at this distance they might just be seeing the armour and the horse size would be hard to judge at them kineas had his horse in hand was ready for the change to the long surge of the beasts powerful hindquarters he trusted the stallion to know how to gallop over the tussocks if he misjudged theyd be dead in a heartbeat artemis he cried and the veterans took it up artemis artemis it was a pale thin remnant of the sound that three hundred of them had made but loud enough the initial charge was going to be successful he could feel it already in his balls see the next act of the play as easily as if he had written it himself he rose a little in his seat pressed his horses sides with his knees and threw his light javelin into the side of a getae the next one pivoted his pony on its haunches pulling her mouth viciously but he was too slow and kineass warhorse rode the smaller horse over without changing gait a boy brave or perhaps simply frozen waited for him sitting on his horse with his bow drawn kineas put his head down to take the point of the arrow on his helmet and leaned forward with his heavy javelin the bow twanged a singular sound even in the melee the arrow missed it went the gods knew where and kineas reversed his javelin in both hands and swung it like a staff knocking the boy clear of the saddle at the end of the stroke he reversed the staff again and turned his head he drew rein used his rein hand to push the helmet back on his head so that he could see and snapped his head right and left looking for friends and foes niceas was right by him mumbling a litany of prayers to athena his heavy javelin reversed and held short in his fist dripping red on to the ground antigonus was on his other flank with his heavy sword out his horse was giving him trouble skipping and hopping smell of blood new horse kineas didnt have to think about these details he just knew them just as he could see the shape of a fight in his mind coenus and agis were side by side a few horse lengths away coenus was just finishing a man in the grass he had a long red mark down his right thigh none of the others appeared to be hurt kineas used his knees to push his horse around in a tight circle one man was down his count was one short there were dead and dying getae all around him in the grass and a double handful already a hillside away even as he watched one of them took an arrow full in the back from ataeluss bow and the man fell slowly losing his seat and finally collapsing to the ground his horse stopped and began to crop grass the other getae continued to run agis tried a long javelin throw from horseback missed swore and then the surviving getae were swallowed by a hillside and the fight was over no time at all had passed since kineas had first spotted the scyth coming back the blink of an eye kineas had done something to his back and had the pain of a pulled muscle in his shoulder he felt as if he had pushed a plough in a field for a whole day he turned to niceas whos down niceas shook his helmeted head ill find out sir and he rode away after a few moments niceas rode back his shoulder hunched like an old man graccus he said he turned away hand on his amulet then looked at kineas he got an arrow in the bole of his throat as soon as we went to the gallop dead kineas knew that niceas and graccus had been friends sometimes more than friends what a waste stupid barbarians we must have killed ten of them more than ten and three prisoners the boy you levelled you want him kineas nodded thats why i didnt kill him yes he and crax can plot behind our backs niceas nodded heavily the other two theyre wounded kineas could hear someone making a horrible pitiful mewling alternating with a fullthroated roar of anguish he rode back to the first man he had downed it was a good throw the javelin was through his chest and had probably cut his heart he gave the shaft a halfhearted tug without leaving the saddle it didnt budge he kept going riding carefully over the tussocks until he came to the wounded men the loud one was hit in the guts by a throwing javelin he might live a long time but it would be horrible the other man had lost a hand to somebodys heavy sword he was bleeding out his face empty he was trying to stop the flow of blood with his other hand but he wasnt really strong enough he had also soiled himself from the pain it was like the end of every action war in all its glory kineas rode over to the screaming man and thrust his heavy javelin through the mans upturned face thrust twist the man fell forward across his own lap instantly silent the other man turned and looked up at him he raised his eyebrows a little as if surprised do the thing he said in weak guttural greek kineas saluted his courage and prayed to athena that when it was his turn hed be as brave thrust twist the second man died as fast as the first graccus can have them to work the ferrymans oars poor bastards niceas get the slaves moving we need all the javelins back i left mine about a stade deep in that poor bastard over there anyone else hit he looked around put graccus over his horse ajax was looking at him with loathing he was clutching his arm kineas pointed at him ajax show me your arm ajax shook his head but the corners of his mouth were white antigonus get ajax off his horse and see to his arm ajax thats what war is thats all it is boy men killing men usually the strong killing the weak right the rest of you dismount except lykeles and ataelus you and the scyth collect the horses lykeles was one of the best riders and horses loved him he rode out the scyth was already out on the plain using his short sword to take the hair off men he had killed it was a grisly piece of barbarism and kineas didnt spare him more than a glance kineas stayed mounted in his armour he rode from man to man exchanging a few words a jest or a curse making sure they werent wounded the godgiven spirit that flooded a good man in a fight could rob him of the ability to feel a wound kineas had seen men good men drop dead after a fight pools of blood around them without ever knowing they had taken a wound horses could go the same way as if they too were touched by the daimon of war coenuss wound was minor but kineas set niceas to look after it while he tended ajax when he had seen to the others kineas cantered his horse to the top of the next rise and looked past the slope towards the hills in the distance carrion birds were already coming in to the feast of ares the smell of blood and excrement lay over the smell of sun and grass polluting it his shoulders sagged and his hands shook for a while but the getae didnt come back and in time he had control of himself the getae horses were rounded up the few wounds coated in honey and the column moved off across the sea of grass they made camp early because the men were tired they found a small steam with a handful of old trees growing on the bank with enough downed wood to make a fire crax was working kineas was happy to note he moved heavily but he moved the other getae boy was still out ajaxs slave was cooking a stew of deer meat and barley from their stores the men ate it hungrily and then sat quietly niceas didnt speak except to ask about the burial of his friend but kineas shook his head town tomorrow he said well give him a pyre niceas nodded slowly and went to take a second helping of food ajax avoided kineas staying around the fire from him philokles who had played no part in the fight came and lay on the ground next to him where he sat with his bowl of stew the spartan indicated ajax with a thrust of his jaw hes in a state he said you should talk to him no he watched me kill the captives he thinks kineas paused searching for words im in a state too bah he needs to grow up talk to him about it or send him home philokles took a mouthful of his own food dropped a heavy piece of campaign bread into his bowl to soften it maybe tomorrow as you say but id do it tonight you remember your first fight yes kineas remembered them all you kill anyone no kineas said and he laughed because his first fight had been a disaster and he and all the athenian hippeis had ridden clear without blooding their weapons and hated themselves for it hoplites disdained the hippeis because they could ride out of a rout philokles pushed his jaw at the boy while chewing he cut that mans hand off one blow and then the poor bastard lived and you had to put him down see a lot for a boy to think about he took a bite of his bread and chewed some of the stew clung to his beard youre the fucking philosopher spartan you talk to him philokles nodded a few times silently he took another bite of bread and wiped his beard clean with his fingers and he looked at kineas while he chewed kineas held his gaze irritated at being badgered but not really angry philokles kept chewing swallowed youre not as tough as you act are you kineas shook his head hes a nice kid you want me to go tell him what everyone else around this fire knows yes except that once he knows hell never be a nice kid again will he philokles rolled over so that he was lying on his stomach and staring at the fire or maybe the contents of his bowl if thats what you tell him me id tell him in the terms he understands honour virtue why not is that really honour and virtue in sparta killing prisoners because theyre too much trouble to save if killing those two is eating your liver why did you do it i wasnt close but it looked to me like they should have wanted a quick end philokles slurped some soup from his bowl ares and aphrodite kineas the boy isnt suffering because you put those two down thats just what hell tell himself its because he knows that hes responsible he did it he cut the hand off he fought in effect he killed how many fights have you seen twenty or fifty more than enough kineas shrugged i see where you are leading the donkey though fair enough philosopher im old enough to ignore the men i kill and i still feel it so it follows that the boy will feel it worse and blame me why not his blame lies lightly enough on me you think so he worshipped you this morning the spartan rolled back to look at kineas i think youd both be happier if you talked happier and wiser and hell be a better man for it kineas nodded slowly why are you with us philokles smiled widely im running out of places to go where they speak greek angry husbands kineas smiled getting to his feet best to get this over with i think that i ask too many questions philokles smiled back honour and virtue kineas began and looked at ajax across the fire admit it kineas you still believe in both of them you want what is good you strive for what is virtuous go tell it to the boy philokles waved him away get going i intend to eat your stew while you are gone kineas snatched his bowl from the other man and refilled it at the common cauldron as he passed by tradition the captain ate last but everyone had eaten most men twice even the slaves kineas scraped the side of the bronze with his wooden bowl while he filled his bowl antigonus came up and refilled his own fair haul for barbarians twelve horses some gold and silver a few good weapons ill divide it after dinner antigonus nodded it will make the men feel better he said diodorus listening in nodded graccus lived through all those years with the boy king just to die on the plains in a gang fight with stupid barbarians sticks in our throats kineas nodded ill keep it in mind he said and went and sat by ajax he did it so suddenly that the boy didnt have time to bolt he was just rising when kineas put out a hand stay where you are hows your arm fine long gash does it sting no yes it does but if you keep honey on it and dont go mad from the flies itll heal in a week it wont hurt in two weeks and by then youll have forgotten his face ajax took a quick breath im sorry i killed him without asking you perhaps you would have kept him but he was a man of my age and he had never been a slave missing a hand like a criminal no way for him to live as a crippled slave does that make it right ajax asked his voice was steady even light as if the question had no consequence right they attacked us ajax we were crossing this land on the plain below their hills they came for our heads and our horses next time we may be the ones in their territory going right up to their huts in the hills and putting fire to their thatch thats what soldiers do thats a different kind of right the right of strength of one polis against another where you trust that the men who voted for war had their reasons and you do your duty this was a simpler right the right to resist aggression like killing a thief you killed both of them and then you said you said that thats all there was the strong killing the weak less steady let me tell you the truth its a rotten truth but if you can handle it maybe youll make a soldier ready try me im the captain yes yes rank means you do what is hard killing unarmed men is rotten work sometimes we all do it but usually i do it so that other men dont have to ajax watched the fire for a while you make it sound like a virtue im not done yet go on then ajax turned and looked at him mostly when the polis makes war or all of greece or the whole hellenic world goes to war think about it do all the men go to war no do all of the warriors go all the men trained to war ajax laughed without happiness no no a few men go sometimes more than a few and the only thing that makes their profession noble is that they do it so that the others dont have to youre a mercenary spat ajax you knew that before you came i know why do you think i find myself so craven now i knew just what happened here and i came anyway and now i have no stomach for it ajax had tears running down his cheeks i fight for other men and for my own profit it is a hard life full of hard men i dont recommend you become one of them ajax if you wish to leave ill send someone back to the ferry with you on the other hand if you wish to stay you have to answer for yourself if you can do this and be a good man kineas rose to his feet felt the age in his knees and thighs you wont like the next part the ugliest part after the killing but you should watch he rubbed at his unshaven chin besides the division of spoils is part of war and its in the iliad so it cant be wrong kineas put a hand on his shoulder and ajax didnt shrug it off then he walked off dropping his bowl by a slave washing his hands in a leather bucket and then stood by diodorus and the string of captured horses crax had the sum of all the valuables from the bodies on a bloody tunic at his feet his face betrayed no emotion but kineas could see tension in his stance and in his shoulders recognition perhaps of the origin of the brooches and pins on the blanket at his feet kineas didnt have to speak to gather the attention of the men he raised a hand for attention gentlemen as is our custom we will divide the spoils of our enemies by share in turns for the good of the company i take these kineas reached among the brooches and took both of the large gold ones they were worth twenty owls apiece and would feed the horses for several days in a city no one demurred although they were easily the most valuable objects in the pile then he pointed to the scyth ataelus discovered their war party and gave us warning he also slew four of them i say he gets the first share it was uncommon for a new man or a barbarian to be given the first share there was a buzz of talk but not an ugly one on the one hand there wasnt much spoil to divide and first choice wasnt a matter of heaps of gold on the other hand the buzz seemed to say the scyth had probably saved all of them or at least saved them from a harder fight antigonus himself a barbarian born raised a fist at the scyth first share he rumbled other men took up the cry ataelus looked around as if making sure he was being chosen he grinned from ear to ear then he went to the string of captured horses and leaped astride the tallest a pale bay mare with a small head and some persian blood in her he gave a loud yip yip and then dismounted to release her from the string it didnt surprise kineas that the scyth took a horse but it pleased the men who wanted the ready cash in the form of silver and coins the tradition of a first share to the man judged most worthy was often a twoedged sword causing resentment as easily as it rewarded military virtue but ataeluss choice made him popular or perhaps more popular the rest of the division was by strict seniority niceas chose second and whatever grief he might feel for graccus he chose carefully from the pile a heavy silver torc with a chain attached that was worth a months pay ill armoured as the getae had been they wore good jewellery and carried coins the other men each took a share in turn and there were plenty of items left after the first share had passed ajax did not join in the sharing but philokles did and no one complained the spartan was already accepted kineas allowed them to circle around again so that most men had at least a dozen owls worth of silver and some had more what was left on the tunic after the second sharing was mostly bronze with a few small silver rings slaves kineas said he pointed at the tunic ajaxs slave came forward willingly he had become the head slave by age and experience and he didnt hesitate but took the largest silver ring and put it on his hand then he winked at crax craxs face in the firelight showed the tracks of tears like rivulets on a hillside after a storm nonetheless he reached down and took another silver ring then they divided the bronze coins between them no one noticed this last division because they were examining the horses bickering over their small size and complaining that the scyth had taken the only good one the sun slipped under the hills to the west while they divided the horses ataelus came up to kineas me look he asked pointing at the two heavy brooches in kineass hand kineas handed them over the scyth looked at them in the last light the red sun colouring the gold so that it looked like new minted copper he nodded make for my people he said he pointed to the horse and stag motif that ran through both they were very fine for barbarian work the haunches of the horse well worked the head of the stag noble and fine while ataelus looked at the brooches kineas glanced at ajax twice but the young man showed nothing but weary resignation at the evils of an older generation ataelus handed the brooches back and returned to gloating over his horse kineas shrugged took his cloak and rolled in it on the ground he didnt think of artemis and then it was morning dawn patrol brought no surprises the girths were well attached the baggage loaded and ajaxs slave whistled while he scraped the cauldron ataelus had curried both of his horses until their coats shone his example got others to currying which pleased kineas who liked men to look their best every day kineas rode off apart to have a moment to himself he watched them working watched the last items roped down to the packhorses plenty of them now and lighter loads for each which meant theyd move faster ajaxs slave waited patiently by his knee when kineas noticed him the slave bowed his head parn me sir kineas felt that the mans whistling had helped to set the tone of the morning that sharing the booty with the slaves had somehow pleased the gods i dont know your name the slave bowed his head again arni kineas chewed the barbarian name a little what is it arni parn me fur askin i wunnert if we ifn thered be more fightn he looked eager i cin fight ifn you were to want it could take a swort or a knife plenty left a yesterday arming slaves was always a dangerous business crossing the plains however was the immediate problem only until we reach a town and crax the slave smiled give im a few days aye ell come round kineas nodded watch he doesnt take your weapon and kill us all before he does so arni smiled shook his head and withdrew horses shining richer and with a score of remounts the column rode across the plains three days of uneventful travel brought them to the scatter of greek homesteads surrounding antiphilous antiphilous was a settlement so small it could barely be thought of as a colony indeed it was the colony of a colony guarding the southern flank of the more prosperous towns of tyras and nikanou both centres of the grain trade with the interior because they controlled access to a bay so deep it was like a small sea kineas had never seen any of them but hed heard enough to have a sense of the area he gave an inward sigh of relief when his horses hoofs were on the gravelled dirt of a greek road their arrival made an instant stir in antiphilous it was easy to see that not many caravans crossed the sea of grass because householders stood on their porticoes to watch the column pass slaves gaped and the men of the town hurried for their spears and stood in the sun of the small agora ready to repel invasion when they discovered that kineas had no ill intent they hurried to wring every possible profit from him asking a grim price for their grain the cheapest grain in the world right at the source at athenian famine prices a scuffle in an ugly wine shop caught kineass attention he motioned to niceas get a days grain for the horses dont budge an obol on our campaign price ill be back he raised his legs over the horses back and slid off checked his sword and pushed through the curtain of wooden beads that masked the entrance of the wine shop inside lykeles and philokles had swords in their hands coenus had a man down and was tickling his throat with his sword he tried to cheat us on the measure lykeles said defensively he knew that kineas hated any kind of incident with citizens lykeles considered himself a gentleman although he wasnt as well born as coenus or laertes so you hit him and drew your swords get outside all of you kineass hands didnt leave his belt but his voice was cold philokles stood up straight and drank off the measure of wine in his hand he seemed disposed to argue the point now said kineas philokles met his eye his eyes shone with ferocity like an animal and he gave kineas a slight nod as if to say that he would obey this time he looked like a different man entirely but he went outside kineas could see that the shopkeeper was in fact a slave a grimmer looking specimen he had seldom seen he threw him some bronze coins the slave swore and demanded more lies frothing from him like spit bubbles kineas stood his ground until the slave was silent and then went back outside niceas was still dickering with a grain factor and a crowd of men had started to gather in the agora many with their spears again diodorus pushed forward through the horses of the column the ferrys closed some nonsense they want to gouge us for the price if you want my guess kineas nodded id say they didnt like us trade with the getae the gods only know and they dont like ataelus kineas nodded again his eyes flicking up and down the column mount up he said lets get out of here they were out of antiphilous as quickly as they had entered and they werent going to be crossing the ferry to nikanou which meant that they were about to ride for days into the heartland of more barbarians in order to go around the bay kineas thought he might have just made a hurried and foolish decision but there had been something rotten about antiphilous and some god had whispered to him that it was time to move a whispering he never ignored ten stades south of the town when he was questioning his decision and trying to ignore the sullen silence of the company they came across a lone greek homestead whose farmer was busy trying to unbury a plough with two young slaves and a horse before the sun had slipped another finger towards the west they had struck a bargain and were camped amidst the mans olive trees and the whole string of horses were gorging on grain at a price that pleased everyone so much that most of the men stripped off their tunics and threw themselves at the recalcitrant plough pushing and calling and laughing until the blade pulled free and then running down to the sandy shore of the bay and flinging themselves in the water with the noise of a cavalry charge artemis artemis kineas accepted a proffered cup of wine from the farmer alexander and sat with his legs crossed on a finely carved stool in the farms courtyard enjoying the shade of the one and only tree no one much comes this way except the grain ships looking for a load the farmer said cant remember the last time i saw a party going around the bay the long way he nodded to the west i see you have a scyth with you thats good thinking theyre everywhere west of here another twenty stades youll be intercepted every day by a band kineas sat listening with his chin on his hand are they trouble alexander shook his head none to me and dont let some fools tell you otherwise i give em a cup of wine when they ride by and im civil and thats all it takes for barbarians theyre a good lot they are hellions when they drink hard and they are mean when crossed so dont cross em says i my wifes afraid of em shes sindi so stands to reason dont it kineas thought that the man was starved for conversation sindi he asked the farmer jerked a thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the coast scythians is no more native here than you an me the sindi was here first or so they say they do the farming the scyths just tax the grain they grow and then the greeks tax it again at the towns but for all that its cheap not for us we tried to buy grain in town they wanted athens prices alexander laughed they figured you had no other choice riding across the plains youre either damn smart or a born fool i see you tangled with the getae kineas nodded nice ponies id be happy to buy a couple kineas sipped his wine they are the property of my men youd have to bargain with them easier if i bargain with you ill give you fifty measures of grain and two silver owls per pony kineas reckoned quickly with bags baskets no bags im short on cloth as it is but theyre good baskets done i can sell four kineas was calculating what price to give the grain so that the men made a profit on their ponies easy money if you lived the next day dawned bleak and rainy with heavy clouds in the west and waves rolling across the bay better by night but youll be soaked by then said alexander you should stay those nags of yours could use a day to eat we could bake you all some fish come on kineas stay a day kineas had forgotten what it was like to feel welcome so few men would welcome a troop of mercenaries but that sort of trouble had never happened here alexander had taken a few precautions his gates were locked at night and although he had daughters kineas had not laid eyes on them they were probably locked in a basement or restricted to the upper rooms of the farms exedra sons were a different matter alexander had half a dozen sons ranging from the quiet hardworking eldest a tall modest man of twentyfive with a young beard to ictinus whom they all called echo echo could be heard at all hours trailing the soldiers repeating anything they said trying to help he was fifteen and tried to sport a beard all six sons appeared together to build a fire on the beach in the afternoon when the sky as predicted showed signs of clearing the clearing had happened to fast that the sky was blue and clear and the tents were dry before the afternoon began to wane all the men looked forward to eating fish barley and meat were good enough but hard food to have to face every day when their gear was clean and repaired all the men gathered wood for graccuss pyre alexander the farmer was kind enough to allow them to take wood from his orchards and there was driftwood on the beach they built him a pyre as tall as two men and laid his body atop it in the old way he already stank of death but they washed his body and arranged his limbs anyway graccus had been quite popular the sons prepared the fish with their mother in a remarkable way first they had one single enormous fish acquired in late morning from a passing log boat they layered the whole fish in clay built a fire pit in the sand burned a bonfire over the pit as soon as the rain ceased and then buried the claycoated fish in hot coals with iron shovels kineas spent most of the day pushing his men to cleaning and oiling their tack currying horses and mending the farmer was remarkably forthcoming with the requirements of mending from flax thread and oil to bits of leather his hospitality made kineas suspicious he disliked having to be suspicious of such favour but he was he posted a sentry on the horses he arranged the sale of four of the getae ponies and transferred them to their new owner watching with satisfaction as basketwoven panniers full of grain were arranged for the other ponies he would leave the farm with more grain than he had started the expedition returning from reviewing the proceeds of the sale he lay down on his cloak inside his tent to discover that his light throwingjavelin had been polished the head gleaming like a mirror the wood shaft carefully oiled so that the grain of the wood swam like fish in a stream his heavy javelin lay beside it equally well cared for he found the slave arni sitting with the other slaves playing knucklebones they all got to their feet sheepishly crax avoiding his eye and the new boy the getae whose life he had spared wincing as he rose i usually care for my own weapons arni but i thank you for the care you lavished on them kineas offered him a bronze obol arni shook his head and smiled showing a number of gaps in his teeth warnt me soldiers weapons is their tools i tell em not our work boy wouldnt listen though arni looked at crax fondly crax looked kineas in the eye i cleaned them the throwing javelin was damaged in the fight i cut the shaft a few fingers and reset the head one of the farm boys drove the rivets so youve decided to grow up kineas thought he tossed the younger slave the obol you did a beautiful job crax you remember what i told you good job youd be a free man yes sir he was very serious i meant it same for your new little brother there i dont need slaves i need men who can ride and fight and i need to know which you both plan to be by the time we ride into olbia ten days two weeks at the outside understand crax said yes sir the new boy looked terrified crax nudged him and said something barbarian and the new boy coughed and mumbled something that might have been yes sir in what might have passed for greek kineas left the slaves to their share of the day of rest and walked back to the beach where couches of straw had been prepared for twenty he could smell the fish baking through the embers in the ground he wondered if the clay would turn to pottery around the fish it did as the charioteer prepared to drive the sun under the world they sat down to feast on the fish with proper sauces and some wine heavy red wine a little past its best days but heady stuff alexander toasted and drank and so did his sons as did every man of kineass troop until the last light was gone from the sky and the bones of the giant fish were picked clean diodorus on the next couch of straw gave a yawn and stretched his hair a halo of fire in the last of the sun better day than i expected when we was in that rotten little town thanks to you alexander and the blessing of the gods on you and yours for your hospitality kineas poured a libation on the ground and raised his kylix high hear me athena protector of soldiers this man has been our friend and given us sacred hospitality bring him good fortune one by one other soldiers added their benisons some spoke with simple piety others with aristocratic rhetoric when the cup returned to kineas he again poured a libation this is the best well come to a funeral feast for graccus so i drink to him and may his shade go down to hades and dwell with heroes or whatever fate he might best enjoy unlike kineas graccus had been a devotee of demeter kineas was not an initiate and had no wish to know what fate such men imagined in the afterlife but he wished the mans shade well niceas begged the hosts indulgence and then told a few tales of graccuss courage and a comic one of his boastfulness and all the men laughed the eyes of the farmers younger sons shining like silver owls in the firelight and then they were all telling tales of graccus and other men who had fallen in the last few years coenus rose and stood with one hand on his hip and told the story of the fight on the fords of the euphrates when twenty of them on a scout caught the tail of dariuss army in the moonlight graccus was the first to take a life he said in the phrasing of the poet and a mede splashed into the river at his feet when he plunged his spear into the mans neck laertes told of how graccus fought a duel with one of the macedonian officers on horseback with javelins it had made him famous and notorious in a day and what kineas best remembered was the time hed spent averting king alexanders wrath but it made a good story alexander the farmer listened politely and mixed the wine with lots of water like a man who was being well entertained and his sons sat and drank it all in the eldest listened like a man being visited by men from another world but echo listened like a hungry man watching food finally agis the closest they had to a priest rose and spilled wine on the sand some say it is a bitter thing when the bronze bites home and the darkness falls over your eyes some say that death is the end of life and some say it is the start of something new he raised his cup but i say that graccus was courteous and brave that he feared the gods and died with a spear in his hand hard death is the lot of every man and woman born and graccus went to his with a song on his lips agis took a brand from the fire pitchfilled pine that flared in the wind and every man there even the farmers sons took more and they walked along the beach to the funeral pyre they sang the hymn to demeter and they sang the paean and then they flung their torches into the pile it burst into flame as if a bolt from zeus had struck it a good omen they watched it burn until the heat drove them back as well as the smell of roast meat then they drank again later they rose from the straw and bowed the betterborn soldiers offering wellturned compliments to the host and went off to sleep on the straw pallets in their tents kineas walked back with niceas who had tears running down his face he had cried quietly for an hour but the tears were drying now i cant remember a symposium i liked so much kineas nodded it was kindly done niceas said ill give him my booty horse in the morning let it be from graccus for his feast and thank you sir for thinking of him i was afraid you had forgotten kineas shook his head he punched his hyperetes in the shoulder and then embraced him other men came and embraced niceas even hesitantly ajax in the morning the pyre still smouldered and the sun rose in splendour casting a pink and yellow glow across everything before he was halfway over the rim of the world kineas heard the phrase rosyfingered dawn a dozen times before he had his horse bridled niceas arranged with young echo to fetch the hot bones from the pyre when they cooled and then bury them in the family graveyard the column formed quickly and neatly every packhorse bulging like a pregnant donkey with baskets of grain everyone knew their place by now and things happened more quickly the tent came down fast cloaks were rolled and stowed horses fetched in from hobbles neither kineas nor niceas had to oversee the process so rosy fingered dawn had not yet given way to full day before kineas mounted was saluting alexander in his yard niceas had already given him a horse it was a pleasure to leave a place with friends left behind niceas looked back as they rode over the first hill that boy will tend his grave as if he was one of the heroes he said tears were running down his cheeks better burial than any of us have a right to expect kineas said and niceas made the peasant sign to avert an evil fate a stade later philokles rode up beside him think youll ever be that man kineas grunted a farmer wife sons philokles laughed daughters kineas shook his head i dont think i could go back philokles raised his eyebrows why not calchus and isokles would have you in a flash kineas shook his head you ask the damnedest questions does some god whisper in your ear go and torment kineas philokles shook his head you interest me the captain the soldier of renown kineas sat back on his horse his ass high on the horses rump and crossed his legs it gave his thighs a rest at the cost of his behind oh come on youre a spartan you must have had a great deal of opportunity to plumb the thoughts of soldiers of renown philokles nodded curtly yes kineas said so i command what twelve men why me soldier of renown flatterer may your words go to zeus but my spartans would all claim they pined for a farm so many would say it that it has become the norm to say it perhaps even to think it perhaps i ask you because you are not a spartan heres my answer then once i wanted a farm and a wife now i think id die of boredom you love war pshaw i love notwar i love the preparation and the riding and the scouting and the planning camaraderie shared success all that the killing part is the price you pay for the notquitewar part farmers have to plan as well at least good farmers do really kineas raised both his eyebrows in a parody of a tragedians look of surprise philokles went on as if kineas had spoken with genuine surprise really good farmers plan carefully good farmers prepare and scout their whole farm is like a file of hoplites all trained to work together but thats not for you kineas shrugged no philokles nodded as if to himself his eyes on the distant hills perhaps it is something else kineas shook his head spartan do you ever talk about the weather or about music athletic events poetry women youve bedded any of those things philokles considered a moment not often kineas laughed why exactly are you with us he asked again philokles had begun to fall back along the column he waved to learn he shouted kineas cursed and looked around for ataelus the scyth had avoided the beachside symposium but he was otherwise now comfortable with most of the men especially antigonus and coenus a former slave and a former nobleman he had ridden off at the first blush of dawn to scout kineas wanted him back it was time to begin to worry kineas realized that he hadnt worried about anything in a day and he thanked the gods for alexander the farmer again calling down blessings on the man and he thought about being a farmer and he thought of the mans instant friendliness and wondered if he should have asked ataelus appeared on the crest of a hill well to the front sitting confidently on his getae horse and waiting for the column to reach him already kineas could recognize him at a distance just from his posture on the horse so ungreek so relaxed he might have been asleep closer up it became plain that he was kineas rode up to him cantering up the last rise ataelus was awake before he reached him a hand waved in greeting have a nice nap kineas asked long ride many things yes kineas nodded what did you see for me i see many things grass and hills also tracks of horses many running horses my people no stinking fuck themselves getae kineas felt a frisson of fear your people how recent when were they here yesterday maybe yesterday two days if not for rain the scyth had a poor command of greeks complexities with nouns and he tended to stick to the form he liked the dative for rain he said again as a question did it rain not yesterday kineas looked back at the column breasting the slope your people will they harm us ataelus slapped his chest not for me he grinned to go find them kineas pointed you are going to find them and come back back to us ataelus nodded find for them come back for you kineas nodded i want to keep moving he gestured at the column keep moving come back for you said ataelus still grinning he waved at the column turned his horse and rode off heading north kineas pulled his horses head back towards the column and ambled over to niceas who was watching the scyth ride hes found some of his own and hes going to meet them then hell come back at least thats what i think hes saying niceas swatted a fly with his hand more like ataelus all in a band thatll be exciting ares wept mutter a prayer we dont annoy them look at the fucking tracks kineass eyes followed niceass pointing hand they were riding over the ground that ataelus must have spotted a low trough between two hills that had the prints of hundreds of horses all moving together he realized that he was holding his breath two hundred horses easy niceas swatted at the fly pestering his horses neck caught it and crushed it between his fingers then flung the corpse of the thing from him in disgust better hope theyre friendly captain they rode the rest of the day without incident it was a sunny pleasant day on the plains water was sparser than kineas had expected and with ataelus gone he had to use lykeles as a scout for a camp he came back late near dusk nothing but the beach he said theres a trickle of water coming in enough to water us and the horses if we dont foul it its not much ive been fifteen stades kineas nodded see any tracks lykeles nodded were following them like as not next ridge over its like the path to a horse fair it was near dark by the time they dismounted the tents bloomed immediately the horses were hobbled close in antigonus and laertes took first watch immediately and stayed mounted the slaves collected driftwood on the beach for a fire while kineas debated with himself a fire was a clear signal for many miles especially on the shore of the bay on the other hand ataelus seemed confident that his people were no threat and yet ataelus was a barbarian for all his qualities nonetheless kineas gave arni the nod and watched him use a steel to raise sparks on charred linen for the fire on balance two hundred horses worth of bowwielding scythians would obliterate them if it came to that a force so strong compared with his own that it really wasnt worth worrying about as the flames rose however he watched them and worried anyway niceas had put him on watch with ajax at dawn ajax didnt avoid him any more but he was distant careful different from the eager youth of the first mornings on the other hand he knew his business now and he posted himself on a low ridge above the beach without the exchange of a word kineas curried the horses there were twentyeight of them a good string for twelve men and three slaves he curried his charger first and then his riding horse then niceass horses and then all the other chargers diodorus was up by then he woke the slaves and roused the fire and then lent a hand to the horses they were all up the work done their cloaks rolled and the baggage loaded before the suns chariot was full over the rim of the world the beach stretched away in a curve for a dozen stades and niceas elected to follow it he wanted to cross a decent stream and get water for the horses water was his current worry he waved to ajax on the ridge above them who waved back lykeles left the column and rode to join the young man and the pair of them flanked the column as they rode along the beach they crossed two tiny rivulets in the sand too easily fouled by the first horses to reach them by the third he was more careful sending dismounted men to lead their mounts one at a time to drink digging a pit in the sand for flow and letting it fill it still wasnt a good drink he sent laertes riding up the beach for water it felt odd to be so worried when the hillsides were damp between tufts of grass and their flank was covered by the sea but the smaller horses were already flagging laertes returned at noon decent sized river at the bottom of the bay plenty of water fresh as fresh lots of hoof marks too good job kineas rode back along the column right no lunch gentlemen well push through theres another of these little streams in a few stades added laertes hades we lose time every time and the horses scarcely get a drink worth a mention straight through how many stades to this river twenty i had a hard ride a morning gallop over the sand fair enough captain laertes grinned his characteristic grin and pushed his big straw hat back on his head youll be there by late afternoon at this rate then well camp there ajax caught his attention waving his hat from the ridge lykeles rode for them flat out his seat far back on his horses rump as she descended the ridge company coming kineas said his men were at the base of a steep ridge with the sea at their backs on jaded horses that needed water armour and chargers now he swung down from his riding horse and got his helmet and breastplate from bags on a packhorse other men and horses nudged him bumped him the column was in chaos he hoped that it would sort itself out lykeles shouted from his left kineas had his breast and back plates fastened and was wrestling with the leather cords that padded the crown of his helmet it was already growing warm from the sun promising to bake his head in a few minutes scythians lykeles called hundreds of them kineas used his heavy javelin to lever himself up on to his charger wheres ataelus no sign of him kineas got his seat always difficult in armour and managed to gain control of both of his reins crax appeared out of the dust and picked up his javelins and handed them up kineas pointed to the baggage horse with more javelins you want to be free he asked crax nodded take my riding horse mount it and take a pair of javelins and form on me you are now a free man crax was gone into the dust before he was done speaking two ranks on me form up kineas yelled the beach sand was kicking up with all the activity and he couldnt see the damned helmet didnt help he folded the cheek pieces back and tipped it up on his head lykeles had fallen in and niceas next to him and now others were coming up at speed crax pulled in behind him clumsy at keeping in formation like any new man but a born rider lykeles hadnt bothered with his helmet he turned to crax welcome to the hippeis boy and to kineas you freed him kineas felt a particular joy on him and the whisper of the god was clear freeing the boy had been the right act he made a lousy slave kineas barked and all the men laughed ajax finished a headlong flight down the ridge and pulled up on the left of the line at the top of the ridge there was a rustle of movement and the laughing stopped then in the blink of an eye the ridge was full of horses and riders the flash of coloured harnesses and the unmistakable gleam of gold repeated again and again so that the whole host of them glittered in the sun which also flashed off iron armour and bronze and spear points blessed athena stand with us now in the hour of our need intoned lykeles at his side niceas cursed profane and long kineas felt their appearance like a blow they were more splendid than any persian cavalry he had ever seen and better mounted they made his fourteen riders look poor and cheap too bad he thought better to have died on the boy kings campaign nonetheless silence sit at attention dont twitch be greeks persians had always been impressed by displays of discipline especially when facing odds kineas slammed his helmet down on the crown of his head and the cheek pieces bounced against his cheeks two riders separated themselves from the mass at the top of the hill and began to ride down a deepthroated trumpet sounded three times and the rest of the mass began to descend the hill at a sedate pace two horns growing from the flanks and cutting off the beach to north and south while the main body halted well within bowshot kineas thought that it was an impressive manoeuver especially for barbarians but he was breathing again because one of the approaching riders was clearly ataelus and the other was almost certainly a woman as they crossed the line of the beach they slowed kineas could see that ataeluss companion was slim straight shouldered and wore a pale leather coat with a blue lined design she also wore a gold neck plate that covered her from her throat to the middle of her chest her hair was tied back in two heavy braids closer yet and he could see she had dark blue eyes like the sea and heavy black brows that had never been plucked and which gave her a serious look and she was young kineas turned sit here like statues i think were going to live to tell this tale niceas on me kineas and niceas rode out on to the soft sand and met the approaching scythians ataelus raised his hand in greeting and said something to the woman she was silent then she said a few words like a gentle reminder it seemed to kineas greetings ataelus these are your people kineas tried to sound commanding and confident the woman was looking attentively past him at his little company no no but like for my people yes and she says not for liking not for seeing face yes ataelus spread his hands wide as if unable to explain the ways of women or commanders kineas handed his spears to niceas and took off his helmet greetings mistress he called she smiled and nodded her head she half turned her horse and motioned to the main line of horses another rider left the line and approached while watching the approaching man woman kineas saw now she spoke softly to ataelus it wasnt a short speech ataelus nodded halfway through the flow of words something surprised him and he remonstrated and in a second the two of them were spitting at each other in the barbarian tongue hermes of travellers thought kineas whatever she wants ataelus she stopped spitting and went back to the gentle voice ataelus began to nod again the second woman approached at a trot the trumpeter very persian except that kineas had heard it whispered ataelus turned back to him she says pay tax for riding over my land he paused she say two horses taken from getae bastards and she say half a talent of gold and i say we have nothing for halftalent of gold yes so she say for me gold and i say kineas for gold so give her gold and two horses and we friends and make feast and ride in peace so much for the company treasury arni get the black leather bag from my pack horse and bring it here he pointed at the baggage horses ask her if she would like to choose her horses he said ataelus translated she spoke she say you choose ataelus shrugged again kineas rode back to the baggage took the black bag from arni and picked the two finest of the getae horses lykeles and andronicuss they would have to be refunded from whatever was left in the common store he led them back on short reins and handed them to the woman who took them she put her hand over his for a moment her hand was very small compared with his fine fingered but with heavy joints from work he thought her hands were rough she had a heavy gold ring on her thumb and a green stone ring on another finger up close he could see that the blue linear decoration on her leather coat was worked in fine blue hair the gold cones full of coloured hair that dangled from the seams of her coat made music when she moved she was wearing a months pay for a full company of cavalry her horse was excellent as good as kineass own and that horse had been the charger of a persian nobleman he smiled at her as one professional to another as if they shared a joke she returned it in kind he opened the company treasury bag and handed it to her tell her that is what we have tell her to take what is fair i am not hiding anything she exclaimed in fact it didnt take any understanding of her barbarian tongue to understand that she was cursing like niceas she held up one of the gold brooches and her trumpeter barked something ataelus spoke briefly and pointed at kineas the scythian commander looked at him she took the two brooches and handed him the bag she spoke directly to him her eyes on his she say these for us these stolen you kill for getae good and more than you owe for tax these two so come and eat and i give you gift for these and she angry captain angry hard but not for us yes ataelus sat on his horse nodding kineas blessed the moment in which some god had sent him the scyth hermes almost certainly the god of travellers and thieves had sent him the scyth as a guide because without him this woman would have killed them all he could feel it he could feel the anger rolling off her making her ugly and hard she had a golden whip on her saddle and she waved it at him and spoke again just a few words and then whirled and galloped back to her main body with her trumpeter on her heels ataelus shook his head pity for getae bastards he said did something fucking stupid killed someone i not knowing for whom but fucked up going to die kineas took a deep breath you did tell her that we killed the man who was wearing these and scattered his riders she not care angry and young hey you owe me captain ataelus looked happy no shit said niceas his first words in ten minutes we all owe you atelus grinned showing some bad teeth he liked being the centre of approbation where you camp were going to camp at the river kineas pointed down the beach towards the site lykeles had located other scyths from the main body were riding down on them they didnt seem threatening in fact they seemed curious two of them rode right up until their ponies were nose to nose with the two greeks one of them pointed at kineas with his whip and called to ataelus he say good horse ataelus said ataelus looked around turned his horse and looked up the hill he seemed upset kineas had other things to occupy him in a few moments the company was surrounded by scythians riding around their formation pointing at things one whooped and suddenly they were all whooping they galloped off down the beach a stade and came to a halt ataelus rode back over gone he said he shrugged she say camp and eat but she gone he shook his head getae bastards for trouble are you think shes going against the getae right now just like that kineas had his eyes on the other scythians about twenty of them who were waiting down the beach he looked back at his men and the horses and he caught a glimpse of his captive the getae boy and an ugly thought came to him niceas get the men moving in armour now gentlemen right along the beach ignore the barbarians i have to bet they wont make trouble hermes send they do not make trouble the company moved off in double file kineas pulled his charger over to crax who was riding his mare he had to hold the charger hard his stallion liked the smell of the mare wrinkled his lips and snorted crax the moment we make camp i mean it you get the getae boy into a tent and stay there these barbarians he realized that there wasnt much he could say the barbarians were after the getae hed just fought them himself the distinction was likely to be lost on crax but crax understood he nodded the amazon wants blood just like that amazon kineas asked astonished at the former slaves erudition amazon women who fight crax looked back at the getae boy ill protect him dont make trouble boy kineas wished he had time to explain wished he understood anything about the politics of the plains or where those thricedamned brooches had originated from the column was moving the scyths were keeping their distance you are getae he asked crax glanced at him sideways and spat no he said bastarnae kineas had heard of the bastarnae but you know these people he asked crax shook his head the getae are thieves the scyths are monsters they never take slaves only kill and burn and go they have magic kineas rolled his eyes he wasnt the only one listening and he heard some comments behind him magic crax magic is a story to scare slaves and children crax nodded sure he looked around they have men he paused clearly uncertain about what to say they are horrible everyone says so the getae are just thieves he looked at kineas am i really free kineas said yes crax said i will fight for you for ever they made camp by the river before the sun had slanted far down the sky the tents went up quickly after kineas and niceas had made the reason plain to everyone and crax disappeared with the getae boy while the scythians were busy with their own camp ataelus didnt go with them he picketed his horses with the greeks and squatted down by the first fire to be lit kineas sat by him who is she he asked pointing to the eastern horizon for emphasis young for angry woman ataelus shrugged noble he used a word that usually meant virtuous in greek kineas puzzled it out shes well born a queen no small force big tribe assagatje tens of tens of tens of riders they can put on the plains and still have many for camp again they for ghan ghan like king for them yes ghan of assagatje big big man has nobles yes three tens of tens nobles all assagatje kineas took a deep breath the king of these assagatje has thousands of warriors and this is just a small band under a noble ataelus nodded and she is young and angry and maybe eager to make a name for herself and she took her troopers and went after the getae who are four days ride away getae feel fire tomorrow ataelus said the flatness of his answer gave kineas a chill tomorrow that ride took us three days assagatje are sakje sakje ride over grass like north wind for blow fast and fast and never for rest ataelus thumped his chest me sakje he thumped his chest ride for day ride for night ride for day again sleep for horse more horse for fight like captain yes niceas cut in from across the fire ares balls so shes going to hit the getae tomorrow and come back ataelus nodded vigorously he pounded his right fist in his open left hand making a noise like a sword hitting a body hit yes kineas and niceas exchanged a long glance kineas said right up in the last watch move as soon as there is light in the sky everyone not on watch get in your cloak kineas curled up next to diodorus who was not asleep what are we afraid of you paid the tax with our horses ill hasten to add kineas considered feigning sleep and not replying sure that every man in the tent was attending to a question only diodorus could ask him finally he said i dont know she was pleasant straighter than many an oligarch but when she saw those damned brooches i am afraid weve started something and i want to get to olbia ahead of whatever it is diodorus whistled softly youre the captain he said too right thought kineas and went to sleep artemis naked her broad back and narrow waist he so well remembered he came up behind her his prick stiff as a board like something an actor would wear and she turned and smiled at him over her shoulder but as she turned she was the assagatje noblewoman the gold gorget hiding her breasts and she spoke words in anger words that sounded like a snarl and in each hand she held one of the brooches and she slammed the pins into her eyes he awoke with diodoruss hand over his mouth you were screaming diodorus said kineas lay and shook he knew he had stronger dreams than other men and he knew the gods sent them but they often disturbed him nonetheless when the fit passed he rose took his own silver cup from a bag and poured wine into it from his own flagon walked well down the beach and poured the whole cup into the sea as a libation and he prayed olbia stood out from the low shoreline of the euxine like a painted statue in a dusty marketplace from where kineas sat on a low bluff across the great borasthenes river he could see a long peninsula projecting from the far shore a pall of smoke from thousands of fires coated the town like dust or soot but the temple of apollo rose in pristine splendour atop a steep hill at the base of the peninsula and the town filled the tip with solid walls as high as three men the highest walls kineas had seen since the siege of tyre the walls seemed out of place out of proportion to the size of the place and the position of the town and the town spilled over the walls small houses and mud buildings filling the ground from the base of the walls to the temple hill an illdefended suburb that would have to be sacrificed in the event of a siege olbia had two harbours one on either side of her peninsula and dolphins the symbol of the town sported in the water below him and gleamed gold on distant marble pillars at the town gates the golden dolphins reassured him almost at his feet was a proper polis gymnasia agora a theatre and a hippodrome kineas was glad to see that he had not led his men into a howling wilderness for nothing but the tall walls and the slovely suburb were at odds either the city needed to defend itself or it did not niceas coughed and a cloud of breath formed in front of his mouth it was cold the summer was long gone well need he coughed again this time too long well need a ferry hermes ill be happy to be in a bed with some straw kineas spotted what had to be the ferry crossing more than a mile from the mouth of the river well clear of the traffic in the harbour lets get you indoors niceas wasnt the only sick man only ataelus was immune to the cold he had a furlined hood taken at a dice game with the other scyths and a longer cloak the hard clear air didnt give him sniffles or a cough and he still slept outside with his reins in his hand the other sakje had ridden away two days before returning to their woman leader wherever she was once they had taken kineas to the mouth of the borasthenes they had been good guests good hosts and everyone had dined on their hunting skills night after night most of the men had picked up a few words of their language and the deep grunt uuhaah they made when they won at dice as they rode down to the ford the horses picking their way through long grass silvered with late morning frost kineas trotted over to ataelus we all owe you a debt of thanks you are a fine scout ataelus smiled then shrugged it is for good for with you he looked at his riding whip as if finding some flaw to cover his embarrassment good with you me i stay you give a more horse yes kineas had not expected this it made his morning you want to stay with us and you want me to give you another horse ataelus held up his hand more horse and more horse you chief yes bigger chief in city yes i get more horse when you get more horse ataelus shrugged as if this was the most obvious thing in the world diodorus more horse antigonus more horse even crax more horse why else fight for city yes kineas reached out and they clasped hands in this respect the scythians and greeks were brothers they clasped hands to show friendship and agreement im very glad you wish to stay ataelus nodded smiled again almost flirtatiously good lets go drink wine but it wasnt that simple their arrival at the ferry caused a commotion a dozen obviously armed men with no trade goods and a scythian it took all of kineass various skills as a leader and as a bully to get the ferryman to load his men and when they arrived on the other side with thirty very cold wet horses soldiers met them please state your business said the officer he was a big man with long dark hair a dark complexion like a levanter or an african a huge beard and expensive armour under a voluminous black cloak and his men were well armed and well disciplined the officer wasnt rude but he was direct you have scared a number of people kineas was ready with his letter and he held it out i was hired to come here and command the hippeis here is my letter from the archon the letter was a little the worse for having travelled from this spot to athens by sea and back again in a saddlebag but it was still legible the officer read it carefully kineas had time to wonder how many things might have gone wrong in six months another man took the commission the archon died the city had changed government the big man returned his letter welcome to olbia kineas of athens the archon hoped it was you but we expected you by boat many weeks ago now he was regarding kineas carefully kineas knew the look every officer in alexanders army watched his rivals just that way kineas stuck out his hand kineas son of eumenes of athens the officer took his hand firmly memnon son of petrocles you served with the conqueror i did kineas motioned to his men to start unloading i was at issus but with the great king he turned and bellowed an order and his men brought their spears to the rest then down butt first on to the ground take your ease he called his voice was not as low as his size had led kineas to expect and he gave his orders in a curious singsong greek his men stopped being automatons and became quite human dropping their heavy shields and pulling their cloaks around them looking with undisguised curiosity at kineass men town slaves came from behind the hoplites and began to make bundles of their gear and place it on their heads they were mostly persians kineas watched them he had seldom seen persians used as slaves memnon followed his interest the great king made a foray against a local brigand a few years back and the result was a market glutted with persians kineas nodded a scythian brigand memnon smiled out of half his mouth is there another kind kineas saw that niceas in betwen coughing fits had the men currying the cold wet horses on the spot good he put a hand on niceass shoulder this is niceas my hyperetes and diodorus my second in command he looked through the group again where is philokles he was just here said diodorus memnon watched them all carefully one of your men is missing diodorus laughed i imagine he headed for the nearest wineseller well find him he gave kineas a minute shrug kineas interpreted the gesture to mean that philokles was on an errand or had business of his own diodorus apparently knew what was happening kineas did not so he merely said well find him soon enough never mind the archon is waiting memnon smiled unpleasantly he hates to be kept waiting it took an hour for all of kineass men to find their quarters they had been put in the citys hippodrome in a newlybuilt barracks by the stables the rooms were new but small and none of his men least of all the gentlemen was in a mood to be pleased he gathered them all in the stable stay here clean the place get it warm and bathe i want niceas and diodorus with me to attend the archon the rest of you this is where we are i suggest you find a way to like it he spoke sharply perhaps more sharply than he meant and find the spartan then unbathed he changed into a clean tunic good sandals and combed his hair and beard in the entryway of the barracks he met with diodorus who looked clean and neat as a newly forged pin and niceas who looked like a man with a serious head cold a soldier and a town slave waited outside the slave to carry anything that might be wanted the soldier to take them to the archon the soldier led them to the towns citadel a stonebuilt tower with heavy bastions and walls a dozen feet thick memnons men guarded the entrance forbidding in their cloaks more of them guarded the closed doors at the end of a long cold portico the walls and the guards prepared kineas to some extent for what awaited him no archon of a free city needed mercenary guards a citadel and an antechamber the archon of a free city would be at his house or in the agora doing business and so he wasnt surprised when the guards at the doors indicated that his men were not welcome he gestured that they should wait for him and passed on a guard took his sword a barbarian in a torq kineas watched the closed doors open and heard the clash of arms within more guards and followed his guide into a warm dark room decorated in gold with a heavy hand statues of the gods their clothes picked out in gold persian hangings shot with gold thread gold lamps suspended on chains from the ceiling that gave a faint gold light an iron brazier with gold legs that glowed red and vented scented smoke a gold screen a table set with gold cups and a huge golden bowl and behind the table almost invisible in the scented murk a man with a diadem was seated on a chair memnon stood behind him his armour appearing to glow in the ruddy light flanking the man in the diadem stood a pair of heavily muscled men in lion skins holding heavy clubs kineas of athens the voice was soft very quiet the smoke from the brazier and the darkness made the voice appear to come from throughout the room like the voice of a god you are late by fifty days a soft laugh it is not easy to travel to the end of the earth is it please help yourself to the wine at your elbow tell me about your adventures there is little to tell archon i sought to bring my own horses and i have i apologize for being late kineas found himself off balance the incense in the smoke was cloying it bit at his throat unpleasantly and the men in skins more barbarians seemed to be a direct threat you have no need to apologize young man at least for being late these things can happen please tell me how you came here i came by sea to tomis and then by land with my horses come young man more detail what can i say we had a brush with some bandits we met with a group of sakje kineas was wary he had the sense that a trap was being laid for him the bandits you fought were getae yes unfortunate that they are allies of this city and the sakje truly the worst bandits of the lot you were lucky to escape with your skin the getae were a few men under a local leader they attacked us for our horses kineas grabbed a handful of his beard as he often did when puzzled i had no idea they were allies of this city nor did they suspect that you were in my service a most unfortunate circumstance still more unfortunate that you then turned the sakje on them they lost ten villages burnt we trade with the getae and the getae are allies of macedon you have hurt our trade the archon rested his chin on his hand and looked up at kineas and perhaps you did not know that my own family are of the getae kineas winced i had no idea a pity and the sakje did they ask a toll of you archon you seem already to know these things please answer the questions as they are put you are in my service and the service of my city we require your cooperation in all things kineas took a deep breath and coughed then he said the sakje asked a toll i paid it two horses from my herd and some gold and the lord of the sakje a redbearded man a woman archon the archons surprise was evident his voice became louder more focused a woman that i had not heard that is interesting news what was her name not for the first time kineas regretted that he had not learned it i dont know a pity it is my lot in life to follow the careers of these petty brigands often it becomes a matter of state security to know which of them is developing ambitions young man we do not pay tolls to the brigands on the plains please be sure never to do so again ah and im told you have one of them in your train please dismiss him kineas had kept his temper on a long leash but hed just reached the end of it im afraid you have sent for the wrong man archon he snapped i am a gentleman of athens not a dog he tossed the letter on the table perhaps a dog can be ordered to dismiss his men in olbia but not an athenian the archon smiled his teeth gleamed like ivory in the light not so obedient but loyal to your men will you be as loyal to me i wonder his tone changed the smile folded and put away the teeth gone back into the darkness you brought horses why there are few things we need less here the brigands sell us what we need they breed them like maggots you came fifty days late and antagonized an ally so that you could get a few greek horses into my city thats not good judgement i only want men with good judgement kineas tried the wine and found it excellent it cut through the smoke in his throat you do not have a single cavalry mount in the city stables the archon paused for the first time he glanced at memnon nonsense i have twenty horses there all superb animals they had better be superb i paid well for them if you advise me i shall get more if required no need for your greek beasts kineas nodded all twenty are excellent horses not one is trained for war i brought twenty chargers and with them as a foundation i can train a hundred more this winter and start a stud he thought but kept it to himself the archon cocked his head to one side and put his chin in his hand humph perhaps there is truth in what you say thats why i wanted a cavalry officer so here you are ill fob the getae off then and the brigands what did you think i think they are a little more than brigands very good cavalry i would not want to tangle with them brigands i tell you they pretend we owe them tribute and tolls humph wait until you try and trade with them but they have their uses and they dont cost us anything unlike your gentlemen who are quite expensive memnon smiled security is never cheap sir humph kineas you know the terms you brought men with you that was never in the contract i wish you to train the gentlemen of my city a deep breath and then the voice went on in a whisper make them useful stop them from being such a thorn in my side they waste my time with their plotting and their lawsuits but i didnt want to hire another troop of mercenaries kineas nodded i took the risk that you would accept them they are excellent soldiers gentlemen of family from greece and elsewhere and i must have some experienced men as fileclosers and as trainers those men must be well born or your hippeis will not accept their direction i brought a dozen men sir they will not empty the treasury kineas pointed at the gold lamp which seems well stocked dont count my treasure before youve earned it snapped the archon his voice rich and mellow when calm was sharp as a sword when aroused money clearly aroused him memnon what do you think i think hes got a point i wouldnt offer to train a citys hoplites to be better soldiers without a staff memnon caught kineass eye what do you expect them to be paid these gentlemen asked the archon four drachma per day payable every month kineas was happy to be on firm ground rattling off the figures he had pondered for a month a month in advance for every man double wages for my hyperetes and one other senior man a bonus for combat duty and for each year of good service double the wages of my men said memnon but he gave kineas the tiniest of nods your men dont provide their own mounts which they have to keep nor all the tack i think that youll find that after deductions for living the wage is about the same kineas had in fact asked for more money than his men were expecting memnon gave a short laugh like a bark the archon shook his head humph very well i expect good service and i expect that when i learn to trust them your men will be at my disposal he rang a small bell the noise sharp in the heavy air a slave in a long robe responded immediately the archon gestured at kineas do the maths and get this man a months pay for his men the slave was well dressed thin as a pole and heavily bearded with deepset eyes he bowed as you command lord his greek was accented with persian he looked at kineas i am cyrus the factor of the archon i understood that you have twelve men two of whom are to receive double pay at the rate of four drachmas a day is this correct kineas nodded the persian was very formal he had probably been a nobleman nothing in his demeanor indicated what he thought of his current status kineas bowed cyrus i am kineas of athens may we be well met cyrus held his eye throughout the greeting not the sign of a born slave and was visibly pleased to be greeted in such a way kineas continued my hyperetes is waiting beyond these doors please give him the money as you wish sir cyrus walked through a side door kineas turned back to the archon i also desire the city rank of hipparch as you stated in your letter the archon hesitated i am hiring you to train my nobles and you will expect me to lead them in the field kineas interrupted dont be so stiff necked there is a man of the city a powerful man cleitus who holds the post of hipparch i do not wish to offend him neither do i archon nonetheless no squadron can have two commanders either i am on the one hand his superior in which case it is my job to make him understand and obey me or he is on the other hand my superior in which case neither he nor any other gentleman of this city has any reason to listen to a word i say the archon fiddled with his beard memnon said nothing his eyes were fixed on one of the gold lamps hanging over kineass head silence reigned you will both be hipparchs said the archon that is my word on it my law you will be equal in rank if he is not willing to learn your ways perhaps you will bring word of this to me and another thing he raised a hand to forestall kineass protest from time to time you will no doubt hear rumours of plots against me from these men you will bring these plots to me you will win their respect so that they expect to confide in you in this way you will strengthen my rule and the city itself do you understand he lowered his voice again and if these men miss musters or refuse to serve under you that is a crime on the rolls of this city long before my time of rule you will report each misdeed to me at once it was kineass turn to stand silent in effect he was being asked to inform on his own troopers a situation so repugnant that he was tempted to give a hot answer on the other hand it was just the sort of petty crap any soldier expected when serving a tyrant kineas balanced the one against the other the good of his men that of his own and his view of himself as a man of honour i will tell you if i believe a man to be plotting against the city he said carefully his choice of verbs was exact the product of his childhood training in rhetoric or committing any serious crime if the archon caught the hedging in his reply he made no comment good then i like that you have not made some horrible demand for your own pay what do you expect what you offered to get me to come here said kineas please note that i do not subtract the bonus because you are fifty days late the archons voice was warm amiable i will start the pay of your men from the time they entered our lands thank you archon you are generous kineas now longed to be free from the room the stink of the brazier and the atmosphere of restriction and fear when do i begin my duties you began them when you reported to me i expect i will have errands for your men soon i will summon the hippeis for the day after the feast of apollo it is their custom to be on the parade of the hippodrome at the ninth hour please inform me by name of every man who fails the muster cyrus will provide you with a complete list he waved his hand in dismissal i look forward to great things from you kineas now that you have come kineas held his ground how shall i address you as archon at all times the archon lowered his head and waved his hand again in dismissal even alexander had used his name with his companions and he said he was a god kineas allowed himself to smile very well archon he turned on his heel and left niceas was waiting with two hefty leather sacks and a scroll diodorus looked through the closing door at all the gold and whistled well were hired free of the room kineas began to think of the many things he should have said and several he had not said he picked up a sack of coins and thrust the scroll through his sword belt then recovered his sword from the guard the guard summoned a guide who led them back through the citadel and out to their quarters diodorus waited until their guide had left and asked tyrant oh yes kineas wanted to wash you smell like a persian girl we staying diodorus indicated the coins niceas started to say something and was lost in coughing kineas opened a bag and began counting out coins yes first because the pay is excellent second because we have nowhere else to go diodorus laughed got that right kineas put a hand on niceass shoulder how sick are you ill be fine good then go round up the men lets get some things straight when they reached the hippodrome almost clear across the town from the citadel diodorus poured them both wine kineas called for arni and put him to mulling wine with spices for niceas by the time the room the largest in the barracks was full of the aroma all of the men were gathered diodorus remained by kineas and niceas joined him wiping his nose on a rag the others brought stools lykeles sat in front with laertes and coenus andronicus and antigonus stood by the door crax hovered at the edge of the hearth ataelus sat on the floor and ajax stood with philokles against the window kineas raised an eyebrow at philokles who smiled in return kineas didnt have time just then to discover where the spartan had been he rose to his feet and addressed them all gentlemen our first payday since we left alexander and time for some rules kineas held out a hand for silence as the word payday was greeted with happy murmurs first we serve a tyrant i will say nothing beyond this every man here must swear before leaving this room to be loyal first to his messmates and his friends before any other loyalty i ask this of you because i already suspect that we will be spied on that our words may be relayed and that our position here could become very difficult instead of living in fear i propose that we agree to speak freely among ourselves whatever silence we choose to keep outside the walls of the hippodrome he sipped his wine they were stone silent now we will be training the hippeis of this city provincial gentlemen with large sums of money large estates and no experience of taking orders from anyone i will speak frankly those of you who were men of property in your cities lykeles diodorus laertes coenus agis and ajax at his name ajaxs head came up as if he were surprised to be included in any way will have the greatest duties as trainers you will understand best the manners and the motivations of our noble soldiers and while being firm on matters of discipline you will exercise judgement as to how to apply them lykeles nodded dont antagonize the rich lead through example thats why i brought you we will offer prizes for accomplishment from the first we will not stint with genuine praise but we will not flatter we will strive to always be better men than our pupils without embarrassing them if possible we will meet them socially and bury them under the weight of our accumulated war stories most of them laughed even ajax antigonus raised his hand are the rest of us to curry horses no kineas looked around we are a company of equals i command yes diodorus will be my second and niceas my hyperetes as always after them every man will take his turn at every duty first however i intend to accustom our recruits to the idea that we are their social equals after we have them broken to the saddle then we will use the rest of you to train them on squadron work skirmishing all the things at which you excel kineas had piled the olbian drachmae on the table while he waited for niceas to bring the men pay will be at the rate of four drachma per day each month is paid in advance this is your first months pay diodorus and niceas get double pay is that acceptable to everyone it was better than acceptable to everyone except ataelus who began counting on his fingers and ajax and coenus who shrugged very well said kineas agis the megaran one hundred and twenty drachmae make your mark one hundred and twenty drachmae to andronicus plus fifty drachmae for the loss of your horse to the amazon no deductions one hundred and seventy drachmae make your mark you are a rich man one hundred and twenty drachmae to antigonus no additions no deductions make your mark coenus and so he went through them leaving crax beaming at the pile of silver in his hands and ajax bemused at what to do with so much pocket change he paid them all while niceas made marks on a scroll and diodorus watched tomorrow we have our first parade i want every one of you up and sparkling for this and every other parade we have remind them by your bearing that you are a professional soldier and they are hopeless amateurs once your tack is clean and your armour shined you may go spend your money any way you like fill the barracks with whores gamble it all away be warned though we are under discipline now discipline with us means dont make an ass of yourself outside the barracks they were laughing the poorer men unable to take their eyes off the small piles of heavy silver coins but first kineass voice snapped like a banner in the wind you will all swear they stood in a circle all twelve and raised their hands putting them over kineass in turn so that he could feel the weight of their arms on his by zeus who hears all oaths by athena and apollo and all the gods we swear that we will remain loyal to each other and the company until it is dissolved by us all in council kineas spoke the words and they repeated them with gusto no voice lacking ajax surprised kineas with his eager voice rising above the others at that moment he loved them he tried not to show it clean your armour then lets get some wine he wriggled his toes by the warmth of the fire glad to be off the cold plains and sitting in a decent chair but he wished he had learned the name of the sakje woman in the morning if there were any long heads from drinking they were hidden well first kineas read off to all of them his intended course of inspection and instruction they laid out butts for throwing javelins set aside space for the practice of mounting and dismounting and built fences to simulate riding over rough country after the field of the hippodrome was ready kineas inspected his dozen veterans all of them had spent money the day before on tunics and buckles and they looked the better for it they wore blue tunics under their armour the colour of the city and every man had a silver buckle on his sword belt their horses shone kineas gave them a smile to show that he appreciated their efforts he himself wore a new cloak of deep blue and had a blue horsehair crest on his plain bronze helmet he had shaved his beard from the shaggy mass of hair it had become to a neat brush in the new style they exercised for an hour in the sharp air their manoeuvers easily accommodated by the field of the hippodrome kineas turned to niceas after the first run with javelins we shall need more room for three hundred gentlemen have ataelus scout the ground around the city and find us a decent field ill go with him said niceas and coughed he wiped his nose with a rag and coughed more i want you to go to bed you look terrible niceas shrugged im fine he said and began to cough again the exercises were quite competent kineas kept them at it until the horses had all been worked to a lather and the men had brushed the cobwebs off their skills ajax could throw one spear at the gallop but couldnt yet manage to get his second javelin transferred to his throwing hand before he passed the target he tended to drop the second in his haste philokles could throw far and accurately but he couldnt throw quickly and he could just manage his horse his riding had improved but not to the standard of the other men kineas chose not to single philokles out the spartan was perfectly aware of the shortcomings of his riding but when the exercises were done he summoned them all i want you to think that we are now in a land of horsemen the sakje are not the only men here who ride our hippeis are likely to be better riders than most greeks as good as thracians or thessalians that was good work today get those horses stabled and warm when thats done id like philokles diodorus lykeles laertes and coenus to accompany me to the gymnasium the rest of you should wander the city accustom yourselves to the streets learn where the gates are and the posterns not just the wine shops the getae slave sitalkes took kineass horse and began to curry it which earned him a glare from niceas kineas ignored the glare and went to change for the gymnasium their barracks was small but it had amenities the central hall off the porch was lined in pegs for cloaks and equipment and gave on to the kitchen where two city slaves cooked as well as a meeting room and kineass own pair of large rooms and a hearth at the back of the building stairs on the outside of the building gave on to a passage with doors that led to six small rooms with sleeping racks for soldiers the rooms were unheated but better than any tent and the men had taken the two rooms directly over the kitchen kineas entered through the portico and stripped in his own chamber wiped the cold sweat from his breastplate cleaned his helmet and set them on a stand by his bed he hung the baldric of his sword belt over the breastplate clothed in a decent but unmilitary tunic and sandals he met diodorus in the central hall now we show ourselves to be gentlemen kineas said ill see what i can do said diodorus coenus gave a sneer id rather the locals proved themselves to be gentlemen so far they look like hicks while waiting for the others kineas sent a slave to the gymnasium to request permission to use it with his men as mercenaries they had some status but they were not citizens it was best to be sure lykeles came in rubbing his head i have a good mind to buy a slave to curry my horse he said the stink the town slave returned with a handful of clay discs these are for your honours use they mark you as guests kineas gave the boy an obol shall we take some exercise he said to his gentleman troopers olbias gymnasium was a finer building than that in tomis if gaudier bronze dolphins adorned the stone steps and the facade was stone as well the building had heated floors and warm baths and a heavy giltbronze plaque in the portico declared that archon leucon son of satyrus had built it as a gift to the city kineas read the plaque amused to see that here at least the archon used his name town slaves took their cloaks and sandals they walked through a short passageway to the changing room and stripped in the chill air leaving their tunics in wooden cubbyholes two other men stopped their conversation and watched them strip silently they began a hushed exchange as soon as the five soldiers left the changing room for the exercise floor the silence was repeated there at least a dozen citizens stood about the sanded floor a few exercising with weights one man using his strigil on another but their conversation died when kineas entered diodorus looked about him then he shrugged care to wrestle a fall kineas it was too chilly even with the heated floor to pause for long kineas squared off against diodorus while coenus and lykeles began to exercise carefully working their cold muscles laertes set to lifting weights diodorus feinted a grab at kineass legs caught an arm and threw him but kineas got hold of his head on the way down and they fell in a tangle of limbs in a second they were both on their feet again in the second engagement diodorus was more careful but he couldnt get kineas to overcommit and it was kineas who trapped one of diodoruss hands and went for a throw diodorus struck kineas a sharp blow to the ribs but kineas got a foot behind diodoruss leg and tripped him diodorus rolled out of the fall and they were both on their feet again now warm and breathing harder kineas raised his hands palms out in a high guard diodorus kept his low close to his body they circled out of the corner of his eye kineas saw that they were being watched by most of the men in the room he grabbed at diodoruss head with both hands diodoruss hands shot out parted kineass hands and hit him open handed on the forehead rocking him back in a second diodorus was on him his left leg between kineass legs and kineas was down this time with the weight of his friend solidly atop him the sand on the floor was none too deep and the fall bruised his hip diodorus got to his feet and kineas stood dripping with sweat and rubbing his hip well struck he said ruefully i certainly thought so you make me work harder and harder kineas you may make a passable wrestler yet they wrestled three more falls two of them by diodorus and then lykeles and coenus began boxing neither of them was as fast as kineas or as athletic as ajax but they were competent and a little showy none of the other men in the room offered a contest or even a wager and none of them approached kineass men they stood silently by the gymnasiums fountain watching in a group kineas crossed the floor to them he was reminded of the efforts he had made fruitless efforts as time proved to be social with the macedonian officers in alexanders army despite his doubts he approached the oldest of the men a lean athletic old man with a beard nearly white good morning sir kineas said i am only a guest here and i desire to run where do i go to run the older man shrugged i run on my estate outside the city i imagine thats what any gentleman does kineas smiled im from athens our estates are generally too far from our houses to visit for exercise many times i have run around the theatre for instance or early in the agora the old man cocked his head examining kineas as if he were a ram for sale at auction really you have an estate frankly young man that surprises me i imagined you were a freebooter kineas began stretching he looked up at the old man and his crowd before he died my father was among the largest landholders in athens eumenes you must have heard of him our ships traded here and as he switched sides to stretch the other leg he said very deliberately my friend calchus still sends ships here i believe another man thinner but with a paunch that suggested a serious lack of exercise leaned forward i trade with calchus you know him kineas brushed sand off his thigh and said we grew up together so you dont run in the city the best looking man in the group younger and harder said sometimes i run around the gymnasium it wasnt built on the best site well it wasnt im not attacking the architect or the archon the new gymnasium doesnt have room for a running event is all other men edged away from him as if he had a disease kineas extended a hand to the man id like some company care to run with me the man looked around at the rest of the group but none of them met his gaze and he shrugged certainly let me stretch a moment im nicomedes they ran longer than kineas might have wished nicomedes was an accomplished distance runner and he was interested in going faster and farther than kineas had planned leaving little wind for talk but it was companionable enough if cold and when they had run as far as kineas could manage without collapsing in public they returned to the gymnasium and the baths and nicomedes invited kineas to dinner his first invitation in the city luxuriating in the first decent bath hed had in a month kineas asked are you in the hippeis nicomedes i certainly qualify by property if thats what you mean i have a horse but ive never served my people have always served on foot close up kineas could see that nicomedes was a bit of a fop he had the remains of makeup on his eyes and the cheeks of a heavy drinker he was older than he had first appeared and very fit and his preening indicated that he knew how good his body was but he was a pleasant companion for all that kineas chose his words carefully a word to the wise nicomedes the archon has given me a full list to muster the towns cavalry and he seems to expect compliance nicomedes shoulders came out of the water so fast the drops flew thats not fair weve always served as hoplites and then how fucking typical and after another pause i shouldnt have said that kineas shrugged and scrubbed you might pass the word nicomedes said have you met the hipparch cleitus kineas thought im the hipparch and then he thought back to the archons hesitation on the subject ahh now i begin to see i have not id like to we will have to work together to accomplish anything other men were coming into the baths and busy slaves were filling the other wooden tubs the rooms began to fill with steam it lent a comforting anonymity the chatter grew louder kineas could hear lykeles flattering somebodys physique diodorus asking questions and coenus quoting xenophons views on horsemanship nicomedes said he sometimes shares a cargo with me and we are occasionally allies in the assembly when the archon lets us have an assembly that is hmm shouldnt have said that anyway i could ask him to dinner give the two of you a chance to meet we were only told that the archon was hiring a mercenary kineas motioned for a slave to rub his shoulders i can imagine he said clean dressed and pleasantly tired kineas led his men back to the barracks his damp beard seemed to freeze as soon as they went outside and his cloak would not get him warm that went well said kineas they expected us to be monsters said lykeles makes me wonder about memnon and his lot itll take more than a couple of dinners and some visits to the gymnasium to settle them said kineas rubbing his beard diodorus said theres more going on here than i expected its not just the old bloods against the archon either my sense it that there are three or even four factions does athens support the archon its not like athens to support a tyrant even in these decadent times athens needs the grain said coenus i heard a debate on granting citizenship to the tyrant of pantecapaeum once in the assembly it was all about grain subsidies he rubbed his beard i thought your nicomedes was a fine man if a bit of a fop i bored one of the older men with my erudition laid it on a bit thick petrocolus his name was fine old fellow theyre a cautious lot said lykeles hermes theyre a closemouthed crew all except your nicomedes handsome man did he run well better than i ever will or want to said kineas bit of a hothead by local standards i wonder how soon the archon will hear you are dining with him asked diodorus one of memnons men was standing in the entryway to the barracks theres your answer said kineas kineas had to struggle to enjoy dinner with nicomedes his food was excellent and his wine passable but the men around the circle of couches were either silent or spoke in what appeared to be a code nicomedes house was colourful decorated in the latest style except for an antique mosaic over the floor of the main room which showed achilles killing the queen of the amazons at troy in grisly detail his furnishings and his food were on par with the richest men in athens kineas revised his view of olbia the grain trade made these men very rich indeed he was introduced to cleitus immediately a short darkhaired man with a long beard and deepset eyes and a fair amount of grey hair but he couldnt seem to start a conversation with any of them all of them lay alone to dine and the couches were set far enough apart that conversation was difficult a trio of nubian dancers reminded him uncomfortably that a bath wasnt the only thing he hadnt had in a long time but they also served to kill any talk that might have sprung up after the main course unable to leave his couch due to the prominence of his approval of the dancers kineas watched the other men trying to identify why the situation seemed so normal and yet so alien on the one hand everything was just as it should be in a wellrun greek home the men being served the side dishes fish sauce wine on the sideboards busy slaves on the other hand the silence was oppressive kineas tried to remember a time in athens even under the most repressive governments that his fathers table had not rung with angry denunciations violent protests if only against the taxing of the rich and political argument the last dishes were cleared away and more wine was brought without being asked kineas rose and pulled his own couch closer to that of cleitus cleitus glanced at him while he moved his couch but said nothing kineas lay back down and held out his cup for filling nicomedes rose said a prayer and poured a libation the other guests added their own prayers and libations again they behaved just like greeks but there was no ribaldry no jokes no suggestions odd nicomedes called kineas i checked the rolls you are listed for service in the cavalry nicomedes sat up on his couch by all the gods well i suppose it cant be blamed on you i can ride well enough when is this muster the day after the feast of apollo i believe cleitus you are the hipparch cleitus shook his head i act as the hipparch only the assembly of the city can appoint the hipparch they have not met they have not that is to say having gone so far cleitus halted and drank his wine nicomedes smiled cleitus doesnt want to say it but the council has not met since the archon dismissed them since then the hipparch cleander died cleitus does the duty kineas frowned at his wine cup so you are not the hipparch and i am not the hipparch who can command in such a situation cleitus glared at him stung what is there to command the last time i mustered only sixteen men came with their horses and armour many others came on foot to see and be seen kineas nodded athenian cavalry often showed the same contempt for authority he had himself once when were you last in the field nicomedes snorted cleitus actually blew some wine out his nose field in the field what against the scyths theyd eat our brains the getae another city you must be joking kineas looked around the room are you all hippeis then the youngest man shook his head and declared that he fell far below the property qualification although he had a horse and liked to ride the rest were all of the cavalry class kineas said carefully wouldnt it be better to have a welltrained wellled body of cavalry in this city than a rabble of rich men better for your pay perhaps said cleitus nicomedes nodded who would it serve what faction would control this welltrained cavalry for the good of the city said kineas they all laughed but nicomedes fingered his short blond beard thoughtfully all his life kineas had heard the phrase for the good of the city used in a number of ways with deliberate sarcasm with political amorality to flatter to cajole or to demand hed heard the phrase abused but hed never seen it ignored who are these men he thought what kind of city is this have a good night asked diodorus when kineas came into the barracks the wine was good the company was a little dull what are you reading in fact what are you doing in my rooms its warmer here and i wanted to talk to you as soon as you came back i thought that the archon told you to avoid nicomedes kineas laughed mirthlessly actually the archon asked me to be careful in making friends i always have been so i chose to take his words as a compliment you waited up to worry about my relations with the archon no this diodorus held up a scroll i had several letters from friends waiting for me and you need to know the contents antipater has made zopryon his satrap in thrace hes putting gold and men into thrace even now theyre building an army there headed where i cant say for certain and neither can my sources the word being given out is that its an army of reinforcements going out to the conqueror that could be true certainly they could be aimed here too these are rich lands and antipater needs cash alexander may be conquering the world but he hasnt sent a lot of money home and antipater has a lot of enemies look at sparta kineas nodded he pulled at his beard and started to pace the narrow confines of the chamber is sparta planning war sooner or later what choice do they have and macedon is mighty but they need money what better place to get it but here diodorus made a rude gesture and there goes my bonus if they are poor and yet sending money and men into thrace then the move cant be far off they wont have the money to pay mercenaries for long kineas stopped and poured himself some wine want a cup please until next summer i expect how many men two taxeis of phalanx some mercenaries and some thracians perhaps fifteen thousand foot companions and thessalian cavalry perhaps four thousand horse kineas whistled wed best get out of the way then diodorus nodded thats why i thought i should tell you immediately you dont seem surprised kineas shrugged you suggested as much at tomis just not in the same detail and after a minutes hesitation i heard something about the possibility in athens diodorus nodded yes you denied any knowledge of it at the time kineas met his eyes and they stared at each other for three heartbeats i see so thats not open to discussion diodorus rubbed his forehead clearly annoyed so what did the dinner guests say you met the hipparch hes not really the hipparch kineas said he explained why and revisited the conversation diodorus looked thoughtful i think i see where this is going you are not the only thinker here diodorus i can see through a brick wall in time the archon is trying to appoint me so that he can usurp yet another power of the assembly i see that kineas gestured with his wine cup and then he uses me to keep the rich men in line diodorus nodded worse than that really i think he expects to use you to cull some of the rich those who conveniently break the muster laws for instance will doubtless be arrested tried and exiled or worse but you may have ruined that by warning them the worst of it is though that the archon no doubt plans to use the hippeis as hostages kineas choked on his wine hostages certainly once they are under your command he can threaten to send them off to fight to patrol hell have control of them remember there is no assembly no council this man can make war and peace on his own word he can send these rich men out of their city on the pretence of public service and keep them out as long as he likes diodorus drank the rest of his wine and wiped his mouth really im surprised no one has thought of it before gods help us all if you ever achieve political power said kineas its nice to have my skills admired im going to bed but i have another point to raise diodorus looked at his wine cup as if the design surprised him go ahead kineas rubbed his chin which didnt seem to have enough hair on it philokles is he a problem i thought everyone liked him hes good company but he comes and goes ares balls its hard to put a finger on this hes out most of the time and hes not whoring i think hes got some business of his own diodorus shrugged i dont mean to spy on him but kineas swirled the wine in his cup ill think about it i dont watch any of you i try not to know whos got a lover and who might drink too much youre suggesting what that philokles is a spy diodorus looked at his wine for a long time i dont know what im suggesting he clearly didnt want to be seen coming into the city remember kineas nodded the atmosphere of this place is going to get to us all lets allow the spartan to live his own life for a while diodorus nodded but he was clearly unconvinced diodorus said kineas thanks im happy to be told i dont always see things the way you do and sometimes no action is the best action diodorus frowned im beginning to suspect that everyone here has a secret id best go find one of my own part ii lotus and parsley his people along the seashore took their joy in casting the discus and the javelin and in archery and their horses each beside his own car eating lotus and parsley of the marsh stood idle iliad book the autumn feast of apollo the paenopsion was a noisy festival a day of sacrifices and feasts was followed at least in olbia by an evening torchlight parade of children holding aloft the produce of the city and garlands of a special wheat cake made in the form of apollos lyre as they walked they sang the eiresione bears rich cakes and figs and honey in a jar and olive oil to sanctify yourself and cups of mellow wine that you may drink and fall asleep when full dark fell the parade gave way to dancing drinking and horse races kineas thought the sacrifices were too showy someone had spent a great deal of money on elaborate pageantry the archon appeared only at the great sacrifice closely guarded by memnon and fifty soldiers most of kineass men attended wearing their best offduty clothes and mingling with the citys elite ajax made his first public appearance in olbias society and was immediately at the centre of a circle of admirers his beauty drew them regardless of his status as a mercenary and their political factions kineas didnt need to stand near the boy to watch the ripple of comment as the admirers discovered who the boys father was most olbian traders did business with isokles of tomis in fact his men circulated so freely that kineas found himself virtually alone at the torch race attended only by the getae boy sitalkes he didnt have an urge to break into a new group and he couldnt see nicomedes or any of the local men he had met coenus was visible taking bets but his new friends were not kineass sort kineas began to wander through the crowd he considered going home he wanted to find cleitus but the man didnt seem to be in attendance kineas saw philokles shout a greeting to someone in the torchlit gloom and was envious philokles made friends easily cleitus was of course entering a horse in the race kineas felt like a fool for failing to realize that every wealthy horse owner would put up a horse he walked down to the edge of the track around the temple and pushed through a crowd of slaves and workers all staring at the horses and trying to work out the best wagers when he found the notquite hipparch he called good fortune to your horse cleitus the blessing of apollo on your house cleitus replied shes so skittish im afraid she wont run doesnt like the crowd kineas watched two slaves hold the mare while she tossed her head and rolled her eyes is she trained to the torches before this id have said she was immune to fire cleitus shrugged clearly unwilling to solicit advice but at his wits end kineas watched her again put blinders on her as the persians do cleitus shook his head ive no idea what youre talking about kineas bent down so that his head was level with the getae boys run and find me a piece of rawhide at least this big sitalkes screwed up his face in thought where getting this thing i am sir kineas shrugged i have no idea its a difficult task surprise me or run to ataelus at our stable and get some from him the boy was off before he finished speaking ill also need a knife and some thread kineas shouted after him cleitus watched his mare try to rear i dont know better to scratch my name off than to injure her and the race will start as soon as the suns rim goes below a certain mark too soon try my way if the boy doesnt make it back you can always scratch then kineas watched the horse a beauty with a deep chest and proud head and added scratching would be ill fortune indeed at a temple festival too right said cleitus in the meantime ill try something of my own cleitus called for a slave and they began to rub the horse down together murmuring endearments kineas was glas to see cleitus working himself too often rich men lost the knack of work and expected their slaves to do everything sitalkes appeared at his elbow he wasnt even breathing hard see it sir see it good good well done where did you get it so quickly kineas took a sharp knife from another slave and began to cut the rawhide in half stole it said the boy not meeting his eye kineas kept cutting anyone see you the getae boy stood tall look idioting no kineas cut strap holes carefully with the point of the knife bring me her head stall he called it wasnt perfect when it was on one of the blinders stood correctly and the other flapped disturbing her more kineas took the thread and stitched both of them in place as he finished the horses were called for the race it was distinctly darker and he could just see his work thanks for trying so hard but ill have to scratch cleitus was watching anxiously theyve called the horses here wait just a moment one more twist of thread there put it on her head see kineas looked around for the rider cleituss son leucon hurriedly introduced moments before she wont be able to see to her sides remember that when you try and pass another rider already the mare was calmer cleitus and leucon walked her away into the crowd and kineas followed the rest of cleituss slaves to the finish line where all the owners and their retainers stood in the light of one of the temple bonfires torches were lit from the fire and tossed up to the riders kineas was unable to follow the progress of the race beyond the sound the chorus of shouts and cheers that moved like fire itself around the temple precinct but as the horses finished they presented a brilliant spectacle crossing the line in a closeknit pack with their torches streaming fire behind them cleituss mare finished third and leucon was presented with a wreath of laurel leaves i wanted to talk to you about the muster tomorrow kineas said when the congratulations and thanks were tapering away i dont plan to give you any trouble youre the professional cleitus was rubbing down the mare ill need your help to get any of these men to do any training kineas thought that straight talk was the right course with cleitus cleitus turned and leaned one hand against the rump of his mare crossed his feet and smiled you always in such a hurry athenian its going to take time and luck to get these boys to practise anything look tomorrow will be a shambles well be lucky if everyone on that damned list comes you come back to dinner with me tomorrow night bring your officers well all get to know each other and some advice dont be in such a hurry kineas took a brush from one of the slaves and began to work on the other side of the mares rump sound advice i have my reasons for hurry i really should thank you for the blinders dangerous in a night race but the chance was worth the result eh but i still had to wait for you to get the blinders done you see lets get through tomorrow apollo send that all the men are wise enough to come if some fool gets arrested well never have a days peace your words to the god may every man come kineas handed his brush to the waiting slave ill take my leave until tomorrow goodnight then leucon say goodnight to the gentleman kineas had his men up at cocks crow and they flogged the stable floors dry set up more exercise butts and curried their horses until they shone mounted in armour with new plumes and cloaks they made a fine show kineas had them at the barracks end of the hippodrome half an hour before the appointed time the citys gentry arrived all together a few minutes before the appointed hour they rode or walked into the hippodrome in a long column and immediately spread over the sand forming groups of ten or twelve with a few loners and one large group of two dozen all well mounted gathered around cleitus kineas left his men to diodorus and rode up to cleitus as he rode he watched the local men they were excellent riders far better than their equivalents in athens or corinth they rode as well as macedonians or thessalians just as he expected they had odd taste in accoutrements as well more than one of them wore sakje trousers or thracianstyle caps and their horse harnesses were often more sakje than greek cleitus glanced at him and turned his head away then glanced back and shouted for his men to wheel and join kineass men at the far end the tail of the column was still entering the hippodrome little knots of men without horses behind the laggards kineas saw the dark cloaks of memnons soldiers theres trouble he said pointing his whip at them cleitus pulled his heavy corinthian helmet back on his head so that he could see better those idiots had better all be here how do you want to do the muster kineas gestured to the end where cleituss horsemen had joined kineass men making an imposing front first we muster the properly turnedout men then we line the rest up and muster them first those with horses then those with armour and no horses then those with neither armour nor horses it makes the least prepared waste the most time youve done this before cleitus smiled mirthlessly twice a year in athens kineas gestured with his whip to niceas who galloped across the sand to him nearly oversetting two portly men you have the roll right here niceas stifled a cough start with the men who just fell in then do our men once a man is mustered he may dismount and relax cleitus and i will start culling the herd kineas gestured at the hundreds of men milling about for more to muster and well send them to you at the end niceas nodded and saluted who is your hyperetes kineas asked cleitus my son leucon you met him last night may i send him to help niceas so that it doesnt look like its all my doing good thought leucon cleitus clamped his horses back with his knees rose in the saddle and roared his son was resplendent in a deepblue cloak and gilt breastplate one of the best turnedout men in the city kineas sent him to niceas as it turned out the muster itself was uneventful three men of the cavalry class were absent but all for acceptable reasons one at pantecapaeum on business two known to be ill and both had sent substitutes when the muster was complete they had all gathered at the far end of the hippodrome it was a cold day and the crowd huddled for warmth kineas inspected them from a distance less than one quarter had any armour although many claimed that they had such stuff at home about one half had come mounted mostly the younger men want to say something asked kineas youre burning to do it said cleitus be my guest just remember that antagonizing them will serve no one kineas rode to the head of the crowd his voice when he started was a roar that squashed interruption men of olbia we are gathered today to serve this city i serve her for pay and you from love of your homes is it possible that some of you love the city more than others or that the gold you pay me is dearer to me than your love of your city or is it possible that some of you are really too poor to bear the burden of cavalry service and lack the horses and arms that make a cavalryman he lowered his voice because he was the only man talking anything worth doing is worth doing well socrates said so and so did my father there is no point pretending to have a troop of city cavalry there is no point in wasting your valuable time mustering you for a service you cant perform and make no mistake gentlemen at the moment you cannot perform it even if the gods gifted you this second with fine persian chargers trained from birth for war with armour crafted by hephaeston himself and weapons fresh from his forge you wouldnt last a minute against real cavalry he smiled with nothing but a little work we could change that with a little work we could make you gentlemen good enough to participate in city parades as the athenian cavalry does perhaps good enough to rival the precision of memnons men kineas pointed down the field where memnon stood with fifty soldiers a palpable threat and by pointing them out kineas hoped that he had been sufficiently subtle in suggesting that they could be bested i wish to show you what cavalrymen look like perhaps having seen them you will say that professional soldiers have the time to practise such things but ill tell you that these skills can be taught to you and you can master them and serve your city with pride kineas rode in silence to the head of his own men he pitched his voice low hoping the gods would carry his words to his own men only gentlemen id appreciate it if youd put on the finest display of horsemanship in history diodorus smiled coldly at your command hipparch start with the javelins he said at my command form file from the left and throw at the gallop then form your front and halt just short of memnons line and gentlemen when i say just short i mean the length of a horses head throw both javelins if you think theyll both hit the target ajax philokjles throw just one ready a shifting some glances kineas looked around found arni waiting by the barracks door collect the javelins as soon as they score and bring them back here arni nodded file from the left skirmish kineas shouted and led the way all the way down the sand to the target kineas had time to consider whether he could have handled them any other way and then he was ten strides from the butts his first javelin away his second just as he passed not his best throw but in the target and he swept by curbing his charger and bringing her to a canter so that diodorus caught him up easily and then crax fell in behind him he refused to turn his head and count the hits the hippeis on the sand were watching closely lykeles fell in and then coenus behind him and then philokles and ajax gods send they hit something and then the gauls and the line was formed kineas shouted charge and the line went back to a gallop just short of memnons waiting men he shouted halt they were knee to knee aimed at the center of memnons line memnons men flinched more at the back than in front kineass men had their own troubles ajax nearly lost his seat and philokles despite the month of practice on the road and a weeks drill in the hippodrome had his horse rear under him and threw his arms around her neck to keep his the hoplites had lost their ordered ranks and memnon was bellowing at them his voice high with real rage kineas ordered his men to face about and led them sedately down the sand to the waiting hippeis diodorus leaned over to him memnon will make a bad enemy kineas nodded i didnt see much choice perhaps i can sweeten him later but they all hate him and i need them to be united diodorus shook his head why why not just collect the money and let them rot but then he smiled and shook his head again at your command many of your mounts are untrained for war kineas called to the men waiting on the sand many of you are not expert at mounting or throwing the javelin or staying in ranks we can teach all of these things we would like to teach you and every man who loves his city should want to learn at the next muster i expect every man in armour and atop his horse at the next muster we will throw javelins until the sun sets cleitus cleitus rode to the head of the muster i intend to learn what this man has to teach he turned and rode back to the ranks of the fully armed men it wasnt a long speech but it had its effect when niceas declared the muster complete and announced the next one at the new moon in just three weeks there was a buzz of talk but no angry shouts kineas was greeted afterwards by at least twenty men many of whom found it necessary to stress excuses as to why they were not mounted today but would be next time as the last of them trickled out of the hippodrome diodorus unfastened his chinstrap the towns armourers will be busy men for three weeks he said and then came the summons from the archon kineas heard it from one of the palace slaves and nodded curtly to diodorus he said we dine tonight with cleitus you ajax and one of the gentlemen nodding at the retreating figure of the slave he shrugged if i survive meeting the archon diodorus raised an eyebrow the archon can hardly be offended by a minor scuffle between mercenaries is this dinner purely social nothing in this city is purely anything diodorus bring agis hes a talker kineas decided to wear his armour he rode to meet the archon this time the archon was not in the murk of his private citadel he was sitting in the open in the agora flanked on both sides by files of fully armoured soldiers giving justice at the courts the market was full of people men walking arm in arm talking men doing business from the sale of a farm by the fountain to the dozens of stalls set up by merchants along the sides kineas was surprised by the scale of some of the sales one stall seemed only to be an office selling cargoes of lateseason wheat to ship owners anxious to beat the first winter storm on the euxine and there were women women doing their market shopping attended by a string of male slaves slave women on the same errands or buying for their households or talking by the fountain finally there were beggars dozens of children begged by the foot of the statue of hermes and grown beggars sat by every stall kineas had to wait while the archon heard a boundary dispute lengthy arguments on both sides appealing to various customs and the views of various neighbours kineas gathered from the arguments that when land had been taken from the local tribe of sindi the demarcations of land grants had never been firmly settled kineas had time to watch the archon he was not a tall man and tended to slouch his shoulders and hunch his back as he listened to the debate before him his chin resting on his right fist he wore a simple white tunic with a red border and a heavy gold ring on one thumb had a diadem on his head but otherwise wore no sign of rank or ornamentation despite the cold air and an icy wind blowing from the north he didnt don his cloak he had a heavy dark beard shot with grey and his hair had begun to thin on his forehead with the exception of the diadem he looked every inch a greek magistrate he settled the grievance in favour of the smaller farmer who had brought the charge that his boundary stones had been moved and ordered that a cup of wine be brought then he motioned for kineas to attend him greetings kineas of athens he said formally greetings archon kineas replied im told that the muster of the hippeis went well here stand close by me you have the muster the archon was convivial kineas thought he was about to place his hand on kineass shoulder i have the full account of the muster to present to you archon kineas held up a scroll i was satisfied the archon frowned i understand you took steps of your own to see that the muster would be full yes kineas hesitated and then said yes i asked several gentlemen to see to it that the importance of the muster was understood throughout the city the archon grunted harrumph kineas perhaps i failed to make myself clear to you or perhaps you have your own designs in the first case i am at fault in the second case you have done me a wrong had i wanted the men of this town informed of the importance of the muster do you not think i could have passed that word myself if i did not perhaps you might have thought that i had my reasons kineas recognized that he was on dangerous ground i sought only to improve the quality of your cavalry archon the first step on the road to training them was to draw them to the muster the archon sipped his wine perhaps he said after a few long seconds had passed kineas you have come here to serve me and this city you think perhaps that you understand us already you see a tyrant on his ivory chair and some noble gentlemen who seek to keep the tyrant within the bounds of the law hmm very athenian i asked you here today to the court to see another thing these cavalrymen of the city these gentlemen are the rapacious landlords who will try to gouge my small farmers i must protect the farmers without them we have no grain if i let the great ones enslave them i have no hoplites and the small men they have rights too i protect them kineas thought the law protects them but he remained silent only nodding many of your gentlemen do all in their power to impede the running of this city even its security hmmm when i hired you i was not aware of your many connections and i wonder if i have made an error have i at the word connections kineas felt for the first time the touch of fear nicomedes is a dangerous man kineas of athens dine with him at your peril very well you have mustered my gentlemen and now you will train them in the meantime i have a use for you you will please take the men on this list and he handed kineas a tablet and find the bandits who wish to send me an embassy you will escort their ambassador to me i understand that they are north of the city above the great bend in the river about three days ride as you have set your next muster for three weeks hence i recommend that you proceed immediately kineas glanced at the tablet there were seven names and none of them was familiar to him i would rather take my own men im sure you would feel free to take two not more than two am i clear i would dislike having my orders misunderstood again he smiled and please apologize to memnon who feels that you insulted him in the hippodrome memnon emerged from the nearest file of soldiers we can settle in private archon thats just what i dont wish the archon snapped no private feuds no quarrels kineas apologize kineas considered for a moment very well i apologize memnon know that i hold you no ill will however your illconsidered arrival at the hippodrome armed and unannounced could have had serious consequences for my command dont be a fool snapped memnon i was there to save you horse master they could have turned on you in a second dont think any of them loves you i was there to provide you some security and you embarrassed me he leered he was missing some teeth and up close he was a scary man is that what passes for an apology in athens because in my city heraclea itd get your balls cut off kineas shook his head no you were there to intimidate the hippeis and me and dont hold me to blame if your men flinch from a cavalry charge sounds like a professional problem fuck your mother said memnon flushing red his voice was quiet almost eerie dont play games athenian the archon stood up kineas you are not impressing me neither one of you is perhaps i should try raising my voice apologize at once the three of them stood in a triangle now surrounded by memnons soldiers who were blocking the crowd memnons whole posture showed that he was ready for violence his thumbs were hitched into his sword belt and his right hand was twitching he was that close to drawing his sword kineas expected he looked the same he was on the balls of his feet ready to fight the archons eyes flicked back and forth between them kineas apologize now kineas made his decision and felt smaller for it memnon i apologize he said the archon grunted i ordered memnon to support you you fool you think you know us you know nothing think about hubris while you escort the barbarians through the plains now go kineas humiliated turned and pushed through memnons men lets take our mounts and go said niceas his hand on the amulet of athenas owl at his neck he coughed long and hard crax and arni had settled him on a couch in front of the brazier he was quite sick you cant travel snapped kineas it sounded more like an accusation than he had meant winter is almost on us you want to ride back down the coast in winter we could leave the horses and take a ship out of here said diodorus we could all cut our throats look its my fault first that we are here and second that i cannot guard my tongue for now we stay ill take lykeles and ataelus with me diodorus stand ready for anything and keep our men out of trouble with memnons philokles pushed through the curtain from the hallway private party kineas glared at him philokles comings and goings were a constant irritation to him the spartan was with them when it was convenient and distant when it suited him yes philokles moved over to the table and poured a cup of wine voices carry trouble with the archon and you have been sent on a mission very sensible of the archon hes getting you out of town for a few days that suits me as well id be happy to accompany you ive already chosen my men kineas said the archon has only allowed me two the rest of us said diodorus will make good hostages philokles smiled well im not really one of your men he said i cant really imagine that the archon meant to deprive you of my company so ill just ride along or perhaps ill meet you on the road kineas angry and still smarting from the scene in the agora was both touched and incensed a hot answer came to his tongue but he bit down on it and swallowed it with some wine i cant stop you he said but his voice had a little more warmth in it my point exactly philokles drank off his wine when do we leave as soon as i can find the men on this list kineas pointed to the tablet on the table philokles read the list and nodded i know most of these theyre all young several are friends with ajax two of them would like to be better friends if you take my meaning send him to gather them up and take him along the thing is as easy as that and he snapped his fingers diodorus nodded id be happier if i could keep lykeles anyway he knows the locals as well as i do he looked at philokles young rich men the sons of the richest perhaps philokles shrugged the archon is no fool neither are you kineas when you dont lose your temper ive heard a rumour perhaps youve heard it too that the archon is going to allow the assembly to meet to confirm his taxes diodorus nodded i have heard the same rumour philokles threw a leg over the table and reclined as if on a couch the sturdy oak table groaned under his weight if i had to guess i would say that the archon is sending away the sons of the most powerful men as a method of controlling the assembly hmm diodorus ran a hand through his hair of course he is i should have seen that kineas looked from one to the other nice of the two of you to keep me informed like this any other gorgons heads to drop on me while i pack for the plains the towns croaking like a chorus of frogs about the cavalry muster people were very impressed with us and with you and with your little performance against memnons men they are widely hated so far we are not now shall we send for ajax kineas said i hate being mothered he smiled ruefully what a fucking idiot i was which time said philokles sweetly and dodged through the curtain the dinner with cleitus was uneventful decorous and professional by chance or design most of the other guests were men whose sons he was taking out into the plains at dawn kineas sensed no hostility from them and he was at pains to make clear that they would train and ride hard but that he would see to their safety cleitus himself raised the possibility of an assembly its all over the agora the archon will summon us to vote his new taxes kineas remained silent and tried to catch the eyes of diodorus and philokles to keep them silent he failed when is the last time the assembly met philokles asked sipping wine cleitus glanced around and shrugged an older man cleomenes one of the citys richest merchants rose a little on his couch almost four years sir an entire olympiad has passed since we were last allowed to assemble his son was a very young man eumenes who had presented himself at the muster horsed and in armour as kineas remembered he was not so young that he couldnt speak at a dinner he sat up on his fathers couch and said it was not always so sir when the archon was first appointed the assembly met regularly cleitus motioned to a slave to bring around more wine were loyal to the archon here poppet so watch your insinuation id like to think that the possibility of an assembly is a good sign eumenes looked about a little wildly i meant no disloyalty kineas felt that the whole conversation had subtext even cleituss declaration of loyalty seemed to have a coda just watching the mens eyes and facial expressions told him something of the tensions between them perhaps things will be different after the assembly offered another gentleman kineas knew the man was the largest ship owner in the city and that his son cliomenedes was barely old enough to serve in the cavalry and was coming on the expedition in the morning it seemed an ominous statement the more so as it was left to lie with the spilled wine none of the other men took it up not even philokles instead cleitus turned the talk to the success of the muster kineas gathered praise too much praise he felt we havent begun to train he said none of you will think of me so highly when your butts are sore that got a laugh but clios father petrocolus shook his head we expected another mercenary like memnon we were surprised that you are so clearly a gentlemen i think i can speak for many men when i say that well be happier for the training at least come spring this notion of winter exercise has my old bones creaking already the party continued on a lighter note from there cleitus despite his public gruffness was an excellent host there were dancers tasteful and skilled and acrobats and a darkskinned freeman who mimed several of the citys important men memnon cleitus himself and finally kineas even kineas had to laugh at the gross parody of his legs and autocratic hand motions he knew himself immediately it wasnt the first time hed been imitated the others present roared and he collected several smiles at the end of the evening philokles performed on the spartan harp and agis recited a section of the iliad it was a nice reminder that kineass men were gentlemen of accomplishment and both performances were well received huddled in their cloaks trying to avoid puddles in the street as they walked back to the hippodrome escorted by a pair of cleituss slaves philokles laughed that went well he said agis laughed as well i expected my old tutor to appear at the door and point a bony hand at me if i missed a word not like performing at the campfire diodorus was more sombre theyre hiding something kineas nodded agreement steer clear of it whatever it is he said to diodorus dont get involved is that clear diodorus nodded he looked at the sky paused and then said were in for a weather change feel it its colder already kineas pulled his cloak tighter he was already cold he coughed they left as the dawn reddened the frosted glass north of the city under a cold blue sky the seven young men were well mounted and each of them had a slave the two eldest each had two slaves and half a dozen horses they were well turned out with good armour and heavy cloaks and they were all eager to go their eagerness made the situation easier to bear hostages or not they were city cavalry and his men and kineas found himself enjoying their company as they followed the narrow track out of the city and up the bluffs beyond to the plain for stades the track wound along the stone walls that edged grain fields now a blasted desert of stubble and broken stalks where the harvesters had cut the crops heavy stone farmhouses dotted the landscape and as the morning went on they began to pass farmers making their way into town most on foot with small carts a few more prosperous on horseback their breath left plumes in the cold air and the farmers didnt seem happy to see so many soldiers the young men chatted pointed out farms that belonged to their families discussed hunting in this or that copse of woods and rehearsed their views on philosophy with philokles until kineas began to ask them questions how would you ride up to that farmhouse kineas indicated a distant stone building with his hand leading twenty men so as not to be seen in your approach they took him seriously and they talked about it waving their hands excitedly finally the leader eumenes his leadership was obvious to kineas less to his friends pointed around the woods and up that little gully there kineas nodded it was interesting to see the change in eumenes from the timid boy of the night before among his own he seemed quite mature good eye kineas said eumenes flushed at the praise thank you sir but if you dont mind my asking isnt cavalry warfare more of well fighting man to man its for the psiloi to sneak around as i understand it dont we cover the flank of the hoplites and fight it out with the enemy cavalry kineas said war is about having an advantage if you can gain an advantage over the enemy cavalry by sneaking you should do it dont you think another youth cliomenedes petrocoluss son stuttered is that is it is it i say can it be i mean right right to take an advantage did achilles do such things kineas was now riding easily in the midst of them ajax had stayed on his right hand philokles had dropped back with an amused look that suggested that mundane matters such as war were beneath his notice and ataelus had already galloped off ahead lost in the morning glare are you achilles kineas asked i should like to be said another boy sophokles my tutor says he is the model for a gentleman are you so good a man of arms that i can expect you to cut down any number of enemies kineas asked the boy looked down another boy kyros cuffed him real war is to the death and dead you lose everything liberty love possessions all lost to preserve them a few tricks are required especially when your enemies are numerous and better trained than you are he said all the words that old soldiers say to young ones and was greeted with the same respectful disbelief that he had offered his fathers friends who had fought at chaeronea they dismounted for lunch and the slaves set out a magnificent meal fit for a party of princes on a hunting trip kineas didnt complain the supplies would be gone soon enough and then theyd by eating the rations that kineas had on two mules under arnis supervision philokles ate enough for two and turned the conversation back to philosophy why do you think there are rules in war he asked eumenes rubbed his bare chin philokles motioned at kineas kineas says that you must be prepared to use subterfuge should you use spies eumenes shrugged everyone uses spies he said with the cynicism of the young agamemnon sent odysseus to spy on troy sophokles said he made a face as if to indicate that he might say such things but put no faith in them if you take a prisoner can you torture him for information philokles asked the boys wriggled and eumenes paid too much attention to his food kineas kicked philokles in the knee without getting up odysseus tortures a prisoner he said its in the iliad i remember it would you philokles asked kineas rubbed his beard and looked at his food much like eumenes then he raised his head no not without some compelling reason and even then thats filthy not for men sophokles glanced up from his bread are you saying that rules are foolish philokles shook his head im not saying anything im asking questions and you are answering them the captain says that war is to the death so why have rules sophokles glanced at kineas looking for approval anything that wins is good isnt it philokles leaned forward so would you attack an enemy during a truce perhaps while he is collecting his dead sophokles sat back and his face displayed outrage but with the tenacity of the young he stuck to his argument yes he said yes if it would give me victory philokles looked at kineas and kineas shook his head never he said sophokles cheeks developed two bright red spots and his throat blotched and he hung his head kineas fingered his beard again rubbing in the oil from his lunch rules in war have purpose he said every broken rule deepens the hate between the enemies every rule preserved keeps hate at bay if two cities fight and both abide by their oaths follow the rules and fear the gods then when they have settled the dispute they can return to trade but if one side violates a truce or murders women or tortures a prisoner then hatred rules the day and war becomes a way of life philokles nodded and he added war is the greatest of tyrants once fully unleashed men make rules to keep the tyrant bound just as they use the assembly to keep the overpowerful citizens from dominating other men fools speak of getting serious or of making real war they are invariably amateurs and cowards who have never stood in the line with a spear in their hands in the phalanx where you smell the breath of your enemy and feel the wind when he farts war is always real real enough when death awaits every misstep but when the tyrant is fully unleashed when cities fight to the death as athens and sparta did a hundred years ago when all the rules are forgotten and every man seeks only the destruction of his enemy then reason is fled and we become mad beasts and then there is neither honour nor victory the boys nodded solemnly and kineas was left with the feeling that he and philokles could as easily have proclaimed the utility of torture and rapine and convinced them after lunch kineas had them throw javelins at a tree on foot and he watched them mount their horses and commented on how that could be improved while they threw he said to philokles that was quite a speech you are against war philokles frowned i am spartan he said as if that answered kineas that kyros has a good arm kineas let the subject drop in combat youll be unhorsed kineas said itll happen several times every time you are on foot in a cavalry fight you are very nearly a dead man being able to remount is the most important skill you can master practise mounting your own horse if you can practise mounting other mens horses because the usual reason for finding yourself on foot is because some bastard has killed your horse when they were all riding into the afternoon passing the very last walled field and the last deep ditch and dyke that marked the very edge of the towns property he said in wrestling were you taught first how to fall ajax smiled because hed heard this speech so many times already practise coming off your horse recovering and getting back on practise it at a walk at a trot even at a canter ajax here was barely able to ride a few weeks ago kineas spared him a goodnatured glance now he can come off at a canter and remount in a flash ajax did it on cue without warning taking his horse a few steps away into a field rolling from the saddle and landing on his side he looked winded but he bounced to his feet and his horse had already stopped he ran to her and vaulted into the saddle his back straight and his leg thrown clear of her back he looked like an athlete several of the young men thought he looked more like a god then they all had to do it their fine cloaks and armour getting an array of dirt and dents as they threw themselves to the ground and remounted several of them lost their horses entirely eumenes a competent young man rolled out of the saddle and his horse bolted and had to be run down by kineas himself after that kineas curtailed their enthusiasm we have miles to ride today he said ajax rubbed his hip that hurt kineas smiled at him you did it very well ajax beamed if he still held an opinion on kineass actions in the fight with the getae it had been dulled by time and the routine of the unit kineas felt some awkwardness in having ajax as his second in command with all these raw youths but ajax took to it immediately tacitly appointing eumenes his own second man only when kineas and philokles had spoken about war had there been something in ajaxs look some hesitation perhaps or disagreement the sun was slipping down in the west when ataelus his red hood brilliant in the dying sun came back kineas had his cloak tight around him the bulk of his horse warming his lower half and the icy wind cutting through his helmet well asked kineas easy said ataelus for me yes tracks and hooves tracks and hooves for me i find it tomorrow night we for they camp yes they camp he gestured you saw their camp and well be there tomorrow night asked kineas see no see with eyes not for me see with this and the scyth pointed at his head tracks and hooves for knowing where not for seeing where yes kineas lost the thread of this especially as the scyth tried to introduce details and barbarian words so you went out saw tracks and well be there tomorrow night yes the scyth was happy to be understood tomorrow maybe night yes food kineas offered him a loaf of bread from lunch and a clay flagon of wine good wine the scyth rode away chuckling they continued until near dark with the river flowing dark and cold on their right on a deep sandy curve they stopped and the slaves made camp the boys were amateurs and insisted on having their own tents their own bedding and consequently were too cold to sleep kineas slept in a huddle with philokles arni and ajax while ataelus more private or perhaps more practised still pulled his horse down and slept against it in the morning the boys were drawn they stood and shivered waiting for their horses waiting for the food to be prepared kineas set them to throwing javelins his throat hurt and he rubbed at it arni brought him a tisane and he drank it with honey it helped for a while the sun was a bright orange ball against a dark sky arni came over to kineas with a cloth in his hand rubbing kineass silver wine cup clean thats heavy weather he said pointing his chin at the sun kineas nodded absently the boys warmed up quickly and in a few minutes they were again abuzz with questions most of which was directed at ajax who handled them well enough all of the boys were curious about the scyth and most wondered aloud if he was some sort of privileged slave if ataelus understood any of it before he rode away he gave no sign and left ajax to explain his status it took more than two hours to get all of the boys packed and mounted their slaves while patient and capable were not used to moving quickly and none of them was used to any discipline beyond the rods of their tutors ajax had to raise his voice and kineas enjoyed the spectacle of ajax shouting down an embarrassed eumenes when the boy wanted the fire to stay lit but im cold said the boy he sounded horrified that anyone could fail to see this as a crisis so am i so are the slaves get mounted ajax sounded so much like niceas that kineas turned away to smile that second day they played at being a patrol kineas didnt insist on any real degree of skill but he sent the boys out to scout and report and he went out a few times with them listened with patience to their reports of deer or cattle tracks dead sheep marshland to the west he instructed he kept them busy by noon he had started to cough in earnest he didnt feel bad in fact he was enjoying himself but the coughs got longer they ate in the saddle when the sun was high because the boys were tired and ataelus had returned to report that there were groups of sakje ahead of them and they could expect to meet a hunting party any time kineas had long since admitted to himself that he liked what he had seen of the sakje barbarians that they were and he didnt expect any hostility from them but professional caution and a certain desire to impress made him unwilling to be caught with a fire at a meal by one of their patrols besides the sky was dark and it had grown curiously warm kineas didnt know the plains but he knew the sea weather was coming from the saddle he said a prayer and poured a libation after lunch it began to snow kineas had seen snow in persia but not like this big heavy flakes like the down from a goose he pulled his cloak around himself and started to cough again finally leaning over in his saddle and coughing until his chest ached he noticed that philokles was supporting his weight in the saddle youre scaring the boys philokles said and we cant see the river any more kineas raised his head and realized that he could scarcely see the head of his horse his helmet sat on his brow like a block of ice his brain began to function again ataelus the scyth appeared out of the swirling snow here i am he shouted go fetch in the two boys who are out well stay right here he coughed again hermes protect us ataelus vanished into the snow the horses crowded together which suited their riders greek gentlemen rode in tunics and boots armour if the occasion demanded but fashionable gentlemen did not wear trousers all of the boys were in their best tunics and their armour to awe the barbarians now they were very cold indeed philokles pick your way along the river and find us some trees better yet find a house or a tavern you understand dont go far and dont risk getting lost we wont move until ataelus comes back and then well ride upstream take clio philokles collected the boy and trotted off into the white curtain kineas thought the stuff was letting up man and boy remained visible to him several horse lengths away eumenes pressed his horse against kineass mare are we lost he asked are we in real trouble thisll pass soon enough said kineas and coughed again im going to get us together and then find some cover we may be cold he lost the ability to speak coughed and coughed then felt better he spat some phlegm and was relieved to see there was no blood in it i made my sacrifice to you lord of contagion i helped a horse race for your glory lord apollo but he remembered he had not offered a sacrifice being busy with his own affairs a white lamb on your altar when i return he vowed and coughed again eumenes watched him his clear brow furrowed with worry under the bronze brim of his helmet kineas got himself erect in the saddle how do you keep a company moving in heavy weather he asked uh murmured eumenes kineas looked around the snow was lighter but the boys were huddled together and their faces were pale their mouths thin they were on the edge of panic you find a mark you can see and move to it then you find another mark and you move to that its slow but it beats getting lost if you cant see far enough to find a mark you stop and wait for the weather to clear kyros the one who threw the best javelin said im cold he said it softly but his words carried real conviction and his cheeks had bright red spots kineas knew that he was on the edge of real difficulty but he had already made a hard choice to stay put until the scyth returned he stuck to it push in closer to ajax by ares young gentlemen you should all learn to love one another a little more ajax is a particularly elegant specimen no one should mind cuddling with him several of the youths glanced at ajax and most of them chuckled and he seized on this slight thaw in the tension how many of you were cold last night everyone learn to be comrades tonight you are going to have mess groups youll eat and sleep in sections like spartans it works dont blush kyros no one is threatening your virtue its too cold he was holding back a cough trying to get them in hand before he made a spectacle of himself but the urge to cough overpowered him the snow in the air seemed to trigger the coughing he tried to keep his back straight and cough into his hands it was shorter but the coughs seemed deeper in his chest harsher his hands were shaking ataeluss red hood appeared over eumeness shoulder they here for me called the scyth good boys off horse wait no problem for me yes well hack hack cough cough well done ataeluss success gave him hope in fact it turned the situation around he wished his head were clearer north along the river bank look for philokles understand sure no problem heya kineax you for baqcas ataelus asked what asked kineas the scyth seemed to be using more and more barbarian words as if getting closer to his people freed his tongue from the fetters of greek what is a baxstak ataelus shook his head bacqca soon he called and waved then he led the way the two boys hed been speaking with followed him and kineas encouraged them they were taking their role as scouts seriously he liked that he didnt like that he was beginning to feel distant from the situation he had a fever hed had one before at the siege of gaza and he knew the signs the distance would serve him for an hour or so but then he would be useless to command ajax he called a pure order ajax trotted to his side or rather his horse tried to trot snow billowing from her hooves already the stuff was a hand deep on the ground sir ajax actually saluted if this boy lives hell be a fine soldier kineas leaned over im sick he said quietly his voice rasped in his throat and his nose was full sick and gedding sicker if i cand command you keep dese lads moving until you meed philokles or you meed the sakje understaaad me hermes he sounded like he was seventy years old yes sir ajax nodded kineas pushed his horse into a canter and she flailed her way back to the head of the boys behind him ajax called out two files were not on a hunting party kineas wanted to smile but things were getting farther and farther away an hour later he was still in command of himself and the group but only just twice he had snapped to not asleep perhaps but drifting both times hed recovered to see the scyths red cap bouncing along ahead of him the snow almost stopped and then came on full force again and kineas began to fear that they might pass philokles and the boy clio in the snow he became sleepy and he knew that wasnt good behind him ajax continued to heckle his charges demanding that they sit straight stop wiping their noses an endless litany of little faults that under other circumstances would have seemed ridiculous the coughing grew worse which at each bout didnt seem possible until the next and then philokles was there with him and the boy clio he sat up straight cleared the ground under the trees said philokles his nose was as red as wine i started a fire said clio myself well done boy right cough how far half a stade ataelus has the two boys at the fire go ged these boys under cover he blew his nose in his hand and coughed two tents slaves in one cavalry in the other get the slaves on food hot drink you know im a fucking spartan said philokles ive been out in a storm before you look like apollo put an arrow in you hermes send we get you to the fire hades youre burning up the sight of philokles eased kineas more than medicine he felt better he brushed the snow off the plume in his helmet and led the way to camp when they followed the tracks down to the fire he halted them and made them wheel their horses into line listen to me you behaved like soldiers that was dangerous and we did it he blew his nose on his fingers again and wiped it off on his thigh coughed and straightened were not done yet every man gathers wood i want a pile of wood as big as a house dont leave it to the slaves its your life as well as theirs horses curried and blankets on he coughed again they sat like statues either inured to discipline in one day or too miserable to twitch arni slaves to boil water and make food let them get warm first masters to work none of them rebelled none of them went to the fire they started to get wood pitiful snowy branches at first but ajax and philokles led them and suddenly it was a contest a feat worthy of achlles and they fought to get more of the stuff driftwood from the river beach downed branches from the stand of woods that filled the bend in the river even kineas who could not entirely control his body felt drawn to participate soon he was drinking from a hot bronze beaker that burned his hands even as the mulled wine burned away the pain in his throat his hands were bright red the others were standing around a huge fire a fire that was itself as big as a house and the heat blasted their clothes dry and then he was in a tent and coughing he is hot and the spirits of the dead gather around him with tongues of fire aristophanes who died screaming with an arrow in his belly on the euphrates bellows fire so that a cloud of it billows around his head like a shroud of flame a persian suddenly hes sure it is a man he killed himself has no face just bone but his hands make precise signals and then he is cold and the bodies of the dead are frozen amyntas has ice in his beard on his cheeks and when he smiles his cheeks develop little fissures like the crows feet at the edge of a matrons eyes i didnt think you were dead amyntas has no eyes no voice and no response artemiss hands are cold as clay and wet with something and his manhood shivels away from her touch and her eyes glitter there is frost on her lashes and a dagger in her neck and he flinches away the moon rises like an accusing goddess over the battlefield at guagemela and he walks alone among the dead mostly persians they lie in sad little heaps where the macedonians reaped them when they broke or windrows where they were cut if they stood and he thinks this is real because he was there in that moonlight but then the dead begin to stir rising like cold men who have had a hard sleep on the ground one patting about him for something lost his intestines at his feet another holding his back and groaning but no sounds come only a stream of black bile artemis takes his hand and he is on the bank of the euphrates with her or perhaps the pinarus perhaps both at once the cold moon gives no real light and he looks at artemis i didnt think you were dead am i dead she raises her hand beautiful as it always was even when red from work the hand of aphrodite and points across the river at the cloud of dust raised by the persian cavalry or the snow he cant remember what made the cloud it smells like smoke like burning rope or pine needles he cant remember his own name although he knows hers he longs for her longs to take the slim dagger from her neck he even knows the dagger but he cant put a name to it somewhere a strong voice is singing but if there are words they mean nothing it is not the voice of a man or a woman he stumbles down the gravel bank to the river because he is so thirsty and tries to drink she smells not of rot earthy unwashed she has smelled this way before in the field her hair is full of dirt perhaps he could wash it for her the singing is very attractive was there ever anything to be seen on the other side of the river he cant remember now there is nothing but he is sure that he had fought his way there once and lived surely that is true was there smoke he needs a horse he is dismounted and needs a horse and artemis is gone but he doesnt care so great is the urgency to find a horse he is dead if he doesnt find one and get mounted and he rises through the water and pushes with his legs but the water must have been deeper than he expected there is nothing under him and his armour is dragging at him dragging him down and he will sink and it is dark and cold so cold he cannot move and only seeks to sleep the urge to find a horse survives and he pushes up on the water but it is more like dust and his mouth is full of the stuff and he coughs and coughs his head comes clear of the waterdust and the horse above him is huge so tall that its legs rise above him like the pillars of a temple but desperation drives him terror he takes hold of the hair at its hocks and it drags him from the river and there is singing barbarian singing all around him and the smell of unwashed hair in his nose and smoke everywhere something is burning he is on the sand in the desert no he is on the snow and darius is dead begging in the agora he is on the horse his first and he cannot control it and it canters and then gallops and he cannot get off the horse ownshimandhecannotridecannotridecannotride the singing is loud and he is on the horse riding at night on the open plain but the plain is dark and sparks fly when the horses feet touch the ground which is seldom he is flying and he is flying down a mountain or up there are flashes of lightning but they linger so that each overlays the last until the sky is white with a single levin bolt in zeuss hand the mountain and the light around the mountain and the singing nasal dull barbaric smell of unwashed hair water in his mouth arms around his waist artemis is holding him on the horse and she is hot her touch is like fire and not for the first time he smiles but the light is everywhere now and the only darkness is like a tunnel ahead of him and at the end of it waits a persian in full armour on an armoured horse and he has no spear of his own no sword and he does not trust this barbarian horse between his knees her hands the dagger the light the rhythm of the horse singing water warmth fur against his head and warm light around him and the smell of fire kineas kineas could see him but he had no place in the world with the horse and artemis and all the dead and then he smiled or tried to he had fur under his head philokles he said gods be praised philokles held a cup of water to his mouth the air tasted of smoke and something barbaric he slept he woke and a barbarian loomed over him with a womans voice and a mans stubble on his cheek singing the singing seemed familiar he slept again he woke and the barbarian was still singing her voice soft and she played with a mans hands on a drum and philokles sat across the fire a fire in a tent taste of water taste of wine he slept he woke and ajax stood in the door and a great gust of wind came in snow against his face never penetrating the pile of skins atop him ajax gave him soup good soup and cleaned him where he had fouled himself so that he was ashamed and ajax laughed you will recover and humiliate me again he said no no i didnt mean you to take that so harshly kineas rest easy we are all well we are with the sakje and he dreamed and words tumbled in his dreams because philokles was speaking them hearing them from the man who was a woman amavaithya gaethanam mizhdem philokles repeated them over and over when the woman said them and the drum beat he was awake but they didnt know it and the language was like persian which he knew a little and then it wasnt the woman was called kam or perhaps baqca and then he was awake and the thin layer through which he had watched the world was stripped away and he was himself he struggled to sit up and philokles came and the whole embarrassing business of stripping him and washing him happened but he knew it for what it was who is that he asked quietly pointing at the woman he could see her more clearly now and she was clearly a man but he had known her voice so long that her gender remained with the voice that is kam baqca who cured you philokles had some message in his words he was always like that but kineass grasp on the world while strong was still not clear she he is sakje kineas croaked out the words regretting them so much else hed like to ask where were the men the boys really was anyone else sick she is very much sakje and everyone is well or well enough i would have gone back to the city but the snow is high and the sakje themselves are staying in their camp are you still with me very much so kineas managed a laugh he was very happy he was alive this is a small part of their nation three hundred or so but an important one kam baqca serves the king the most senior king of the sakje i think the ghan as does srayanka they have come to olbia on embassy are you ready to hear this philokles stopped because kineas was coughing it was a pale shadow of his former cough but it still hurt his chest his chest had exactly the feeling of having been struck repeatedly while wearing armour the same deep pain as if bruised under the skin ready enough how long seven days since we arrived we carried you here from the tent camp i thought you were dead kineas could remember snatches of his dreams he shook his head to drive them away and didnt comment you can talk to them eumenes had a sakje nurse he can speak and ataelus has never slept without him i wonder if we would be alive and now i have learned a little and the lady srayanka speaks a very little greek and the king speaks a good deal i think although he seldom speaks to us kineas looked around him he was in a round tent or hut it was open to the air at the top where the smoke billowed out and had a central pole but it felt solid under his hands and he reached up and touched it felt thick felt the floor was covered in closely woven reed mats and rugs and skins the rugs were violent colourful and barbaric he had seen them in persia a fire burned in the centre and there were chests of wood with heavy iron corners and designs savage beasts lurked in the iron and the rugs and the gold of a lamp above him he lay back already exhausted philokles said listen im tiring you but i have to share this with someone before i burst they will not meet me formally they are waiting to see if you live and they gave their best to save you but diodorus is right they say that antipater is coming in the spring with a vast army and they are here to make an alliance kineas shook his head fuck he murmured and went to sleep when he woke again it was dark ataelus was sitting by the fire playing with it and kineas watched him for what seemed a long time as he collected chips of bark and wood from the carpets and fed them into the flames absorbed by the flickers of light and the process of burning then he slipped out through the door and returned with an armload of small stuff carefully broken to length he placed it neatly atop the remnants of an older stack and built the fire up until it roared in the new light of the high flames kineas could see that kam baqca was sitting across the fire had been sitting the whole time she wore a long coat of skin covered in minute symbols carefully worked in dyed deer hair hundreds of small gold plates covered the sleeves and breast so that she glittered in the new light her feet were clad in tightfitting shoes and stockings of skin the shoes were little more than socks of leather also covered in minute decoration kineas could see horses and antelope and stranger animals especially gryphons repeated in endless variety no two the same she saw that he was awake and came around the fire to him her face was middleaged handsome and dignified with a long straight nose and high plucked brows but the eyes were a mans eyes and the throat was a mans throat and her hands when she lifted a cup for him to drink the cup was solid gold were a mans hands heavy with calluses and broken skin ataelus was still toying with the fire kam baqca spoke her voice low and ataelus came and joined her kam baqca asks how is it for you this night ataelus enunciated more clearly than he usually did kineas shook his head to be rid of the gold cup im better yes good can you give her my thanks she is a doctor ataelus cocked his head to one side like a very smart dog you better he said and then repeated himself in his barbarian tongue can you tell her thank you kineas asked again he spaced his words carefully ataelus spoke more in his other language and then turned back to kineas i say thank you for you good good speak so much greek for me he laughed maybe learn more greek for me yes kineas nodded and lay back on the pile of furs beneath his head just raising his head took too much effort kam baqca began to speak the longer she spoke the more familiar her words seemed so like persian she said xshathra ghan the great king he knew that word it wore him out listening so near to understanding ataelus began to translate she say for you important seek the king soon but sooner for you talk to her more important most important thing talk to her she say for you almost die then she say yes do you remember for almost die kineas nodded tell yes yes i remember she nodded as his response and went on ataelus said she say did you go into the river and kineas was afraid she was very barbarous and her malefemale role was alien and now she was asking him a question about his dream he didnt answer she shook her head violently a hand shot out of her cuffs and gestured at him and when she spoke her greek while ionian was clear enough be not afraid but only speak the truth did you go into the river kineas nodded he could see it could taste the dust yes she nodded from behind her she produced a drum covered in more little animals mostly reindeer she produced a small whip like a childrens toy riding whip except that the handle was iron and the whip was made of hair and with the whip she began to play the drum and sing kineas wanted to go he wanted free of the alien tent and the alien hewoman and he wanted to be spoken to in proper greek he was very near the edge of panic he stared at ataelus familiar ataelus his prokusatore searching for stability she snapped the drum up into the air and said a long sentence ataelus said she says i find you in the river i bring you home only for you only for baqcas no warrior is was will ataelus sat and struggled with language and suddenly smiled should be alive she say this for most important thing yes you know what i say kineas turned away unable to understand past the sheer barbarity tell her i thank her he said and pretended to fall asleep soon he was the next day he was stronger and they moved him the move cleared his head and his glimpse of the outside world even amidst the snow cheered him there were dogs and horses and men wearing skins and fur women in trousers and heavy fur jackets gold rings and gold decorations everywhere he had been in the tent of the kam baqca he now understood and now they took him to a tent set aside for him he had piles of furs and two gold lamps rugs and mats and several thracian cloaks for good measure philokles led the move and all of the boys were there fighting for a place in carrying his litter arranging his furs his blankets getting him hot wine it was deeply touching and he enjoyed it and the conversation with kam baqca seemed less alien perhaps he had still had a touch of fever but it was gone now i take it you are all waiting for me to recover he said to philokles the rest of the boys had cleared out led by ajax to join hunters from the sakje yes the king wants to speak to you before he moves to be frank i suggested we leave you with his people and i lead the escort back to olbia but he thinks that you are a person of consequence ares balls why kineas snorted many things had gone below the threshold of worry during the last days but they were all back now his alienated employer the factions the city lady srayanka i mentioned her the kings niece i think although they have a different word for every degree of relative like the persians just so shes a niece or maybe a sisters adopted child but shes someone with power and shes our girl from the plains she claims you are a man of importance ataelus says its a warrior thing philokles shrugged i gather you killed someone important or perhaps just at the right time or eumenes says this avenged somebody here by your act and that gives you status kineas shook his head were a long way from home he felt an excitement our girl from the plains now ive learned her name srayanka it seemed an absurd thing for a grown man to be so pleased by but he was pleased he repeated it over and over like a prayer philokles sat on a pile of furs kineas realized with a start that philokles was wearing leather trousers it was so ungreek so unlike a spartan however exiled philokles followed his gaze and smiled its cold and someone made them for me eumenes said it would be rude to refuse they are warm they rub the parts if the ephors could see you now youd be an exile for ever kineas began to laugh it hurt his chest but it felt good he was speaking greek to a greek the world would be right soon enough philokles laughed with him and then leaned over listen to me kineas theres more to this than you know kineas nodded no listen these people they hold the military power on the plains they dont need hoplites or walls theyre nomads they just move when they want they hold the power here they have the ability to stop macedon on the plains or not kineas sat up since when do you care so deeply what macedon does philokles stood up this is not about me kineas lay back it is it is about you there was something nagging at the edge of his thoughts some connection you wanted to be here here you are macedon are they really coming here do i care ill get the company clear before no philokles leaned over him no kineas stay and fight all these people need to hear is that olbia and pantecapaeum will stand and fight beside them and they will assemble an army srayanka says so kineas shook his head and said slowly this means a great deal to you spartan is this why you came to make an alliance against macedon i came to see the world i am an exile and a philosopher bastard you are an agent of the kings and ephors and a spy you lie philokles snapped up his cloak rot in hell athenian you have it in your power to do good to hold the line and save something bah like an athenian save your skin and let the others rot no wonder the macedonians own us he pushed out through the flap bruising snow off the roof and leaving a gap where an icy wind crept in the fire began to smoke kineas climbed out from underneath his furs and made his way to the door it wasnt as bad as he had feared just cold he tugged at the heavy felt flap until it fell into place across the door and he pushed on a stick sewn into the felt until it closed just right sealing the door an inner curtain fell over the whole he was warmer immediately he found dried meat and apple cider by his bed and tore into them the meat was softly seasoned almost tart and the cider smelled of ectabana he drank it all then he had to piss he was naked in his tent and there was nothing like a jar or a chamber pot he wondered what had led him to accuse philokles and he shook his head at the hypocrisy of his accusation he had to piss and he needed someone to help him that revealed to him how foolish he had been to antagonize the spartan and for what he was suspicious of the spartans motives he always had been who cares he asked the tent flap he had no clothes and it would be cold as hell outside and he needed to piss who gives a shit which under the circumstances seemed funny the flap rustled and philokless head appeared kineas smiled in relief i apologize me too philokles came in i antagonized a very sick man what are you doing out of your blankets i have to piss like a warhorse philokles wrapped him in two thracian cloaks and led him out in the snow his feet hurt from the cold but the relief of emptying his bladder trumped the pain of his feet and in seconds he was back in the furs philokles watched him intently you are better kineas nodded i am good i have found someone more persuasive to make my argument lady srayanka will be here when the hunt ends she will make the case herself kineas cast about the tent again where are my clothes dont be a fool this is not a mating ritual i imagine the lady is well wed this is diplomacy and you have the advantage of illness sit and look pale besides youve seldom been lovelier eumenes pines for you when he isnt pining for ajax kineas glanced at him and realized that he was being teased cut my beard an hour ago i was a coward and a liar no a spy you said liar the possibility of real enmity hung in the air between them just a few words away from the raillery kineas made a sign of aversion in the air a peasant sign from the hills of attica i have apologized and i will again no need im a touchy bastard philokles looked away i am a bastard kineas do you know what that means in sparta kineas shook his head he knew what it meant in athens it means you are never a spartiate win at games triumph in lessons and still no mess group will welcome you i thought that i had escaped from the weight of the shame but apparently i brought it here with me kineas thought for a moment sipping more cider and then he said you are not a bastard here im sorry for the word i use it too often it is easy im well born whatever i am now but i say again you are no bastard here or in olbia or in tomis for that matter please forgive me philokles smiled it was a rare kind of smile for him free of sarcasm or doubt just a smile the philosopher forgave you when i walked out the tent he laughed the spartan needed a little more combat kineas rubbed his face now trim my beard and comb my hair and philokles said you bastard it was long after dark when she came kineas and philokles had spent the afternoon talking first in a gush and then comfortably by topics with silences twice kineas went to sleep and awoke to find him still there the snow had finally ceased eumenes said so when he came back with an antelope hed knocked over with his own spear proud as a boy reciting his first lines of homer these barbarians can ride my father calls them bandits but they are like centaurs id only seen them drunk in the town and my nurse of course not like they are here at all philokles smiled i fancy you are seeing a different type of sakje altogether noble ones i know the lady she rides like artemis herself kineas started before he realized the boy must mean the goddess he made the avert sign women who rivalled artemis seldom came to a good end but his artemis had been a fine rider in many different ways he smiled to himself he was becoming an old fool eumenes continued she killed twice once with a bow and once with her spear a woman sirs imagine and the men so courteous they found my buck i was nervous what if i failed my throw right there surrounded by barbarians kineas laughed aloud i know that feeling young man eumenes looked hurt you sir i saw you throw in the hippodrome sir but anyway ill never let my father call them bandits again philokles ushered him out i gather lady srayanka has gone to dinner kineas was disappointed he was shaved and under the furs he had a good linen tunic now somewhat creased from being napped in but he smiled you are good company sir philokles flushed like a young man you please me socrates said there was no higher compliment or maybe xenophon one of them anyway for a soldier but why hector you about what soldiers think have you made a campaign is it not something about which you will speak i mean no insult i made a campaign with the men of molyvos against mytilene it was my first for all my training why did you leave philokles looked into the fire many reasons he began and there was a stir at the door cloth lady srayanka entered alone and without fuss sweeping the door aside and closing it with a single sweep of her arm having entered she walked around the fire brushed her long doeskin coat under her knees and sat in one fluid motion she flashed a brief smile at philokles greetings greek men may the gods look favourably upon you it was delivered so well so fluently that only later did kineas realize it was a practised phrase learned off by heart philokles nodded gravely as if to a greek matron in a wellordered house greetings despoina kineas couldnt help but smile the head was the same although the face was less severe still the same clear blue eyes and her ludicrous heavy brows that nearly met in the middle of her face he was being rude staring into her eyes and she was looking back at him the corner of her mouth curled greetings lady he said it didnt sound as stumbling as he had feared i desire to send for ataelax yes her voice was low but very much a womans ataelax asked kineas ataelus his name as it is said here i gather philokles explained as he opened the flap and called ataelus came in so quickly it was obvious he had been waiting nearby the moment he entered something changed until then her eyes were mostly on kineas once he was through the flap they were everywhere else for speaking he said kineas decided that he would pay some teacher in olbia to improve on the cases of the scyths nouns as soon as possible lady srayanka spoke softly and at length ataelus waited until she was completely finished and then asked her several questions then she asked him a question finally he turned to kineas she says many fine things for you you birth and how to say hearting brave she say you kill a very big man getae man kill her for special friend and for dear man yes and other thing for other thing all good then this sorry she take tax on plain for her from us make trouble with stone houses make trouble for horse people sakje she say you never say olbia and i say you never ask but truth for truth you never tell me or maybe i for understand or not yes philokles leaned over ive heard this before kineas this getae you killed he had killed someone important to her not a relative not a husband a lover i dont think well get to know kineas nodded praise was praise when you valued the giver tell her i am sorry for the loss of her friend ataelus nodded and spoke to the lady who nodded too she spoke tugging one of her heavy black braids she say i cut these for loss so not now but long ago i think she went on gesturing with her hands she was wearing a different coat and her golden breastplate was not in evidence but this coat was also decorated in dark blue lines abstract patterns from the middle of the sleeve to her wrist and it had the same cones of gold foil wrapped around hair that tinkled and whispered as she moved now she say other thing she say you airyanam yes you know this word kineas nodded flattered the persian word for aristocrat old noble and also for good behaviour i know it so she say you this airyanam you big man for olbia she say macedon walks here she say macedon kill father brother i say this big battle ten turns of the moon years ten years yes in the summer sakje fight macedon many kill many die no win but king he killed me far away on the plains care nothing for this king nothing for macedon but i hear this too big battle big yes so so her father this king so i say not she she big woman big she like i think first time yes philokles glanced at her and said you think her father was the king who died fighting macedon in a big battle ten years back you werent there but you heard a lot about it and you think she is very important good for you said ataelus for me she big yes and she say macedon walks she say hands of hands of hands of men walk for macedon like grass like water in river she say new king good man but not fight or maybe fight but if olbia fight king fight otherwise not king go off into plains macedon walks to olbia kineas nodded that he understood what had been said he was sitting up watching her she ignored his regard concentrating on ataelus now she was passionate her hands flashing in front of her as if she urged on a horse by pumping the reins she was loud ataelus continued she say you big man for olbia you man airyanam you make for her although ataelus was just starting to translate her most impassioned speech she was finished and she sank back with her head against the tents central pole her face turned up to the smoke hole her heavy lashes covering her eyes as if she couldnt bear to watch the result of her words kineas realized that he was watching her so intently he was missing the translation of her speech you go bring olbia make olbia fight war down macedon make sakje great make olbia great break macedon everybody free she say more all word talk and kineax she like you that she not say yes i say it little childrens ouside yurt say it yes everybody say it king poke her with it so you knowing this i say it ataelus was smiling but he had forgotten that the lady spoke some greek like an arrow from a bow she rose to her feet glared at him struck him with her riding whip a substantial blow that knocked him flat and vanished through the door flap uh oh said ataelus he got to his feet unsteadily holding his shoulder then he pushed through the flap and called out a steady stream of obvious invective greeted him it was quite loud fluent and went on for long enough that kineas and philokles exchanged glances kineas winced very like a persian i think she just said that he could eat shit and die philokles poured himself wine im happy that your romance is flourishing but i need your brain you understand her words about macedon kineas was still listening to her she was running down using words that he didnt know they all seemed to end in ax macedon yes philokles yes i was listening macedon is coming listen philokles ive made seven campaigns ive been in two great battles i know what macedon brings listen to me if antipater comes here hell have two or three taxies of foot half as many as alexander has in asia hell have as many thracians as he can pay and two thousand heterae the best cavalry in the world hell have thessalians and greeks and artillery even if he only sends a tithe of his strength these noble savages and our city hoplites wouldnt last an hour philokles looked at his wine cup and then held it up it was solid gold youve been sick a week ive been talking to people mostly to kam baqca she is their closest approach to a philosopher the witch doctor kineas said with a smile she scared me last night she is a great deal more than a witch doctor in fact she is so great that her presence here is probably more important than the kings she speaks some greek but for her own reasons seldom uses it i wish i spoke this language everything i think i know comes through the sieve of other mens thoughts kam baqca scares ataelus so badly he can barely keep his thoughts in order to translate for me kineas was losing hope that srayanka would come back why i admit she has tremendous presence have you ever gone to delphi philokles interrupted no the priestesses of apollo are like her she combines in herself two sacred functions she is enareis you remember your herodotus she has sacrificed her manhood to function as a seer and she is baqca the most powerful baqca anyone can remember according to ataelus kineas tried to remember what had been said in her tent what is baqca i have no idea ataelus keeps telling me things and lady srayanka they speak of her with reverence but they dont speak of baqca in detail it is a barbarian concept philokles shook his head im losing my thread in a maze of details kineas there are thousands of these people tens of thousands and their king is wandering around with a witch doctor and a handful of retainers looking for support from a little town on the euxine tell me another one philokles tossed off the rest of his wine youre pissing me off they are barbarians kineas i dont understand the role of their king but hes neither figurehead nor asian tyrant the best ive been able to understand hes only king when there is something kingly to do otherwise hes a major chief ruling his tribe and this is only a fraction of his tribe his escort if you like kineas lay back tell me all this in the morning im better in the morning i intend to see if i can ride and srayanka wants it said philokles he smiled nastily whichever head you want to think with i have an argument as soon as it was known that kineas was up and dressed he was summoned to meet the king he was prepared dressed in his best tunic and sandals he left his armour off as he was still too weak to bear the weight for any time outside the tent his escort waited his eight men from olbia in their cloaks and armour looking like statues they faced together like professionals and marched him to the kings yurt flanked by a crowd of curious sakje dogs barked children pointed and they crossed a few yards of muddy snow the kings yurt was by far the largest and the entrance had two layers of doors that had to be thrown back by his escort inside it was so warm that he shed his cloak as soon as dignity permitted a dozen sakje sat in a semicircle around the fire they sat crossslegged on the ground chatting easily and as kineas entered the yurt they all rose to their feet in the centre of them stood a boy or perhaps a very young man with heavy blond hair and a short blond beard his position marked him as the king but for the splendour of dress and the quantity of gold any one of the dozen sakje might have been royal srayanka stood at his right hand her face was closed and cold and her glance flicked over him rested briefly on philokles and returned to the king next to her kam baqca stood behind the king dressed simply in a long coat of white with her hair coiled atop her head she inclined her head in greeting the king smiled welcome kineas i am satrax king of the assagatje please sit and let us serve you at his words all of the people in the tent sat together and kineas tried and failed to match their grace philokles and eumenes had entered with him and sat on either side by prior arrangement and ataelus sat a little to his right in a sort of nomansland between the groups kineas spoke once he had settled i thank you for your welcome o king your hospitality has been gracious indeed i was sick and your doctor healed me he watched the king carefully the boy was younger than alexander had been when they crossed the hellespont his face still soft and unmarked with harsh experience his wide eyes spoke well of his good nature and his gestures had a fledgling dignity kineas liked what he saw greek wine was brought in deep vases and poured into a huge bowl of solid gold the king dipped cups of wine in the bowl and handed them to his guests blessing each one when he filled kineass cup he carried it to where kineas sat kineas rose unsure of the protocol and unused to be being waited on by any but slaves the king pressed him back down the blessings of the nine gods of the heavens attend you kineas he said in greek he had an accent but his greek was pure if ionic kineas took his cup and drank as he had seen others do it was unwatered pure chian straight from the vase he swallowed carefully and a small fire was lit in his stomach when the king was seated with a cup in his own hand he poured a libation and spoke a prayer then he leaned forward to business he said he was aggressive in the halftimorous way of the young will olbia fight against macedon or submit kineas was astonished at the speed with which the king moved to the issue at hand he had made the mistake of finding similarities between the sakje and the persians and had therefore expected ceremony and lengthy conversation about trivialities no answer came to him come kineas several of my friends have already broached this topic with you the king leaned forward clearly enjoying his advantage what will olbia do kineas noted that the boys eyes flicked to srayankas for approval so i cannot speak for olbia sir kineas met the kings eye close up he could see the young king was handsome almost as handsome as ajax with a snub barbarian nose the only jarring feature on his face kineas toyed with his wine to give himself time to think i think the archon will first have to be convinced that the threat of macedon is real the king nodded and exchanged a glance with a big bearded man at his left i expected as much and i have no proof to offer let me ask a better question if macedon marches will olbia submit kineas suspected that the boy was giving memorized questions he shrugged again you must ask the archon i cannot speak for olbia he squirmed as srayanka glanced at him with indifference and turned back to smile at the king the king played with his beard after a short silence he nodded this is as i expected and that is why i must go and see your archon myself he paused will you advise me kineas nodded slowly as far as i am able i command the archons cavalry i am not his confidante the king smiled if you were i should hardly ask you to advise me he suddenly seemed very mature for his years it occurred to kineas that the boy might be asking his own questions after all and his sarcasm was as greek as his language many of my nobles feel we should fight kam baqca says we should fight only if olbia and pantecapaeum intend to fight what do you say easy to be derisory when facing philokles more difficult when facing this direct young man i would hesitate to fight macedon srayankas head snapped in his direction her eyes narrowed he noted how dark her lips were and how when she turned her head away they turned down kam baqca spoke a few words the king smiled kam baqca says that you have served the monster and you know more of him than any man here the monster asked kineas alexander kam baqca calls him the monster the king poured himself more wine i served alexander kineas admitted they all looked at him and he wondered if he was in danger here none of the looks were friendly only kam baqca regarded him with a smile and srayanka busied herself with her riding whip rather than meet his eye and he thought i served him i loved him and now i begin to suspect that kam baqca is right he is a monster he was confused and the confusion fed his tone the army of macedon is the finest in the world if antipater sends zopryon here he will bring thousands of pike men thracians archers probably fifteen thousand men on foot and cavalry from macedon and thessaly the best in the greek world against that the men of olbia and pantecapaeum plus a few hundred scythians were every one of them achilles come back from the elysian fields would not be enough the king fingered his beard again and then played with a ring embarrassed how many riders do you think i can put in the field kineas kineas was at a loss how to answer since barbarian kings inevitably exaggerated the numbers of their men if he flattered and guessed too high he robbed his own argument of validity too low and he insulted the king i do not know o king i see a few hundred here im sure there are more the king laughed as kineass words were translated more and more of the sakje laughed even srayanka laughed listen kineas it is winter the grass is under the snow and there is little wood out on the plains for fires in winter every band from every tribe goes its own way to find food to get shelter and to cut wood if we all stayed together the horses would starve and the animals would all stay away from our bows i have seen the cities of the greeks i was a hostage in pantecapaeum i have seen how many people you can put inside a stone wall with slaves to till the land and slaves to cook it we have no slaves we have no walls but in the spring if my chief war leaders agree that we must fight i can call tens of thousands of horsemen here perhaps three tens of thousands perhaps more philokles put a hand on kineass knee ataelus says this is so i think it is true think before you speak kineas tried to imagine three tens of thousands of horsemen in a single army can you feed them he asked the king nodded for a while and for a longer while with the cities at my side let me be straight with you kineas i can also simply ride away north into the plains and leave you to the macedonians they can march until the snow falls next year and never find me the plains are vast greater than all the rest of the world kineas took a deep breath shutting out the hand on his knee and the blue eyes under the dark brows across the tent if you wish to sway the archon you must convince him that you have such force with three tens of thousands of men and women who rode like artemis the king pointed the toe of his boot at the great golden bowl at his feet i cannot show him the riders on the great plain kineas but i can show him an enormous amount of gold and gold is the way to the heart of a greek or so i have observed and your archon might ask himself this if the bandit king has a mountain of gold why should he not have thirty thousand riders kineas winced at the words bandit king and the king laughed again isnt that what he calls us bandits horse thieves worse i heard them all when i was a hostage kineas said then why would you fight at all why not retreat into the plains the king sat back until his shoulders rested against a wall hanging he looked comfortable your cities are our riches we sell our grain there and we buy goods we love we can lose these things we are not bound by them but we might fight to keep them too he raised his hand and rocked it to and fro it balances like this fight for our treasure or leave it he smiled wryly if i decide rightly i will be a good king if i decide poorly i will be a bad king he stood you are tired i will have more questions as we ride will you be prepared to depart tomorrow kineas stood as well philokles rising impatiently by his side o king i will by your leave i will escort you to olbia let it be so the next day kineas still felt lightheaded when he moved too fast and the effort of wearing armour was at first too much for him but he was soon accustomed to it the snow lay in deep drifts around the camp tramped flat where the tracks of hunters or wood gatherers left the circle of wagons away to the south he could see a great black curve of the river there was no sign of the track they had followed this far we will have to go slowly kineas said to ajax and eumenes philokles was avoiding him the sakje will all have changes of horses eumenes pointed to where the travelling party was preparing the king and ten mounted companions they were all dressed like kings heavy with gold ornaments all of them wore red cloaks although no two cloaks were dyed to exactly the same hue kineas looked for srayanka but she was not there she would not be accompanying the royal party he wondered if she would have come had he spoken as she desired he wondered what exactly she and philokles had wanted him to say he thought about the reception waiting for him in olbia and a winter training rich men and their sons to be cavalrymen and for the first time the prospect seemed empty and worthless he thought about the proposition he had been made after being exiled and what it might now mean he thought about her and the way the king had looked at her royal mistress fiancee sour thoughts the kind of jealous thoughts that first inform a man that hes in love were filling his mind when philokles appeared at his elbow you look as if a dog ate your breakfast philokles said he looked happy fit and ready for anything is she actually well wed brother kineas asked philokles grinned kineas seldom referred to him as brother and he enjoyed the compliment she is not something told me that you might enquire he laughed aloud kineas could feel the flush rolling down his cheeks to his neck laugh all you want he said tersely philokles held up a hand my pardon he said unfair to laugh who has so often felt the sting of aphrodite himself she is unwed and as ataelus thought the lord of a great tribe of these barbarians and a famous warrior kineas rubbed his beard watching the king and his mount and avoiding philokless eyes is she the kings concubine philokles put his hands on his hips can you imagine that girl as anyones concubine he grinned i have half a mind to tell her you asked kineas whirled around and philokles laughed again you have it bad he said kineas grunted then he turned away from philokles grabbed eumenes by the shoulder and strode to the kings side the king was checking the hooves of his mount he had a forefoot between his knees and a crooked knife in his teeth good morning he said around the knife kineas bowed stiffly the weight of his breastplate making him clumsy i dont want to slow you sir but we have only a few remounts and we wont be able to travel quickly the king put the horses foot back on the ground gave the beast a friendly pat and began tightening the girth kineas still had difficulty watching a king tighten his own girth it rendered him unable to believe that the same king might have thirty thousand horsemen sure that his girth was adequate the king waved his whip at a tall man with whiteblond hair and an enormous beard dressed from head to foot in red at the council he had sat at the kings left side marthax i need you marthax rode over on a tall roan stallion he was a heavy man with a paunch that spilled over his belt but he had arms like small trees and his legs were enormous his red pointed hat was trimmed in white fur and he had a set of gold plaques modelled as kissing aphrodites that ran around the top of each bicep he and the king exchanged a few words kineas was sure that they said horse and snow then they both looked at him marthax grinned widely you friend king he said some friend king give horses come see horses take kineas shouted for ataelus and said to eumenes i dont want to be beholden for these horses just tell him to loan us a few so that we have remounts eumenes began to hem and haw interjecting a few tentative words of sakje but the king shook his head just take them i have a few thousand more i want to go fast and get this over with my people here will be waiting and we have a long long ride north across the plains when this is done his words were friendly but the tone was preemptory the gift was not a request it was an order kineas pointed to ataelus already mounted to follow marthax he returned with a string of sturdy plains ponies and two tall chargers they were both pale grey like new iron with black stripes running down their spines kineas watched them go by scrutinizing their size and strength he was so absorbed with the chargers that he almost walked into kam baqca she held his shoulders firmly and looked into his eyes her own were dark so brown as to be almost black even in the glare of the snow she began to speak almost to sing and the king came and stood beside her she says do not try to cross the river again without my help the king raised his eyebrows the seer smiled still holding his shoulders and he looked into her deep brown eyes all the way down to where the dreams waited and a tree grew in the dark and then he was standing in the snow and she said you must not leave without speaking to my niece in clear greek the king turned to look at her the sudden turn and glare of an eagle kineas noted it the seer ignored her king instead she reached up and attached a charm to kineass horses bridle the bridle was plain just a loop of leather with a bronze bit his good bridle was with his charger safely back in olbia the charm was of iron a bow and an arrow will that keep me warm he asked lightly the king frowned do not joke about kam baqca she does not sell her charms but we are greatly favoured if we wear them what river can you not cross without her i dreamed a river kineas said his eyes were on lady srayanka who stood in the muddy snow by the kings yurt giving orders to men loading a wagon he looked back at the king and his eyes were wary and his face closed she says next time you will dream a tree do not climb it without me the king rubbed his beard he was too young to hide his anger and kineas had no idea what the king might be angry about this is seer talk kineas are you too a baqca kineas made the sign of aversion no i am a simple cavalryman philokles is the philosopher his aside was apparently translated because kam baqca spat an answer back and then as if relenting gave him a pat on the head as if he were a good child she says the one who says poems is a fine man but she has never seen him and he did not go alone to the river and she says the king paused his eyes narrowed she says this decision will come down to you however you twist and turn i think she speaks of the war with macedon kam baqca hit the king lightly on the shoulder and she tells me this is not for me to think on that i am only her mouth the king frowned again adolescent petulance warring with natural humour what satrap what great king can be ordered around in this way by his people the king began to collect his arms a heavy quiver that held both bow and arrows called a gorytos a short sword on an elaborately decorated belt with a heavy scabbard and a bucket of javelins that attached to his saddle kam baqca patted kineas on the head again and then turned him by his shoulders so he faced lady srayanka srayanka caught his eye and then looked away her indifference was a little too studied a younger man would have read her motion as a direct rejection but kineas had seen some of the world and recognized that she wanted his attention he couldnt help but smile as he walked to her he had no translator which given the last occasion but one seemed just as well and as he came close to her she extended a hand in greeting on a whim he reached up and took the gorgons head clasp off his cloak and put it in her hand her hand was warmer than his with heavy calluses on the top of the palm and a velvety smoothness on the back he hadnt remembered and the contrast the hard sword hand and the soft back went through him like poetry or the sight of the first flower of spring recognition wonder awe at first she didnt meet his eyes but neither did she reject his touch she shouted a command over her shoulder and then flicked her eyes over the broach smiled and looked at him she was taller than he had imagined her eyes had flecks of brown amidst the blue and were very nearly level with his own go with the gods kinyaas she said she looked at the gorgons head again decent work from an athenian shop and smiled he could smell her woodsmoke and leather her hair needed washing he wanted to kiss her and he didnt think that was a good idea but the urge was so strong that he stepped back to avoid having his body betray him she put her whip in his hand go with the gods she said again and turned on her heel already calling to a mounted man carrying a bundle of fleeces kineas looked at the whip after he mounted he had never carried one despising them as a tool for poor riders this one had a handle made of something very heavy yet pliable he could feel it moving under his hands alternating bands of worked leather and solid gold were wrapped over a pliable core the worked leather showed a scene of men and women hunting together on horseback that wound up the handle from an agate stone in the pommel to the stiff horsehair of the whip it was a beautiful thing too heavy to hit a horse but a useful pointer and a pretty fair weapon he flexed it a few times his young men were mounting behind him they looked better for a week riding with the sakje and today they all had their armour helmets and cloaks he took his place at their head still playing with his whip ajax saluted he was already a competent hyperetes the men were formed neatly and kineas saluted back youre a fine soldier ajax he said ill be sorry when you go back to marry your rich girl and trade your cargoes ajax flashed him his beautiful smile sir do you ever pay a compliment without a sting in the tail kineas flexed the whip again yes he smiled at clio the nearest trooper clio you look like an adult this morning and to all of them you gentlemen ready for a hard ride the king intends to do this in two days thats going to be ten hours in the saddle i cant let anyone drop out are you ready yes they shouted the sakje stopped whatever they were doing to watch them for a moment then they went back to their preparations philokles came up mounted on one of the sakje chargers a fine animal with heavy muscles the king gave me this horse i must say hes a generous fellow he looked around and then whispered not your greatest fan kineas kineas raised an eyebrow philokles spread his hands and bowed his head a gesture universal among greeks ill say no more on the subject kineas shook his head and returned his mind to the matter at hand i couldnt find a horse your size thats a superb animal philokles dont waste him in the snow bah youve made a centaur of me kineas with this beast between my legs i could ride anywhere philokles gave him a broad smile if you dont wipe that grin off your face kineas people might mistake you for a happy man kineas glanced at the spartan ran his eyes over his horse you might want to get your girth tight first kineas slid down got under the spartans leg and heaved and roll your cloak tight here give it to me philokles shrugged niceas always does it for me shame on him shame on you kineas flipped the cloak open over the broad back of the charger who shied a little when he saw the flapping cloak in the corner of his black eye then kineas folded it rolled it tight and hard and buckled it to the highbacked sakje saddle in the infantry we just wear the damn things philokles said tie it like this behind your saddle and you have something to lean your ass on when youre tired kineas was looking at the sakje saddle that philokles had acquired it had a much higher back than any greek tack most greeks were content with a blanket he remounted and gathered his reins nice whip philokles said that didnt come from the king he flashed a wicked smile philokles kineas said putting his hand on the spartans rein the king rode up on his other side and interrupted him were ready if you are he said curtly in what order would you like us to ride kineas looked at his own disciplined greeks and the milling sakje nobles they were showing off for women or men performing curvets and rearing their horses two were already off having a race and the snow erupted from under their hooves in the early sun the young king shrugged i thought that i would send out a pair in front like any decent commander and then since this is a peaceful mission i thought you and i could ride abreast perhaps with this talkative spartan for company i shall practise my greek philokles shall learn more of my land and i can teach you how to use the sakje whip the king indicated the whip in kineass hand that looks familiar to me he said with greek sarcasm at your command sir kineas said he raised his hand forward said the king in greek and then fera the sickness was almost gone from his body praise to the deadly archer apollo for passing him by and to kam baqca for saving him and the coughs scarcely troubled him the journey back to the city was pleasant despite the chill and the deep snow on the plains because the kings men were good companions and because his olbian boys were becoming something like soldiers for two days kineas had nothing to worry about the kings men chose camps and erected felt tents from the two heavy wagons that carried all of the partys baggage kineas rode and talked and in brief intervals alone thought of srayanka whatever coldness was between him and the king it disappeared soon after they left the camp the holiday ended forty stades from olbia we spotted a patrol young kyros shouted as soon as he was close enough to be heard he slowed his horse sweeping in a wide arc in front of the king and gave a belated salute kineas waited with apparent indifference until the young man brought his horse to a stand in front of them four men all well mounted ataelus says they are your men from the city kyros looked a trifle downcast i didnt see them ataelus did hes watching them kineas turned to the king if ataelus saw them theyll have seen him and theyll be with us shortly even as he spoke two riders crested the next ridge and began a rapid descent kineas knew niceas by the set of his shoulders and the way he rode even on the horizon of a snowy plain and as soon as he spotted his hyperetes cantering down the ridge towards the sakje kings party he began to worry that man rides well said the king at his side hes been in the saddle all his life kineas said he gave a cough to keep watch on the roads in winter is no easy task the king said he tugged his beard thoughtfully niceas rode up at a fast trot and saluted hipparch i greet you he said formally kineas returned his salute and then embraced him you are better he said niceas smiled by the grace of all the gods and despite the meddling of diodorus with various potions im a new man then he seemed to recollect the company he was in pardon sir kineas used to the rampant informalities of the sakje had to make himself think like a greek the king of the sakje my friend and hyperetes niceas like me an athenian the king held out his right hand and niceas took it im honoured great king im not a great king satrax said i am king of the assagatje he narrowed his eyes i do intend to be a great king in time niceas looked back and forth between his commander and the barbarian king kineas read his hesitancy and motioned to the king with his whip already a part of him niceas has private news for me o king may i have your permission to ride aside with him for a little space satrax waved his riding whip in return it was a sakje habit they talked with their whips be my guest he said i like him said niceas as soon as they were out of earshot nothing persian about him but ares frozen balls hes young not as young as he looks what in hades brought you out to freeze your hairy ass in the snow kineas was taking both of them out of the column at a good standing trot and his words were shaken by the motion of the horse niceas was silent until they both reined in at the top of a low ridge below them the kings two heavy wagons toiled along drawn by a double yoke of oxen you were supposed to be back in three days a week at longest he looked around the assembly didnt accept the archons taxes now theres trouble nothing solid yet but when you didnt show people started to talk trouble that will be solved the hour you ride in the gate a lot of rich fathers are missing their sons led by cleomenes so diodorus and i decided wed send out patrols to look for you that was three days back niceas looked like a man ridding himself of the weight of the world why are you so late theres men in the city saying you were killed by the barbarians and others saying the archon wont let you bring back the boys until the taxes are voted what men asked kineas who said so coenus was off to find that out when i took the patrol out niceas shrugged even money says its the archon did you have his permission to look for me kineas waved to get the kings attention somehow that slipped my mind niceas pantomimed repentance kineas sighed he had enjoyed days on the plains without any burden of command beyond his handful of promising boys he felt as if all of niceass burdens had shifted squarely on to his own shoulders he kicked his heels and his sturdy pony one of the kings gifts trotted back down the hill towards the column how are the rest kineas asked pretty fair bored this patrol had everyone volunteering diodorus put everything off limits except the gymnasium and the hippodrome until your return niceas chuckled weve acquired some whores diodorus bought the services of a hetaera kineas congratulated diodorus in his mind whered they come from he asked they were approaching the king and marthax who were laughing with ajax and eumenes niceas glanced away oh here and there i guess he said evasively kineas made a note to himself to find out and then saluted the king o king i am required in the city ajax made room and kineas brought his horse alongside the kings satrax nodded then let us go faster he said and set his horse to a gallop every sakje in the party did the same and the greeks had to scramble to keep up for the first time kineas saw the full measure of the sakje as horsemen they galloped their horses for an hour halted and every man switched horses and they were off again it was a pace that would have broken a troop of greek cavalry in two hours but with their herd of remounts and their unflagging energy the sakje rode at a gallop for three hours pausing once to drink unwatered wine and piss in the snow they left their wagons and half their party to come along at the pace of the oxen before the sun was three fists from the horizon the whole party was passing over the citys boundary ditch and through the outer fields of the greek and sindi farmers fast enough for you kineas asked the king reining in id prefer to arrive without all my horses blown kineass legs felt like hot lead had been poured down his thighs his olbian boys were all still with them but the moment the cavalcade stopped every one of them dismounted and began to rub his thighs the horses steamed the sakje merely pulled out their wineskins and drank next to the king marthax opened his barbarian trousers and pissed in the snow without dismounting his horse did the same kineas rode back to his own men ten stades my friends lets finish with the same spirit we had at the start backs straight good seat and a javelin in your fist niceas even the hyperetes looked tired from the last three hours sir check their gear helmets i think look sharp kineas rode back to the horses and exchanged his pony for his warhorse who seemed happy to see him he didnt feel too sharp himself but as he rode he pulled his freezing helmet off his pack and pushed it on to the back of his head eumenes rode up and handed him a javelin marthax rode up beside him king says fear what kineas had gotten to know a little of marthax on the ride he was a relation to srayanka and he had a little greek he seemed to be the kings steward or his closest companion despite the age difference marthax was a warrior in his prime or perhaps past it kineas suspected he was the kings warlord ill tell the king lets go kineas hadnt mastered much of the sakje tongue beyond simple congnates of persian he already knew but he had gotten the knack of speaking simple greek to the greek speakers and to hades with subtlety ataelus was sitting on his horse beside the king i have for the town gate and back he said he held up an arrow got this for greeting kineas pushed his horse into the kings group i can explain o king the town is in some turmoil i am overdue and niceas had told me a rumour was spread that that we were killed on the plain satrax gave him a level look but all of your men are arming for show sir only for the show marthax spoke quickly in sakje and there were grunts from the other warriors ataelus pushed his horse to kineass side for going home for not trust city trust you he says trust not city for telling king he told all this before kineas raised his voice over the murmurs of the sakje nobles if we move now satrax we will be in the city before dark and well quell these rumors if we wait a day he shrugged satrax nodded he spoke in sakje and dikarxes a noble of the kings age spoke and then marthax spoke clearly in agreement the king nodded and turned to kineas well wait here for the wagons if youll be so kind as to send one of your men to get permission from the farmer well make our camp by the first bend in the river where the horse market is held kineas glanced at the rapidly setting sun i had thought to take you to the city best you go ahead dikarxes and marthax agree a horde of bandits like ourselves might get a grim reception he extended his hand and clasped kineass hand you look worried my friend go attend to this and come fetch us in the morning in truth your city makes us nervous i think we will be happier to camp in the snow kineas shook his head you shame me o king and yet i fear that your decision is a wise one look for me in the morning he rode back to his own men gather round he said and they pressed close the king will camp here the city is nervous some fool has spread a rumour were all dead well go to the city but the king needs a man to guarantee the good behaviour of the farmers remember that to them hes a dangerous bandit he could see at a glance that theyd taken it in they were good boys and every one of them had matured in two weeks on the plains he went on i need a volunteer to spend another night in the snow with them ataelus immediately waved his hand but kineas continued id prefer one of the citizens they all clamoured to volunteer he was impressed eumenes and clio my thanks to both of you i want you to ride around to every farmer in ten stades tell them who is camping at the bend in the river and why take all your slaves make a show and dont take any crap from the farmers eumenes seemed to grow a hand span yes sir clios father owns this farm and the next i dont expect well have much trouble clio who had matured the most of all the boys saluted no problem at all sir please tell my father im at gades farm kineas pointed his heavy whip at ataelus you stay with them help them translate make sure anything taken is paid for and stay sober if i dont come back in the morning stay sharp ill return as soon as i can he shook hands with all three of them finally he said to eumenes you are in charge eumenes glowed thank you sir thank me when you see me again behind him ajax was forming the rest of the greeks niceas formed as a simple trooper allowing ajax to be the hyperetes just as the younger man had done for the past two weeks the two syracusans antigonus and andronicus had come out with niceas and they formed the next file equally willing to allow ajax to command kineas pulled up beside philokles while ajax checked equipment and inspected youre leaving the two boys as hostages philokles said nothing so brutal kineas said theyll have a fine time and the king and his men wont feel that we abandoned them amidst a horde of terrified sindi farmers the spartan shrugged you are worried about what the archon intends kineas nodded philokles spat in the snow ajax makes a good hyperetes hes had good teachers kineas worried that all of them in armour would frighten the city watch into some action but it was too late and the die was cast ajax are we ready to ride ajax raised his fist to his breastplate at your command sir kineas took the lead spot and waved his whip lets ride he said he prayed to hermes and to apollo as he rode asking that they preserve the peace he worried that the tyrant had done something said something to provoke so much anguish and fear that a city man had fired an arrow at ataelus and he worried what the archon intended for the sakje and for his men he had lots to worry about the sun set red on the city and their jingling column rode down out of the hills of the isthmus peasants slaves and farmers came out to the edge of their fields despite the cold and word spread like lightning so that by the time they approached the suburb beyond the citys fortifications the streets were lined with people bundled in cloaks and blankets kineas feared mischief feared an accident considered assassination cursed his imagination he wasnt sure what he was afraid of but he was afraid he turned to niceas you have the best lungs ride ahead and announce us first to the crowd then at the gate the hipparch and hippeis of the city return from an embassy to the king of the assagatje got it niceas nodded once and kneed his horse into motion kineas turned to ajax at his side let us walk our horses slowly as if in a temple procession but ajax tell your men to watch the crowd and watch the roofs antigonus watch the rear slowly they walked through the suburb in the distance he could hear niceass voice roaring at the gate do you know the paean of apollo he asked the five boys all nodded sing it he said there were only a dozen of them all told but they made a good show and the young voices carried so that before they entered the last narrow muddy street the crowd had taken up the paean there was cheering the main gate was open and kineas offered thanks to zeus two files of memnons mercenaries lined the road inside the gate and his second officer licurgus saluted with his spear kineass fears began to calm he returned the salute niceas fell in by his side memnon wants to speak to you at your earliest convenience in secret kineas kept his eyes on the crowd which was even thicker inside the city walls that cant be good i laid out a few obols to send boys to the homes of your lads so their fathers would know niceas said thanks kineas said the crowd was thick and the street narrow at the best of times the little column had to ride single file and they had to be attentive to avoid trampling children under their hooves it was the largest crowd kineas had seen since the festival of apollo made ominous by the loom of night and the narrow streets kineas scanned the rooftops again there were people on the flatter roofs but they seemed to be watching the spectacle why are we getting this heros welcome he asked niceas grunted and shrugged theres a rumour on the streets that youre going to overthrow the archon he said when kineas whirled on him he shrugged again dont blame the messenger but ive heard it often enough it makes you quite popular athena protect me kineas muttered they tried to watch the crowd and the roofs as they picked their way through the streets they were careful nothing untoward occurred they rode through the gates of the hippodrome to find a smaller assembly gentlemen of the city many mounted and in armour and the rest of kineass men also mounted and armed with cleitus and diodorus at their head diodorus looked as relieved as kineas felt they clasped hands and diodorus waved to his little troop to dismount cleitus smiled ruefully i guess were a bunch of worried hens he said he took off his helmet and gave it to his son leucon fathers were embracing their sons young kyros dismounted to regale a circle of family retainers with his adventures sophokles was embracing his father and the word amazon carried clearly and echoed off the stone seats above them nicomedes was there mounted on a magnificent horse and wearing a breastplate worth more than all of kineass possessions he gave kineas a wry smile kineas could feel that something something was right on the edge of explosion all these men mounted and armed with full night just moments away what in hades is going on here kineas said to diodorus diodorus unbuckled his chinstrap hades is about it kineas the archon didnt get his taxes at least not yet the assembly did some business without the archons approval like what kineas asked he was watching the cavalryman their assembly was probably illegal and such things could have serious repercussions it occurred to him that the muster he had appointed was tomorrow he almost missed diodoruss answer say that again the assembly appointed you hipparch diodorus said cleitus made the motion it didnt go by without argument but it did pass i need to talk to you later kineas said he smiled he was quite happy to be the legally appointed hipparch i need to make this assembly of armed men legal before the archon gets the wrong idea eighty years ago in athens the cavalry class had seized power in the city it had started with a muster of the mounted gentlemen the scars of the aristocratic revolt were still visible in every athenian assembly or the right one said diodorus he knew the history of athens as well as kineas or better his grandfather had been one of the ringleaders kineas glared at him dont even suggest it friend diodorus held his hands up disclaiming responsibility people are talking he said kineas rode to the front of the gathered horsemen since were all together and since i see so many faces from the muster perhaps we could have a quick inspection niceas kineas waved with his whip niceas looked hesitant kineas voice hardened do the thing he said niceas took a deep breath and bellowed his voice rang like a trumpet and the hippodrome fell silent assemble the hippeis he bellowed the boys who had made the trek out to the plains groaned but as one they left their fathers and their friends standing on the sand and went back to their weary horses young kyros had a little trouble mounting nicomedes raised an eyebrow and shook his head but he pulled his helmet on over his carefully oiled locks and fell in where he was told so did the others leucon handed his father the helmet he was holding and brandishing his baton joined niceas in pushing the gentlemen of the city into their ranks at the edge of the muster kineas saw cleomenes eumenes father take his helmet from a big blond slave the gesture was an angry one out on the sand ajax began to help leucon and niceas and as fast as the city slaves lit the torches by the gates the whole troop was assembled and mounted there were almost a hundred of them kineas looked at them and thought too few to have a chance of taking the city but enough to think about it trouble indeed and power he rode to face them and raised his voice i seem to remember appointing tomorrow as the day of exercise but i thank every one of you who turned out this evening for your display of spirit to the men who rode with me on the plains well done every one of you your fathers should be proud men and despite all your pains gentlemen tomorrow is the day of exercise and muster will be in the third hour after the sun rises dismissed they sat still for a moment then someone gave a cheer and it was taken up the moment passed and the assembly began to disperse several fathers stopped to take his hand and a dozen men congratulated him on his appointment it seemed normal enough he saw cleomenes with his gaulic slave and he rode over to tell the man where his son was cleomenes had the heavy beard of the older generation that and the darkness made it difficult to read his expression you were gone longer than we expected he said carefully all my fault i was quite ill thanks to apollo none of the boys was struck by such an arrow and the sakje were very good to us kineas raised his voice so that it would carry to the other fathers he could see petrocolus clios father at the edge of the torchlight to him kineas said you son sends his greetings and says they are at gades farm i took the liberty of placing the sakje king there with his men petrocoluss relief was evident thanks for your words hipparch ill send a slave to make sure the bandits that is the sakje get a good reception cleomenes nodded up at him tersely so you chose to leave my son with the barbarians very nice he unbuckled his breastplate and handed it to his blond slave who stood impassively apparently untroubled by the weight of the armour even in the flickering torchlight kineas could see that the mans face was lined with tattoos your son volunteered kineas said keeping his temper on a tight rein oh of course cleomenes replied diodorus was still by kineass shoulder but kineas rode away from him when he saw that there was a palace slave by the main gate of the hippodrome flanked by two torchbearers kineas recognized him as the archons persian steward cyrus he had intended to try to win cleomenes over but the mans face in the light looked closed and angry kineas shrugged and rode over toward cyrus despite the complaints from his thighs and knees cyrus i greet you kineas said my master wishes to have you attend him cyrus said he did not raise his eyes kineas was tired and it was hard to see in the shifting light of the torches but it appeared to him that all three slaves were afraid kineas dismounted cyrus tell the archon i will be with him directly he must understand i have been on the plains and i rode at dawn this morning i ask his leave to have a bath cyrus glanced up you will come kineas raised an eyebrow of course ill come what foolishness is this cyrus stepped away from the other two slaves there are rumours abroad rumours that you intend to take the city his eyes flickered to the horsemen still milling about at the far end of the hippodrome and rested on the one on the best horse wearing the most expensive cloak or that nicomedes intends it he said meeting kineass eyes you heard me dismiss them with your own ears kineas said what in all the stygian flood is going on here kineas thought but even as he did so a great deal was slipping into place in fact it was just as he had feared it might be the tyrant feared the hippeis the tyrant feared him that was the root of the thing he sighed for the wasted time and his own fatigue ill come immediately lest your master think im busy plotting cyrus gave him a long look the archon prizes loyalty above all things hipparch in your place i would hurry or not come at all he turned quickly leaving the scent of something spicy in the wake of the swirl of his cloak kineas dismounted and handed his horse to diodorus ill be back soon he said dont go diodorus said or go in the morning with some witnesses when the streets are full he looked around as if fearing to be overheard cleomenes voted against you in the assembly and he thinks you left his son with the barbarians as a hostage as retribution i heard that in his voice kineas replied i swear by zeus the father of all the gods the man is a fool kineas stopped and cursed he gave the stallion a slap on the rump that bad worse since the assembly met the archon sees everyone as a plotter even memnon diodorus grabbed kineas by the shoulder im in earnest go in the morning even that perfumed mede said as much if you read his words the way i do diodorus looked around and said nicomedes has a slave leon youve seen him kineas nodded men attacked him he says they were kelts perhaps from the archons bodyguard he escaped nicomedes has been pressing for action ever since hades kineas said im not afraid of the archon and theres too much going on right now for me to wait for morning you dont know my news and i havent time to tell it all macedon is marching and they are coming here antipater wants to control the grain he wants pantecapeum and olbia the king of the sakje is outside the suburbs waiting to negotiate with the archon he wont wait long diodorus let go of kineass shoulder the archon could kill you tonight from pure fear he pulled his helmet off rubbed his hair and sighed what a stew of crap kineas laughed i dont think ill die tonight he felt the weight of his cavalry breastplate on his shoulders i want to go to bed but im better off seeing him tonight let me send one of the men diodorus tucked his helmet under his arm ill come myself kineas shook his head thanks but no i dont want to spook him i think i have his measure now im betting that a quick display of loyalty right now will go a long way if im wrong and some god moves his hand to strike me take the company out the gates to the sakje winter over with them and go south in the spring diodorus shook his head i dont know why he fears you so in his place it would be memnon id watch kineas pulled his cloak around his shoulders hed given the clasp to srayanka and he hadnt replaced it that reminds me send a boy to memnon and tell him ill speak to him in the morning you are set on this course i am kineas took the other mans hand trust the gods diodorus shook his head i dont then ignoring his friends protestations kineas walked off to the palace kineas hurried his confidence in his course of action so high in the hippodrome ebbed in the dark streets outside four streets from the palace he wished he had a pair of torchbearers or even a file of cavalry as escort twice he heard motion on rooftops and a flash of bronze drew his eye in the alley that ran parallel to the main street he quickened his pace hoping to catch sight of cyrus and his torchbearers he decided that his virtue would not be injured by running to catch the persian even the main street was empty there was not so much as a beggar under the eaves speed and his cavalry breastplate saved his life he saw too late the blur of motion at the alley corner by a closed wine shop he planted a foot to turn and something hit him hard right in the side where the bronze was thickest over his belly there were at least two of them one hed seen and the other who hit him he pushed through the attack took another step two and threw himself against the sidewall of another wine shop he had his arms free of his cloak and srayankas whip in his hand he flicked it as the king had taught him straight into the eyes of one of them the man gave a choked scream and fell back but the other man bore straight in like a wrestler determined to knock him off his feet and finish him kineas sidestepped it wasnt his first alley fight he wanted room to shed his cloak and draw his sword he knew he had room to his right but he had to wonder if there were only two of them and then the time for thinking was past and he was fighting for his life the first man landed a blow that rang his back plate like a gong the mans fist caught his cloak seeking to unbalance him or choke him and the whole heavy garment came away no cloak pin kineas flipped the riding whip from his right to left hand catching the whip by the tail and drew his sword he lunged towards the man in front of him holding the sakje whip by the fronds of horsehair rather than by the handle the handle snapped up and took the barbarian in the side of the head and he fell as if his head had been severed his mate leaped forward with a bellow but he had to get around the falling body the two collided kineas stepped back again clear of the collision and flipped the whip in his hand he slashed it across the other mans face the fight was over barring fresh attackers or the will of some god and kineas wanted the second man to run the second man didnt run he was tall and heavily built and his big hand held a heavy club clearly the weapon that had struck kineas in the first seconds of the fight and he swung it it whistled in the air as kineas retreated his booted feet clumsy on refuse bad footing kineas swung the whip at the mans hands once twice three times in a rhythm that put the bigger man on the defensive and drove him back into the centre of the street as he tried to protect his hands kineas let him gain a step he still believed that the man would bolt as soon as he came to his senses the step gave the big man time to recover with both hands on the haft of his club he leaped to the attack swinging the club faster than kineas thought possible kineas scrambled ducked and slashed with both whip and sword but he was parried the lash landed twice but the big man showed no effect his assailant was a skilled fighter not a thug big skilled and brave kineas was driven back by a flurry of blows he could neither parry nor fully avoid without retreat suddenly his back foot was stopped by the stucco of the wine shop and he had no place to move to the right due to the presence of a huge urn by the door the big man paused he hadnt said a word except to grunt when the lash went home both of them were breathing hard kineas began to be afraid not the normal fear of every warrior but the fear that he might be outmatched might die in the old vomit at the door to a wretched wine shop his assailant was very skilled not a common hired killer he feinted movement towards the open ground to his left and at the same time feinted an underhand sword cut at the clubmans hands the big man changed his guard shifted and kineas gave him the whole lash of the whip across his face the man screamed and swung his club and kineas tripped and fell in attempting to avoid the blow and his head hit the shop front hard enough that he smelled blood in his nostrils he pushed himself on his heels rolled to avoid a second blow and got his legs under himself despite the weight of the breastplate and the fog in his mind he staggered the clubman wasnt blind but he was in pain he swung the club the swing was wild and lacked the full power of the mans arms but it almost ended the fight glancing off kineass left shoulder even so the blow numbed his left arm and he dropped the whip kineas moved in despite his bodys urge to run while the other man was hurt he got in close punched with his left hand against the big mans head and cut with his sword at the mans fingers several of which fell in the street the big mans blood steamed as it sprayed ungggh screamed the clubman more in rage than fear his first loud noise with his one good hand he brought his club down on kineass sword it wasnt a heavy blow but it knocked the weapon clear and left kineass hand numb kineas was disarmed his enemy had trouble recovering the club kineas threw himself on the bigger man he got his arms around him and threw him a simple wrestling move that his assailant didnt know and then kineas was atop his foe kneeing him in the groin the man thrashed trying to break his hold and he bit into kineass arm so that kineas had to move his arm he smashed his right fist into the mans face and his flailing left hand found the pliable fronds of his sakje whip without conscious thought he snapped it up and rammed the haft of the whip into his opponents belly kneed him again in the groin grappled him close so that he could smell the garlic and the pork on the mans breath the big man tried to squeeze him but the breastplate stopped him even with the damage kineas had just wreaked at close quarters his assailant managed to break his remaining hold and started to struggle to his feet kineas twisted placed a leg behind the other mans thigh and levered him over the bigger man was unprepared or had never wrestled the whole sequence surprised him again and in three heartbeats he was face down in the icy mud with kineass foot on the back of his neck kineas was too afraid of the clubman to let him up so he reversed the whip again and hit him hard on the head the giant lay still his back rose and fell to show that he was alive kineas lifted his head by the hair and then let it down so the man didnt drown in the mud and so he knew the man was out he couldnt remember fighting hand to hand with an opponent so dangerous ares and aphrodite he breathed his lungs were eager for air any air and his throat felt like a narrow funnel through which molten bronze had to pass he bent to retrieve his sword and felt lightheaded his whole body shook in reaction and he sat down in the mud suddenly his knees too weak to support him but the mud was as cold as the styx and it got him to his feet again quickly he went back to the smaller man counting himself lucky that he had landed so heavy a blow at the very outset two men as well trained as the giant clubman would have had him down in seconds he whispered a prayer of thanks to athena and bent by the body he turned aside to vomit as the reaction hit him again and then he shook again it was all right he was alive the smaller man was oiled like a wrestler good olive oil he was almost naked despite the cold close up he looked like a barbarian close examination showed that he had yellow hair the oil made it lank and dark the big man wasnt oiled but he too had blond hair the smaller man had tattoos on his face kineas wanted them both alive but the streets remained obstinately empty and kineas knew from experience that the sound of a fight late at night would drive any sober slave or decent citizen to shutter their windows his limbs ached and his breastplate weighed more than the atlas mountains he looked at his sword it was badly bent where the club had hit it and the iron was notched he straightened it against the ground and felt the slight give in the weak point the sword would break soon aphrodite and ares he said again then he set his shoulders gathered his cloak from the mud and started for the palace night or day the gloom in the palace was the same and the opulence memnons men were on duty on the porch of the megaron but inside at the door to the archons sanctum were two of the archons giants in their lion skins they relieved him of his sword without a word spoken looking at their blond hair and oiled skin kineas smiled grimly neither of them reacted in any way two more stood flanking the man himself cyrus stood behind the archon a tablet in his hand im surprised you came said the archon he looked kineas up and down you look a little the worse for wear he grinned at his own witticism cyrus told me you suspected me of plotting revolt kineas didnt like the look of the two barbarians any more than he had the first time he had visited the archon im not i hope my presence here demonstrates as much because we have more important matters to discuss he could smell the garbage and more on his sandals and feet his tunic was foul with mud and the backs of his legs were worse i was attacked on my way here the archon held out a gold goblet and a slave hurried to fill it otherwise he didnt react although cyrus behind him gave a start there is no matter more important than the obedience of my men i ordered you out to the plains and i went kineas was tired in pain and suffering the bleakness that the gods send to men after they fight he was impatient with the tyrants games you returned without permission the archon was drunk the words were slurred it didnt shock kineas alexander had ruled the world through a haze of wine but he was never drunk in a crisis what permission kineas demanded you sent me on a mission i accomplished it i have a report to make you also arranged to be appointed hipparch in your own absence it makes me wonder who is ruling this city the archon sat up you were a fool to come here alone kineas flicked a glance at the two big barbarians probably kelts kineas had heard a great deal about the kelts he readied himself macedon is marching and antipater intends to take this city kineas said the archon didnt seem to be listening they could kill you right now kineas took this for an admission not that he needed one their two comrades failed and if these two try and fail ill kill you kineas still had his sakje whip srayankas whip his wrists trembled a little with fear and fatigue all bluff now he didnt think he could muster the virtue for another fight but his threat got through to the archon his head snapped around and for the first time he seemed to give kineas his full attention you think you could best them then more slowly he said their comrades attacked you where kineas shrugged in the street does it matter can we move from these threats to the war that is coming i serve you and this city i have come despite the attack to prove my words are true the archon appeared moved even shocked you were attacked and yet you came he looked at cyrus cyrus gave a small fraction of a nod the archon looked at him carefully i appear to have been mistaken in my estimation of you he said tell me of this war apollo be my witness these last days have been unkind enough more bad news may send me mad macedon is marching here the king of the sakje is waiting to speak to you of alliance and apollo and athena by my witnesses i am not plotting to take this city kineas felt the reaction from the fight just six days ago he had argued against war with macedon something in his head had changed during the fight in the alley or perhaps here in this room that choked him with riches and incense the archon held out his hand and cyrus put another cup of wine in it then he looked up where is this bandit king kineas met the tyrants eyes hard by the city ditch at gades farm the archon put forth his arm in a dramatic gesture of negation and shook his head why why is macedon marching to take my city i already paid a hefty bribe to send them elsewhere he looked up and met kineass eye we cant fight macedon kineas stood unmoving did he agree he had already begun to plan his campaign on the endless grass with tens of thousands of sakje horsemen one of whom had dark blue eyes suddenly he realized that his thoughts had been fully changed as if by one of the gods his pulse raced it was like insanity talk to the king he said carefully do you know that the assembly used to meet at my whim and vote anything i asked the archon looked into his wine cup and then at kineas they loved me kineas i protected them from the bandits on the plains and they grew rich in peace and they loved me now they simmer to revolt for what that fop nicomedes could no more protect them from the bandits than a whore in the agora and you with your talk of macedon and war what can some bandit from the grass tell me of macedon he said perhaps it doesnt matter anyway he sounded drunk and maudlin and tired ive ridden this horse too long i think athenian i can no longer remember how to get their agreement he waved out the doors of the megaron at the city beyond and laughed bitterly antipater can come and depose the assembly perhaps and set up a new tyrant nicomedes perhaps kineas approached the ivory stool words coming unbidden to his head as he saw both of his campaigns form in his thoughts the one to defeat antipater and the other to push this tyrant to make a stand he thought of achilles on the beach his rage at agamemnon and then his acceptance of the council of the goddess so that he spoke in honeyed words because like it or not athens had hired him from exile for this very task theyd lied about it of course but it was clear to him as clear as if athena had just whispered it in his ear that licurgus and his party had sent him to olbia to stop antipater aye honeyed words they came to him as if on a whisper and he used them the threat of macedon should serve to unite your city he said and he saw on the archons face that his arrow had struck home and the king could be a better friend than you think archon peace on the plains and more grain in our ships the archon grunted i doubt that my city will be saved by the bandits he said but he had his chin in his hand and he was looking thoughtful but as soon as it is known that antipater is marching this city will empty not in winter it wont kineas said and by spring with a little effort we can build an alliance and a force to stop macedon on the plains of the sakje plans trembled at the edge of his thoughts ready to tumble out in speech if he let them but he held his tongue the archon shook his head youre drunker than i am he drained his glass nothing can stop macedon no one should know that better than you it is a pretty dream you spin and ill grant you that the threat of macedon would bring the city to heel as if by magic but no no ill send you to antipater overland immediately if you are loyal you can buy me peace you know these people you can get them to listen i doubt it kineas said i hate them he suddenly thought all the slights of being a greek in the army of macedon passed over for promotion dismissed by alexander it was as if every scab had been ripped off every wound ever inflicted on him i hate them i will make you a rich man they made you a citizen you know that and elected you hipparch youve only been here a month of couse i thought you were having a shot at my diadem the archon held out his cup again cyrus hurried to get more wine no other slave appeared my father was a mercenary i know just how the thing is done you wont find me sleeping the archon bellowed the last and sprung to his feet glaring at kineas kineas ignored the tyrants fears no matter what you offer macedon they will march he said with patience he didnt feel antipater needs money and he needs a war to keep the nobles from coming after him he still fears sparta that leaves us we look easy and control of the euxine will strengthen antipaters hold on athens on the whole of greece the archon rubbed his face with both hands like a mimer removing face paint athens aye athens from which you are supposedly an exile athens which probably sent you here to replace me ive always been loyal to athens kineas paused like a man crossing a swamp who suddenly finds the going treacherous i swear by zeus i am not here to replace you the archon ignored him ill offer to become the client of macedon to rule in their name pay taxes the same contribution athens levied more kineas looked at him with disgust archon macedon can have all that if they come and take the city and my sources say that antipater wants a war are you listening to me the archon tossed his wine cup on the floor and the gold rang as it hit the stone im fucked he said no one defeats macedon it sounded craven to kineas even though it was the very same argument he had used to the king coming from the mouth of the archon the drunk and despondent murderous archon it disgusted him in that hour he had become a convert srayanka wanted war with macedon the archon feared it he wondered what god had whispered in his ear seized his tongue he had become an advocate of the war talk to the king he said he knows much bloody brigand said the archon but his tone had changed when tomorrow the king has to ride for the high plains before the snow comes in earnest but he wants an alliance and he has much to offer the archon sat up im drunk he rose i was right about you you are a dangerous man he settled the diadem more exactly on his head what do you want anyway money power restoration to athens he gave kineas a look if the effect was supposed to be menacing his drunken stagger and the skewed diadem on his brow ruined it is this athens doing horse master and then he slumped a little never mind whatever you want youll grab at in time youre that kind right now you dont seem to want my little crown he smiled i still do and i suppose your barbarian bandit is my best chance to keep it ill see him bring him in the morning kineas felt bold you promise his life is safe the archon raised an eyebrow looking like an old satyr eyeing a young maiden in the theatre you think i threaten his life he passed kineas on his way to his own chamber or yours his voice trailed back into the throne room you have a lot to learn about my city athenian there were bruises on his ribs in the morning and a long red welt on his left leg where skin had been ripped away and the joints in his fingers were swollen and prickly he couldnt remember how some of the injuries had happened sitalkes tended them with oil and herbs and got him dressed and armoured while philokles and diodorus argued were not leaving he said get it through your heads hes a tyrant tyrants fear every mans hand i lived lets move on hell kill you hell kill us diodorus stood with his hands on his hips macedon is coming and we cant trust our employer get us out philokles shook his head hell trust kineas now diodorus raised his hands in frustration as if invoking the gods he doesnt trust anyone hes a tyrant and it doesnt matter because we cant trust him get us out kineas got to his feet slowly and took the weight of his armour on his shoulders the shoulder straps were resting on last nights bruises the king of the assagatje is waiting at gades farm two hundred gentlemen of the city will be mustering in an hour a hint of any of this will be like sparks on tinder let me be clear we are staying we are going to prepare this city to fight if you cant stomach it you have my leave to depart diodorus let his hands fall by his sides you know i wont leave you he said he sounded as tired as kineas felt he took a deep breath and said kineas can you tell me why why you are hazarding our lives to fight macedon philokles stood very still quietly he said that is the question isnt it a few days ago you told the king that we should not fight what changed your mind kineas picked his sakje whip off the oak table and rubbed his thumb across the gold decoration last night while i argued with the archon it came to me as if a god had spoken in my ear friends i cannot explain better than that in one moment my mind was set it is not so much a matter for rational argument as a a revelation he tucked the whip into the sash he wore over his breastplate my mind is clear i intend to do this thing diodorus sighed the men will not be happy kineas nodded any who wish to leave will be allowed to go diodorus shook his head none of them will leave but they will not be happy kineas nodded again that is in the hands of the gods for now we have a great deal of work to do philokles you will take sitalkes and ride to the king telling him we will attend him with all of the gentlemen of the city in the second hour after noon diodorus the rest of us shall spend the morning throwing javelins and practising the cavalry at riding in formation after noon we will ride in a column out to the king and fetch him to the archon in style philokles said someone had best warn the archon and dont forget that you were to speak with memnon send crax to the palace and ask cyrus the steward if the archon will be available at the second hour after noon send a slave to memnon to ask him if he can attend me here explain the need diodorus saluted yes hipparch he smiled kineas smiled back despite everything i like the sound of that the muster started well there were more men missing making their last trading trips of the year or home sick or making excuses on the other hand there were far more men mounted and armed niceas ajax and leucon had them in their ranks in a few minutes the rolls were called and the absent noted kineas rode to the head of the troop there were almost two hundred men mounted they filled the east side of the hippodrome in four sloppy ranks horses moved back and forth or shifted and in the second rank a stallion nipped a mare welcome gentlemen of olbia kineas called across the turmoil he sat straight trying to ignore the fatigue of the last days ride the scars of the fight by the wine shop i thank you for the honour you have done me in granting me this office and further in making me a citizen of this city i will not waste further words when none can express my feelings he looked back and forth under his helmet this morning we will have our first drill every man will present himself his horse and his armour to my hyperetes niceas who will advise you on how to better them as soon as a man passes niceas he will join diodorus in practising the throwing of javelins and from there pass to ajax who will instruct on remounting in combat at noon we will take some bread and oil while we hold our mounts like cavalrymen should then we will practise various formations this afternoon the full troop of the city will do its first duty in many years we will ride to escort the king of the sakje a buzz of talk from the ranks silence please gentlemen during the whole of a muster you are no longer free to chatter do the citizens who serve on foot chatter in the phalanx no they listen for orders so you must any questions a plaintive voice from the fourth ranks called i have an appointment to buy linen seed in the afternoon kineas smiled under the cold cheek pieces of his helmet you will miss it i didnt bring food said another when i dismiss you you may send your slaves for food next time you will know better a muster is for the whole day are we all to have blue cloaks asked another niceas will inform you anything else he looked at them they sat on their horses in silence as a group they were better disciplined than their athenian counterparts but they looked like what they were rich men playing soldier kineas sighed hippeis he called he glanced around niceas ajax and leucon were all together by the stadium seats with horses hard by and equipment laid out on blankets as examples diodorus and the two gauls had paced out a run for javelin practice and antigonus was propping a heavy shield against a pair of spears as a target as ready as they were likely to be dismissed to your posts he said the whole mass surged into motion a quarter of them rode straight to him with complaints demands and suggestions hed expected as much they werent soldiers they were rich men and greeks kineas knew how to make short work of them lykeles helped him another veteran of the athenian hippeis musters lykeles rode among them hearing their complaints and dealing with the easiest himself kineas was patient but firm with the rest half an hour sufficed to see every one of them off to one of the stations against the tiered seats niceas could be heard urging the purchase of cornellwood javelins he had done his research and already knew which merchants in the town could get the wood from persia and which smiths made the best heads he and leucon ably supported by coenus reviewed the quality and training of the mens horses coenus walked across the sand to kineas and waited to speak when kineas glanced at him he said we have a horse problem kineas grunted and pushed his helmet back on his head mares and stallions coenus nodded horses are cheap here we should have a standard sex otherwise when the mares come into season well have chaos kineas tugged at his beard what would xenophon say coenus smiled geldings kineas felt as if he had to sleep or die he leaned down geldings it is then exempt the hyperetes and the officers having said so he rode off to watch the first group of riders tackle the javelin throwing they were all the young men who had ridden to the sakje and they made a creditable showing watching them gave him an idea that he should form troops of fifty within the hippeis all of the best men would just make one company of fifty kyros galloped down the sand his bay horse stretching to the task hooves flashing his throw was hard and true and the shield fell with a crack like thunder that boy throws like the hand of zeus philokles said at kineass shoulder the king sends his regards he will be waiting for you at the second hour the boys were competent but the rest of them were not nicomedes set the standard by falling during his first remount and missing the shield every time he rode by it he affected an air of humorous disdain but he hid his irritation poorly kineas guessed he was unused to failing at anything like every other gentleman on the sand ajax rode up alongside the citys fashion leader and twirled a javelin in his fist he shouted kineas couldnt hear the words but it was a tease and rode at the target scattering slaves who had intended to help their master nicomedes cursed pulled himself up with a fist in his horses mane and followed and ajax threw true nicomedes throw was wide by a hands breadth his curses flowed across the arena the old men ride like sacks of goat shit and the middleaged men are so afraid to get themselves dirty they remind me of fucking priestesses said niceas and thats before we try riding in formations kineas tried not to smile the boys arent bad i want to put all the best men in one company of fifty make me a list let it be known so that men will struggle to be in that company think of that yourself did you niceas said with a hard smile the six athenian companies of horse were rivals in every kind of procession and game he pointed with his chin at eumenes father cleomenes who sat quietly with a group of his friends they were not participating not quite mutiny he said but hes half the problem ill see to it kineas answered turning his horse an older man threw a leg over his horse and fell straight off the far side you intend to fight macedon with this lot niceas asked you too me first im told that the gods themselves have told you to fight macedon did they send you that whip too niceas pointed at the heavy whip in kineass sash a troop of companions would scatter these like dandruff at the first charge leave em for the peltasts to clean up half of them will fall off and stay down until their throats are slit tell me if i lie kineas wheeled his horse sounds like you have a lot of work to do then niceass ferret face wrinkled in a rueful smile thats what i knew youd say kineas rode over to where cleomenes and his twenty friends and allies sat which station would you prefer to go to first sir he asked cleomenes ignored him one of his friends laughed were gentlemen not soldiers dont include us in this farce kineas looked at the man who had spoken you lack a breastplate your horse is too small please report to my hyperetes the man shrugged and if i say no he said kineas didnt raise his voice i might fine you he said i might report you to the archon the man grinned as if that was not a threat he feared i might beat you to a bloody pulp right here on the sand kineas added any of the three are within my legal right as hipparch the man flinched kineas turned to cleomenes i am a gentleman of athens he said i hold no grudge that you voted against me as a citizen and again as hipparch that is how democracy functions but if you fail to do your duty we will very soon come to a test that cannot benefit anyone cleomenes never met his eye he was looking at someone else probably nicomedes his principal rival in the city very well he said tersely i feel a sudden need to throw a javelin it was a curiously empty victory cleomenes walked over to the butts mounted his horse and threw competently and then sat down again kineas tried a different tack he waved at coenus to join him and indicated cleomenes there sits one of the citys principal gentlemen he dislikes me hes behaving like an arrogant fool and i cant figure him out befriend him coenus chuckled as one arrogant fool to another you mean something like that kineas agreed the close order drill was terrible the first attempt to form the rhomboid formation that kineas preferred was hampered by the size of the hippodrome and the numbers involved but it would have been horrible nonetheless it took them half an hour to get every man to see his place in the formation and they couldnt ride ten strides without becoming a mob kineas sighed and gave it up instead he formed them in a column of fours and rode them in circles until most of them learned to keep their intervals a full hour he was hoarse from shouting all the professionals were hoarse and so were some of the boys who had ridden the plains he shook his head and rode over to cleitus im losing my voice would you order them to disperse and take their lunch with pleasure cleitus said and when he had fetched his own bread he returned and said i knew you were the right man for the job look at them kineas took some sausage from sitalkes why they look like dog shit cleitus frowned no they dont they look like they are trying if they stop trying we lose so far were winning get them through three of these and theyll feel the difference could set quite a fashion can i have some of that sausage the garlic is making my stomach rumble kineas handed over a chunk of sausage cleitus cut off a piece with a knife and tossed it to his son who was eating with ajax and kyros they were sitting on their horses to eat like sakje in fact all the young men who had gone with kineas were sitting mounted to eat cleitus offered a skin of wine to kineas rotten stuff perfect for soldiers so were fighting macedon news travels around here kineas took a pull at the wineskin they were going to be late fetching the king is it different in athens the way i heard it you killed a squad of murderous persian assassins or perhaps they were kelts and then thrashed the archon with your big whip and told him to behave and then your eyes rolled back in your head and you prophesied that we would defeat antipater cleituss light tone didnt cover the anxiety on his face kineas handed back the wineskin thats pretty much how it was he said my first rhetoric tutor told me that my facetious ways would get me in trouble and look he was right kineas i proposed you for citizenship my friends made you hipparch dont get us all killed cleitus grimaced and took more sausage kineas pulled off his helmet and scratched his head vigorously then he met cleituss eyes i dont have a place to invite gentlemen to dinner will you host for me ill explain to your guests why i think we have to fight and what they stand to lose if we dont cleitus grunted i was hoping youd just say the rumour was wrong he said macedon is coming here kineas said the king was waiting he and his men sat like goldarmoured centaurs the column of city cavalry rode up and halted more like a mob than kineas liked and petrocolus and cleomenes rushing to embrace their sons ruined any pretence to military discipline the sakje didnt seem to mind the king pushed through the throng of greek horsemen to reach kineas youre late he said smiling i offer profound apology o king the archon awaits us kineas motioned with his whip at niceas who raised his voice and the city troop began to reform satrax shook his head im teasing you what is time to us but it seems to mean so much to you greeks the second hour after noon the young king laughed try getting the sakje to assemble within a single moon yet you would fight macedon kineas said oh its easier to assemble them for war satrax said he narrowed his eyes youve changed your mind i can see it on your face i have too kineas said he shrugged the gods spoke to me the king shrugged kam baqca assured me that this would happen i am not surprised she is right she is nearly always right kineas watched both hyperetes pushing the column into some form of order he had a few minutes i have spoken to the archon satrax nodded i think he will support the war kineas said at least for now this too is as kam baqca said it would be the king smiled showing his even teeth and the full lips that hid under his moustache and beard so i will lead my clans to war against macedon he didnt sound excited more resigned kineas nodded the days muster had taken the eagerness out of him he was going to lead these enthusiastic amateurs against the veterans of fifty years of war gods send us victory he said the gods send victories to those who earn them said the king kineas attended the meeting between the archon and the king on the porch of the temple of apollo but he didnt speak the archon was a different man direct sober blunt a commander of men he changed faster than an actor who took multiple roles in the theatre kineas had seen it done in oedipus the king was also the messenger in olbia the drunken tyrant could also be the philosopher king cyrus stood at his right hand and wrote the terms of the treaty the king and the archon drafted it in an hour and clasped hands each swearing by apollo and by their own gods to support the other in war should macedon march in the spring they did not pledge eternal friendship the king did not agree that olbians were free to travel the plains without hindrance but he did agree to forbear taxing them for as long as the treaty was in effect after they clasped hands the archon mounted a horse and escorted the king to the walls of the city and the two men chatted as they rode kineas directly behind the archon heard more silence than chatter in the arch of the gate the archon drew rein we will need to meet in the spring to discuss strategy he said the king looked out over the citys fields and nodded i will need time and space to muster my people the archon was an excellent rider kineas hadnt had an opportunity to note it before he surprised kineas by backing his horse a few steps and catching kineass bridle my hipparch pressed me to make this war o king so ill send him to you in the spring satrax nodded i will look forward to that he said the archon nodded i thought you might well know for sure about what antipater plans when the athenian grain fleet comes in the spring the kings horse was restive he calmed it with a hand on its neck and some words in sakje and then he reached for kineass hand in the spring when the ground sets hard and the grass is green i will send you an escort the streets were crowded and the gate was almost surrounded by the people of the town and the suburb the king waved in farewell and then he made his horse rear and leap so that it almost seemed that the two would gallop across the sky instead of merely riding along the road at his side the archon said you enjoyed your time among these barbarians and kineas who could dissemble when need required said i befriended one of their war leaders i had this whip as a guest gift the archon nodded slowly your friendship with these bandits may be more of a boon than i thought athenian they like you he nodded again their king is not a simple man he has education he gave a nasty grin he is young and arrogant he was a hostage in pantecapaeum kineas said why did i never meet him the archon asked he shrugged or perhaps i did they breed like maggots and their women are so unchaste hard to know which little bastard is the get of which sire still theyll make good fodder if we must fight this war kineas stiffened but said nothing which i will now work like a slave to prevent the archon turned his horse back to the palace cleitus gave a dinner in his honour on the night when athens honoured her dead and her heroes and he drank too deep of too much wine he drank too much wine because he was called to speak in public at cleituss urging and with help from diodorus and philokles he prepared an oration and after dinner when urged by cleitus and all the guests he rose from his couch and went to the centre of the room like the politicians who had attended his fathers dinners in athens he had never thought to use such tactics himself and his hands shook so that he had to thrust them into his tunic gentlemen of olbia he began formally but that wasnt the tone he wanted at all especially with the quaver in his voice and he smiled shrugged rubbed his beard friends and sponsors better it has been said indeed its being said right now somewhere not far from here that having been sponsored as a citizen and then raised to hipparch i have repaid your kindness by plunging you into desperate war they looked interested but no more the younger men eumenes for instance had no idea what a war would mean they were excited by it the older men had the means to board their ships and vanish around the coast to heraclea or tomis or even to athens kineas took a deep breath the war is none of our making alexander the boy king who i served is now a man more than a man he has declared himself a god he marches to conquer not just the medes but the whole world kineas spread his arms like an actor funny how these things came back to you kineas hadnt practised rhetoric in ten years at least but he continued one of the ways we can tell that alexander is not so much of a god as he would like to be is that his wars still require men and money the gods i think could conquer the world with their own power alexander does it with the treasury of persopolis and the manpower of the whole greek world and this hunger for treasure to fight his wars has cost macedon dearly none of the gold of persopolis went home none of the spoil of babylon waits in chests of cedar in phillips treasury olympia does not bathe in the pearls of the nile alexander burns gold as other men burn wood he took watered wine from a servant and sipped antipater needs money he needs to put his boot on the necks of the cities of attica and the peloponnese he needs our grain and our gold and he needs a war to toughen his levies before he sends them to his master the god he paused a moment to let that sink in then he began to pace around the circle of couches speaking directly to them first one and then another this will not be a simple war between cities where hoplites clash and the winner dictates the terms to the loser or burns his fields if antipater takes this city he will keep it he will appoint a satrap to rule one of his own men from macedon kineas said the last directly to nicomedes it was done as if by chance and nicomedes smooth face didnt betray whether the shot went home or not there will be a garrison of macedonians and heavy taxes no assembly and no men of property you might ask me how i know all this and i will say that i know because i watched it done from granicus to the nile you think the archon is a tyrant kineas looked around at the little starts that had them awake the archon is the purest democrat next to a garrison of macedon you think that antipater might benefit the city or perhaps that you can slip away and return in a few years when the business opportunities are better kineas stopped again and pointed at lykeles lykeles was a gentleman of thebes ask him what the occupation of macedon meant they were restless fidgeting on their couches the older ones refusing to meet his eye like most rich men they heard him but they doubted that his words would apply theyd find a way to bribe their way free they were sure but again his argument hit home every man present knew that thebes had been utterly destroyed the walls cast down most of the citizens sold into slavery for attacking their macedonian garrison and that was thebes a pillar of the greek world the city of oedipus and epaminondas kineas sipped more wine i will not tell you that we can defeat the might of macedon if alexander came here with seven taxeis of his veterans and four regiments of companions with all this thessalian horse and all his psiloi and his peltasts and the guard then i would say that despite our alliances and our own strength we would be broken in an hour but it is not alexander who marches it will probably not even be antipater no mean general let me tell you it will be one of the junior generals who stayed home from the persian wars and are now eager for fame eager to make a name on a march to the sea that general will have two taxeis of macedonians and one of those will be raw he will have one regiment of companions every troublemaker that antipater wants out of the country he will have thracians getae and bastarnae and that army gentlemen we can defeat or even if we fail to defeat it we can keep it on the plains so long that it will have no time to lay siege to this city they lay quietly on their couches listening and drinking wine he made it clear that he was finished by sitting on his couch he felt empty he felt like a schoolboy who had given a speech and forgotten some part of it he shrugged oh the birching that gesture would have gotten him from his rhetoric tutor that is the way i see it he said and felt the poverty of his summation cleomenes rose in turn he lay by himself he had brought his son but eumenes had gone off to share the couch of kyros most of the other men present either ignored him or fawned on him unlike nicomedes and cleitus who were bitter rivals in trade and politics but appeared to enjoy each others company cleomenes was aloof as if he didnt want to be caught associating with his rivals the hipparch speaks well for a mercenary he looked around the room with patrician disdain just as well might i visit another mans city and tell him how he can with enormous risk win through to a little gain but despite the fact that you cleitus and you nicomedes conspired to give this man the vote i say he is a foreigner a man with little stake in our city surely not the same stake as i have why would a man of my accomplishments wish to provoke a war with macedon our mercenary thinks so highly of his profession that he desires for us all to take part in it i say that it is the business of his sort to make war i have neither skill nor appetite for it men of property have no need to do such things when i need them done i can hire a mercenary he looked around you are a pack of fools if you think that your little squadron of horse will last a minute against the force of macedon men like you have no business fighting your business is business achilles was a fool and odysseus not much better grow up accept the coming changes let this city grow and prosper as it is meant to regardless of who claims to rule it and leave fighting to mercenaries he gave kineas half a smile although when i hire one ill try to find one with less arrogance less pretension and superior skill at fighting not a winesack blowhard who was dismissed by alexander he sat down and the room erupted men were watching kineas he was acutely aware of how deeply cleomenes speech had cut him both in his own pride and in the eyes of some of his most prominent supporters but despite the instant rise of rage in his heart and the double grip of fear and anger in his gut kineas was a veteran of many years of athenian politics in his fathers house and in the hippeis he refilled his cup spilled a libation with a prayer to athena and rose again outwardly calm inwardly both enraged and hurt even saddened his stomach seemed to rise to fill his throat in some ways it was worse than a fight in a fight the daemon came to hold you up to stiffen your sinews but in debate a man who was a friend or at least sometimes an ally suddenly turned on you and spoke insults face to face like battle kineas took a breath to steady himself im sure cleomenes speaks with the best of intentions he said his mild sarcasm so at odds with what the room expected from him silenced the babble cleomenes am i the winesack blowhard to whom you refer cleomenes glared at him like medusa but kineas pinned him with his own gaze come were all friends here you must have had someone in mind kineass raillery was still light cleomenes wasnt fooled he wriggled on his couch like a bug on a pin kineas raised an eyebrow so you dont mean me he took a step forward and cleomenes wriggled again perhaps you mean memnon or perhaps licurgus perhaps my friend diodorus or perhaps young ajax isokles son of tomis is that who you mean kineas took another step towards the man he had the feeling that cleomenes would make a bad enemy but that enmity was already there he was not going to win the man to his side so he had to be defeated except none of them served alexander only i he stepped closer or were you speaking generally of winesacks and blowhards youve known in your wide experience of the world cleomenes stood up you know who i meant he said his face red kineas shrugged im a poor mercenary slow of intellect tell me cleomenes spat figure it out kineas spread his hands i am a simple soldier i admire those men to whom you referred achilles and odysseus they may not have been good men of business but they were not afraid to speak their minds cleomenes rolled off his couch his face purple damn you you insolent cleitus rushed to intervene both men had their hands balled into fists gentlemen i think we have left reasoned debate and good feeling at the bottom of the last wine bowl this is mere argument there is bad feeling cleomenes did not mean the insult he implied im sure and neither would kineas mean to call cleomenes a coward would you kineas kineas nodded and let his next words drawl out with all the athenian arrogance he could muster which was considerable i didnt say that cleomenes was a coward he said with a mocking smile indeed i spoke generally about the longhaired argives who fought for helen on the windy plains of illios several guests applauded kineass rhetorical tricks had the elegance of an athenian gentlemans education cleomenes looked rude by comparison and hed lost his temper entirely without another word he picked up a scroll bag he had brought and walked to the door you will all rue the day you brought this man into our city he said and left despite the lazy smile pasted to his face kineas felt weak at the knees as if he had fought a combat he felt as if he needed more wine when he reached the couch he shared with philokles the spartan smiled at him other men asked a few questions but most chose to change the subject he drank a great deal cleomenes insults still rankling and went to bed drunk the tree was bigger than the world and its trunk was like a city wall rising from a rocky plain the lowest branches hung to the ground it was a cedar no it was a black pine from the mountains of attica closer it seemed that it was not one tree but all trees and the fallen leaves and needles littered the ground so that every step he took he sank to his ankles and when he looked down to watch his footing he saw that the leaves were mixed with bones and under the leaves and bones were corpses strange that the bones lay over the corpses he thought with the clarity of dream thought he felt strangely in control of his dream and he made his body turn and look away from the tree but there was nothing to see except the branches hanging to the ground and the near dark beyond the tree and the leaves and bones and all the dead he turned back and set his hand against the trunk and it was warm and smooth like the back of srayankas hands and he awoke troubled because of the dreams clarity and because it was alien while he dreamed the tree he was another man a man who didnt think like a hellene and that was terrifying he covered his terror in work training the hippeis which he did despite the first serious winter storm the sailing season closed the threat of antipater became known throughout the city no one could flee so rich and poor alike settled in for months of cold telling each other that there would be time to flee in the spring if antipater really did come in the next week memnon called a muster of the citys hoplites it was the first muster held in four years the archon had restricted such musters because he feared the power of the hoplites all together and under arms as much as he feared everything else but memnon insisted and he had his way the city hoplites looked better than the cavalry they wore more armour than their compatriots in athens or sparta the thirty years war in attica and the peloponnese had taught greeks to wear less armour and move faster but the hoplite class of the euxine had missed those bloody wars and they came to muster in the bronze cuirass greaves and heavy helmets of their fathers they mustered in the open fields north of the suburbs and trampled the snow and the grain stubble for three hours despite the fouryear hiatus and the presence of a new generation who had never been trained they looked competent they had three hundred mercenaries to provide fileclosers and they had seasoned men in their ranks who had served in the war with heraclea kineas watched them drill with cleitus and half a dozen city gentlemen he was unstinting in his praise whether to his own men or to memnon and the city officers when they approached at the end of the drill memnon stopped and leaned on his spear he had been charging about the field black cloak flapping behind him correcting faults and praising virtue and now he panted like a dog ive got to get them out of all that armour he said he pointed to a group of young men at drill they keep all the old traditions here the youngest best fighters make a select company to cover the flank ill try to keep them from wearing it kineas watched the older men standing in glittering ranks depends on what we think theyre for he said nicomedes stopped flirting with ajax and pushed his horse forward surely we all know what hoplites are for he said i used to serve as one myself you may recall before the hipparch forced me to serve on horseback kineas smiled i gave you the excuse to buy that beautiful blue cloak and that exciting breastplate he said then he turned back to memnon for dash or to chase down thracians our lightarmed hoplites are the thing but here on the plain here kineas raised his head to gaze across the snow he didnt even know exactly where she was but she was somewhere out in the endless white he caught himself here it is cavalry country armour makes a man braver and steadies him and keeps him safe from the javelins and bows memnon rubbed his jaw which was as black as his cloak by zeus hipparch let us never have to face the bandits out in open country i stood against the boy king at issus when his horse came against us if theyd had bows none of us would have escaped armour might stop the first push of a macedonian taxeis kineas said memnon curled his lip keep my flanks secure and ill stop them dead these lads may hate the archon like fire hates water many of them hate me i dare say and theyll hate me worse before spring but theyre good lads and every man and boy has done his years in the gymnasium and in the field real hoplites not so many of those left in greece most left their bones at chaeronea i hear you boned cleomenes up the arse nicomedes snorted aloud cleitus looked away embarrassed memnon winked cleomenes is one of the many men in this city who think they would make a good archon he glared at nicomedes but hes more of a boil on the arse than his rivals and no mistake memnon nodded to kineas if you survive the winter youll know em like i do howd you arrange for the assembly to make you a citizen and hipparch kineas shook his head cleitus did it i was as surprised as any the endless advantages of birth memnon spat his face was unreadable behind the shape of his helmet antipater is really marching here in the spring kineas nodded yes it is true this isnt some trick of the archons to keep us all biddable for another season this is real and you will fight him most of the hoplites were watching them yes kineas said why you were one of the boy kings men memnon took kineas by the hand his hand was hard as iron and it held kineass tight as if to read him for truth i think a god told me to fight or a woman perhaps the gods spoke through her or athena or all together kineas knew he had to fight macedon as clearly as he had ever known anything in his life such revelations were divine memnon relinquished his hand i do not honour the gods as much as i should he said but i would like to fight macedon again he turned on his heel and walked away across the last blades of autumn grass where it waved above the snow part iii the taste of bronze but come he shall taste the bronze at the point of our spears iliad book the sun shone on the first blades of spring grass that waved in the north wind so that they rocked back and forth like a thousand beckoning fingers kineas pulled on his reins and looked back over the column toiling up the ridge that lined the riverbank following it with his eye down the steep road past the last files of the column and past the two baggage carts and the donkeys to fields by the city walls where the whole force of the citys hoplites could be seen marching memnons black cloak was a speck in the front rank beyond the fields and the mass of men stood the city on the river the spring sun was warm and the clear yellow light gilded the marble of the temple of apollo and lit the gold dolphins at the edge of the port with fire from here the archons citadel stood clear of the walls like an island in a pond at the boundary ditch kineas halted the column and waved to niceas who raised a trumpet to his lips the shrill notes rang clear in the wind and the long column bunched heaved and then formed itself into a compact rhomboid with kineas at the tip kineas didnt hide his grin of satisfaction kineas trotted the formation across fields that belonged to nicomedes and then ordered an abrupt change of direction and the formation obliged the turn was sloppy but the rhomboid reformed quickly because despite confusion every man knew his place kineas raised his hand and niceas blew the halt kineas gave his warhorse a hard pressure with his knees and heels and the big animal surged out of the formation under gentler pressure the horse turned in a long curve as he accelerated to the gallop so that kineas was riding out to the left of his rhomboid and around it looking for confusion for error for fatal weakness he rode all the way around and then halted facing them sound form line by troop he called many men were moving before niceas could raise the heavy trumpet to his lips it was a bad habit something that needed to be worked on but the performance of the manoeuvre was adequate the four troops each separated by an interval the width of four riders formed along the edge of the road running north again kineas didnt disguise his pleasure he rode to diodorus sitting at the head of his troop and clasped his hand well done he said loudly diodorus wasnt much given to broad grins but he looked as if his lips might split while the hoplites marched solidly up the ridge and began to deploy from column into their deep phalanx along the road kineas rode along the ranks of the hippeis as if inspecting but his ride was more a long string of congratulations troop commanders hyperetes individual troopers who had either shown great improvement or had natural skill the third troop had most of niceass new recruits from heraclea and kineas saluted them as he went by only six men but their combined experience had already shown its effect then he rode back to the centre of the line and knelt on his stallions back a boys trick but useful when you needed to address troops the hoplites took the heavy shields off their shoulders and set the rims on the ground planted the spikes of their spears and leaned on them for comfort gentlemen of olbia he called horses moved and made sounds and a few pulled at their reins to be allowed to crop grass but the men of the city were silent and still the wind blew warm from the south drying the ground and the sun sparkled on bronze and silver and gilt along the ranks the quiet grew it wrapped itself around them a palpable thing as if they sat in the midst of a bubble of eternity it was one of those moments men recall by their firesides in old age the whole scene seemed to be set in crystal suddenly nothing in kineass prepared rhetoric was sufficient to the day they were magnificent the hoplites and the hippeis together he said a prayer to athena in his heart and raised his hand pointing at olbia there is your city here beside you are your fellow citizens hoplites and hippeis together here are your comrades look at them look to the left to the right these are your brothers the words came to him from the air and his voice carried in the unnatural calm war is coming he said he looked across the plain to the west as if zopryons army would appear on cue the fate of the city is in the hands of the gods but it is also in your hands in the hands of every man here he looked up and down the ranks and found that he didnt have control of his voice his throat was sore and his eyes burned and the image before him wavered and flowed so that great gaps appeared in the lines of men where they blurred to his tearfilled eyes he sat quietly waiting for the moment to pass zopryon believes that he will have a quick campaign an easy conquest i believe that with the help of the gods we will stop him on the plain of grass and send him back to macedon that is why you have given your winter to training that is why you are standing here rather than tilling your fields the silence was still there and the stillness it was daunting the wind from the plain of grass ruffled his horses mane and he could hear the hairs move against each other i have served macedon he said at last in macedon they say that greece is done that we love beauty more than war that we are soft that our only place is in their empire he raised his voice but i say what is more beautiful than this to serve with your comrades to stand beside them when the shields ring and quoting the poet he said my friends argives one and all good bad and indifferent for there was never a fight yet in which all were of equal prowess there is now work enough as you very well know for all of you see that you none of you turn in flight daunted by the shouting of the foe but press forward and keep one another in heart if it may so be that olympian zeus the lord of lightning will grant us to repel our foes and drive them away from our city the sound of the familiar words ajaxs famous speech that schoolboys learned by heart drew a response and they cheered first the hoplites and then all of them so that the hoplites banged their shields with their spears and the horsemens swords rang against their breastplates an ominous sound the cheer of ares kineas wasnt used to being cheered he felt the daimon that infected him in combat so that his chest was full and he felt more alive and he wondered if this was the feeling alexander had every day then he turned his head embarrassed and called to niceas who trotted out of the ranks to him sound all captains niceas blew the trumpet the troop commanders and their hyperetes trotted out of the cheering ranks and halted in a neat line gentlemen kineas began he pulled his helmet off and wiped his eyes several of the officers did the same nicomedes looked around him dryeyed and said no wonder they call greeks emotional memnon walked up in his big black cloak good speech fucking good speech lets go kill something kineas cleared his throat while the other men chuckled im off for the sea of grass memnon has the command while im away diodorus has the command of the hippeis he looked them over listen to me gentlemen the archon is now a desperate man he fears this war just about as much as he fears you i ask you to be careful in what you say or do in the assembly i ask you not to provoke him in my absence indeed i ask you not to provoke him until weve seen the back of zopryon memnon spat cleitus nodded nicomedes made a face he shrugged and said but thats my hobby kineas met his gaze and stared him down make the command of your troop your hobby he collected their eyes and went on dont fool yourselves that because we have a competent troop of horse and some good hoplites we have an army zopryon has an army we have a tithe of his strength only if the sakje agree to our plan will we have the power to face zopryon even with the sakje even if the king sends all his strength we will be hard pressed to save our city ajax coloured but his voice carried conviction i felt a god at my shoulder while you spoke he said kineas shrugged i cannot speak of gods though i revere them but i can say that i have known a handful of good men to shatter an army of multitudes your men look good make them better dont let them forget what is coming neither make them fear it so that they take a ship and sail away that is what i had planned to say this morning but other words were set in my throat he didnt say that the small army had been macedonian and the multitudes had been the medes kineas turned to diodorus ill take the first troop as we discussed will you continue without us i have a long day planned diodorus said with a wicked smile im sure that most of them will wish they were crossing the sea of grass with you by the time the sun is setting travel well they told each other to go with the gods and they clasped hands and then kineas and all of the first troop changed from their warhorses to their lighter mounts formed a column and rode off on the track north to the waiting grass kineas had all the younger men with leucon in command and a sober eumenes as his hyperetes cleomenes had taken ship and deserted leaving his son an empty house and a ruined reputation eumenes bore it in fact he seemed happier or freer kineas told them that they would live rough and he meant it they had just ten slaves for fifty men kineas had arranged that all the slaves were mounted like the first trip to find the sakje he kept them busy from the moment they left diodorus sending parties of scouts out into the grass making mock attacks on empty sheep folds skirmishing against a bank of earth that rose from the plain the soil visible as a black line until the dirt was full of javelins and eumenes made the required joke about sewing dragons teeth and reaping spears kineas was eager to go forward to the great bend eager to meet srayanka and yet hesitant as all his doubts of the winter flooded him would the city hold behind him would the archon stay steady would the citizens desert had his anticipations of meeting the lady srayanka exceeded the reality fifty young men with a hundred times as many questions did a great deal to distract him as did memnon whose questions rivalled the whole multitude of the rest by the end of the first day kineas felt like a boxer who had spent a whole day parrying blows you ask too many questions kineas growled at the spartan you know you are not the first man to say as much philokles said with a laugh but im doing you a service and you should thank me bah service kineas watched his scouts moving a few stades in advance of the column a passable skirmish line if it werent for me youd do nothing but moon for your amazon philokles laughed not bad i hadnt even intended the pun kineas was watching the scouts beyond them there was a flash of red ataeluss cap he summoned leucon and ordered him to pull the column together the boys had a natural tendency to straggle then he turned back to philokles did you say something the big man shook his head only the best joke ive made in never mind kineas reined in and looked out under his hand it was ataelus for sure tell me again philokles pursed his lips and shook his head you know some things have to be taken on the bound or not at all kineas narrowed his eyes what are you talking about hunting philokles raised his hands as if demanding the intercession of the gods and then turned his horse and went back to the column they camped in the open where a small brook had cut a deep gully across the plain the miniature valley was full of small trees and bigger game and eumenes led three of his friends in cutting down a big doe like gentlemen they made sure she was barren before they killed her killing a gravid doe in spring would be a bad omen or worse an offence the doe didnt feed seventy men but the fresh meat served to season their rations the evening had more the air of a festival than a training camp too many fucking slaves and the boys are already up too late niceas said his recruiting trip to heraklea hadnt mellowed him i have known you to stay up too late and drink too much the first night of a campaign kineas passed a cup of wine to his hyperetes im a veteran said the older man he reached up and pinched the muscles where his neck met his shoulders an old veteran hades the straps on my breastplate cut like knives he was watching eumenes who was regaling the younger men with the tale of their winter ride together i doubt he even notices you arent smitten are you kineas asked he meant the comment in jest and cursed inwardly when he saw that it had hit home of all the old niceas hes young enough to be your son niceas shrugged and said no fool like an old fool he looked at the fire but soon his gaze was back on eumenes still posturing to his friends like ajax he was beautiful graceful manly brave keep your thoughts on the war kineas said he tried to make the comment light niceas gave a lopsided grin fine talk from you youll see your filly tomorrow and then you wont notice the rest of us exist for i dont know until were all dead kineas stiffened ill try to spare some time for other thoughts he said still trying for a light tone niceas shook his head dont be a prick i dont mean to offend not much anyway but some of the boys think were in this fucking war so that you can mount this girl and for all that the poet is full of such stuff its thin enough if were all dead the lopsided grin was back i liked your speech today hades i felt the touch whatever it was i wont say gods i wont say it werent he took kineass cup and refilled it philokles spread his cloak and fell on it with a thud private conversation he asked when it was too late for them to evict him no said kineas curious how little of his authority seemed to carry over to the campfire that is to say yes but youre as welcome as my other friends to be critical of my love life a look passed between the spartan and the older man they both smiled kineas looked from one to the other and got to his feet aphrodite take you both he growled im for bed philokles indicated his cloak with an expansive wave im in mine kineas rolled his cloak out and slept between them by the fire no more was said but he lay awake for a long time there was an owl and he was determined to catch it though he couldnt think why he rode his horse a great rough beast that he didnt want to look at across the endless rolling plain of ash the ash was everywhere and devoured all the colour so that he felt as if he was riding in a dark summer twilight with all the colours robbed by the loom of night and still the horse if horse it was galloped on across the plain when he saw the river in the distance he felt fear as sharp and total as the first fear hed ever felt the beast between his legs cared nothing for his fears and it ran on straight for the sandy ford at the base of the slope he lifted his head and saw the sea glimmering darkly and knew that he was again on the field of issus there were bodies all around the ford men and horses mixed and the men had been mutilated his beasts hooves rattled on the gravel of the slope toward the river still black water that reflected no stars he had been chasing an owl where was the owl he turned and looked to the right where the second taxeis should have broken through the wall of mercenaries but there were only corpses and ash and the smell of smoke and then he saw a winged shape rising against the high ground he pulled at the beasts reins sawing them back and forth increasingly desperate as the thing crashed into the ford do not cross the river said kam baqca the voice was clear and calm and the beast turned splashing along the margins of the river and the black drops rose slowly through the air and burned like ice when they touched the skin and then he was galloping free of the water if water it was over the field of the dead and the owl spiralled down towards him as if stooping on prey his beast shied the first time it had missed a step in its mad career and he looked down past its hideous hide to the ground where alexanders body lay broken his face covered with a smiling golden mask around him lay the bodies of his companions thats not what happened complained some rational part of his mind but the thought slipped away the owl swooped out of the air he saw it in the periphery of his vision and turned his head to see the claws sink into his face through his face the owl melting into his flesh like a sword thrust sinking home he screamed and he was flying he was the owl the owl was him the beast was gone or the beast too was one with the bird and the man the great brown wings beat and he watched the earth below and knew where his prey lived saw every mortal movement on the plain of ash he rose with the worlds wind under his wings and then beat strongly without fatigue over the low hills that had lined the battlefield of issus until he was clear of the plain of ash and flew over the world of men and still he rose until he could see the curve of the sea from alexandria to tyre and then he fell with the long curve of an arrow past tyre and chios and lesvos past the ruins of troy past the hellespont until he slowed his descent and hovered over the sea of grass and in the distance he saw the tree growing to shade the whole world and yet it seemed to grow from a single tent on the plain he soared to the tree and as his talons bit into the rich comfort of its bark he awoke missing the warmth of his hyperetes against his right side he could hear niceas berating someone and young voices raised in laughter and he thought time to get up and then the enormity of the dream hit him and he lay there trying to see it all again terrified all over again at the alienness of his own thoughts he shivered with more than just the cold of the morning pushed himself to the fire and one of eumenes young men brought him a cup of hot wine agathon he said remembering the lads name the boy beamed can i get you anything else we slept in the open like real soldiers i wasnt even cold kineas couldnt handle too much adolescent enthusiasm so early in the morning he drank off the rest of the hot wine and rolled his cloak tight in the time it took the sun to get his ball of fire fully over the horizon they were mounted their breath streaming away like pale plumes in the cold spring air and the dream with all of its bonds to the other was again banished by a counter spell of work kineas waved for ataelus to join him with the exception of his abortive attempts to learn the sakje tongue over the winter kineas hadnt seen much of the scyth he gave the man a smile ataelus looked tense kineas couldnt remember seeing the man look so reserved will we find the sakje camp today he asked the scout ataelus made a face yes he said second hour after the sun is high unless they were for moving he didnt look as if he relished the prospect kineas rubbed his new beard well then lead on ataelus looked back at him gravely the lady for waiting two weeks of you he sighed heavily do you mean she may have left kineas said in alarm ataeluss greek had improved considerably over the winter his vocabulary was much bigger his grammar was about the same he could still be difficult to understand not for leaving ataelus said heavily for waiting he shook his reins and touched his riding whip to his ponys flanks and he was gone over the grass leaving kineas to worry philokles joined kineas as the column started forward what was that about kineas waved dismissively our scyth is in a state because were late hmm said the spartan we are late and the lady doesnt strike me as the sort of commander who likes to wait kineas rode out of the column signalled to leucon to join him and barked out a string of commands that set the whole troop into an open skirmish line two stades wide when the rough line was moving well he rode back to philokles who as usual took no part in the manoeuvres shell understand that i was delayed kineas said so will the king the spartan pursed his lips listen hipparch if you were waiting for her and youd sat for two weeks while she drilled her cavalry he raised an eyebrow kineas was watching the skirmish line which was sticking together pretty well i dont you dont think of her as another commander you think of her as a greek girl with some equine skills better get over that brother shes had to put up with two weeks of ribbing from her troopers about waiting like a mare in heat for her stallion thats my guess look how well you handle our teasing the left half of the skirmish line was bunching up as the young troopers chatted while they rode riding with a horse length between each file pair took practice and the line was starting to fall apart sound halt kineas bellowed to philokles he said she may not even want me the spartan didnt blink thats a whole different problem but if she didnt want you chances are ataelus wouldnt be looking so worried kineas watched the outer arms of his skirmish line galloping to the centre to form on their commander as always id treasure your advice philokles nodded make the same apologies to her that youd make to a man kineas scratched his beard kick me when i go wrong he cantered for the command group to discuss the skirmish line they saw the first scouts by midmorning dark centaurs on the horizon who vanished between hoof beats they found the camp in the afternoon as ataelus had predicted kineass stomach turned over at the sight of the wagons and he clenched the barrel of his horse between his knees until the animal began to curvet and fidget there were a few riders at the edge of the camp and a mounted group was gathered at the edge of the river the riders came to them at a gallop two young men resplendent in red leather and gold ornament flashing in the sun who raced by the head of the column waved and raced off again yipping like dogs they ran their horses right in among the crowd at the edge of the water kineas led his column through the tall grass to the edge of the camp and ordered it to halt he sat at the head of the column feeling foolish because he didnt know what to do hed expected that shed come out and meet him instead he saw that there was some sort of archery contest going on shooting with bows ataelus said at his side lady shoots next see kineas saw how had he missed her srayanka was seated on a grey mare at the edge of the water with a bow in her hand her jacket half off so that one breast was bare in the warm spring sun the sleeve falling free one shoulder bare to the gold gorget at her neck her hair was bound in two heavy braids and as she turned her head he saw her heavy brows and the focus of her expression thats what she looks like he thought yes wait here he said to niceas he motioned to ataelus to attend him and touched his horse with his whip her whip and cantered across the grass to her a man was shooting as kineas reined in the man kneed his horse into motion first a canter and then a gallop along the flat grass at the waters edge he leaned out over his horses neck and shot an arrow into a bundle of grass a second arrow appeared in his fingers and he shot it point blank leaning so far down off his pony that the head of the arrow almost brushed the target as he released and then he was past turning in the saddle with a third arrow nocked and he drew and released in one smooth motion the last shot hung in the wind for a moment the arrow visible as a black streak before burying itself in the ground an arms length beyond the target the other sakje hooted and cheered kineas looked back to srayanka and she took a deep breath her whole body focused on the target of grass the way a hunting dog would watch a wounded stag like a man philokles had said her visible breast and the line of her muscular shoulder to her neck were like a phidian status of artemis but the athenian sculptor would never have known a womans face to have such an expression set and hard with purpose kineas stayed silent without another glance she tapped her heels against her mare and the horse leaped straight from a stand into a gallop her first arrow was in the air with the horses first full stride she had three more in the fingers of her draw hand and she flipped one like a conjuror drew and shot leaned out close to the target just as the man had done her whole body at an impossible angle to the horse her braided hair straight out behind her head the muscles of her arm standing out with the strain of drawing the bow her hips and legs one with her mount kineas couldnt breathe she put the last arrow on her bow and turned back so fast that her body seemed to rotate free of her waist and shot again her arrow invisible until it punched through the grass target and then as the horsemen began to cheer she drew a fifth arrow from the gorytos at her waist whirled again and loosed her upper body straining to the heavens like a priestess offering a prayer to apollo the arrow lofted up and up into the blue sky and hung as if caught by the gods hand at the top of its arc before plummeting to the earth where it transfixed the bundle of grass before the arrow hit she had slowed her horse as she turned to be greeted by the roars of all the warriors and the greeks up the ridge the sound went on and on though there were just fifty or so of them with a high crescendo of screams yeeyeeyee from the women and bass barking from the men several stepped forward raising their hands in obvious congratulations and an older woman her trumpeter rode up close and embraced her she handed the trumpeter her bow turned and put her arm down into her sleeve and shrugged the jacket back over her naked shoulder she walked her horse toward kineas empty handed he was still bellowing his appreciation like a good guest at a symposium behind him the other olbians were cheering too he fell silent as she rode closer her eyebrows were just as he remembered her nose long and greek her forehead clear and high how could he have forgotten how large her eyes were or their brown flecks within the dark blue he couldnt think of anything useful to say he had to say something tell her thats the finest shooting ive ever seen he said his voice came out clear and calm he was surprised he got it out at all ataelus spoke in sakje kineas knew the words enough to know that his compliment was passed unadorned she raised an eyebrow and replied to ataelus without taking her eyes off kineas she say she shoot bow much when she has long wait ataelus sounded more nervous than kineas she say she packed wagons for leaving saw us coming she say are you ready to ride or need more rest kineas didnt take his eyes off hers tell her im very sorry we are so late ataelus spoke this time he spoke at some length she raised a hand and silenced him she pressed her mare forward kineass stallion rolled his lips back from his teeth and sniffed his neck extended as far forwards the mare as he could manage despite kineass rock hard hand at the reins the mare shied a step and then fast as thought her head came round and she nipped kineass horse on the neck with her teeth and he shied stepped back and kineas had to struggle to keep his seat srayanka spoke kineas caught words he knew mare and stallion the sakje warriors laughed one of them laughed so hard that he fell to the ground and pointing at him led to more laughter kineas got his stallion in hand and turned to ataelus he could feel the heat of his face she was laughing too what did she say he asked ataelus was laughing so hard that his eyes were closed and both of his hands were wrapped in his horses mane what did she say kineas demanded again this time in his battlefield voice ataelus wiped the grin off his face and sat straight she made for joke he said after some hesitation the sakje were still laughing worse yet someone who had some sakje had translated the joke to the olbians the older men were trying to hide their laughter but the younger were unable to control themselves i can see that kineas snapped she turned away from him to her trumpeter and snapped a string of orders and then she turned her head back to him and he caught the flash of deep blue as her eyes sought his and she smiled dont be an ass he thought to himself but he was boiling inside and he couldnt manage to return her smile tell me this joke he said to ataelus ataelus was struggling to restrain laughter he panted like a dog slapped his horse finally gave up the struggle and dissolved into laughter with his arms crossed over his chest kineas glanced after srayankas retreating back she was gathering riders and shouting orders and a group of younger men were harnessing oxen to the wagons most of the laughter had stopped among the sakje but it was still spreading among the olbians as the joke was translated and passed from file to file kineas trotted over to niceas who sat on his charger fingering his amulet with a fixed and dutiful expression that kineas knew all too well kineas spoke quietly firmly as if nothing untoward had happened get everyone off their warhorses and on their riding horses water all the animals at the river bread and cheese in the saddle niceas nodded as if he didnt dare speak philokles had a broad grin on his face he pulled out of the column as niceas began to shout orders leucon rode by redfaced avoiding kineass eye in fact none of the men met kineass eye eumenes was still laughing ataelus reached out and touched his elbow he was smiling she say maybe mare he began to laugh again he managed to croak out in heat two weeks ago kineas had to work through the words in his mind and then a slow smile punctured the grim mask of his face before the sun had moved another hand across the sea of grass the whole column sakje and olbian was mounted and heading north kineas changed horses and cantered up the column to where srayanka rode with her trumpeter a hardeyed older woman with skin like leather and bright red hair like diodorus whom kineas remembered from the summer before srayanka smiled as he rode up the best smile she had ever given him she nudged her trumpeter and spoke to ataelus behind him the lead sakje tittered she say where your stallion kineax tell her my stallion is too sad to be ridden in despair can you say in despair kineas was at a heavy disadvantage in translation ataelus shook his head whats despair something bad so sad you cant eat kineas said ah lovesick ataelus laughed and then spoke quickly before kineas could stop him the sakje tittered again and a big blackhaired man behind kineas leaned out and slapped his shoulder srayanka turned and brushed a hand against kineass face the motion took him by surprise she was that fast and he squirmed and almost missed her touch ataelus laughed with the rest of the sakje and then said she say not worry she say and he broke off a while to laugh again she say maybe mare in heat again in about two weeks kineas felt his face grow hot he grinned at her and she grinned at him the look went on too long kineas decided it was time to change the subject ask her if the king is ready to make war he said the laughter from the sakje stopped she replied in a few words her face changed returning to the hard look she had worn while she shot her bow she say not for her to speak for king she come to guide she say speak not for war until we come for king ataelus had a look on his face that pleaded for understanding kineas nodded but he continued i have heard of zopryons army it is very great and ready to march it was infuriating to have to listen to ataeluss halting translation and her reply ataelus turned back to him she say the king is for having many things for talk much talk not for her to take the words for the king tell her i understand kineas pantomimed understanding to her she spoke directly to him he understood getae and zopryon and the verb for riding she say the grass already knocked down with hooves of the getae she say she know zopryon ready to ride ataelus wiped his forehead with his sleeve i say for talking that talking is hard work he laughed grimly kineas took the hint and rode back to his own men the column moved fast and the land became flat the endless grass greener with each warm day extending to the horizon on the left and the river coiling like a snake sometimes it was at their feet and sometimes it passed far away to their right in long last curves those curves were the only marker of their progress otherwise they might have been standing still for all the variation in the landscape when the river passed out of sight the plain of grass and the solid blue of the sky spread unchanged in every direction like a blue bowl inverted over a green bowl the immensity of it made the greeks uncomfortable time seemed to stand still yet by the second day the whole life of the column was routine rising in predawn cold the welcome warmth of the horse at first mounting a hasty meal with the first rays of the new sun and then hours walking and trotting through the grass the trampled line of their passage straight as the flight of an arrow behind them and the virgin grass before them as far as the eye could see evening was different srayankas scouts chose the halting place each night always close to water and often shaded by trees at the rivers edge and fires were lit against the cold the product of the days hunt roasted on iron spits and the warriors told stories or pushed each other to vicious competitions horse races wrestling archery contests of strength and memory wit and skill filled the evening from the last halt to the dying of the fires at first the olbians hung back but on the second night niceas wrestled parshtaevalt the blackhaired scyth who had shown interest in everything greek then eumenes raced his best pony against srayankas trumpeter and lost the race and the pony the third evening became an equine olympics with mounted races a dozen wrestling matches and new events boxing and foot races the sakje were as poor on foot as they were gifted on horseback their notion of boxing was even stranger the sakje had a contest that appeared similar where two champions would stand toe to toe and hit each other by turns until the weaker man fell or declared himself beaten leucon a passable boxer thought that he was seeing the greek sport and proceeded to block blows to the consternation of his opponent and half the audience and kineas had to explain boxing to srayanka through eumenes and ataelus and then he and leucon gave a demonstration leucon was a sturdy man powerfully built and well trained but he lacked the speed and grace of ajax or kineas kineas drew the match out both for leucons vanity and for the benefit of the audience but when he parried leucons best punch and responded with a flurry of blows too fast to be counted in the dwindling light the crowd sakje and greek alike roared approval leucon fell then by torchlight philokles and a score of other men threw stones from the river they threw for distance and argued the rules did a bounce count until kineas feared violence would ensue and ordered the olbians to bed the fourth day passed like the others the olbian horse drilled and skirmished formed and reformed and the sakje watched and hooted or hunted or rode in speculative silence a week in the saddle and all of leucons troopers were already hardened to the life eating in the saddle riding all day kineas reined in next to the young commander in the late afternoon leucon had a hard head from the boxing but he kept his temper like a gentleman and everyone respected him the more your men are very good kineas said youre a good commander leucon smiled ruefully at the praise good thing he said as my olympic boxing career seems to be over then he said but thanks im so proud of them i feel like i might burst or start singing kineas rubbed his jaw where his new beard was now prominent it barely itched any more i know what you mean he glanced at niceas theyre good arent they old man niceas had eumenes by his side in the column and he glanced at the younger hyperetes before responding better than i expected he said then he broke into a smile of course well see what theyre really made of when we have to fight dont stop drilling said kineas after achieving excellence comes keeping it on the fourth evening kineas found himself throwing javelins against niceas and kyros and one of the more promising boys the sakje watched curiously as the men rode through the course throwing to the right and left kineas was done having struck all his targets and was watching the boy intently when he saw that srayanka had mounted her mare and was starting the course behind the boy she had a bow and shot twice for every javelin he had launched and rode past the last target flushed with triumph to the cheers of her band kineas rode back to the lists and retrieved all of his javelins determined to answer her challenge he took two more javelins from niceas his hyperetes shot him a look through the failing light at the crowd of sakje this is a good idea he asked ask me after i ride kineas responded he halted his horse at the start line and cleared his mind srayanka was still receiving the applause of her warriors he watched her for a moment and then pressed his horse into motion the stallion hadnt been ridden all day except for his first pass and he was full of energy kineas threw his first javelin from well out a difficult shot but well placed and the heavy dart sank into the rawhide of the target a sakje shield he threw his second just before he passed the target and heard the thunk as the head bit home without looking at the result he took his third javelin from his rein hand and threw for distance it was one of niceass lighter than his own and it flew high catching the top of the second target and knocking it flat at a gallop too fast to think he took his fourth javelin and sent his horse over the shield rather than past it raised the second javelin high as he gathered the horse to jump and plunged it down with the whole weight of his arm he heard a reaction from the crowd but he was already throwing his fifth his whole being concentrated on the last target and his last javelin he was a stride behind he fumbled the grip change for a heartbeat and the shield was past he turned if she could do it he could and threw sidearmed at the last target he felt a muscle pop in his neck as he released and felt the pain as he turned back to the course but the sudden burst of sound from a hundred throats told him that the pain was well won he trotted his charger back to niceas niceas was holding the second shield over his head and shouting his approval his leaping throw had punched right through the rawhide and through the wood so that the black spike of the head protruded the length of an arm from the back parshtaevalt srayankas second in command reached up and embraced him shouting in sakje and then srayanka still mounted put her arms around his neck and pressed him close the crowd shrieked approval then eumenes was pushing a cup of wine into his hands unseen hands made wreaths and kineas found himself reclining on a carpet wearing his while srayanka sat with her back to a rolled cloak wearing hers with her hair loose and looking like a muscular nymph they watched the rest of the competitions together at some point he took her hand and she turned to him and her eyes were wide her pupils huge and she moved her thumb across his palm despite the crowd around them she continued to stroke his hand turning it back and forth as she would and he began to join her at the game stroking the back of her hand comparing the calluses on her palm to the warm softness on the back daring to touch the inside of her wrist as if it were a much more private place it was the closest they had been to privacy neither said a word time passed and then the competitions died away into drinking and then the pressure of the wine on kineass bladder made him rise much against his will he looked down aware that he was grinning like a fool or a lovestruck boy with his first serving girl they didnt even speak a common language she met his eyes and then looked down she laughed srayanka he said kineax she said and that was the fourth night the next day he was stiff and cold when he awoke and his hands ached every joint swollen his right shoulder burned when he reached up to fasten his cloak the trophy of last nights throw he summoned eumenes and ataelus i want to work on my sakje as we ride he said both of them looked away smiling but when they were all mounted eumenes and ataelus joined him and began to point around them mare stallion sky and grass and give him the words in sakje the roots of the words lurked at the edge of familiarity like persian some like older greek forms in the poet but the declensions were different and the end sounds were barbaric kineas had started the process in the winter but the press of politics and training had drowned his attempts at language lessons now with the object of his lessons at hand and nothing to do but ride and watch leucon handle his men kineas worked like a boy with a tutor parshtaevalt joined them at the midday halt he was a tall man for a sakje with pale golden hair and a deep tan kineas had gathered that he was some relation to srayanka but the relationship was hard to define a matrilineal cousin he was also a successful war leader with the hair of a dozen enemies on his saddlecloth he had a keen intelligence and he took to the language lessons easily he seemed to enjoy and admire greek things he rode away after an hour and returned with srayanka who rode with them the rest of the day naming things in greek as kineas named them in sakje she continued to command the column while she practised her greek and kineas had an opportunity to observe her at work she was a fine commander he watched her separate two men who were fighting over a haunch of venison her eyes blazing in contrast to her calm level voice they shrank down as if struck she moved around the column she knew the state of every horse in her considerable herd and her scouts were always alert in the evening she spoke to her people when they won contests and when they lost them that much he gleaned just from watching her but he learned more from watching her warriors the respect almost awe with which they treated her could be seen in every interaction she never shied from a contest and although she didnt win them all it was a matter for boasting for the victor when she lost any of them she was first in the saddle at the start of the day and last in the saddle when the column halted she had a different face and a different voice for every warrior in her band man or woman to some she explained using her hands to emphasize a point whereas to others she simply directed and all her people loved her he talked to parshtaevalt through eumenes on the sixth day when she had ridden away from the language lessons to question a scout parshtaevalt now rode with niceas and eumenes most of the time asking questions of the younger man as quickly as he could think of them when parshtaevalt mentioned a raid he had been on the year before kineas asked did srayanka lead the raid against the getae ataelus passed the question and then rolled his eyes at the answer he say fucking getae they burning towns three towns for killing every man they found kineas nodded to indicate he understood how many actions has she fought he asked pointing at srayanka raids battles eumenes phrased the question his sakje was better every day the blackhaired man looked down at his reins and then up at the sun as if looking for inspiration as many as the days of the moon he said through eumenes thirty kineas said aloud thirty actions philokles who always rode to the sound of a good conversation appeared from the sakje part of the column more than leonidas he said more than me said kineas more than me said niceas he gave kineas a grin ill be more respectful on the seventh day the scouts found a herd of deer and a mixed group of hunters sakje and olbian rode away to procure fresh meat they returned with six big carcasses and kineas stood beside srayanka as they ordered the division of the meat the youngest warriors of the sakje were skinning the animals and the olbians slaves were breaking the joints and butchering srayanka watched two young women skinning the biggest buck kineas watched her he could see her desire to say something or perhaps take the chore herself although he couldnt see that they were making any error a trio of olbian cavalrymen younger ones with no immediate duty had gravitated to the sight because the two sakje women had stripped naked to do the bloody work srayanka glanced up from her own concerns when one of the olbian men said barbarian a little too aggressively she turned to kineas and raised an eyebrow who needs language he thought he walked over to the knot of hippeis if you gentlemen dont have anything better to do i expect i could teach you to do some basic butchering the mouthy one alcaeus shook his head thats slaves work he said were just watching the amazons bathe in blood theyre skinning the buck to get the skin not to impress you with their charms move along or ill put you to butchering kineas kept his voice low he didnt want to advertise the poor behaviour of his men out of the corner of his eye he could see srayankas trumpeter and a halfdozen other sakje watching and flicking their riding whips alcaeus put his hands on his hips im not on duty he tossed his head arrogantly i can watch the barbarians show their tits if i want his companions both moved away from him as if he had the plague kineas glanced around for niceas or eumenes he would have preferred that this obvious indiscipline be dealt with by someone else but they were both busy still keeping his voice low kineas said no you cant dont be a fool go to your horse and curry him then join the sentries until i order you in the man looked affronted rather than sheepish i take my orders from leucon he said and besides silence kineas said in his battlefield voice not another word alcaeus shifted his gaze to look past kineas at the two women he glanced at his two companions with all the arrogance of an adolescent assuring himself of an audience he smirked youre blocking my view he said lazily kineas lost his temper it happened in a moment he felt the flood of anger and then he had knocked the stupid boy unconscious with a single blow it hurt his shoulder and split a knuckle he turned on one of the mans companions roll him in his cloak and put him by his horse both of you stay with him until he wakes and then help him curry his horse mount it and the three of you go on sentry until i recall you do you understand they all nodded their eyes as round as athenian owls when he returned to srayanka and ataelus she shook her head for what you hit the man she asked in passable greek kineas turned to ataelus how do you say disobey ataelus shook his head what is disobey kineas breathed out slowly he was angry too angry when i give an order i expect the man to obey if he wont he disobeys srayanka turned her head back and forth between them then she asked a short question in rapid sakje kineas caught his own name and nothing more ataelus shook his head glanced at kineas and spoke at length making gestures of riding and sleeping to kineas he said she ask me for how long am i with you and i tell her and she ask how often you hit men and i say not so much srayankas eyes locked with his they were like the blue of the aegean when the sun returns after a squall he was taller than she by half a head she was standing quite close to him she spoke directly to him speaking slow careful sakje he didnt understand a word ataelus said she say if i hit one man for hurt if i hit one i kill or he ride away or make for enemy he stopped looked back and forth like a trapped animal finally he said then she say man watch girls men all fools when women show tits so what why hit kineas was not used to having his judgement questioned in matters of command he was not used to being questioned in public through an interpreter or by a woman like a man philokles had said but she could have had a man flayed to ribbons with a riding whip and he wouldnt have questioned her authority he could feel the red in his face feel his temper rarely unleashed building he could feel his mind in revolt against the unfairness of it against the censure in her eyes he breathed in and out several times he counted to ten in sakje then he gave her a nod i will explain he said in greek when i am less angry good she said and walked away that night he related the incident to leucon eumenes niceas and philokles they sat by a small fire distant from the sakje who were quiet and kept to themselves hes got a dick instead of a brain niceas said he glanced at leucon sorry i know hes your friend but hes a fool he had it coming leucon looked miserable hes been my companion since we were boys he always gets what he wants hard to change that now niceas gave a nasty grin not that hard he said leucon put his head in his hands i feel that ive failed you hipparch but also i have to say this i feel that that you didnt need to hit him hes a gentleman no one has hit him since his first tutor kineas bridled trying not to react philokles spoke in sparta he could have been killed on the spot leucon sat back on his stool clearly shocked for a little backtalk philokles shrugged indiscipline is poison leucon looked at eumenes eumenes didnt meet his eye hes the kind of bully who would draw a knife in a wineshop brawl ive seen him do it he looked at niceas and then back at leucon i dont like him kineas leaned forward thats not at issue like or dislike a commander is above them i dont dislike the boy i hit him because he was disobedient in my experience disobedience is a plague that starts slowly but spreads rapidly he spread his hands to catch more warmth from the fire leaned forward so that his elbows could rest on his thighs he was cold his knuckle and his shoulder both hurt and he didnt want to think of what damage hed done to relations with srayanka or the sakje he was offending the sakje he offended me and he disobeyed a direct order kineas rubbed his beard i am a hard man a mercenary perhaps your men needed to remember that and then he sighed i let myself grow angry leucon looked more bewildered than informed what will i tell his father he asked before he walked off into the dark philokles watched him go i take it lady srayanka was unimpressed kineas nodded philokles shook his head you did the right thing what else could you do kineas rubbed his hands together youre the philosopher you tell me philokles shook his head im a spartan first and a philosopher second i suppose i might have killed him kineas nodded wearily odd thats what srayanka said she said if she had to hit a man shed kill him rather than leave an enemy at her back or at least thats what i got from the whole thing eumenes said they dont even strike their children he shrugged im serious i had a sakje nanny in war or in a contest no holds barred but not for discipline he thought for as long as it took niceas to put an armload of wood on the fire and then said i dont think they even have a word for discipline now that is interesting philokles said kineas left them to it he sent niceas to recall the three sentries before he went to roll in his cloak then he lay awake for a long time thinking about women his mother his sisters artemis and srayanka he didnt reach any conclusion at all artemis and srayanka were like a different sex from his mother and sisters it was not that he thought that artemis and srayanka were really so alike artemis used her sex as a tool to get what she wanted from men srayanka was a commander and yet there was some basic similarity he thought of philokles telling him to treat srayanka as if she were a man the thought made him frown and he fell asleep they didnt ride together the next day kineas rode with his men practising words with ataelus as the grass vanished under their hooves it wasnt that everything was the same nor that anything was different the same could be said in the olbian section of the column kineas couldnt define the problem but something had changed it confounded him he had the ability to read his troops and he knew that they agreed with him that alcaeus deserved his punishment in fact from his demeanor it appeared that alcaeus himself felt he merited the blow he looked sheepish now rather than angry and yet something was different in the column as if by demonstrating the force that underlay the discipline kineas had forfeited some of their goodwill niceas added a barb to the situation when they were alone the idiot was ogling the sakje girls right and you spend all your waking hours with one you know what soldiers say when one man has something the others cant have kineas had to admit the fairness of the point at least through the eyes of soldiers he stroked his beard and blew on his cold hands you know if all these pampered gentlemen soldiers have to complain about is my love life theyre doing pretty well he looked off at the horizon she wont speak to me today niceas gave him a halfgrin in return exactly he raised an eyebrow you worry too much hipparch he glanced at the sky where a line of heavy dark clouds came at them like a phalanx one corner of his mouth curled the rich boysll sing a different tune soon enough after three days of rain everyone in the column had plenty to complain about the three days were miserable for the greeks who spent them learning to live like soldiers rather than like rich men on an extended hunt their cloaks were wet through some men found that the blue dye in their cloaks ran staining their skins and their fires were fitful and smoky the nights were cold and wet and the troopers from olbia finally learned to huddle together for warmth it wasnt really like sleeping the best most men could manage was a troubled halfsleep as the pile of bodies moved every man searching for warmth at the centre by day they had their horses for warmth and by the third day most of them could sleep on horseback kineas was just as miserable because while he drilled his men and taught them to live in the rain srayanka eluded him worse he sometimes caught her watching him her face serious her brows a single line across her face she was judging him on the fourth day the sun shone and towards evening they found the king the city of the sakje stretched for miles and when he first saw the extent of the walls the size of it took kineass breath away a temple stood on a high bluff over the river and around it lay an acropolis of large log structures brightly coloured and smaller buildings built of hewn timber and earth the acropolis itself was small enough but the walls that surrounded it ran off to join earthworks three men tall that ran off almost to the horizon its not really a city satrax said they were standing together on the walls of the acropolis its really a big stock pen kineas had spent two days discussing plans with marthax the kings principal warlord and other of his inner council kam baqca the king himself and srayanka eumenes and ataelus were exhausted from constant translation and even the king the only man among them to speak sakje and greek with equal fluency was showing the strain when kineas slept he had dreams of languages where sakje dogs accosted him in broken greek where objects named themselves in sakje he was learning the language but his brain was tired all the time the king ordained a break and dragged kineas outside to see the sun he was less distant less aggressive than he had been at their winter meeting srayanka who ignored kineas as if he didnt exist spent most of her time with the king while they debated the conduct of the war she opposed him always seeking the rashest course in this he sided with the young king and caution she didnt seem to hold the cautious policy against the king she focused her discontent on just one man that morning however she was off with the other fighting women and kam baqca something about religion kineas was heartsick and only the loss of srayankas favour informed him fully of what she had come to mean to him over the winter he chided himself for being a fool he had help in this from niceas and tried to concentrate on the weighty matters at hand of course she as the greatest magnate among the assagatje would favour the king who doted on her kineas realized that the king had been speaking for some time he seemed to expect a response kineas waved at the stock pens with the exception of the acropolis and a builtup stretch along the river where the sindi farmers had a town and greek merchants had their warehouses the rest of the walls were empty who built the walls kineas asked they go on for what forty stades twice that if you include all the tribal enclosures the king gave a proud smile the sindi did it many years ago after the threat of darius the sakje decided that we needed a safe place for all the herds in time of war and the sindi agreed to build the walls the sindi are your peasants kineas asked there were sindi farmers in olbia but there were also sindi aristocrats they were native to the euxine but many of them had assimilated so successfully with the greeks that the only sign of them was their dark eyes and straight black hair eumenes had the hair kyros had the eyes and young clio had both the king shook his head the sindi love the dirt the sakje love the sky he shrugged when first we came so our legend says we had contempt for the sindi we destroyed their army and took their women he glanced at kineas and raised an eyebrow all sounds likely enough but they fought back in their own ways they shot our men from behind trees they fouled wells and killed men in their sleep the king shrugged so the legend says myself i think that the wiser sakje knew from the first that without the grain raised by sindi farmers there would be no gold and no greek wine does it matter we are not really two peoples any longer we are one people with two different faces he leaned out over the timber hoarding of the acropolis wall and pointed at a crowd of merchants arguing over grain prices at the base of the wall sometimes in the villages there is a boy or a girl they live in the dirt but they want the sky and one day when a band of sakje ride by the boy or girl goes to the chief and says take me and in the same way sometimes a rider old or young watches the grass grow and yearns for the earth for something solid under his feet such a one goes to the chief of a village and says take me he turned to kineas his handsome face lit by the rising sun i am the king of all of them so i love the dirt and the sky the wind was warmer and the grass was greener but the north wind bit hard and kineas pulled his cloak tight around his shoulders for warmth he looked at the walls he could see following them from west to east right up to the river athens piraeus olbia and tomis would fit inside those walls and still have room but there werent enough people to fill a small greek town stock pens he said as a reminder when the tribes come in for the festival or in time of war there is grazing for their herds at least for a month the walls serve to keep the animals in and to keep raiders out he grinned so we have a population higher than athens if you count goats i see a great many merchants kineas could see further than usual over the plains and villages on the river we never saw a village in two weeks travel the king nodded the merchants dont speak much about this its a trade secret this is where the grain is grown those warehouses are where the grain is stored they ship it down the river in barges spring and fall why tell other men he looked out over the wall but neither is it a secret i suspect most of your men could have told you kineas shook his head i feel like a fool i thought i was going to find a field of tents in a month you would have we dont live here except for the sindi the merchants and a handful of priests not even for the winter kineas asked the king nodded i have wintered here the hill is cold he looked north i prefer to winter in the north by the trees the king began to walk back into the great hall at the top of the acropolis opposite the temple the great hall was a log version of a greek megaron with a central hearth the fire blazed as high as a man the warmth could be felt as soon as the two men pushed through the tapestries that covered the great door the tapestries were a shock of colour they were as alien as the endless sky and the sea of grass the pair that kept the cold at bay in the door were made from heavy felt in many layers with figures of men and horses and fantastic beasts cut out or applied in bright colours and geometric patterns on a white ground on the walls hung larger panels of heavy wool embroidered with griffons and horses huge horned deer and hunting cats the floor was deep in bright carpets such as kineas had seen in kam baqcas tent the dominant colour was red and the warmth was palpable the king waved at marthax standing by the fire with kam baqca in a magnificent robe and philokles what trees how far are the trees kineas asked he was looking for srayanka a thousand stades or more i doubt it could be measured the trees are like another world a world of forests the sindi say that once all the world was a single forest he shrugged i have seen the sea and i have seen the trees each is like another world why winter there kineas asked more wood makes bigger fires satrax said with the adolescent sneer hed avoided all morning he grinned its not complicated kineas thought of the walls the warehouses and the grain you dont need olbia as a base to feed your army he said satrax grinned it wouldnt hurt to spread the cost i dont own all that grain but no i lied kings do that when they must i dont need olbia kineas grinned back but then narrowed his eyes but you do have something for the macedonians to march against a city to lose you cant really just melt into the grass he stopped as if struck you have to fight for your farmers they joined the circle at the fire the sakje had little ceremony the king came and went like any free man and the respect accorded him was no more or less than that given by greek soldiers to a commander they respected the king took a cup of heated apple cider from the woman who was mulling it by the fire then he sat on a pile of carpets while kineas got his own cider the king answered yes and no kineas i could still melt into the grass nothing here is built in stone thats our law zopryon can burn the lot well build it back in a season or move he waved at a group of merchants by the fire and if we all agreed to it the sindi would come with us kineas sat without the grace all the sakje showed in descending to the carpets the king looked into the fire but i dont want to build it again i dont want the interruption in trade in fact i dont want this war at all he sighed but it is coming here and ill fight it kineas drank some of the cider he loved the stuff where does this come from he asked apples wont grow for two seasons the king shrugged cold has its advantages we make cider in the fall and freeze it in blocks for the winter he beckoned to the other people that kineas had come to think of as the war council to kineas he said drink up spring is here and soon all the cider will go bad kam baqca sat next to kineas in a rustle of silk kineas had seen silk before but seldom worn so often and by so many most of the sakje had a silk garment even if worn to tatters kam baqca had a robe pale yellow covered in pink flowers and curling griffons it was so magnificent that kineas kept looking at it despite himself we have wrangled for days kam baqca said marthax says that you are ready tell us your plan kineas hesitated his cup of cider to his lips kam baqca regarded him calmly her large eyes relaxed almost sleepy you have a plan kineas of athens the king has an army but he does not yet have a plan she nodded the two fit together like a man and she smiled a woman the shamans eyes flicked to srayanka who joined the circle also wearing a silk robe and back to kineas kam baqca put a hand on kineass arm and said you must come and visit my tent you must face the tree kineas nodded politely with no intention of passing under her hand again the last two dreams of the tree had left marks on his mind ruts into which the wheels of his thoughts fell and along which they travelled too often and too unpredictably as if reading his mind kam baqca leaned close so that he could smell the spice and resin of her magic without the tree you will never win her she said srayankas robe was dark blue and reached from her neck to her ankles and under it she wore trousers of a rich red she looked more like a woman kineass native idea of a woman than he had seen before kineas found it disconcerting and distracting for two days he had fought her tooth and nail on the conduct of the war no greek woman would have faced him down shouted him down when he counselled caution of course he thought with further heartache no greek woman would have been at a war council aware of his regard she turned her head away from him and sat exchanging greetings with the king and with marthax as she sat other men and women gathered to them leucon and eumenes and niceas marthax and ataelus and a dozen sakje nobles they sat in a circle some reclined srayanka lay on her stomach kicking her slippered heels in the air a posture that no greek woman would ever have adopted out of her bedroom kineas felt like a besotted fool but he couldnt take his eyes away they fell silent after a momentary babble of greetings i too think it is time to speak of the whole plan said the king he looked at kineas i am a mercenary kineas said to the group i have never commanded more than three hundred horse in action he pointed at marthax as the kings war leader shouldnt marthax present the plan behind him eumenes translated as quickly as he could into sakje kineas was no longer surprised by how much the young man understood the king made a gesture with his hand this is not a greek council and i am not a greek king i have translated for you for two days i know the plan but we all wish to hear it in its finished form kineas nodded looked around the circle very well the plan is simple we never fight a battle niceas whistled i like it already he said marthax waited for the translation and then nodded exactly he said in greek srayanka raised an eyebrow she rolled over and sat up he looked at her too long again the king held out his cup for more cider how kineas tore his eyes from the lady its a matter of timing and logistics marthax spoke in sakje and eumenes translated thats why youre the expert kineas held up his hand last year i rode from tomis to olbia by the same route that zopryon must use it took me thirty days it will take his army fifty if he marches tomorrow the best he can do is to reach olbia at midsummer he paused to let eumenes translation catch up if we destroy the ferry at antiphilous we add at least two weeks to his journey if the men of pantecapaeum stand with us and their fleet will serve our need then we will strip his triremes off his army and slow his march still further he intends to build forts as he marches he is wise enough to know that his road home needs protection which will slow him longer again he waited for eumenes to catch him up we will then be past the new year past the month of games past the summer festival and we will not yet have shown our hand kineas looked around the circle you know why he is coming here srayanka answered to conquer us satrax shook his head in the long run the result would be the same but he seeks our submission to prove his worth as a feat of arms srayankas face at the translation of the word submission had a look that kineas hoped was never directed at him kineas took a deep breath when he is sixty days from home and not yet at the borasthenes river we have a choice he tried not to look at srayanka the simplest choice would be to offer submission he shrugged he wont have time to press the siege of olbia by that point he wont have the time to march here and it would be suicide to march to this place leaving olbia in his rear astride his road home if we offer him the tokens of submission he paused again and sighed still avoiding srayankas eye satrax nodded you think like a king kineas glanced at philokles who gave a slight nod of recognition srayanka was boring holes in his head with her eyes she sprang to her feet this must be your greek discipline she glared around the council what are we a nation of slaves she asked in greek to the king she said will we beat our warriors into submission for this macedonian beast are we so afraid kineas dropped his eyes he had hoped it no longer mattered what he hoped marthax spoke the other choice said ataelus kineas breathed in again we strike his march columns every day over the last hundred and fifty stades to the great river the sakje who wont have shown themselves yet except in handfuls groups of scouts appear as if by magic they kill the stragglers and the foragers a handful of warriors strike their camps at night marthax spoke again as did most of the sakje out of the babble ataelus translated marthax says that more for liking him there was a brief silence and philokles leaned forward into it and said but of course each of those attacks will work just once kineas nodded satrax leaned forward into the circle pulling at his beard yesterday you sounded as if you could pick his army to pieces like a flock of vultures today you say every trick will work only once why will the attacks work only once kineas glanced at philokles but philokles shook his head declining to take up the argument kineas looked at srayanka who continued to avoid his eye he determined not to look at her again macedon has good officers and excellent discipline after we hit their column once there wont be any stragglers the next day after we kill their foragers the next day they will forage by regiments with the whole army standing to arms he looked around the circle avoiding her but willing her to listen with discipline they can minimize our advantages of speed and stealth he gave a hard grin of course every measure they take to minimize our advantages will slow them he finished the cider in his cup and we will not take heavy losses to do it the cost in money to macedon will be staggering and zopryon will never have a chance to try again he will be disgraced kam baqca nodded slowly and then shook her head but of course lord zopryon will know all this kineas nodded yes so that as soon as the raids start he will immediately recognize our strategy and he will react like a desperate wounded animal she looked not at kineas but at philokles and then at srayanka philokles met her eyes yes it will perhaps take him a few days to pass his desperation to his officers but yes so he will not retreat to disgrace he will lash out he will if he can force us to battle kam baqca sat up on her knees even if he must take reckless gambles with his men and his supplies all the greeks nodded she also nodded as if to herself it is the wounded boar who kills men it is the boar with no hope who gores kings ouch muttered niceas srayanka bowed her head to kam baqca honoured one we need not fear him with our full muster kam baqca reached out and touched her face we might still lose every person in this circle might lie broken under the long moon she stopped and closed her eyes the king watched her closely do you prophesy she opened her eyes it is on a swords edge as i have said kineas spoke with all the conviction of a man forced to speak against his will we will not win such a battle srayanka spoke not angrily but with great force and the king translated for her you sound as if he is alexander he said mimicking srayankas gesture what if he makes the wrong choice what if he retreats kineas watched her face while the king translated her words you have never seen us fight kineax do you think we are cowards she clenched her fist and held it up perhaps we lack the discipline you have but we are strong kineas shook his head he was not doing well at avoiding her eyes but when he spoke he was controlled zopryon is no alexander praise the gods he is an average commander with no particular gifts but the worst commander in macedon knows how to conduct this kind of campaign in greece we have books to tell us even if we dont have veterans to tell us how to do it he frowned i have never seen you fight but i know you to be brave but no amount of courage will break the front of a taxeis the king translated his reply and then looked at both of them kineas my fathers sisters daughter has more merit in her argument than you might think you have never seen us fight you dont know what we can muster he turned to srayanka yet as i first said kineas thinks like a king battle is a risk war is a danger why chase fortunes tail he looked at marthax who nodded deeply so that his grey and black beard rode up and down on his chest i hadnt thought to destroy the ferry at antiphilous the king continued and i didnt know how great zopryons fleet might be but in other respects is this not the plan as we discussed it all winter and you my lady did i not warn you that kineas would bring even more reasons to be wary marthax drained his cup and belched better he said and kineas understood before ataelus translated he went on when he reaches some agreed point we harry him and then unless he retreats we offer submission he grinned only a fool would reject us kam baqca sat back on her heels and sipped a cup of wine he will reject us she said i have seen it srayankas head snapped around she spoke at length and with the kind of vehemence that kineas associated with reprimands to errant troopers she spoke quickly and her voice rose in pitch so that he couldnt even pick out words eumenes shook his head lost by the fluidity of her speech even ataelus hesitated the king came to their rescue she says that if kam baqca has already foreseen the rejection we can save ourselves the shame of offering the submission and concentrate on proving kineas to be a fool about the battle he avoided looking at kineas she said some other things best left between her and kam baqca but i will answer her he spoke briefly in sakje and then said in greek i am king kam baqca is often correct but she herself says that the future is like the wax of a candle and the closer it gets to the flame the more malleable it is she has been surprised i have been surprised he turned to srayanka and spoke in sakje and she put her hands to her face a girlish gesture kineas had never seen her use in greek the king said we will not have our full muster of strength many horses we should have counted from our cousins the massakje many we should have counted from our cousins the sauromatae he looked around the circle this is not for every man to discuss alexander is beating at the eastern gates of the grass just as zopryon beats at the west gate the monster is in bactria chasing a rebel satrap the king rolled his shoulders and looked very young or he has always planned the campaign this way to have armies enter the plain of grass from either end kam baqca says this is not true that it is mere happenstance but it makes no difference to us we will have only two thirds of our full muster perhaps less the getae are already marching east and our easternmost clans will have to protect their farmers he shrugged spoke a long sentence in sakje kineas understood several words no horses and macedon in greek the king said submission alone costs us nothing there is no shame in it because we have no intention to submit somewhere in his head kineas realized that nothing in greek was indicated in sakje by no horses surrender costs us no horses the king said kineas nodded in satisfaction the grass is growing kam baqca said the ground is almost hard in a week the last of the heavy rain will pass in two weeks he will march kineas nodded in agreement the king said where do we appoint the muster where do we assemble our army kineas shrugged we need to cover olbia if zopryon takes olbia you will have no choices at all and if the archon does not feel that you are willing to protect him he will abandon the alliance and submit really submit privately kineas thought that the archon might be tempted to make such a submission anyway the closer the main army is to olbia the more reliable will be your alliance with the euxine cities the king nodded while kineass words were translated for the sakje so that my army threatens even as it protects satrax said he put his chin on his hand it will be a month before i have even half my army in hand marthax spoke the king listened and nodded eumenes said marthax says that the ferry will have to be destroyed immediately that the riders should be dispatched today kineas looked at marthax and nodded emphatically then he said our camp should be on the other bank of the great river near a ford if a battle must be fought we must seize every advantage make zopryon cross the river if we come to that extremity srayanka waited for his translation and then spoke as did several of the other sakje nobles the king said all of them agree that if we need a ford and a place to camp the best is the far side of the campsite at the great bend there is water and forage for an army and supplies can reach us easily on boats he paused and then said let it be so the muster is appointed for the summer solstice at the great bend to kineas he said you will bring the city troops we have nothing like your hoplites and few enough of our nobles have the armour of your cavalry kineas agreed i will bring the troops of the euxine cities to the great bend by the solstice he said he hoped he was telling the truth they talked about the campaign for two more days they planned the muster of the sakje messengers were dispatched to the leading sakje clans to appoint the muster they drafted letters for pantecapaeum and for olbia marthax was to go with sixty warriors to destroy the ferry a job he felt required his presence in person before he departed kineas took him aside and asked him to spare the farm by the bay where graccus was buried and marthax laughed many and many the wine i swill there kineax ataelus translated marthax gave kineas a hug which he returned old man feel no fire from us he gave kineas a squeeze that threatened his ribs worry for less kineas plan good kineas extricated himself from marthaxs hug the trust that marthax put in him unnerved him i am not a commander of armies kineas said the young king emerged from the door behind his warlord he shrugged at kineas nor am i but if i intended to make shoes i would go to a shoemaker plato said kineas with a sour smile socrates said philokles plato would have tried to make the shoes all by himself the sakje town had a market as big as any on the euxine twenty stalls competed to sell every edged implement from the simplest eating knife to the heavy rhompheas the new heavy swords favoured by the thracian hillmen simple short swords were available at every booth from plain iron weapons with serviceable bone hilts to fanciful examples decorated in persian gold work cavalry swords were less common because the sakje didnt like them kineas walked from one booth to the next comparing lengths and weights price ornamentation and practicality kineas enjoyed shopping and hearing the talk of war sword merchants were notorious gossips often spies most of the stalls were run by slaves but one was held by its owner a big egyptian freedman with his own stall and a wagon after hed examined every ware on the mans table he was invited to drink wine in half a cup he heard professional gossip from ectabana and from egypt and all the lands in between youre the hipparch ive heard so much about the merchant asked no offence but youre in for it kineas shrugged and swirled the second cup of excellent wine in the plain horn cup hed been offered i gather zopryon has quite an army he observed zopryon means to conquer these sakje all the scyths the merchant replied at least thats what he says in his cups darius failed xerxes failed cyrus died fighting them zopryon figures that he can get a name up there the merchant took a sip of his own wine and gave a slight smile all of them want to rival alexander he made the lords of macedon sound like foolish boys kineas was sitting on a leather stool behind the mans stall watching laertes haggle for an expensive knife at the next stall as he watched laertes face went through a series of expressions like a comic mime anger irritation puzzlement pleasure as the price dropped the merchant was watching the exchange as well that mans good at haggling one of your soldiers and an old family friend said kineas we grew up together in athens the merchant said and then paused realizing that perhaps hed said too much well thats what i heard and your accent kineas turned away to hide his smile he helped save my life at issus he said nice kind of friend the merchant said the kind of friend the gods send to a man both of them spilled wine on the ground then choosing his words carefully the merchant said that would be when you won the prize for bravery kineas nodded stupidity more like he considered the merchant for a few breaths you know too much about me the merchant looked around and shrugged i came here from tomis he said where zopryon is raising his army ah kineas replied pleased at the mans calm he was obviously a spy but in some small way an honest one zopryon has heard all about you from the veterans on his staff the hipparch of his regiment of companions phillip theyre all named phillip arent they so they are kineas agreed he knew a phillip who commanded companions the dreaded hetaerae the finest heavy cavalry in the world i gather this phillip had a woman named artemis kineas narrowed his eyes yes he said she has a very high opinion of you said the egyptian i began to wonder if this campaign is as onesided as people in thrace claim it is kineas leaned forward zopryon may be surprised by the strength of the opposition he said carefully the merchant flicked his eyes around the sakje and sindi in the crowd and then let his gaze fall heavily on kineas do tell he said kineas smiled phillip barely scraped a victory out of his fight with the scyths he said cyrus died darius ran home with his whiskers burned what does that tell you the egyptian had a furlined thracian cloak across his lap he pulled it around his shoulders you tell me he said slowly kineas leaned back im here to buy a good sword not swap gossip the merchant took his turn to shrug i have a few good swords i save for special customers he said the kind that bring me good gossip are my favourites he watched laertes paying for his purchase kineas was glad to see the man happy kineas got up and began to toy with one of the infantry short swords on the merchants table there are a lot of scyths he said he rolled his wrist letting the sword fall into an imaginary victim under its own weight too light he knew that the merchant looked bored this is something about which i have wondered much he said he poured more wine from a ewer and held it up for kineas who held out his horn cup think of it this way kineas said there are scyths here there are scyths all around the euxine scyths north of bactria and north of persia and everywhere in between the egyptian nodded just as herodotus says he got up shrugged the cloak into place on his shoulders and took a heavy rug off the twowheeled cart at the back of his stall kineas had had all winter to read herodotus it had become one of his favourite pastimes especially the part about amazons he came to olbia kineas said he knew what he was talking about the merchant nodded i expect he did he said will they fight kineas watched him unroll the rug it had four swords in its folds two were short and two were long the longest was shaped like a greek cavalry sword a true machaira the weight near the tip of the blade curved like a reversed sickle but it had a wicked point it felt curiously light in his hand almost alive the tang had a simple leather wrapping and no hilt kineas rolled it in his fist and let the point drop it bit into the table with a soft thunk beautiful he said steel the merchant said he flexed it in his hands and handed it back theres a priest in alexandria who has the knack he doesnt make many but every one of them comes out right the merchant drank wine put his cup down and rubbed his hands before blowing on them then he said ive seen other men make steel blades one in a dozen or one in a hundred this priest is the only man i know who makes them every time the blade seemed to have a dozen colours trapped just under the surface which was polished to a degree kineas had not seen before he made an overhand cut and the sword sang as it cut the air kineas realized that he had a broad smile on his face he couldnt help it how much he asked how many scyths are there the man asked again kineas rubbed his thumb on the tang thousands he said and sat back on his stool the egyptian nodded the getae tell lord zopryon that there are only a few hundred warriors the last remnant of a proud race and that he can conquer them in a summer zopryon intends to take olbia and pantecapaeum to pay for the campaign and to serve as bases and then march inland building forts as he goes i tell you nothing that is not common knowledge yes he looked intently at kineas for a reaction it wasnt common knowledge in olbia kineas tried to keep his face blank it must have been good enough because the egyptian continued but some of the older officers ask questions about the numbers of the nomads they say the old king brought ten thousand horsemen to fight phillip he gestured with his chin at the sword blade across kineas lap eight minae of silver kineas handed the sword back with regret too rich for me he said im an officer not a god he rose thanks for the wine the egyptian rose as well and bowed i could perhaps accept seven minae kineas shook his head he must be a very rich priest this fellow in alexandria two minae would break me id have to go sell my services to zopryon the merchant gave him an amused look you are the hipparch of the richest city on the euxine you plead poverty i think rather that you are some hardhearted rich man who seeks to beggar me and leave my wife and my two expensive daughters as paupers that sword is a gift of the gods to a fighting man look i didnt even bother to put a hilt on it because only a rich fool or a swordsman would want the thing the first would want a hilt i cant afford and the second would want to hilt it himself the sword was made for you make me an offer kineas found that he had picked the sword up again not his best bargaining technique i might be able to find three minae the egyptian raised his hands to heaven and then pulled them abruptly down on his head id have my slaves throw you in the mud except you are a guest he said and then he smiled and of course none of my slaves are big enough to throw you in the mud and your friend the king could have me executed he put his hands on his hips let us drop this haggling you pleased me with your tidbits about the scyth you are the first man of sense i have met in this market make me a genuine offer and i will take it kineas leaned close where he could smell the rosescented perfume on the other man and the fish sauce hed had with his lunch the sakje here will eat zopryon for dinner the egyptian narrowed his eyes and your alliance with him is firm kineas shrugged i suspect zopryon would like to know he grinned will he hear it from you amon do i look like a spy for zopryon the egyptian smiled with a sleight of hand that kineas had to admire two small scrolls were pressed into kineass cloak to cover the movement kineas nodded i might go to four minae he said the egyptian shrugged now you offer some money still not enough he pulled his cloak tighter when the assembly restores your fathers property youll be so rich you can buy every sword in the market kineas raised an eyebrow your words to zeus egyptian or do you know something i know many people the egyptian said some live in athens he made a face and pulled his cloak tighter yet by zeusamon its colder than olbia kineass eyebrows shot up you were in olbia i just missed you said the egyptian raising his voice he said perhaps i might let you keep this sword for six minae kineas was too eager to read the letters to wait and haggle over the sword blade i dont have six minae kineas said he put the horn cup down on the table and laid the sword gently on the rug i wish i did he gave the egyptian a short bow thanks for the wine any time said the merchant borrow the money kineas laughed and walked away at a table in a tented wine shop he read the two scrolls letters from athens the letters were months behind he rubbed his face and then laughed athens wanted him to stop zopryon one thing the sakje town boasted out of all proportion to its size were goldsmiths kineas walked among them with the kings companion dikarxes as well as ataelus and philokles gold was cheap here not cheap per se but cheaper than in athens and the sakje required it for every garment every ornament there were shops of craftsmen from persia and from athens and from as far afield as the etruscan peninsula north of syracuse the crowds of goldsmiths made kineas feel yet more foolish for imagining the town a secret a freedman from athens ran a shop with six men of all races working the bust of athena in his shop window and the sound of his voice moved kineas profoundly and he entered to talk and stayed to buy he presented the egyptian sword blade to be hilted purchased the day before for five minae quite a piece of iron said the athenian he made a face most of my customers want a horse or a griffon on their swords what do you fancy a hilt that balances the blade kineas said how much can you pay asked the man eyeing the blade with professional interest he put it on a scale and weighed it made notes on a wax tablet point heavy show me where you want the balance close enough he set some weights on the balance and then wrote the result drew a line on the blade with a wax stylus kineas looked around the shop parshtaevalt was admiring a gorytos cover solid gold with magnificent depictions of olympus surrounded by a score of assagatje nobles not as much as they can pay he said two minae of silver he said hed have to borrow it the sword had returned him to penury the goldsmith tilted his head i suppose i could make it from lead he said parshtaevalt leaned over listen you big man king pay for you yes yes i dont want the king to pay kineas said let me build you something as fine as the blade said the athenian smith youre the hipparch of olbia ive heard of you your credit is good with me kineas relinquished the blade with some hesitation dikarxes the kings friend pushed past philokles the shop was growing crowded with sakje nobles almost every man and woman from the council parshtaevalt growled a greeting and dikarxes replied at length ataelus translated trust you to find out all our secrets our own athenian goldsmith parshtaevalt slapped his back dikarxes spoke again and ataelus said of course the king for pay he for show favour you he ask everyone what gift to give what better gift than sword dikarxes interrupted to introduce the other nobles kaliax of the standing horse he said through ataelus and went on gaomavant of the patient wolves they are the most loyal the core of the kings army with the cruel hands of course he grinned at parshtaevalt it is a very good sign that they are already come in with most of their strength kineas clasped hands with each in turn gaomavant gave him a tight hug and spoke while slapping his back ataelus choked and eumenes translated his face red as a flame he says you are the one that srayanka fancies it is good you are so tough or she will swallow you dikarxes said a few words and the others roared and again gaomavant slapped his back ataelus wiped his eyes lord dikarxes say good for everyone if she mate you you greek and no clan suffer from the alliance if cruel hands join patient wolves blood on the grass yes cruel hands mate with king king too powerful but cruel hands cruel hands kineas asked is that srayankas clan ataelus nodded and ladys war name too cruel hands philokles patted his shoulder nice name perfect little greek wife kineas made himself laugh but for the rest of the afternoon he heard ataeluss voice in his head cruel hands mate with king kineas tried to avoid kam baqca because the woman scared him she was the personification of the dreams that troubled him and in her presence the dreams of the tree and the plain seemed more imminent almost real but on his fifth day in the city of the sakje kam baqca found him in the great hall and seized his arm in hers strong as an iron blade and walked him to a curtained alcove like a tent she threw a handful of seeds on a brazier and a cloud of heavy smoke rose around them the smoke smelled like cut grass it made him cough you dreamed the tree she said he nodded you dreamed the tree twice you touched the tree and you are paying the price but you waited for me to climb it so you are not altogether a fool kineas bit his lips there was a drug in the incense he could feel it i am a greek man he said your tree is not for me she seemed to move in the smoke like a snake coiling flowing easily from one place to another you are a baqca born she said you dream like a baqca are you ready for the tree i must take you now while i have you soon you will be gone and the maw of war will devour you it is a war i will not survive and then there will be no one to take you to the tree and without the tree you will neither survive nor win the lady she was telling him too many things too fast you will die she was beside him listen to me she held his arm in a grip of iron listen the first thing the tree shows you is the moment of your death are you ready for that kineas wasnt ready for any of it i am a greek man he said again although it sounded like a poor excuse especially as the tree itself was growing before his eyes rising from the smokedense tent straight out of the charcoal of the brazier its heavy branches just over his head and rising into the heavens above him take a branch and climb she said he reached up and took the first softbacked branch over his head threw a leg over it clumsily and pulled himself up his arms were as full of the drug as his head he found that he had closed his eyes and he opened them he was sitting on a horse in the middle of a river a shallow river with rocks under his horses feet and pink water flowing over and around the rocks the ford it was a ford was full of bodies men and horses all dead and the white water burbling over the rocks was stained with blood the froth of the water pink in the sun the river was vast not issus then some part of his mind said he lifted his head and saw the far bank and he rode towards it there were other men behind him all around him and they were singing he was astride a strange horse tall and dark and he felt the weight of strange armour he felt the power of a god he knew that feeling the feeling of a battle won he gestured and his cavalry gathered speed crossing the ford faster on the far bank a thin line of archers began to form and fire but behind them was the chaos of defeat and rout a whole army breaking into fragments a macedonian army a halfstade from the archers he raised his hands his goldhilted sword of egyptian steel like a rainbow of death in his hand he half turned to niceas it wasnt niceas but a woman the woman raised the trumpet to her lips and the call rang like a clarion and they charged the day was won it was his last thought as the arrow knocked him from the saddle into the water he was deep in the water and he had been here before and he pushed himself to his feet but the arrow dragged him down he sat alive astride a branch of the tree and it was as soft as a womans leg against his groin kam baqca spoke you have seen your death kineas was lying flat holding someones hand his death scream still raw in his throat yes he whispered he opened his eyes and found that he was holding kam baqcas hand not a bad death he thought niceas had not been beside him when he fell had philokles been there hard to tell in the chaos of a few seconds all the men at his back had worn closed helmets and most had been in coats of scale sakje armour in fact kam baqca spoke again do not dare to interpret what you have seen you may be sure of what it means and you can still be surprised you have begun to climb the tree i have climbed it all my life i gave my sex to the gods to help me climb faster you do not even believe in the climb beware of hubris what he coughed as if he still had water in his lungs his mind was clear but his body was sluggish there are no rules for greeks she replied but i think you will find it unwise to speak of it especially in a few weeks when you decide that i am a bent sheman who uses drugs to manipulate she shrugged perhaps i wrong you you and philokles i have never met nor seen in any dream greek men more open to new things kam baqca rose on her haunches and threw another herb on the fire this one redolent of pine that will clear your head and take death from your spirit she said she stood it is a week for hard news kineas the athenian here is mine for you you watch srayanka like the stallion watches the mare i tell you and i speak for the king we will not allow stallions and mares to serve in the same company because they disturb all the horses so with you you will not mate until this war is over already srayanka thinks more of you than of her duty already you fear to offend her rather than offering the king your best council she put a hand on his shoulder who cannot see that you are for each other although you share no tongue but not yet and not now kineas spoke and he couldnt hide the anguish in his voice she hasnt spoken to me in a week has she not kam baqca seemed unperturbed by his tone you are blind deaf and stupid then she gave him a small smile when you grow less stupid i ask that you have a care its a care i would like to have kineas said kam baqca reached out and touched his cheek everything everything is balanced in the blade of a sharp sword one word one act and the balance tilts kineas thought less of the balance than of the fact that he was doomed to die and soon they rode like sakje on the road home trotting for miles changing horses and moving again they had no escort this time just parshtaevalt and a second cruel hand called gavan as guides and messengers through the entire trip kineas felt the press of urgency on his shoulders the ground was hard enough zopryon could march at any time and the campaign for so long in abeyance was suddenly upon him and he felt unprepared he worried about the archons treachery and about the morale of the city about the lives of his troops and about the alliance of the sakje their numbers their quality and having foreseen his own death he struggled to understand what it meant or whether he accepted it as genuine prophecy or merely the result of the smoke the sakje used a drug of smoke for many things including recreation hed experienced it more than once now when visiting dikarxes when sitting in the great hall while the drug was cast in braziers hed smelled it in kam baqcas tent in the snow it was possible that the drug was the root of all the dreams and if the dream was real it was a twoedged sword no man wanted to know he had just sixty days to live but there was comfort too to fall at the hour of victory had at least the virtue of predicting victory of all the things he had ever wanted to discuss with philokles this the dreams the prophecy oracular powers dreams of death and of the future pressed on him every time they spoke and yet some reserve some caution about making it more real by discussing it aloud kept him from it and of course the baqca had forbidden it on the last day when the outriders had already seen the walls of olbia exchanged shouts with the sentries on the walls and relieved kineass mind of half its illogical worries by reporting all was well philokles rode up next to kineas he rode well enough now to be accounted a horseman he required larger horses than any other man and he tired them more quickly but he was tireless in the saddle kineas glanced at him with affection philokles was a big man but he was now a tower of muscle the fat he had worn when they first met was gone burned away by almost a year of constant exercise he was handsome heavily bearded and he smiled more often than had been his wont all is well in the city he asked as he rode up thats what the scouts say kineas was still smiling to himself you seem happier today philokles said kineas raised an eyebrow you have been a silent man for six days brother youre putting the troops off their feed and niceas is so worried he put me up to this you are a worrier but not usually a brooder did your amazon play you false i confess that i heard much speculation about her relations with the king kineas fidgeted with his reins which his riding horse resented the horse showed his resentment by shying at a passing bee and then kicking his rear hooves until kineas squeezed his thighs and stopped playing with the reins i have a great deal to think about kineas didnt meet his friends eye doubtless the man of the moment the warlord of the alliance philokles paused and then said may i tell you something i know about you of course you worry all the time you worry about many things some of them very profound like good and evil and some of them very practical like where well camp and some of them quite silly like the archons potential for treason its all that worrying that makes you a good commander this is not news to me my friend kineas growled why is the archons potential for treason silly philokles said if he chooses to betray the alliance you will take action you and memnon and cleitus and nicomedes if he doesnt then no action need be taken the decision to betray us is in the mind of the archon and you cannot affect it so your worry is wasted nonsense kineas said i worry at the effect his betrayal might have on the trust of the sakje and i plan for contingencies what if he does thus and such sometimes your worry touches on hubris but i have strayed from the straight road of my intention i have seen you worry since the first hour i knew you sitting on your bench in that cursed pentekonter and worrying at what the helmsmans intention might be it is your nature again this is not news to me kineas shrugged i am familiar with what happens inside my head so you are but since we left that sakje town you are closed nothing moves in your face and your eyes seldom light this is not worry this is more like fear what do you fear philokles spoke softly tell me brother a burden shared is a heart eased kineas made a motion to niceas who had allowed himself to fall behind and the hyperetes sounded the halt the column halted immediately and every man dismounted wineskins were passed and now that the heat of the sun was full in the sky men rolled their cloaks and fastened them to their saddles kineas dismounted took wine from philokles skin and stood at his horses head the horse pressed his nose into kineass hand and he scratched the geldings head i cannot he said at length the desire to speak of his dream of death was so powerful that he didnt trust himself to speak more the desire to speak of his feelings for srayanka was equally strong philokles spoke slowly we have shared our secrets you make me afraid that shall i say it that you know something from athens that threatens us all or from the king you miss the mark entirely kineas said stung if i knew some doom hanging over us dont you think id speak of it philokles stood by his own horse he took his wineskin and shook his head in one thing you and the tyrant are like brothers you would not tell us if you thought we would be better off not knowing you feel that your will is superior to that of most men no commander worth an obol shares all his thoughts with his men kineas snapped the tyrant lives in every commander philokles agreed yet you supported my views on discipline kineas said discipline is not secrecy every man in the phalanx knows that his survival depends on the actions of all no deviation can be allowed that discipline is a public thing the rules are available to all kineass heart was thudding and his breathing was fast he took a deep breath and counted to ten in sakje an exercise that was coming more and more easily you provoke me more easily than any man on earth you are not the first man to tell me that philokles replied i am not ready to discuss the thing that i fear yes you are right of course i am afraid yet and i ask you to trust me on this it is not a matter that need concern you i am afraid of death somehow just admitting the fear to himself had lightened the load philokles glanced at him sharply and then held his eye when you are ready you should talk about it i am a spy i learn things i know that you saw kam baqca i suspect she told you something he looked hard at kineas and i guess she told you some ill news kineass face must have betrayed his inner anguish because philokles raised his hand your pardon i see on your face that i am on poor ground i know you love the lady if she treats you ill im sorry kineas nodded i am not ready to discuss it yet his friends concern touched him and he had to smile confronted with the loss of a woman hed scarcely touched and his imminent death which was more important men were idiots his sisters had said as much many times and artemis had concurred philokles slung his wineskin youre smiling i have achieved something shall we ride to olbia then kineas managed another smile where the worst thing to face is the archon he waved to niceas to sound the mount order who said that war makes things simple philokles grunted someone who had never planned a war once again i confess that i have underestimated you my dear hipparch the archon beamed with satisfaction kineas was growing used to the archons abrupt swings of mood and favour instead of betraying surprise or giving an answer he merely inclined his head you have lured the bandit king to do his all in our protection and then before anyone is committed to a policy of war we are allowed to negotiate a settlement brilliant and zopryon out on the plains with bands of barbarians harrying him the archon who had been rubbing his chin now clapped his hands together hell negotiate all right hipparch i appoint you our commander i put in your hands the forces of the state please do your best to avoid using them kineas found that he was pleased despite everything to be appointed commander he had thought that on balance he would get the post memnon though older hadnt seen nearly as much fighting as he but these things were political and often unpredictable i will archon good the archon signalled his nubian slave for wine and indicated that he wanted three cups kineas glanced at memnon whose dark face was thunderous you arent pleased the archon said to memnon memnons voice was flat very pleased the archons voice was all honey you do not sound pleased are you slighted should you have had the command memnon glanced at kineas shrugged perhaps he hesitated but anger got the better of him i want to push my spear into macedon not hide behind walls and then feign submission what kind of plan is that the archon put his chin on his hand one finger pointing up along his temple towards heaven his hair was cut in the latest mode with a fringe of ringlets around the crown which accentuated the golden wreath he affected the plan of a realist memnon kineass plans greatest elegance is that the macedonians can spend all the money and do all the dying and then at the end we have a full range of political options we can if i desire it rescue poor zopryon supplies a base of operations and use him to rid us of the bandits for ever while he pronounced these words the archon glanced at kineas he had a wicked smile on his face the sort of smile a little boy wears when he knows that he does wrong kineas maintained his impassivity he was finding that the knowledge of his own death had gifted him with as much calm as fear in fact the fear was fading with acceptance he had two months to live the archons desire to manipulate and disconcert was of little moment these musings kept him silent too long and the archon snapped well hipparch why shouldnt i help zopryon kineas wrapped his left hand around the pommel of his old sword because he would seize your city at the first pretext he said carefully the archon slumped there must be a way to use him against the bandits kineas said nothing the archons desires were now of little importance to him the archon brightened we must have a ceremony he said at the temple i will vest you with the command in public kineass fingers betrayed his impatience with their rapid drumming at his pommel we must get our citizens prepared the hippeis at least must be ready to move to the camp memnon grunted i believe we can find time for a ceremony that will have important repercussions said the archon he motioned to a slave who stood behind his stool see to it all the priests perhaps some token of benevolence for the people the slave another persian spoke for the first time that will take some days to prepare archon the archons face set you havent heard zopryon executed cyrus my emissary on the pretext that as a slave he was unworthy of serving as ambassador this is amarayan kineas looked carefully at amarayan a bronzecoloured man with a rich black beard and a face that betrayed nothing we will need cooperation from pantecapaeum kineas said we will need their fleet the archon shook his head there i must disagree any action by their fleet would commit us i fear kineas sighed if the macedonian fleet is not kept in check we will not have any options at midsummer the archon tapped his fingers against his face oh very well i will ask that they bring their ships here kineas shook his head they must do more than that archon they must patrol south around the coast seek out the macedonian squadron and destroy it in addition id like you to close the port he continued to watch amarayan there are no doubt spies here i dont want them to communicate with tomis the archon spoke slowly as if humouring a child closing our port would be ruinous to trade with respect archon we are at war kineas willed his hand to stop playing with his sword if all goes well the grain can be shipped in the autumn athens will not be pleased if we hold their grain ships all summer the archon looked at amarayan who nodded none of the autumn wheat will be coming down the river anyway kineas countered the king of the sakje is holding the grain to supply his army army spat the archon bands of savages on the grass are not an army kineas remained silent memnon stifled a laugh archon you cannot pretend that all is normal zopryon is marching here with the intention of taking the city kineas added athens would rather miss a season of grain than lose us to macedon for ever amarayan leaned forward and whispered to the archon the archon nodded i will think on it he said you are dismissed you may inform our citizens to prepare themselves to take the field in five days he glanced at amarayan who nodded we will celebrate the spring festival by appointing you formally to lead the allied army perhaps after that i will close the port five days by then the three ships in port would have loaded and gone carrying whatever messages they had kineas gave a salute and withdrew in the citadels courtyard under the eyes of a dozen of the archons kelts kineas caught memnon by the shoulder there will be a battle he said memnon stopped he was armoured and held his helmet under his arm his curly black hair was cropped short and his black cloak flapped in the wind his eyes searched kineass face you plan to force one kineas shook his head i would avoid battle with zopryon if i can but the gods kineas stopped himself unsure what to reveal but he needed memnon and memnon needed to know kineas couldnt endure a summer of open hostility with the man the gods sent me a dream a very vivid dream memnon there will be a battle i have seen it memnon continued to watch him warily i am not one for gods and dreams he said you are a strange man you puzzle me he stuck his thumbs in his sash but you are not a liar i think do we win this battle kineas feared to say too much feared that by saying something he might change it i think so memnon stepped closer you dreamed of it but you only think you know the result how can this be kineas let out his breath and shook his head ask me no more i dont want to discuss it i only wanted to say that for all the archons prevarications we will fight when midsummer comes we will not submit kineas glanced over his shoulder where did the new persian come from memnon smiled briefly showing his teeth two of which were broken and then he spat on the paving stones of the courtyard cleomenes gave him to the archon a fully trained persian steward this one was born a slave he will become very dangerous memnon said flicking his eyes towards the citadel then he gave kineas a hard grin as will the archon if he finds that hes not actually at the helm kineas shrugged i think that events will take the decisions out of his hands i want a battle i dont much care how we come to it all this skirmishing on the grass is well enough for the horse boys but my lads need a flat field and a long day we wont be raiding camps kineas nodded your men are the heart of the citys citizens every week we keep them in the field is a week in which olbia has no blacksmiths and no farmers i think kineas hesitated wondering for the hundredth time how accurate his numbers were i think that you can wait a month to follow me ten days to march to the camp you should still be there twenty days ahead of zopryon memnon fingered his beard twenty days plus a ten day march thats a good amount of time enough to harden them train every day not so much that theyll be worn down he nodded what if zopryon doesnt keep your timetable kineas started to walk to the gate he didnt want all of his thoughts reported back to the archon although he doubted the kelts knew much greek he hasnt much choice an army his size horse and foot you know as well as i how slowly hell move if he bides his time then he wont get here in time to even threaten a siege if he rushes men will starve memnon walked with him out through the citadel gate and down the walls to the town your reasoning sounds excellent he laughed mirthlessly alexander would take his time coming and to hades with the consequences hed assume that he could take this city even in late autumn and that he could use it to feed his troops even if he had to put the people to the sword kineas nodded as he walked yes memnon stopped in the agora and turned to face kineas so why wont zopryon do the same kineas pursed his lips rubbed his beard perhaps he will he said perhaps thats why well fight a battle memnon shook his head you sound like a priest i have no fondness for priests dream or no dream this will be a hard campaign mark my words im an oracle of war he laughed thus speaks memnon the oracle zopryon will do something we havent considered and all your timetables will be buggered kineas was stung memnons dismissal of his calculations annoyed him but he had to admit the truth of the mans assertions perhaps he growled perhaps nothing youre a professional soldier you know it as well as i plan all you like zopryon will win or lose at the point of the spear memnon seemed to grow in size as he spoke he was passionate and all the horse boys in the world cant stop a macedonian taxeis when push comes to shove its my hoplites and those from pantecapaeum who will stand or not stand the thought seemed to delight him ill need to arrange a muster for the pantecapaeum troops meet their commander plan some drills and see if they have some iron in their bellies kineas was pleased that memnon was engaged he slapped the man on the shoulder youre a good man memnon memnon nodded hah i am they made me a citizen can you believe it i may yet die in a bed for a few moments kineas the commander had forgotten the imminence of his own mortality memnons words brought it straight back he sobered i hope you do he said bah im a spear child ares rules me if there are any gods and if any of them care an obol for men which i doubt why die in bed he chuckled waved and walked off into the market pantecapaeum was very much in kineass thoughts the next few days he sent a letter with niceas as the herald addressed to the hipparch of the city requesting that the man meet him to plan the campaign and suggesting a tentative schedule of marches he told niceas to bring him a report on the citys preparedness niceas returned the same day that the three ships sailed kineas was on the walls watching memnon drill the hoplites in opening gaps in their ranks to permit the passage of diodorus with the horse philokles came up behind him athens will be pleased to get the last of the winter wheat kineas grunted zopryon will be pleased to get a spy report from here outlining every aspect of our plans philokles yawned somebody here is two macedonian merchants came in on the last ship the pentekonter on the beach kineas sighed we are a sieve philokles laughed dont despair brother i took some precautions kineas looked out over the walls the hoplites had been too slow in opening their files and diodoruss troop was caught against the face of the phalanx dreadfully exposed in a battle that small error of marching would have meant disaster memnon and diodorus were shouting themselves hoarse kineas looked back at the spartan precautions philokles twitched the corners of his mouth i have allowed the archons new factor another perfumed mede to receive some reports that you have deceived the archon that you intend to take the army and march south with the sakje in fact he was surprised to learn that sindi farmers have been paid to prepare a battlefield along the agathes river digging trenches and preparing traps kineas raised an eyebrow philokles shrugged rumour all rumour he sneered zopryon is more likely to believe a rumour his spies gleaned in the wine shops than a plan spoken before his face it is a fault all spies share kineas wrapped his arms around the spartan well done philokles shrugged again it was nothing he was pleased by the praise however a flush crept up his cheeks the macedonian merchants theyll know better in a few weeks kineas said hmm philokles nodded too true however nicomedes and leon have them in hand that is to say perhaps it is best if i say no more kineas shook his head nicomedes philokles nodded surely having seen the ease with which he commands his troop you no longer believe in his pose as a useless fop kineas shook his head i think that i must despite his obvious skills and authority i find it difficult to take him seriously philokles nodded as if a theory had been confirmed that is why the nicomedes of this world are so successful in the long run at any rate the merchants are similarly dismissive they sit in his home eating his bread sneering at his effeminate ways and chasing his slaves and his wife the spartan looked into the distance it will be a pity when an outraged freedman kills them both kineass bark of shock caused the big man to look back at him its a rough game hipparch those men want our blood as surely as a screaming getae waving a spear kineas relaxed watching the hoplites reforming for a second try at the manoeuvre he nodded thanks more than thanks i had assumed there was nothing to be done and you have done so much philokles grinned you are unsparing with praise very unspartan but then his grin faded the two merchants will be the first two dead in this war and so it begins i know you hate war kineas said he reached out to take philokless shoulder but philokles moved away what makes you think that he asked the spring festival of apollo drew every man and woman in the city and most of the populations of the farms for stades around the walls the streets of the city were packed with people in their best clothes and it was warm enough to cast cloaks aside for men to be abroad in fine linen and for women those who chose to appear in public to look their best the full force of the hippeis now filled the hippodrome two hundred and thirty horsemen resplendent in blue and polished bronze and brilliant gold kineas could see the difference among the cloaks and armour the cloaks of the men who had gone to the sakje had already faded by some shades from the royal blue of the first cloth and their armour had deeper shades of red from long days in the rain but the appearance of the whole body was magnificent kineas felt oddly nervous at their head he was wearing his best armour mounted on his tallest charger and he knew he looked the part he couldnt explain it his skills with men came from the gods and he seldom doubted them but today he felt as if he was an actor assigned a role and the adulation of the crowds along the route to the temple increased his sense of unreality to be appointed the commander of a citys forces short of leading the army of his own athens in the field he was at the summit of any soldiers ambition his imminent death and all it would mean the loss of worldly power friends love was never far from his thoughts he found that he could spare no time for trifles that every moment mattered and that he wanted to take his forces out to the camp on the great bend as soon as possible to live his last campaign to the fullest to see srayanka even if he could not have her he thought all these things but on this day he rode to the temple of apollo like a bridegroom eager despite himself for the honour that the archon intended to bestow philokles rode at his side you have a certain vanity i find he said between plaudits from the crowd kineas waved at a group of sindi who were pointing at him most soldiers are vain dont you think he asked philokles smiled your love of finery is carefully hidden you parade your poverty and your old tattered cloak the better to show the contrast to your magnificence if you say so kineas answered i do or are you perhaps afraid to show so much finery every day for fear someone would take you for nicodemus philokles last words were almost drowned by renewed cheers he nodded to ataelus who rode forward he had a linen wrapped bundle which he passed over to philokles we swore an oath philokles said not to give this to you until the feast of apollo kineas unwrapped the linen inside the bundle was his new sword scabbarded in red leather and hilted with gold an elegant sweeping hilt decorated with a pair of flying pegasus the pommel was cast and worked like the head of a woman the first squadron had begun to sing the paean in the next quiet interval kineas said it is magnificent but i sought no gift from the king the king sent it nonetheless philokles said with a mirthless grin you might note the pommel do you see a resemblance kineas closed his hand on the hilt you are like a bluebottle fly no matter how often i swat you you just come and settle to sting again his intended severity was ruined by his broad grin he loved it it fit his hand srayanka gleamed in heavy gold from the pommel srayanka medea he sent this really philokles grinned really he shook his head stop grinning like that you might hurt your face he pulled his horse out of the column and fell back to his place kineas didnt stop grinning the king of the assagatje had sent him a message or a challenge the ceremony was long but pleasant full of music and bright colour it raised the spirits of the city and of the hippeis and the hoplites and when the archon tied the magenta sash around his breastplate kineas too felt a thrill of joy after the last procession through the town kineas took the hippeis back to the hippodrome and dismissed them with his thanks and praise and with orders to assemble in two days ready to march he listened to the sounds they made as they departed the gossip the tone of their grumbles the taunts and the teasing morale was good as if by prior arrangement the old soldiers the mercenaries who had come to the city just eight months before met in the barracks rather than go off to the torchlit races and the public feast they were all there antigonus coenus diodorus crax and sitalkes ajax niceas fresh back from pantecapaeum laertes and lykeles agis and andronicus and ataelus the last in because it was their turn to curry horses and philokles who appeared with two town slaves and a big amphora of wine the shape of the amphora revealed it to be from chios and they all applauded philokles produced a wine bowl from under a blanket and everyone else fetched cups laid pillows and cloaks on benches for couches we thought we should drink some wine together one last time before we take the field philokles said while were still your friends before we become your soldiers said niceas one hand on the owl at his neck they were all stiff at first sitalkes and crax were utterly silent except for nervous giggles as they prodded each other on their shared couch ataelus who rarely shared their revelry seemed uncomfortable on a couch and moved to the floor where he sat crosslegged philokles rose in sparta we have two customs on the eve of war one is that we sing a hymn to ares the other is that in our mess every man takes a turn at the bowl he raises his cup pours a libation to the gods and toasts every one of his comrades he grinned its a good way to get drunk very quickly then he raised his voice he had no sense of a tune but others did kineas and coenus ares exceeding in strength chariotrider goldenhelmed doughty in heart shieldbearer saviour of cities harnessed in bronze strong of arm unwearying mighty with the spear o defence of olympus father of warlike victory ally of themis stern governor of the rebellious leader of righteous men sceptred king of manliness who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven hear me helper of men giver of dauntless youth shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life and strength of war that i may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread the ways of bloodcurdling strife rather o blessed one give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death andronicus got to his feet good song he shouted too seldom do you greeks praise the lord of strife philokles shook his head we are no friends to the lord of strife but andronicus was not in a mood for argument good custom he walked straight to the bowl and dipped his cup full he sloshed a libation on the floor and raised his cup to us comrades one by one he said their names raised his cup and drank until he came to kineas to you hipparch he said and drained his cup one by one they did it lykeles made jokes about each of them philokles imitated their voices as he toasted them agis spoke well and laertes had a compliment for every man sitalkes drank in silence meeting each mans eye in turn and drinking to him until he got to kineas to him he raised his cup i was getae he said now i am yours he drank and the others cheered and stamped their feet as they had not for laertes pretty rhetoric crax took his stand at the bowl with a belligerent stare when we fight i will kill more than any of you he said and drank ajax took the cup and wept then he wiped his eyes every man here has my love you are the comrades i dreamed of as a child when i lay on my fathers arm and he read to me how achilles sulked in his tent how diomedes led the army of the hellenes and all the other stories of the war with troy ataelus insisted on having pure wine in his cup he stood by the bowl for some time finally he said my greek is better so i am not for fear speaking to you all you like good clan you take me from city give horse give honour he raised his cup too much talktalk to toast every one i toast all akinje craje the flying horse clan what the sakje call you good name he drank then he dipped and drank again and again saluting each one in turn in unwatered wine he walked back to his place on the floor without a tremor and sat with the same grace as all the sakje last was kineas he waved to philokles the acting host by all the gods put some water in it or i wont live to reach the camp he stood by the bowl he found that he had a smile across his face so firm that he couldnt crack it even to speak he was silent as silent at sitalkes or ataelus had been then he raised his cup on the tips of his fingers and tipped it to spill a libation the gods honour those who strive the hardest he said i doubt any group of men have worked harder in the last six months than you i ask that the gods take notice we came here as strangers and have been made citizens we came here as mercenaries now i think most of us go to fight for our city as men of virtue do he looked around like ajax i love every one of you and like ataelus i know you for my own clan for myself i swear by the gods to do my best to bring you back safe but i also say this we go to a hard campaign he looked around if we fall let us do it so that some olbian poet will sing of us the way the spartans sing of leonidas or the way every hellene sings of peleass son they cheered him even hardeyed niceas he drank to them they raised their cups with a roar much later a very drunk kineas slapped philokles shoulder youre a good man he said philokles smiled i cant hear you say that too often im for bed ill have a head like an anvil come the dawn kineas stood unsteadily crax was retching outside the barracks main door he sounded like a man on the edge of death philokles pushed himself to his feet i think youll find that dawn is close he said its good to see you happy kineas hung on to the doorframe as he passed it im happy enough brother better to die happy than he managed to shut his mouth die said philokles he sounded more sober who said anything about death kineas waved his hands unsteadily nothing shouldnt have said anything of the sort my mouth runs away with me when im drunk like a diarrhoea of words philokles grabbed him and spun him around he rested his forehead against kineas which steadied them both he put a hand behind kineass neck like a wrestler going for a hold die happy you said wheres that come from nowhere just a phrase donkey shit piles of it philokles sounded harsh kineas rolled his eyes he couldnt remember why he had to hide all this from the spartan anyway gonna die he said in the battle philokles ground his forehead against kineas it hurt says who dream kam baqca tree saying it aloud made it seem a little silly philokles pushed him away and started laughing ares swelling member you poor bastard kam baqca thinks she is going to die in this battle shes just spreading the misery kineas shrugged maybe knows a lot philokles nodded so she does so walk away board a ship go to sparta kineas shook his head the myths of his youth were full of men who fled fate to die foolishly achilles choice he said philokles shook his head angrily youre too old for that shit you arent achilles the gods dont whisper in your ear kineas sat on a table hed made it to his room he kicked off his sandals bed he said and fell on his he was asleep before philokles could muster an argument kineas was the last man of the hippeis to reach the camp at great bend he sent the squadrons off one each day while he continued to wrangle with the hipparch of pantecapaeum and wrote detailed orders for the city allies leucon took the elite first troop on the day after the festival they were ready still hard from the visit to the sakje and eager for it kineas sent niceas to keep an eye on them and to make sure that their camp was well sited and well built on the second day when diodoruss squadron was clear of the gates six light triremes arrived from their fellow city the first concrete sign that the assembly of pantecapaeum intended to honour its pledge kineas went down to see them and to discuss strategy with their navarch demostrate a short fat man with a nose like a pig despite his looks ugly as hephaestes he was cheerful even comic and his ships were in good order from the lustiness of their rowers citizens all to their sails painted with a seated athena twice as tall as a man floating over the blackhulled ships like banners to the goddess demostrate immediately agreed to hunt down the macedonian triremes hell get more as the summer wears on mark my words said the fat man id just as soon wreck those hes got as soon as they come under my hand go with the gods kineas said the tides on the make i wont hold you good to meet a general who knows the sea is it true youre a citizen will you stay youve become quite the famous figure in pantecapaeum kineas shrugged i think im here to stay he said thats good to hear hard to trust a mercenary no offence intended kineas stood up on the oar rail and leaped to the wharf send me word if you have an action demostrate waved ive played this game before i can get three more hulls in the water by midsummer if i get them and ive cleared his squadron i may just cruise the bosporus he leered my lads would love to take a few merchant men kineas turned to nicomedes who had accompanied him down to make an introduction he looks more like a pirate than a merchant nicomedes laughed he was a pirate pantecapaeum made him navarch to stop his predatory ways he laughed kineas realized that he had been expected to know as much that the fat man had been making fun of both of them with his comment about mercenaries i assume hes as competent as he appears nicomedes nodded hes a terror he used to prey on my ships howd you stop him kineas asked nicomedes made a moue and winked it would be indelicate to relate he said then his voice changed all business im off with my squadron tomorrow i want to voice a concern a real concern come to my house kineas followed him up the hill from the port nicomedes was an important man and walking to his house involved running a gauntlet of requests factors beggars of various degrees and stations it took an hour he could ill spare once seated in a room full of beautiful if salacious mosaic and marble kineas lay on a couch with a cup of excellent wine he kept his patience nicomedes was not just one of his officers but next to the archon and perhaps cleitus the citys most powerful man probably as rich as any man in athens whats on your mind kineas asked nicomedes was admiring the goldwork on kineass sword this is superb youll pardon me if i say i had not expected to envy you the ownership of an object although i had heard of the wonders of the blade nicomedes shrugged made a wry face swords dont move me much i like one thats sharp and stays in my hand but the hilt masterwork from athens kineas shook his head an athenian master living with the sakje the style like great athenian work but all these outre animals and the medusa or is that medea kineas smiled i suspect it to be medea medea she killed her children didnt she nicomedes raised an eyebrow that face i can imagine her killing a few children beautiful but fierce why medea kineas shook his head private joke i think whats on your mind he asked again nicomedes continued to admire the sword then he straightened cleomenes has reappeared he said zeus lord of all kineas swore heraclea worse tomis hes gone over to the macedonians i found out this morning the archon wont know yet kineas rubbed his jaw cleomenes for all his party enmity knew all of their plans every nuance hed attended every meeting of the citys magnates he was after all one of the leading men that could be a heavy blow he said nicomedes nodded i respect your command but you are sending every leader in the assembly out of the city there will be no one left with the balls to contest the archon or cleomenes if he comes here and he will kineas rubbed his beard and made a face he took a deep breath and then said youre right he could murder some of the popular leaders among the people and close the gates nicomedes drank his wine the archon has spent five years improving the defences id hate to try and take this place kineas shook his head wed have it in our hands in three days nicomedes looked surprised not an expression his smooth features often wore how kineas raised an eyebrow to indicate that he wanted nicomedes to guess treason asked nicomedes but as soon as he said it he laughed of course were the army all our people are in the city kineas nodded i like to think of it as an exercise in military democracy wellgoverned cities can stand a siege for ever unless they are unlucky but an unpopular government will only last until someone opens a gate not usually a long wait tyrannies kineas smiled a wolfish smile they fall easily nicomedes leaned forward on his couch by the gods you are tempting him kineas shook his head i dont play those games i need the soldiers in the field if for no other reason to show the sakje that we are with them but if the archon is tempted to be foolish and he acts kineas shrugged i am not responsible for the evil actions of other men my tutor taught me that nicomedes nodded his eyes alight but then he shook his head he could still damage our property he might attack families he might even hand the citadel to macedon if he thought it was his only hope of survival kineas nodded i believe that he is a rational man despite his burst of temper you think worse of him he is more stable with you and memnon than he was last year i fear that when you are gone i fear many things kineas rubbed his beard what do you want me to do leave my squadron here nicomedes shrugged i can watch the archon and i can deal with cleomenes his voice hardened kineas shook his head ah nicomedes you have worked yourself too hard yours is the best of the four squadrons on the day of battle i need you nicomedes shrugged i thought youd say that very well then leave cleitus here kineas rubbed his cheeks thoughtfully the older men the worst riders but on the best horses and with the best equipment nicomedes leaned across the space between the couches handing kineas back his sword hilt first most of them are old for a real campaign but young enough to wear armour and stare down a tyrant you and cleitus are rivals kineas said carefully nicomedes got up from his couch and walked to the table where a dozen scrolls were open not in this id rather it was me cleitus has a lingering respect for the archon and hes clay in cleomeness hands but hell hold the line all the more reason for it to be him the archon remains my employer he is autocratic but as far as i can tell he has acted within the laws of the city you empowered him hes your monster kineas rubbed his beard and i fear that you and cleomenes that its too personal nicomedes looked bitter it is ill kill him when i can kineas stood up when the athenian assembly voted for war with macedon many were against it and some of them lie dead at chaeronea thats democracy nicomedes came and walked kineas to his door youll do it though leave cleituss squadron kineas nodded sharply yes nicomedes smiled and kineas wondered if hed just been outmanoeuvred good it would kill ajax to stay and ive never seen war on land it looks very safe compared to war at sea kineas didnt know whether this was humour or not it was always hard to tell with nicomedes so he clasped the mans hand in his doorway amidst a crowd of hangerson and went back to the barracks the third day nicomedes squadron rode forth with more baggage and more slaves then the other two combined but his squadron had the best discipline of the four kineas watched them go with a heavy heart he wanted to go but he had to finish his work with the allies philokles memnon and cleitus stood with him until the last spare horse and the last mule cart passed through the gates memnon continued to appear a foot taller he turned to kineas and saluted without a trace of sarcasm and said ill just take my lads out for an hour with your permission kineas returned his salute hand on chest memnon you do not need my permission to drill the hoplites memnon grinned i know that god help you if you thought otherwise he pointed at the waiting men formed in long files in the streets of the town but its a good game for them philokles agreed those who obey will be obeyed he said memnon pointed at him right just what i mean socrates philokles shook his head lykeurgos of sparta memnon walked off still laughing memnon found much to admire in the hoplites of pantecapeum their phalanx he accounted very good and their elite young men two hundred athletes in top shape the epilektoi made him grin of course their officers are a bunch of pompous twits he said through his snaggle teeth the hipparch of pantecapaeum was about the same he was a tall thin very young man with a dour face and a large forehead usually a sign of immense intelligence my troops will remain exclusively under my command he said you may communicate your orders to me and if i feel that they are appropriate i will pass them to my men we are gentlemen not mercenaries i have heard a great many things about you that you force the gentlemen of olbia to curry their own horses for instance none of that foolishness will apply to my men kineas had expected as much from their exchange of letters i will discuss all of these points with you of course in the meantime may i inspect your men the allied hipparch heron gave a thin smile if you wish to view them you may only i inspect them only i speak to them i hope ive made myself clear kineas knew him instantly a man for whom intelligence replaced sense and whose fear of failure made him distant and arrogant all too common in small armies kineas had known from the first how lucky he was with nicomedes and cleitus and heron was the proof kineas nodded his mind was refreshingly clear of anger and long years with the arrogance of macedonian officers had accustomed him to this sort of thing instead of a reaction he turned his horse and began to walk it down the front rank of the hippeis of pantecapaeum the hippeis of pantecapaeum were fifty years out of date in their equipment like the hoplites of olbia they were wearing equipment that their grandfathers would have used light linen armour or no armour small horses light javelins most of the riders were overweight and at least a dozen were sitting back on their horses haunches what athenians called chair seat a posture that was easier on untrained riders but hard on the horse kineas noted that they had no cloaks at their saddlecloths and that the squadron just seventy men had a surprising mix of horses he smiled because he suspected that if he had seen the hippeis of olbia a year ago the few who turned out might have looked like this he reined up and turned to heron well train you youll have to work on your equipment ill treat you as one of my troop commanders for as long as you deserve it he rode up close to the man ive seen years and years of mounted warfare and this is going to be a hard campaign obey me and youll keep most of your men alive go your own way and you are of no use to me heron stared to the front for a few seconds i will consult with my men he said stiffly kineas nodded be quick then kineas sent a slave for cleitus and spent an ugly half hour on the sand with an angry troop of allied horsemen he gave them orders and they were sullen or simply ignorant their hyperetes dion seemed willing enough heron retreated first to the far edge of the sand and then to the gate cleitus appeared at the head of his squadron it being an appointed drill day for the cavalry left in the city they filed into the hippodrome making it look empty compared to full muster days but the fifty of them made a superb contrast to the men of pantecapaeum thank the gods kineas said he was somewhere between frustration and rage he had niceas to do this kind of work and always had kineas pointed at the allied horse can you train them for me two weeks surely you can train them faster and better in camp cleitus looked around wheres heron did you kill him no hes brave enough just pigignorant cleitus shook his head hes the son of an old rival of mine he grew up soft too soft kineas shrugged so did i listen they need armour and they need the same big geldings we have you can do all that here i cant ill get them remounts at the camp but the armour has to come from here cleitus scratched his chin whos paying kineas grinned let me guess the thin kid heron is rich cleitus laughed rich as croseus kineas shook his head i wish all my problems had such easy answers tell him ill keep him as hipparch even apologize if he pays otherwise send him home and pick a new one dias looks competent cleitus nodded dion dias is the trumpeter he is hes just dishonest he waved to his friend petrocolus who trotted up looking a decade younger whats up cleitus pointed at the men of pantecapaeum i knew we were getting off too easily when we were left as the garrison now we get to train them petrocolus eyed them with the disdain of the veteran for the amateur the sight made kineas smile ill do my best he said kineas saw the archon one more time before he left the archon refused to be serious mocking macedon and kineas by turns he was drunk he accused kineas of wanting to take the city and made him swear hed defend it and then he demanded kineass oath that he would not try to overthrow him kineas swore and was eventually dismissed you can be so naive philokles said when he heard the whole story they were finally riding out just the two of them with ataelus for a scout he was pitiful kineas said philokles shook his head note how he put you on the defensive he made you swear a vow he swore none kineas rode in silence for a stade then he shook his head youre right i am philokles said he grinned nevertheless you cant have hurt things perhaps you purchased a few more weeks of trust my people in the citadel say that he fears an assassin persian courts are full of them kineas rode in silence again and then said i fear the archon and i fear for him hes useless and selfdestructive and he will betray us are you ready for it philokles asked well have the army lets beat zopryon worry about the archon later wasnt that your advice kineas drank some water he looked out at the sea of grass somewhere around the curve of the euxine zopryon was coming forty to fifty days away imagine every day that he kept zopryon at bay was another day of life it was almost funny does medea know philokles asked what asked kineas startled out of his reverie the lady srayanka we call her medea does she know about your dream kineas shook his head i thought it was you lot you got the goldsmith to take her as a model philokles grinned ill never tell bastards the lot of you no she doesnt know at least from me kineas watched the horizon he ached to ride to her day and night until he got to the camp good mature behaviour from a commander he reached out a hand for the water skin and said kam baqca and the king have forbidden us to be together philokles turned his head away obviously embarrassed i know you know kineas spluttered on his water it was discussed philokles said he made a series of fidgets and motions indicating extreme embarrassment i was consulted ares and aphrodite kineas said philokles hung his head you had eyes for no one else philokles looked out over the plain she refused to speak to you the king is mad with love for her the three of you he sighed the three of you threaten the whole war with your lovesickness with the clear head of a man who had forty days to live kineas did not succumb to rage you may be right philokles glanced at him searched for signs of anger you see that i suppose solon had a rhyme i dont remember it but it was about a man who thought that he was right and every other citizen in the city was wrong kineas gave a fleeting smile you niceas kam baqca i doubt that you are all wrong his smile brightened even now i consider touching my heels to this horse and riding hard to her camp just a stade back i was thinking of it philokles grinned her barbs sunk deep i can see why shes more like a spartan woman than any barbarian ive ever seen he took the water back is it eros or agape have you lain with her you are like some pimply boyhood friend asking after my first conquest no im a philosopher studying my current subject the girl in the golden sandals has indeed smacked me with the big fat grape of love kineas said quoting a popular song from the athens of his youth when exactly can two cavalry commanders find private time to make love he rubbed the hilt of his new sword with his left hand philokles smiled he looked away spartans manage such things pretty well on campaign even spartiates bah youre all men you just pick your cloak mate kineas raised an eyebrow the spartan answered it is your amazon a woman i mean besides the anatomy shes no more a woman than kam baqca is a man kineas felt his face grow hot i think she is he said going to settle her down in the top floor of your house and raise babies philokles said from what ive seen of sakje women i understand medea all the better bred to freedom life as a woman in thebes would be slavery cruel hands you know why they call her that clan name said kineas in her case she used to take heads from her kills without a mercy blow philokles slung his water skin im not against her i just want you to see that she will never be a wife a greek wife do i want a greek wife kineas said perhaps not philokles said but if you change your mind she will be a fearsome foe medea indeed kineas turned away waved to ataelus and choked somewhere between laughter and tears luckily he said finally ill be dead his first sight of the allied camp made him stop his horse and stare across the river as far as he could see from the low hill to the north of the ford in a great curve away to the south there were herds of horses he did as his tutor had taught him he took a deep breath kneed his own horse forward and divided the vast expanse into a grid of manageable squares he estimated the size of one square and began to count the animals in it arrived at a reasonable answer and multiplied by his approximate number of squares adding the columns as he moved until his horse was splashing across the ford and he was shaking his head at the impossibility of the figure hed calculated ataelus lead them to the kings wagon the kings household his personal clan had their camp on the hilltop north of the ford with fifty heavy wagons parked in a circle like a wooden fort the kings wagon was in the centre at the base of the hill herds of horses flocks of goats and dozens of oxen milled in promiscuous confusion kineas greeted marthax who stood within a ring of other nobles the raid kineas called out in sakje marthax waddled over with the rolling gait of a man who scarcely ever walked when he could ride he spoke rapidly too rapidly for kineas to follow although by now his sakje was sufficient to register the raids success ferry destroyed ataelus said all boats burned and town for burning no horse lost kineas winced despite the ill treatment of his column at antiphilous the summer before he hadnt expected the whole town to be sacrificed to the war marthax grinned he said something and all kineas caught was a phrase about baby shit ataelus said lord say i burned towns when you were baby kineas frowned at what he suspected the man had actually said and marthax grinned back behind him philokles grunted the tyrant rears his head he said kineas looked back at him as he dismounted tyrant the spartan also dismounted and rubbed his thighs havent i said it a dozen times war is the ultimate tyrant and every concession you make him leads only to further demands how many died at antiphilous kineas sighed thats war philokles nodded yes it is and this is just the beginning kineas made the king laugh when he asked if the full muster was present a tenth of my strength at most i too have my stronger and my weaker chiefs my olbia and my pantecapaeum if you like kineas waved at the plain below the hill i counted ten thousand horses satrax nodded at least those are the royal herds i am not the greatest of the sakje kings but neither am i the least they are also the herds of the standing horse patient wolves and man under tree clans he gazed out over the plain by midsummer we will have eaten the grass from here to the water gods shrine upriver and we will have to move he shrugged but the grain is starting to come kineas shook his head so many horses kineas said the king a poor sakje a man with no skills at the hunt and no reputation in battle owns four horses a poor woman has the same a man with less than four horses isnt welcome with his clan because he cant keep up with the hunt or the treks every man and every woman has at least four most have ten a rich warrior has a hundred horses a king has a thousand horses kineas who owned four horses himself whistled the king turned to ataelus and you how many horses have you ataelus spoke with obvious pride i have six horses with me and two more in the stables of olbia i will take more from macedon and then i will have a wife satrax turned to kineas when you met him he had no horses am i right kineas smiled at ataelus i take your point the king said you are a good chief to him he has horses now greedy chiefs keep spoils for themselves good ones make sure every man has his due kineas nodded it is the same with us you know the iliad ive heard it an odd story i was never sure who i was supposed to like achilles struck me as a monster but i take your point the whole story is about unfair division of spoils kineas who had been taught from childhood to see in achilles the embodiment of every manly virtue had to choke back an exposition on achilles the king could be very greek despite his trousers and his hoodlike hats but then in flawless greek he would render an opinion that showed just how alien he was the king saw his confusion and laughed i know you worship him but you greeks spend a lot of time being angry so perhaps achilles is your model why so much anger now come and tell me what your archon is going to do he was all compliance my lord the hoplites will march with the new moon diodorus will have explained about the troop of horse left behind he did indeed he also chose your camp go to it and we will talk later war had made the king more autocratic kineas noted that he had a larger court and that he had more men and more women in attendance he wondered what that might portend diodorus met him with a hug and a cup of wine i hope you like our camp he said he had taken the spur of ground immediately south of the kings camp a spur that pushed out into the deeper water north of the ford as a rocky peninsula the tents of the olbians were arranged in a neat square with a line for the horses and another line for fires and beyond the fires a line of pits latrines it was straight from one of the manuals like a mathematics exercise transformed into hard reality to the north of the hill he pointed out another square a stade on a side marked with heavy pegs and almost clear of sakje animals for the hoplites when they arrive well done kineas said he walked among the fires greeting men he knew clasping hands and basking in their joy at seeing him at the centre of the camp stood a wagon the king presented it to you diodorus said the wagon was painted blue from its wheels to the heavy boards of the sides the felt tent that covered the roof was a dark blue and the yokes for four oxen were blue steps led from the ground to the back flap of the felt cover kineas handed his horse to a slave and leaned in the box was small just a little wider than the height of a man and twice as long inside was a bed set into the wagons wall and protected by hangings felt figured with deer and horses and griffons and a low table the floor was thick with sakje rugs and cushions i took the liberty of testing the bed for a few nights diodorus said he grinned just to make sure it worked and it does it makes you want to stay in it by the gods kineas i am glad you are here if ever i thought i could do your job i was mistaken a thousand crises a day he was interrupted by eumenes who clasped kineas by the hand and then turned to diodorus we were told there would be grain for the chargers today where will we get that diodorus pointed at kineas with both hands welcome to great bend hipparch he said you are in command he mimed lifting a great weight off his back and placing it on kineas eumenes philokles and ataelus all laughed kineas smiled at all of them diodorus where is this grain dole no idea he replied go find out kineas said with the same smile diodorus shook his head why didnt i think of that kineass first week in the camp at great bend was a constant exercise in humility his men trained to near perfection by a hard winter and now being carefully tempered in the camp were as good as any greek cavalry hed ever seen the sakje were an order of magnitude better kineas had seen the sakje in sport and contest riding over the grass racing shooting for pleasure but he had never seen a hundred warriors lying in the grass with their ponies lying beside them invisible in a fold of the ground until their chief blew a bone whistle and before the shriek died away on the air every man rolled his pony upright and was mounted it was one of a hundred tricks they had that used their godlike riding skills and kineas understood exactly why the earliest poets had thought them to be centaurs on the second day srayanka and a dozen of her warriors returned from a hunt she eyed him coolly and challenged him to shoot a course with her javelin against javelin i have practised she said in greek he rode almost as well as he had in the first contest landing five of six javelins in the shields the last one a hands breadth too high srayanka raced through the shields faster and missed none her eyes sparkled when she slid off her mare so she said i practised five years to throw that well he thought but he mastered his disappointment and praised her she smiled up at him loser give winner gift she said kineas went to his wagon and emerged with his first sword the plunder of ectabana the blade long since repaired he handed it to her ataelus spoke and srayanka replied they shot back and forth several times as she turned the weapon in her hands you give gift like chief she said in greek like king i dream of you kineax and i of you i carry your gift kineas said and her eyes strayed to his whip good she said she waved her whip at her companions and they mounted and raced off across the grass hooting and shouting nice little wife philokles said why didnt i ever think of using swords as courtship gifts nicomedes asked the air dont you people have work to do kineas asked the black horse clan came into the camp on the fourth day a thousand warriors and another eight thousand animals they arrived in full panoply and kineas had his first sight of sakje nobles dressed for war the first hundred riders the chiefs companions wore scale armour from shoulder to knee heavy coats of leather with bronze and iron scales attached like the scales on a fish or like tiles on a roof the richest men on the biggest horses had the same armour on the chests of their horses as well as fullface greek helmets with enormous plumes and every man of the chiefs companions rode a black horse they were magnificent and as well armoured and mounted as the cream of a persian host they each carried a bow in a gorytos and a heavy lance as well as a brace of javelins niceas watching at kineass side said bitterly what in hades do they need us for srayanka was impatient for the rest of her cruel hands to ride in from her pastureland to the west they were late and she was losing prestige every day they delayed her retinue said as much and so did ataelus they came on the sixth day after kineass arrival they did not make much of a show the herds were as large as any other tribe but the warriors looked tired and a convoy of travois carrying wounded men and women led the herds she was gone among her people for an hour and then the king summoned all the chiefs to meet in his laager zopryon has sent the getae to burn the sindi srayanka said my people were hard pressed to hold them and my tanist chose to come to the rendezvous rather than fight alone the king nodded grimly kairax is a good man but your people are tired and you have many wounded srayanka frowned we can ride back tonight she said marthax shook his head if your people had been on time for the muster wed never have known he said as it is your people took the brunt of the raid and your farmers are paying in blood and fire but were warned eumenes translated as fast as marthax could speak kineas after a week in camp and more dreams of talking trees understood marthax before the translation was done the armys language barrier was falling slowly we must strike back srayanka said all of the sakje were with her even the king kineas let them talk and then cut in zopryon is using the getae to test your strength and to see if hes lucky or you are foolish if he can scare you into breaking up your army to protect your farmers fucking getae ataelus said a phrase that never needed to be translated fucking getae indeed kineas said he ignored srayankas glare they know where to find your farmers they know just how to hurt you yes and if zopryon sent them theyll raid in a wide arc across the north probably the whole of their strength right to the walls of your town how many of your chiefs will stay home to fight them rather than march through them to the muster and zopryon wont have to feed them while they cover his army against your raids kineas paused its a good strategy privately kineas knew it was the strategy of a man who was fully informed of the sakje plan by cleomenes his stomach bubbled satrax rubbed his temples why didnt we foresee this he asked kam baqca she shook her head as you know more is hidden than is revealed very well said the king what do we do marthax and srayanka spoke together both said the same thing fight you disagree the king said to kineas kineas stood silent a moment gathering his thoughts kam baqcas sentence lingered in his head and his idea was born from it i agree he said lets fight he took a deep breath if we are swift and decisive the result will allow us to return to our original plan with an advantage zopryon has been bold but he may also have made an error he spoke rapidly outlining his plan mmm said marthax he like for plan said ataelus kineass plan carried the day but he didnt like the kings hesitation or his frequent exchanges with srayanka and over the next dozen days he had many opportunities to ponder what those exchanges might have meant part iv the battle haze footmen were ever slaying footmen as they fled perforce and horsemen slew horsemen and from beneath them rose from the plain the battle haze which the thundering hooves of horses stirred up and they wrought havoc with the bronze iliad book chargers kineas shouted cantering down the slope he had just ascended his trio of cruel hand scouts remained on the bluff looking down on a village of six log houses four of which were aflame the last two were still holding out kineas hadnt needed his scouts to find the getae this was srayankas land eight hundred stades north and west of the great bend camp and the getae were putting it to the torch moving slowly east their progress marked by the funeral pyres of a hundred villages as soon as kineas called his column began changing horses most of the men were already wearing armour they had been close to the enemy for two days riding carefully to avoid detection kineas pulled up with niceas leucon and nicomedes at the head of the column he held his palm flat and spoke rapidly a clear picture of the town the river and the surrounding terrain clear in his mind leucon take your troop south around the bluff and ride like the pegasus get in east of the town and then cut north he illustrated this with his right finger drawing on his palm heres the village heres our bluff my thumb marks the river see it he indicated on his hand where leucon would go you close off their retreat we smash into their main body let a handful flee away north understand leucon this will depend on you leucon closed his eyes ii think so he was hesitant and he didnt understand kineas spared a moment for a new commanders fear he knew them all intimately ill get lost i dont know the country i wont be able to find the village ill be too slow kineas leaned forward ride up to the summit dismount where the sakje horses are and take a quick look nicomedes go with him quickly and dont let yourself be seen go they seemed to take for ever when he had been atop the bluff he had seen a woman being raped in the street leucons inexperience would cost that woman her life kineas sacrificed her a woman he had never met so that his officers would know their roles which might save lives zeus they take their time he muttered niceas refused to answer knowing this mood of old and busied himself checking the column kineas decided to join him he rode along the ranks most of the troopers looked nervous let your horse do the work he heard niceas saying to a group of leucons young men no different from a hunt place your javelin and ride on kineas said to the men behind eumenes even eumenes looked pale nicomedes and leucon came down the hill at a rush kineas met them at the head of the column you see it he asked leucon was paler than eumenes i think so south around the bluff here and then along the river bank under what cover i can find and then hard back into the town to cut their retreat and break their resistance kineas put a hand on the young mans shoulder you have it well enough he wanted to get on with it but he took the time to say this may not work there may be an irrigation ditch or something that blocks your movement perhaps the getae have scouts down that way he shrugged despite the weight of his armour from this moment take it as it comes to you youll be fine if his words had any good effect kineas couldnt see it leucon looked almost paralysed on your way leucon kineas said crisply leucon saluted arm across his chest and waved to eumenes the first troop moved out at the trot and nicomedes older troop watched them go calling encouragement sometimes fathers encouraging sons first action kineas said he had his own nerves they aint bad for rich boys niceas said he was picking his teeth with a tough grass stem they needed a speech something about the gods and their city no they didnt kineas said he put his horse to the slope and niceas followed him with nicomedes just behind hold the horses he said to niceas he and nicomedes crawled on their bellies the last few feet to the summit the sakje had pulled branches from weedy bushes to cover their hide from the bluff kineas could see ten stades in every direction the getae had been fools not to put a sentry here but they really were barbarians and they thought they were at liberty to loot in an undefended land to the south leucons column was now in a file of twos a blue and gold caterpillar crawling across a narrow ditch nonetheless he was making good progress kineass own tensions shot up as he realized how close his timing would have to be the getae in the village street were preparing to rush the last house five houses had their roofs afire the body of the woman lay naked and unmoving in the street there were two hundred getae give or take a dozen most were gathered thick around the town looting the houses or preparing to take the last one a few were straggling to the north chasing some goats and a dozen more to the south fuck kineas said he leaped to his feet and ran for his horse nicomedes hard on his heels theyre going to see leucon any second we have to go nicomedes looked at him without comprehension but he followed leaping on to his horses back like a professional niceas got up and raised an eyebrow kineas got to the head of the column and waved to the right column until we round the bluff well form line as soon as were in the fields right through the town kill anyone in your path and keep the line straight even if you have to go around buildings this wont be like drill and gentlemen if all else fails kill every getae to come under your hand theyre the ones with tattoos no one laughed veterans would have laughed walk kineas called niceass trumpet was out but silent surprise was still possible nicomedes said i dont understand kineas turned on his mount trot he shouted to nicomedes he said theres getae south of the village theyll spot leucon and call their friends the whole fight will now happen down by the river and if were not quick a lot of young men will die nicomedes shook his head you see this kineas had lived his whole life as a soldier largely unable to communicate just how clearly he could read a battlefield yes he said the head of the column rounded the flank of the bluff and the village was immediately visible form line kineas called now a winters training told despite their fears they responded crisply enough to the orders and even the corner of a boundary hedge that blocked the last formation of the line didnt slow them the end files fell back and the line advanced in good order ajax collect the last four files and keep them as a reserve follow the main charge kineas waved at them and ajax turned out of the line at a gallop kineas took a javelin in his free hand and raised it so that inexperienced troopers could see that it was time to ready themselves nicomedes had his in hand his face was set and he looked old they still havent seen us kineas said that wont last and i want to get their minds off leucon nicomedes shrugged you are commanding my troop he said without bitterness im a trooper command me kineas felt vaguely guilty that he had seized command but he wanted this to go well the future morale and quality of the whole would depend on this one action victory would build confidence defeat would shatter it at the edge of town a man in a red cloak rode into view turned and shouted a stade to go shouldnt we charge nicomedes asked shouting to be heard still too far said niceas it all looks closer than it is the first few times he said kineas farted and his hands began to shake red cloak was pointing urgently and men were joining him kineas had time to wonder how a man fated to die at a different river weeks from now could be so afraid and then he forced himself to turn his head glanced north and south and assured himself that he was not riding into the jaws of a trap now he said to niceas niceass trumpet came up catching the sun in a blinding dazzle as he settled it to his lips and the long call began nicomedes sang come apollo now if ever let us now thy glory see now lord of light we pray thee give thy servants victory by the third word the troop vented their fear in song and the paean rose to the heavens like the smoke of the vanquished towns and their hooves pounded the earth like a tide of vengeance flowing from the east kineas leaned low over the neck of his grey stallion and dug in his heels for a final burst of speed throwing his javelin sidearmed into red cloak his throw was high and the point took the man in the mouth his head seemed to cave in and kineas was past him whirling his heavy javelin like a scythe seeking only to widen the hole he had made but niceas had killed his man and suddenly they were in the streets of the village the handful of dismounted getae died against the log walls or pinned to the mud of the street or trampled to death by a hundred hooves and then the line burst out of the village to the south nicomedes had led the right of the line around the town and they were in good order to the north there was chaos a fight around a barn and a tangle of hedge and no officer ajax kineas called sort that out he waved his sword at the melee at the barn where was his good javelin why was his sword out with half the men he started down the slope towards the river where he could hear sounds of fighting line he shouted he didnt slow down his canter and they came on like veterans galloping up to take their places in the line despite the many men missing his horse was tired almost blown and the other horses would be worse too late for that he pointed his line as best he could at where he imagined the fight to be just past the crest of the low ridge that lined the river waited a few strides of his stallion to let the line adjust and raised his sword niceas put the trumpet to his lips and the call rang out and then they were over the rise straight into the rear of the getae not a line but a series of knots of men facing leucons outnumbered line kineas had no javelin he rode straight into one of the knots cutting with his egyptian blade his horse reared shying from a corpse and then struck with his hooves a blow on his back plate and a line of fire along the top of his bridle arm he cut back on instinct and felt the blade hit home his eyes only seeing the target after the sword had fully severed the mans hand above the wrist kineass horse danced again and kineas cut back with the whole weight of his arm and severed the mans head so that it rose a few inches and then fell blood fountaining from the stump of the arm and neck and the trunk slipping from a now terrified horse kineas reined his stallion in a tight circle looking for a new opponent he saw eumenes locked in a grapple with a getae warrior and even as he watched the two fell from their horses eumenes landed on top and his opponent had the wind crushed out of him and eumenes fevered hands found a rock and smashed the mans head a few strides away nicomedes killed carefully fastidiously like a cat his javelin licking out into mens faces and necks in fact he fought like a hoplite mounted on a horse kineas had never seen a javelin used that way like a sixfoot sword just beyond the last knot of barbarians still fighting kineas found leucon clear of the melee restraining a few files from the slaughter the getae were broken panicked seeking only escape and the olbians were not giving any quarter they had ridden through the village to reach the fight and they were in an angry mood and they were fresh troops in their first action all their fear was being vented on the beaten enemy i thought i should keep a few men back leucon shouted well done kineas called just as his stallion paused and then in a long slow fall collapsed and died blood gushing from a wound in his neck the getae had been surprised and disordered in each combat and the persian stallion was the only casualty among the olbians by the time the routed enemy were butchered over a hundred getae were dead and the olbians killed the seriously wounded barbarians at niceass order few enough of the getae had died fighting most had been hacked down after they broke pinned against the swollen waters of the river more had drowned trying to swim to safety no prisoners the way were moving and no soldier worth a fuck leaves a man to die like that niceas said to a group of redfaced olbians they were cooling down now was the time to give quarter if they can walk let them go to kineas he said what do we do with all these corpses our rich boys wont want to bury them they seem quick enough to loot them kineas said even the most starryeyed achillesloving stripling among the cavalry was taking his turn cutting gold and silver rings from the fallen getae how do you think they got to be rich boys niceas sneered leave the dead for the crows kineas said i want to move as soon as we can make that sindi farmer see sense him and his fellows kineas turned to ataelus who had missed the action scouting north of the village but had managed to acquire four new horses anyway ataelus make him see sense they have to come with us column of refugees will only slow us down niceas said kineas smiled grimly i want to be slowed down he said ataelus shook his head men stay to bury he said take me to him kineas said he had to walk his riding horse was lame and his stallion dead the finest horse he had ever owned to niceas he said get the best horse available get two or three niceas shook his head sorry the grey bastard died ill miss him like an old friend better a horse than a man kineas said but he had kept that stallion alive for three years and the grey bastard had done the same for him he followed the sakje to a group of sindi men heavily built squat with broad faces and red hair most of them they were burying children and the woman who had been raped and killed kineas tried not to look at her wondered if he could have saved her by a simple charge into the town then he made himself look at her simple courtesy really she was young and she had died an awful death he made himself breathe in and out next to her was an older woman perhaps forty with long blond braids and a small knife still stuck in her throat tell them i can take them all of them with me kineas gestured ataelus spoke to the broadest man obviously a smith kineas understood all that he said the man shook his head and pointed at the row of little bodies with his shovel and the blonde woman all of the sindi men were weeping ataelus turned back to kineas very bad thing when house took fire mother killed childs then kill her with own knife brave and men vow fight to death and then we come so wife all children dead men want die athena protect us kineas said in horror the mother killed her own children ataelus looked at him like an alien building no sakje dirt people or sky people go as slave mother brave brave brave the sakje reached in his belt pouch and took out a pinch of seeds the same seeds that kam baqca burned on her brazier he threw the seeds into the grave and threw a small ornate knife from his boot beside it i honour her brave kineas heart seemed to swell to fill his chest and he thought he might choke and his eyes burned he turned away walked back to where ajax and eumenes were telling of their exploits watched with some amusement by nicomedes and niceas thirty men to help the townspeople dig graves for their fallen right now kineass voice broke as he said it and he turned so that his officers wouldnt see him unmanned he was an old hand and he had seen quite a few dead children but this affected him so deeply that he was shaking he thought of medea killing her children at the end of the play and he wondered what the playwright had missed or known the olbians aware of some change in their hipparch dug without a grumble the women and children were buried in an hour the men gathered flowers to put on the graves and kineas threw a brooch in as did many of the soldiers so that the mothers grave was heaped with things she might have counted as treasures if she had lived by the time the last flower was placed on the last childs grave kineas had listened to all ataelus had to tell him of the getae to the north and west when his column mounted the sindi men had getae horses and a good wagon of their own the sindi men all had bows like sakje bows and every man had a heavy axe and death in their faces north and east right across the front of the getae advance kineas said ataelus smiled grimly after three days kineas had a hundred sindi refugees men and women and children and his column was slowed to the speed of a walking man and the getae had taken notice three times hed fallen on their raiders three times hed destroyed the band hed met every man in the olbian column was a killer now there had been hard fighting in the last town fighting inside the houses and with killing death young kyros the brilliant javelineer was dead a getae knife in his neck and nicomedes business partner theo lay on a cart breathing as best he could with a punctured lung waiting to die and sophokles whose contempt for the rules of war had entertained them on the first trip to the sakje took a sword cut to his arm and bled out before his comrades could save him luck good armour and barbarian indiscipline had kept the rest of them alive but they were exhausted in body and in spirit and many of them had wounds wounds they would survive but which sapped their strength and their will to fight kineas and niceas bore down becoming monsters of discipline no shortcoming was tolerated niceas struck two young troopers in a single morning kineas wondered what srayanka would think or what she would do so it was a silent sullen column that moved through a steady drizzle on the fourth morning the tired men riding tired beasts man and horse alike with their heads down niceas and nicomedes were both out with the scouts because the scouts required the immediate presence of their officers to keep them alert kineas blessed the handful of sakje every hour they were doing most of the work ajax and eumenes rode with a silent kineas both glanced at him from time to time but neither spoke ataelus returned from his latest scout by midday fucktheirmothers getae gather behind us he said three big bands see them when night comes if we camp kineas cursed and wiped water off his face i dont want to lose them and i dont want my camp stormed in the night he said how many ataelus shrugged many many ten hands and ten hands and ten hands and ten hands in each group and more too many to fight kineas nodded and waved to one of the cruel hand scouts who cantered up like ataelus he didnt look tired depressed or unhappy and kineas wished he had a hundred veterans the advantages of taking his olbian horse for this part of his plan against the raiders was now balanced by how brittle their spirit was theyd recover and be better soldiers for it but not for some days can you find the king kineas said the sakje nodded go find him tell him it will be tomorrow just after dawn ill make for the big hill the sakje turned his horse he raised his whip to his forehead you good chief he said in greek he waved at ataelus gave a loud yip in the direction of the other cruel hands and rode off at a gallop kineas watched him go wondering if the king would come kineas had begun to distrust the king perhaps distrust is too strong a word he thought but the king despite his youth wanted srayanka and when kineas had proposed to use his own men as bait hed seen something pass over the young mans face the rest of the day was brutal kineas kept the column moving by force of will the fear he could inspire and force he terrified women he ripped children from their mothers arms to put them on wagons he struck srayankas whip at the slowest oxen towards evening they came to a stream hed been here before en route to the first action then theyd crossed easily but now it was swollen with a days rain athena protect us he said grimly he rode back to his officers go among your men select all the veterans and send them to me youll weaken the files niceas said i dont think the files will fight i need to survive the next hour kineas was looking through the rain at the last hill where he hoped his scouts were watching his back trail niceas shook his head dont do it a day of absolute authority had its cost obey kineas demanded leucon shook his head sombre but sure theyll fight hipparch you just have to say something theyre scared ares balls sir im scared too ii thought wed have a rest kineas mastered his anger and turned his attention to niceas speak your mind hyperetes dont pull the veterans give em a talk we lighten up a little show them some respect and theyll fight like heroes kineas rubbed his jaw watching a cart begin to cross pulled with ropes by men waist deep in muddy water think thatll work worked on you once or twice niceas said pull the veterans and theyll think you dont trust them kineas smiled his first smile in a day ill try it he said sound form line despite fatigue and rain the two troops formed line on their tired horses like soldiers some men did it without raising their heads kineas rode out to the front of the line im tired he said so im pretty sure youre all tired ive driven you like a coach drives athletes and youve come up to the mark every day and now were at this hadesdamned stream and i have to ask you for more he pointed at their back trail there are two thousand getae behind us about an hours march away he swung srayankas whip over his head and pointed past them a days march that way is the king of the sakje i hope one more fight and one more day on the trail moving fast and you can rest and before you despair gentlemen youve fought three actions in three days none of you are boys any more now you know what the animal looks like any man worthy of his father can stand in a big field on a sunny day and hold his piece of ground for an hour but to be a real soldier you have to find it in yourself to do it day after day in the rain in the desert when you are tired and sore and when your dinner runs down your legs or when you have no food to eat at all he pulled his helmet off and rode closer to the line we can get across this stream and back to the king if you have the spirit to do it ajax raised his sword apollo he shouted the answering shout was not deafening but neither was it hopeless the troops gave three apollos kineas summoned his officers have the men dismount and stand by their horses send the most junior files of each troop to help move the wagons lets do this thing he spoke in a different tone than hed used all day like an officer commanding veterans he turned to niceas you were right he said niceas shrugged it happens he said he watched young clio leading two younger men in pushing at a wagon wheel up to their waists in freezing water they dont look so much like rich boys now twenty minutes later the last wagon was across and ataelus returned at a gallop to report that the lead getae band was in sight kineas looked at the sky more rain and the crossing to niceas he said i think were going to do this niceas huddled in his cloak did you doubt it hipparch kineas shook his head i did he waved to leucon get your men across nicomedes mount and cover them the getae are coming something tugged at his right foot and he saw the blacksmith what he said in sakje the blacksmith pointed at the stand of small trees by the swollen river die here he said pointing at himself you cross kineas wiped the water off his face no no one will die here too much rain get across the man planted his feet die here kineas shook his head he called for ataelus tell him its raining he said tell him that his bowstrings are wet and hell be lucky to kill one getae and that itll be for nothing because the getae wont want to push across against us not enough light left ataelus translated speaking rapidly using his hands more than he was wont speaking kineas thought with great emotion ataelus thought highly of the blacksmith the blacksmith finally nodded he put his axe over his shoulder and walked to the ford his friends falling in around him and they followed leucons men through the rising water kineas rode up to nicomedes the getae were still well distant and the ford was clear better cross he said nicomedes gave a tired smile you wont have to tell me twice the two cruel hand scouts were coming in one galloping far to the north the other far to the south both turned periodically and shot from the saddle and ataelus gave a yip and rode out to the front nicomedes shook his head does that change our plans no kineas said get across he sat in the rain watching the sakje just three of them harrying the advancing getae who had few bows and none that would fire in the rain one by one the sakje bowstrings became wet through despite the best efforts of the sakje warriors to keep them dry but they each hit two or three men slowing all the getae for a few more minutes as the precious grey light slipped away to night all three rode to the ford untouched the getae were just two stades away clear despite the heavier rain and gathering gloom the four of them pushed into the heavy water after ten steps kineas put his arms around his horses neck and allowed himself to float free from his saddle cloth and then his horse an ugly getae beast but strong as an ox pushed up the far bank of earth showering both of them in mud in the process of shaking like a dog the sindi men were cutting poles stakes it turned out and as kineas wrung the water from his cloak and tried to get warm he watched them pound the stakes into the soft earth at the side of the stream so that the ford was blocked with manhigh spikes pointed at horsechest height kineas rode up to the officers the getae are mad they may try it anyway if not theyll come an hour after the rain stops well hold them here we wont get better ground to the blacksmith he said tell the people in the wagons that we move before dawn we will abandon the wagons every man and woman is to ride on the spare horses no unloading and leave the fires lit when we go he looked at ataelus will the getae fight at night ataelus shrugged with a sneer as if the petty superstitions of the getae were beneath his consideration kineas looked around i want our scouts up and down stream ten stades looking for another ford if they find one we leave half a troop on duty every watch two hours a trick get a hot meal in them and then well sleep in the open in the mud asked eumenes thats right if you arent tired enough to sleep in the mud you arent really tired leucons boys know how to huddle up tell them to teach their fathers right we move before dawn any questions there were none nicomedes was almost asleep in his saddle the slaves and the sindi cooked faster and better than the olbians and they had hot food mostly a thin soup of roots and some meat but as good as ambrosia after their day and heavy bread nine days old kineas ate his and handed his bowl to niceas to use wake me if the rain stops he said he lay down with eumenes and leucon and the soggy ground met him with an icy embrace it was horrible and then it was merely uncomfortable and then he was asleep he woke from a dream of being trapped in a cave full of water to find leucons cloak over his head and he was blind he threw it off reaching for his sword and niceas silhouetted by a fire that burned as high as a man jumped back rain stopped sky is clearing he said he was munching something and he pointed stars he said through the bread in his mouth kineas ached and he shivered his whole body moving as if he was going to vomit his fingers were swollen and their joints burned the wound he had taken on his left bicep in the first fight was hot and tender he didnt know where he was for a few heartbeats and then he did get everybody up he said whatre the getae doing huddling around their fires niceas said theres quite a pack of them fires all the way back to the hills kineass brain began to function he squelched over to the fire and its warmth began to soak into his joints get everyone in the saddle a sindi woman pushed something hot into his hand a clay cup full of tea it tasted bitter but it was warm he drained it burning his tongue the cut on his arm ached mount all the sindi on the spare horses and leave the wagons kineas said heard you last night niceas said done had to use a stick on the refugees they dont want to leave their little bits of things behind he gave a hard grin i took care of it athenas shield hipparch we could have done that two days ago and left the getae in our dust eumenes spoke from the other side of the fire we could have kineas said but thats not what i ordered now i have eumenes held his hands up like a boxer defending himself i spoke hastily kineas ignored him turning to nicomedes you are the rear guard try to keep the stragglers moving but if you must abandon them and push on dont be trapped into a fight once we stop the whole pack will be on us understand nicomedes drank some of the womans tea and nodded he had circles under his eyes and he looked sixty years old ajax stood behind him as beautiful as ever if we arent to fight why are we the rear guard he asked kineas shook his head dont be a fool if i have to ill sacrifice you to get the rest away but not without an order from me if you see me form leucons troop in line come and fall into your accustomed place for a last stand ajax asked for whatever i order kineas said he took a deep breath and drained the tea left in his cup bowed to the woman and handed her back her cup and then turned back to grin at his men trust me he said again he wondered if he could trust the king the getae were as slow to rise as any barbarians and they were two hours behind at midmorning helioss winged chariot was climbing in the sky and the sakje rode with their bowstrings across their knees to dry the sinew in the sun an hour later the men had passed from cold to heat and the ground was already dry rolling out to the horizon in waves of grass a few stades to the east a single tall ridge rose above the plain kineas had scouted it on the trip out just ten days ago behind them the getae were less than three stades away and their flank companies were beginning to press forward extending to the right and left in the high grass calling to each other as they came they were beginning to encircle him like good hunters they were pressing on quickly assured of their prey and embarrassed by so much defeat in the last few days kineas rode to the head of the column straight up the ridge he said at the gallop the column was losing cohesion the weary men showing a tendency to lose control of their horses but the gallop galvanized them again the sindi in the centre of the column were mostly accomplished riders but not all kineas rode back down when he saw them slow he and ajax took children and mothers on their own jaded horses and the sindi men took others and the little band of sindi pressed on kineas saw the base of the hill rising between his horses ugly ears and prayed to zeus he looked back the getae were two stades back forming a line and their flanking bands were a stade distant to the right and left but already level pacing them the getae were calling back and forth their war cries loud and shrill kineass tired horse grunted as he started up the ridge the child in his arms was a girl perhaps three years old with blonde hair and deep blue eyes she looked at him curiously horse is tired she said she smiled are you tired yes he said whats your name leucons company was at the crest forming a line as they arrived they werent neat but they were still under control and he was proud of them alyet im three years old the little girl held up three fingers spread broadly are we going to die she asked with all the lack of understanding of the young my mother said we might die no kineas said he was three quarters of the way up the slope and his animal was making heavy work of it he let her take the slope at an angle and she responded well leucons men were formed and nicomedes men were passing the refugees just as he had ordered scrambling up the face of the ridge to form alongside leucons company the getae didnt pause they were coming on so close that kineas could see the plaques they wore as decoration on their harness and the designs on their cloaks the companies to the right and left were angling in eager to be in at the kill hill or no hill kineas made it to the crest he rode to the huddle of sindi and swung the girl into her mothers arms mindful of the horror in the village afraid that on the edge of victory they would despair he patted the little girls head and raised a hand for attention now we win he said loudly in sakje a hundred doubting faces looked back at him he smiled all the cares of the last few days lifted by what he could see from the top of the ridge watch he said and rode away to the centre of his line the getae were at the base of the slope calling and shouting the bolder spirits had pushed their horses up the first part of the slope far out on the sea of green beyond the farthest horns of the getae advance the grass moved as if pushed by a wind and lines of sakje rolled their horses erect lines that stretched for a stade each hundreds of riders rising from the grass like warriors grown from dragons teeth and from behind the ridge came the king and his nobles riding easily on unwearied horses up the back of the ridge to form a compact line of armoured men to kineass left and another company appeared on the right more and more riders the olbians and the sindi gave a cheer and the sakje crossed the crest to fall like the bolts of zeus on the getae the king had come the king had come kineas felt the weight fall from his shoulders and then the slaughter began the olbians played no role in the fight they watched the revenge of the sakje with the weary joy of men who know that they have accomplished much and can now rest before the last getae fell where a knot of nobles gathered around their leader and died in a heap kineas led his column the last few stades to the kings camp a great circle of wagons enclosing thousands of horses by yet another river guarded by yet more sakje deemed unnecessary for the massacre the olbians were greeted as heroes kineas found that despite his weariness he couldnt listen to too much praise he rode from group to group watching their faces amused that his men exhausted moments before suddenly had the energy to drink wine and boast there was food and fire and soon they were joined by the first sakje returning from the rout of the getae many had heads tied to their saddlecloths later kineas saw a man scraping carefully at a whole tattooed skin others had loot a little gold a great deal of silver and horses ataelus returned just before dark riding in with srayankas cruel hands she was covered in blood but before kineass fears could rise in his chest she waved he returned her wave a broad smile across his face and saw that his own skin was filthy mud and blood and sweat fighting for possession of his wrists and hands he hadnt bathed or strigilled in a week ataelus rode up proudly sitting on his tired pony like a king i take ten horses he said you great chief all warriors say so he glanced at srayanka issuing orders to her inner circle lady say you hero say you airyanam kineas grinned again while ataelus praised him the king rode into the laager his armour was gold and it was blinding in the setting sun he looked right and left and finding kineas he rode up to him a mass of gold from head to toe it worked he said he struggled with the chinstrap on his corinthian helmet got it and lifted the whole gilt thing off his head his hair was matted flat and he had a trickle of blood running out of one nostril by the gods kineas the getae will feel this for ten generations we were lucky kineas said i thought of all the things that could have gone wrong while we rode a foolish plan and far too ambitious he smiled wearily and i seem to remember that you were to have no part in this fight i seem to remember kam baqca extracting a promise you came he wanted to say i said i would not place myself in any danger the king grinned nor did i they were broken before we rode down the hill he dismounted and opened his arms in embrace and kineas hugged him armoured chest to armoured chest oh we pounded them the king boasted the cruel hands lay so still that their scouts practically rode over their lines without seeing them i must have killed six the boy ended the embrace i feel foul tired this is my first big fight my first victory as king and you gave it to me i wont forget satrax was stripping armour while he babbled he was still fighting the laces on his scale vambrace marthax says i should stay out of the fight but if i didnt fight i would cease to be king we are sakje not greeks he grinned the same relief from tension on his face that could be seen on every other leader sometimes i think that marthax wants to keep all the glory for himself or that he wants to be king in my place he seized a proffered cup of wine and drained it kineas stepped up close and started on the other lace other men and women did the same so that the kings disarming was itself a celebration they babbled to each other exalted by victory and survival when his scale breastplate was dragged over his head the king stepped out of it and then embraced kineas again smile he said laugh we are alive and now i believe we will defeat zopryon i believe we could defeat alexander the young king pounded his shoulders and he smiled at them suddenly wanting to be free of their embraces and their praise feeling dirty he slipped away gradually telling himself that he was as eager to be free of his armour as the king had been free of his kineas went to a fire that the olbians had appropriated and was greeted with a roar ajax helped him out of his breastplate and kineas felt lighter if not younger nicomedes came and placed an arm around ajaxs broad shoulders the age had fallen away from his face and he was a gentleman of forty again we honour you hipparch he said it is one thing to hear of your exploits and another thing to see kineas looked at his legs streaked with mud and his arms with blood and ordure mixed all the rain had done was to streak it and where he had lain in the mud his tunic was soaked through and his side was itchy and his left arm was swollen if you are quoting someone i dont know it kineas said nicomedes said i am a rich man and i have been privileged to see many great craftsmen and artists at work it is always the same when you watch them work you see the focus of their genius and you know you have the real thing ajax laughed i doubt kineas wants to be in your collection my friend kineas half grinned thanks i think he pulled off his tunic can you get a slave to find my kit i need to wear something else in the meantime im going to the river to bathe nicomedes made a show of sniffing his battered cloak a splendid idea ajax produced a strigil as niceas joined them with another i have oil niceas said ajax cheered him as if hed won a race as they walked a few other men joined them leucon and eumenes and several of their young men they walked the stade to the river on sore legs and kineas was happy as happy as a man who can foretell his own death can be he had lost four men in a hard campaign he regretted them but he knew he and they had done well and he knew that for a few hours he didnt have to worry about anything but the aches in his muscles and the fever in his wound death seemed very far away he listened to the younger men chatter and he walked a little ahead of them naked with his filthy tunic over his shoulder he heard the pounding of hooves and he turned srayanka was behind him with a few of her officers all naked covered as they all were in mud and filth the horses as well as the riders she saw him and he saw her and she rode past him her eyes flicking over his body even as he looked at hers then she was past kicking her horse to a gallop turning back to wave she raced on as beautiful as anything kineas had ever seen despite the grime and the blood her unbound black hair flying out behind her her back straight as she gathered her horse for a jump and then leaped from the bank straight into the river with a splash like a leaping whale all the rest of her warriors followed her the olbians pointed and shouted and cheered like artemis and her nymphs nicomedes said he appeared shocked he took a breath who expected such beauty on a day like this i wish i had a painter a sculptor anyone to make that for me ill settle for a bath niceas said lets run said kineas and the olbians began to run they ran like olympians squandering their last reserves in the setting sun and as they came to the bank they made the leap into the cold water and they shouted as they fell kineas swam across the broadest pool the water was deep but full of silt from the rain or stirred up by the horses he didnt care it felt wonderful against his skin despite the cold he swam with his tunic in his teeth looking for her in the slowly falling dark he found her in the shallows under a tall tree she was scrubbing her warhorse clean scooping sand with her hands from the river bank and scrubbing at her horses legs where the big beast appeared to have waded in blood she smiled at him he bites she said in greek not too close kineas stayed in the deep water he was a practical man and he was happy just to be with her admiring her body he began to wash his tunic as best he could after a while he passed behind her and went to the bank where he collected a handful of her sand and began to grind away at the dried crud on his arms down the pool he could hear shrieks and shouts from the other olbians from the voices it appeared that more and more were coming to bathe more olbians and more sakje you airyanam she said looking over her shoulder she pushed a tail of black hair back over her naked shoulder she glanced downstream and back at him he stepped up to her and she entered his arms as though they had rehearsed the embrace a thousand times and her mouth came under his as easily as the clasping of two hands they wrapped themselves into each other for a few seconds until ataelus called here they are and they were surrounded cruel hands and olbians laughing jeering with more than a few obscene suggestions kineas slipped into deeper water to hide the truth of their assertions still holding her hand and she swam after him leaving her horse and they swam together with their people until they were clean they dried naked in the warm evening air on the grass and agis the megaran and ajax both sang from the iliad while the greek men used olive oil and strigils on their skin to the delight and amusement of all the sakje then marthax sang with srayanka turn and turn again an endless ballad of love and revenge kineas found that the king had joined them and he sat with the king while men fetched dry tunics and food and then srayanka finished singing and sat with her back against his as if they were old war companions her people had brought her clothes and she was dressed and she had given him a tunic of pale skin covered in embroidery like her own it was barbaric he put it on anyway the king sat stiffly with them and then turned away clearly angered when kineas donned the tunic later when she kissed kineas an absent and affectionate peck as she reached past him for wine the king rose to his feet he spoke to her in rapid angry sakje she tossed her drying hair flicked her eyes at kineas and then nodded to the king my mind knows she said clearly and my mind rules my body the king turned and strode off into the dark srayankas back remained warm against his her iron and deerskin hand supple in his and he was again as happy as a man could be who had only a few weeks to live in the morning the army lay in a stupor of exhaustion and winesickness a handful of getae could have wrecked them kineas had never seen an army behave differently after a victory but wondered if there might be a value in keeping a guard the swelling in his arm was less and the heat from it almost gone as if the river spirit had drawn away the poison he was one of the first up and having drunk some sindi tea he donned the leather tunic that srayanka had given him despite its outre appearance it was clean his military tunic was damp and despite his desultory washing while he watched srayanka it was still filthy and the rest of his kit had vanished in the retreat probably left at the last camp the king rode up to where kineas was eyeing the olbians string of captured getae mounts working to select a decent riding horse to his eye they were all too small i think it is time we spoke as men the king said with an obvious attempt at dignity you have given me a great victory i would not be ungenerous kineas sighed and looked up at the king i am at your service lord he looked at the ground unused to discussing such matters then he looked back are we speaking of srayanka the king wouldnt meet his eye after zopryon is defeated would you marry her kineas shrugged of course he said because he had to say something of course if i were alive the king leaned down perhaps the prospect is not as enticing she is no greek woman and she is fierce but she will not settle to be your leman she is the chief of the cruel hands too great a personage to be a trull perhaps you cannot wed her perhaps you are already married or promised the king had mistaken his tone entirely i would be proud to be wed to the lady kineas said and found that he meant it the king straightened in his saddle really he sounded surprised she would never live in a city it would kill her now he met kineass eye i have lived in a greek city i know the lady she lives as a free spear maiden and your city would kill her fantasizing aloud kineas said perhaps i could buy a farm north of olbia she could visit he laughed even as he spoke the king shook his head i like you kineas i liked you from the first but you come like the doom of my happiness you brought this war and now you will take my cousin i will try to speak as a man and not an outraged youth i wish her for myself but she will have only you now i must endure not just the loss of her a woman i have desired since i was old enough to feel a mans desire but to know that my best warriors speak of you as airyanam if you wed her you will be a potent ally or a deadly rival and i ask myself is this what you desire will you leave your men to ride the plains or bring them like a new clan kineas rubbed at his beard and felt old lord i will serve you indeed i had not thought on any of these matters i can see that they prey on you but kineas struggled for words it is the lady herself that i value how will you live the king asked can you leave niceas or diodorus to be the consort of a barbarian girl he looked away over the grass or would she leave the cruel hands to grind flour and weave with greek women i think perhaps she would until she hated you or went mad kineas nodded because he had thought these thoughts and because the sentence of death hanging over him had saved him from having to decide except he felt knew in his heart that they would have found a way or would he have ended as jason and she as medea but what could he say lord ill be dead so it doesnt matter i think we would will find a way he said carefully the king was still watching the grass he drew himself taller i will try not to stand between you he said the sentence cost him and then he added kam baqca says i must do this thing kineas wondered what it was like to have so much power at eighteen years it is a noble thing to do whether kam baqca recommended it or not satrax shrugged then he straightened and sought again for dignity i hear you lost your warhorse he said you lost that grey which gives me a beautiful opportunity to show you how highly i value you he extended a hand inviting kineas to mount behind him kineas mounted with the king people will laugh he said unlikely the king answered he kicked his horse into a trot and then a canter they were riding through the royal herd or rather the abbreviated version that the king had brought on the pursuit of the getae kineas knew the brands the king spoke suddenly my other lords think you are the perfect choice she will have a husband and the cruel hands will have heirs and you of course are already a war leader of repute the horse continued for a few strides i am told i should pick a girl my own age with better hips for childbearing a sauromatae princess is recommended kineas was pressed against the kings back and satrax was stiff angry angry that he had to bow to the wishes of his lords then he relaxed and pointed there he said the stallion was not so much grey as silver a dark silver the colour of polished iron or steel he had a heavy black line down his back a marking kineas had only seen among the heavy sakje breed and a pale mane and tale he was tall and selfpossessed in fact he was twin to the kings war mount he wont be as well trained as your persian the king said like all men giving a great gift he had to decry its faults but hes well broken to harness my next warhorse yours now and a couple of riding horses marthax has them for you but i wanted to talk kineas walked around the stallion admiring his haunches he had a short head without the purity of line the persian had but he was big and the colour was either ugly or magnificent it was certainly rare thank you lord this is a kingly gift the king grinned embarrassed and looking very young indeed he is isnt he satrax smiled showing his essential good humour theres the advantage of owning ten thousand horses he said after a moment i am sorry kineas said he couldnt think of anything else to say the king grimaced kings have to think hard thoughts if you are her husband you will be a man of great power among my people a baqca who was also a man with a wife who commanded a clan a great soldier with greek allies you may be my rival he looked at the horse as marthax is he stared over the plain or is this just my jealousy speaking you are blunt kineas said you think like a king i have to the king gestured at the horse give him a try he said kineas caught the mane of the stallion in one hand and vaulted on to the beasts tall back he almost missed his seat this monster was a hand taller than the persian and he was thankful that the animal waited patiently while his feet scrambled satrax restrained his laughter with difficulty pleased to see the greek discomfited by the horse kineas made a clucking sound and the big animal flowed into a curve what a gait kineas crowed the beasts easy flow of hooves was strangely familiar he tried his knees alone his hands free and brought the stallion alongside the kings mount easily the two horses sniffed at each other like stable mates which they probably were they were the same colour same dam he said satrax grinned same dam and sire he said brothers kineas inclined his head i am honoured he patted the horses shoulder thinking of his conversation with philokles i swear to you that no action of mine will harm your kingship nor will i wed srayanka or ask for her without your permission he slapped the horse this is a wonderful gift he repeated good said the king he nodded obviously relieved and just as obviously still troubled and jealous good lets get the army moving it was later in the day when kineas who was becoming more enamoured of his new horse by the hour realized why his gait seemed so familiar the silver horse was the stallion from the dream of his death they crossed the plains from west to east at speed the sakje set their usual pace and the olbians with remounts provided kept up they made a hundred stades a day by kineass estimation watering at rivers that crossed the plain at measured intervals camping in established spots with fresh green grass for fodder and a few trees for firewood the level of organization was staggering for barbarians but kineas no longer thought of them as barbarians kineas had never seen an army of five thousand move so fast if zopryon pressed his men as hard as alexander himself he might make sixty stades although patrols would go farther and kineas suspected he had not seen the fastest march of which the sakje were capable most of the campsites were shadowed by tall hills of turf that grew out of the plain often the highest point for many hours riding on the fourth evening his muscles sore but his body clean kineas sat with his back against niceass rubbing tallow into his bridle leather and then working carefully at the headstall where it had begun to burst its stitches making minute alterations in the fit as he went the new horse had a big head srayanka came with parshtaevalt and hirene her trumpeter she had become less shy about seeking him out come walk kineax she said kineas used the awl in his palm to punch two new holes working carefully with the old leather he needed the headstall to last until they were back at the camp at great bend and no longer soon he said she sat down by him and pointed at his work to hirene who frowned niceas was cutting a getae cloak to make a saddle blanket hirene spoke quickly in sakje her lip curled whether in sneer or smile kineas couldnt tell srayanka laughed a lovely sound and sat gracefully on kineass blanket hirene say you have uses after all srayanka said the great war leader sews leather kineas ran a stitch back through the last hole and then again and then a third time and then bit the linen thread as close as he could to the leather kineas buffed the headstall with the palm of his hand and then laid it carefully atop the pile of his tack parshtaevalt knelt by the pile and began to examine the bit not good ours he said but good his greek like their sakje was improving by the day niceas tossed his blanket on his own tack and waved across the fire for ataelus to translate to parshtaevalt he said you just show me mate he gave kineas a friendly wink hirene looked torn she wanted to follow her mistress but srayanka shook her head turning to kineas she said bring your sword kineas thought that he had the oddest courtship since alexandros met helen but he fetched the egyptian blade from his blanket where the precious thing was rolled at the centre she took his hand and they walked off into the red evening by the camp the turf was even and the grass bright green and short but she led him out into the sea of grass where hummocks made walking treacherous they laughed together when their mutual refusal to relinquish the others hand cost them their balance kineas looked back over his shoulder to find that they were in full view of the camp stretching out to the north and south along the stream and that many heads were turned watching them reading his thoughts she said let them watch this hill is grave to the father of me here we kill two hundred horses send him to ghanam i baqca here they came to the base of the mound closer up it was clearer that the hill was made by the hands of men turfs were set like steps running up the barrow and a deep trench invisible from a stade away ran clear around the base with a barrier of stone around the outside srayanka led him around a quarter of the boundary ditch and then they entered at a gate flanked by wild roses and began to climb the mound she began to sing tonelessly the ball of the setting sun came to rest on the far horizon bathing the green grass of the turf with red and orange and gold light so that the hill appeared to be an amalgam of grass and gold and blood her singing increased in volume and tone hurry she said she pulled at his hand and they ran the last few steps to the top where a stone sat in a slight depression from the stone rose a bar of rusted iron closer up it proved to be the remnants of a sword with the gold of the hilt still standing proud above the decay of the blade the sun was huge a quarter gone beneath the curve of the world draw your sword she ordered kineas drew his sword she reached out and took the rusted sword reverentially by the hilt and drew it from the stone she seized kineass sword from him and as the last rays of the sun turned its hilt to fire she plunged it straight into the stone deeper if anything than the other sword had been as the sun vanished leaving the sky like a dye shop with vivid reds and pale pink contrasting to the growing purple and dark blue veil of night she stopped singing she knelt facing the stone kineas stood by her embarrassed at his own ignorance of her ways equally embarrassed by the extent of her barbarism but she was a priestess and it was not the greek way to ridicule any peoples gods so he knelt by her in the damp hollow he could smell the moss on the stone and the oil on his egyptian blade and the woodsmoke in her hair they knelt there until his knees burned and his back was a column of stone against his muscles darkness fell complete so that the plain beyond the hollow vanished and there was only the sky and the stone the smells of the hollow and then the cry of an owl and he was flying over the plain of grass looking for prey the pinprick glow of uncountable stars sufficient light for him to see he rose higher over the plain in lazy circles and when he saw a circle of fires a dozen circles of fire a hundred circles of fire then he descended again watching the camp as he came down in spirals as suddenly as she had knelt srayanka rose took a pouch of seeds from her waist and scattered them in the hollow and on the stone kineas got to his feet with considerable difficulty one of his feet was asleep but his mind was clear part of it still high in the dark sky you are baqca she said you dream strong dream he rubbed his face to clear his head the inside of his mouth felt gummy as if hed eaten resin i dreamed he said in greek she put a hand on his face i must sit in the she paused seeking words smoke tent even here under the guryama of the father of me she rubbed his face affectionately you dream free he was still in the grip of the dream and she took his hand and led him down the hill halfway down he began to recover my sword he said she smiled used her position higher on the turf hill to lean to him eye to eye and kiss him it was a long kiss and he found that his hand quite naturally went to her right breast and she bit his tongue and stepped back laughing sword right here she said slapping at his groin with a hard hand then she relented climb for sword with dawn baqca thing yes kineas spoke hesitantly you are putting the power of your fathers sword into my sword she considered him for a moment with the look a mother gives when a child has asked a difficult question or a question whose answer may itself cause harm you marry me she asked kineass breath caught in his throat but he didnt hesitate yes she nodded as if the answer was just as she expected so we ride together yes and perhaps she wore an open look like a priestess at worship a look that scared him to his bones and marrow perhaps we rule together kineas took a step back the king rules he said srayanka shrugged kings die kineas thought youre backing the wrong horse my love im the one fated to die he reached out his arms to her and she came into them when her head was against his shoulder he said srayanka i she put a hand on his mouth shhh she said say nothing spirits walk say nothing kineas embraced her almost a chaste embrace and she stood with her head on his shoulder her arms around his waist for a long time and then they walked back down the hill without discussion they began to separate at the edge of the short grass she to her camp and he to his but their hands stayed together too long and they almost fell again they laughed and walked away she came for him in the morning dressed in white skins with gold plaques and gold embroidery crowned with a headdress of gold that towered above her the king was with her and marthax and twenty other chiefs and warriors kineas waved to leucon and nicomedes to attend him and the group repeated the journey climbing through the last of the dark to the hollow at the summit all the sakje began to sing even the king the first ray of the sun licked over the dark line of the worlds edge like a flame rising from a new fire the sun picked out the gorgons head medeas head srayankas head on the hilt of his machaira so that it seemed to draw colour from the rising run and the line of flame crept down the blade faster and faster so that in a few heartbeats the sword seemed to have drawn the sun down into the stone all the sakje shouted and srayankas hand took the hilt and she sang a high pure note and motioned with her other hand at kineas kineas took the sword hilt in his right hand and just for an instant it seemed to pull him down srayanka released the hilt and kineass hand shot aloft pulling the sword clear of the stone kineas had been so drawn into the effect of the ceremony that for a moment he expected something a tide of energy perhaps or the words of a god instead he saw the look on the kings face jealousy and envy naked to his glance when their eyes met the king flinched marthax frowned and then slapped him on the back good sword he said and they all walked down the hill what was that about nicomedes asked beautiful light effect kineas shrugged srayankas fathers barrow he said quietly and leucon and nicomedes both nodded after they reached the short grass marthax began to bellow orders kineas took the king by the elbow i dreamed up on the barrow the king pulled away that is as it should be he said after a moment i saw the army of zopryon camped in good order perhaps two hundred stades south of here perhaps more satrax rubbed his beard and made a face he makes good time kineas said can we trust this dream he thought of the details the hobbled horses the pickets the circles of fire but his mind could supply all of those the king stared at kineas kam baqca sees nothing she is closing her mind to the visions as they show her nothing but her own death so i must rely on yours as much as any dream i will send scouts then we will know if it is a true dream kineas said and his voice trembled he wanted it to be a false dream he wanted the scouts to place zopryon another two hundred stades to the west because that would mean that he dreamed falsely that these barbarians how ever much he loved them were superstitious like all barbarians and he was not fated to die in a few short weeks at the crossing of a river he took a breath and released it if this is a true dream then it is almost time to begin harrying his army one of the kings companions came up with a cup of tea and the king took it eagerly our hooves are hard the horses are conditioned he nodded if the scouts confirm your dream then yes we will begin the king sent twenty riders one of whom was ataelus three days later when they were a short mornings march from the camp at great bend they returned in a group the king summoned all of the chiefs and officers it had been a true dream to the greeks ataelus said zopryons army is not for big so rumour make has many many many hands of men not so many of horses ataelus grinned his horrible grin send getae no getae come back oops kineass stomach twisted and turned and his blood ran riot in his veins he had at most two weeks to live srayanka spoke in sakje now we harry him she said and the look in her eyes was disturbingly like the look in her eyes when he had come up behind her the night of the victory over the getae or when she spoke of how they might rule together like lust satrax spoke carefully tonight i ride for the camp marthax will bring in the column the rest of you sakje and olbians must be ready to ride with me we will see what clans have come in and what the rumour of our victory has done for numbers we will see if the sauromatae have come and the rest of the greeks he looked around and then we will let zopryon feel the weight of our hooves the party with the king comprised most of the officers and nobles of the allied army twenty clan leaders the kings bodyguard of nobles sons kineas nicomedes leucon and niceas they rode through the soft summer evening without herds without wagons and they rode fast kineas rode by the king but they exchanged few words and kineas felt that there was still a barrier between them whether the barrier was of his own construction or of the kings was the sort of question philokles might have answered but kineas couldnt see the answer himself just as full darkness rolled over the plains they saw the great bend of the river in the east a greater darkness and a hint of moist air and then a thousand points of fire burning on the far side of the ford the camp had doubled or tripled in size the smell of burning wood carried almost as far as the sight of so many fires all of the horses gave voice and the herds responded the king paused turning his head from the last glow of ruddy light in the west behind him to the sparkle of campfires beyond the great river when i was a boy he said to kineas i loved boats every spring i would go and ride the boats of the merchants going down the river to olbia i remember how one of the wisest of them an old sindi called bion would judge the spring rush of waters stopping frequently because as he said when the river swelled past a certain point then no effort of man could beach a boat and that boat would either rush down the river to its destination or would be swept up on a rock or a log and utterly destroyed the king pointed at the camp oblivious to the crowd of nobles pressing around them kineas nodded it is much the same at sea lord you can feel your way along a coast to a certain point but when poseidon wills it you must chance to the winedark sea and ride the waves or perish in the last light the kings smile was grim my meaning was a little different kineas on the river bion would stop he would stop to rest stop to prove that he still could stop to delay that moment when he committed to everything to that last rush to success or destruction he shrugged the motion almost lost in the darkness in an hour i will give the order and my people will fall on zopryon and from that moment i am on the river and it is in full spate kineas kneed his horse closer to the kings and put his hand on the other mans and you wish to stop he asked the king put his whip hand over kineass hand you too are a commander you too know the terror the weight of other mens hopes and other mens fears i wish to stop or to have it done i know it said kineas voicing his own fears they sat together for a few more seconds watching the fall of darkness out to the west and for that night at least they were friends come said the king lets board the boat philokles and diodorus were waiting with a group of strangers at the edge of the camp the king had already appointed the place and time for the meeting of his council the hour after dawn in his wagon laager kineas nicomedes leucon and niceas rode along the river to the encampment of the greeks now full of tents and wagons stretching off into the darkness congratulations are in order diodorus said clasping kineass hand as soon as he slid from his horse niceas laughed touched his amulet as if to avoid hubris and said you missed some good fighting he grinned as good as anything against the medes the getae dont even know our tricks it was grand philokles stood a little apart although he greeted each of the commanders warmly enough kineas clasped his hand i missed you he said philokles look of reserve melted away and i you he said then after casting a glance toward the olbian officers he said i have news most of it bad kineas took a deep breath tell me it should be told in private philokles said it isnt known in camp are the hoplites here kineas asked two or three days away and marching hard the pantecapaeum horse is in camp and the sauromatae that will please the king kineas said whats so bad other men were coming up from the darkness antigonus cast his arms around kineas and they embraced we heard you were close he said and that you won niceas was already regaling a crowd of the older hands with war stories wineskins appeared with strong country wine that tasted of goat and pine pitch kineas stood with leucon and nicomedes and told the basic story of the campaign while most of the men in the greek camp came up to listen so the getae are smashed philokles said the king thought they had been destroyed for a generation perhaps longer leucon said philokles winced his eyes flicking to sitalkes who was laughing with the men of his troop kineas took him by the elbow and led him a little apart you are behaving like a fury at a feast he said philokles glanced around the crowd and lowered his voice i have a man in my tent he said pelagius a man of pantecapaeum he came north in a boat from the fleet and he reported things in olbia from just five days back kineas nodded according to pelagius demostrate found the macedonian squadron thirty days back caught it on the beach and burned two ships then he dispatched messengers to tell us the job was done and went south to the bosporus to prey on macedonian shipping kineas nodded thats what he said all along he said pelagius arrived in olbia in a small boat with a handful of crewmen he intended to find the archon and tell him of developments at sea but what he saw caused him to take his boat upriver instead what did he see kineas asked a macedonian garrison in the citadel philokles said that was five days ago he arrived today and i sat on him kineas shook his head hades hades were fucked kineas felt as if he had been kicked by a stallion he was having trouble breathing hades philokles is he sure sure enough to come pelting upriver to us without putting in if demostrate burned the macedonian triremes how in hades did it happen kineas smacked a fist into his palm all his plans were rising away like the smoke of an altar fire in a breeze i can only speculate a merchantman with a hold crammed with soldiers and the archon in it to the hilt philokles shook his head angrily i dont know kineas hung his head ares balls our asses are going to be in the air we need to know whats happening he looked back at the crowd by the fire men were watching him we cant hide this better if i put it to the officers immediately philokles pulled on his beard you know what this may mean your men all your men may go home can you hold them if the archon orders them home is the archon the voice of the city kineas asked philokles crossed his arms memnon is two days away with the hoplites kineas nodded so we have the assembly here philokles took his arm you expected this kineas was looking out into the dark thinking of the king and his image of a boat swept down the river yes he said i expected betrayal from the archon he made a motion as if throwing a handful of dice on the ground the game is well underway my friend too late to walk away and save our cloaks philokles laughed bitterly it seems to me that in one throw the archon has already triumphed he said he has the city nicomedes obviously felt the same when he was told an hour later his ruddy face went white in the firelight leucon was similar except that he cried out my father eumenes became silent his jaw set all of the olbians were moved some wept kineas stood on the tongue of a wagon he had taken the time to go to philokles camp and hear the sailor speak the man was a gentleman a citizen of pantecapaeum a veteran trader who knew the coast and knew the politics his account was reliable when kineas left the man he ordered niceas to gather all the men of olbia in the camp and he sent philokles to tell the king nicomedes shook his head he stood just below kineas and when he spoke his voice carried we left men as a precaution against something like this is there any news his voice cracked from emotion has the archon ordered us home kineas spoke loudly into the crowd of men around his wagon this war was voted by the assembly of the citizens of olbia he said the archon and his extraordinary powers were voted by the assembly of the citizens of olbia he paused and received silence the best accolade of any assembly of greek men in two days the hoplites will be here i propose that we then hold an assembly of the city here in camp perhaps we will choose to agree with the action that the archon has taken or perhaps he made his voice loud and hard a trick of rhetoric and one of command perhaps we will find that the archon has betrayed the city the archon holds the city leucon said his voice was flat kineas had no response to that he dismissed them to go to bed they moved off grumbling philokles stood by his shoulder when they were gone you are a surprising man kineas i think perhaps you would have been a dangerous opponent in the law courts if you had not taken to the cavalry you will argue that the army and not the archon is the voice of olbia i will kineas said i would lie if i said that i expected this but by zeus i feared it and i thought about it and now all i can do is to ask them they are men let them act like men philokles shrugged sparta has no walls he said in the morning the men were calm and obedient which was as much as kineas had hoped for he attended the kings council with his own officers when called on he rose and addressed them king satrax noble sakje men of pantecapaeum i wish to speak before rumour exaggerates it appears to us from a report that the archon of olbia has allowed a garrison of macedon into the citys citadel or perhaps it has been taken by surprise a murmur rose first from the officers of the pantecapaeum horse and then from the sakje kineas raised his voice and continued it is possible that even now there is an order en route to this camp from the archon ordering this part of the army home he caught srayankas eye unwittingly her dark brows were drawn together as one the king flicked his whip and what will the men of olbia do he asked kineas bowed we must have a few days to decide he had explained in private as soon as the king was up and again to srayanka choosing his words carefully but none of them smiled at him the atmosphere of the council was heavy and cold many new men and some new women sat there now the war leaders of the western clans and the alien sauromatae handsome tall men and women from the east with closed faces who wore their armour to the council kam baqca spoke carefully her eyes were wide and her pupils enormous as if she had received a blow to the head or recently awakened she seemed to have trouble focusing and her body writhed from minute to minute as if inhabited by a giant snake do you think she asked carefully into a dead silence that the sakje should allow you to ride away if your archon intends to make war on us her head sunk suddenly to her chest and then snapped back erect and her eyes were locked on the king i never saw this she said kineas spoke over the first angry response from his own officers to kam baqcas threat i ask for time to deal with this crisis in our own way threats promises censure none of them will help the men of olbia deal with their own sense of betrayal and their own very deep fears for their city i beg this council and the king to exercise patience lest our alliance already touched with victory dissolve the king made a sharp notion for kineas to desist before he could speak the best armoured of the sauromatae rose from his seat and spoke he spoke rapidly in the sakje tongue with a strong accent and kineas could catch little more than his anger the king listened attentively and then said to the council prince lot speaks for the sauromatae he says they have come far far from their tents on the great sea of grass and farther from the queen of the massagetae who also craved their lances in bactria he says they come to find a handful of foreign allies preparing to desert to macedon and he wonders aloud if i am a strong king the king rose to his feet the campaign against the getae had hardened him there was no adolescent rage just a cold focus he spoke in sakje and kineas understood him well enough and then he spoke again in greek i am a strong king i have crushed the getae who preyed on my people for ten generations of men i won this victory with the help of the men of olbia and such brotherhood is not lightly set aside he looked at kineas kineas read a great deal from that look the boy was putting his kingship above his desire for srayanka again he continued i give the olbians five days to make their decision and then we will take council again in the meantime i command that the harrying of the army of macedon begin zopryon is two hundred stades distant he will take at least a week to reach the bank of the great river by then all questions of olbia and its archon will have been resolved the king sat he had never looked less young or more fully a king srayanka smiled at him and kineas felt the bile in his gut it occurred to him to wonder what exactly srayanka wanted in a man was it power the thought was black with jealousy and unworthy of her but the barb stuck marthaxs army returned with the rest of the olbians and all the other veterans of the campaign against the getae srayankas cruel hands came into camp with a whoop of victory kineas saw them at a distance he saw srayanka greet parshtaevalt just as he saw the king welcome marthax and he saw the subdued celebrations among the sakje for the first time that summer however he was separate distant and not welcome and as soon as they came and celebrated they rode away again kineas watched srayanka lead the cruel hands out of the camp on the third day after their return she rode up to him he hadnt touched her in days hadnt spoken to her except at the council she gestured with her whip at the knots of olbian men gathered by their fires fix this it is between us kineas tried to grab her hand she frowned shook her head turned her horse and galloped back to the head of her column and kineas felt a hot jab of rejection and rage behind kineas there was a great deal of comment the veterans of the getae campaign filling in their mates on just how the ground lay between their commander and the lady srayanka kineas whirled on them savage and a great many punishments were handed out it was ruinous for morale by the time memnons spears marched into sight on the east bank of the river those who remained sakje and greek alike were waiting to hear the news like men waiting for a bolt of lightning memnon arrived at the head of the phalanx of pantecapaeum with the phalanx of olbia a few stades behind kineas rode out to him as soon as the glitter of his spears was identified it was obvious from their first exchange that memnons news of the city was out of date he had left a city dedicated to the war kineas took memnon aside as soon as he could pressed a cup of wine into his hands and sat him on a stool we have reason to believe that the archon sold the city to macedon a day or two after you went out the gates he said memnon took a gulp of wine spat it in the fire and then drank some bastard whoreson dickless catamite he drank off the wine were fucked theyll all go home kineas shook his head let them hear the news tonight tomorrow all the men of olbia will gather in assembly ares itll be chaos kineas and therell be desertions i hate to say it i love the whoresons but i know them memnon shook his head bastard boyfucker he just waited for us to march out and then he handed the citadel to zopryon kineas raised an eyebrow did you expect anything else i didnt now well see what weve made memnon shook his head listen comrade were old soldiers mercenaries masterless men exiles we know that the loss of your city is a bitter pill but in the end nothing a city is a city yes they dont know they will feel as if their gods have died and theyll crawl back to the archon and swear whatever he requires to have their city back kineas looked at the marching column they look good he said they are good fuck your mother memnon spoke with angry pride they trained all winter and they marched here like like spartiates theyve trowelled off a lot of weight and they like it most of them are middleaged men who just won themselves a last summer of youth theyll fight like heroes he said glumly if they choose to fight kineas slapped the dark mans shoulder isnt that the way it ought to be he said men ought to fight only if they vote it you spend too much time with that fucking spartan memnon grumbled if somebody pays me to fight i fight i dont ask a lot of questions kineas met his eye thats how we both came to work for the archon he said from now on i think ill ask more questions in the night leon the slave of nicomedes came into camp having run day and night from the city he brought news kineas summoned from a dream full of smoke and monsters was muddled when he made his way to nicomedes tent leon looked like a literal man of clay he was coated in pale river mud and he stank of it nicomedes handed kineas and philokles a cup of wine its bad he said tell him leon leon drank from his own wine cup cleomenes had cleitus murdered by the kelts day before yesterday he said he rubbed his face with his hands as a man does when he tries to stay awake and flakes of mud came away from his face as if he was literally falling to pieces he has seized command of the rest of the hippeis kineas pounded his right fist into his left hand zeus of all the base acts he drained his wine what of the archon thoughts and images boiled in his mind the archons treason came as a shock for all of his preparation leon shook his head nicomedes swirled some more wine unwatered in his cup its always worse than you think no one has seen the archon cleomenes has seized power and turned the citadel over to a garrison from thrace amarayan gives the orders in the citadel leon said no one has seen the archon in ten days since the garrison came they came out of a big merchant ship and by the time cleitus had heard and mustered the hippeis they were installed in the citadel how many asked kineas two hundred leon speculated hard to know they havent come down into the town indeed they only hold the gates and the citadel they dont patrol the walls he hung his head cleitus was going to try ejecting them with his hippeis and some citizens who remained behind thats when cleomenes showed his hand and had cleitus killed he looked at nicomedes you are exiled kineas and memnon have their citizenship revoked the army of the city is recalled all our goods have been seized howd you come free kineas asked it was harsher than he meant but he was not in a trusting mood leon met his eye im a slave he said i walked through the gates with the market crowd took a horse from the gamelios farm and rode hard he shrugged heavily when i saw the macedonians i got down in the riverbed and walked nicomedes put his hand on the seated mans neck now you are a free man he said leon glanced up taken aback can you afford to free me he asked im quite valuable then he laughed despite everything by all the gods you mean it sir nicomedes tossed his cloak off his shoulder and curled his beard with his fingers why not i used to be the richest man in olbia get some sleep he glanced at kineas i thought you should know first kineas mutely held his cup out for more unwatered wine philokles shook his head i thought it would be the archon he said blearily or or you nicomedes nicomedes shrugged with a pained look it might have been me after we dealt with zopryon philokles nodded were in deep trouble cleomenes he knows exactly how to hurt us kineas nodded yes he said and rubbed his jaw like a boxer who had taken a heavy blow the next day dawned red with a promise of heavy weather later in the day kineas gathered all the men of olbia in a great halfcircle a conscious recreation of the place of assembly in the city kineas and nicomedes had worked to make the assembly ground as familiar as possible it was an odd assembly because for whatever reason all the men hoplites and hippeis brought their spears and stood leaning on them so that the assembly was a forest of bright spear points in the red morning light first came helladius a priest of apollo who made a sacrifice in the name of the god and declared the day favourable just as he would have in olbia he was solemn and the steam that rose from the blood of his slaughtered lamb in the red light of dawn seemed to waft the sacrifice straight to the gods after helladius nicomedes strode to the centre of the assembly and spoke he stood in the centre of the halfcircle holding his spear like every other man present he didnt look like a fop this morning men of olbia he said fellow citizens he proceeded to tell the story of the war from its inception to the demands made by zopryon he rehearsed for them every vote they had made the grants of citizenship to the mercenaries the subsidies of money to the archon for more men more arms armour horses more mercenaries the treaty with the king of the sakje and the treaty with the city of pantecapaeum if it was dry or boring no one showed it they stood leaning on their spears grumbling when they didnt like his point or speaking up with shouts of thats right and theres the thing when they felt that nicomedes had the right of it nicomedes took them right through to the end when he came to the presence of the new garrison in the citadel they groaned and the spear points moved as if they were blades of grass in the wind and then he spoke to them of the proclamation and the threat of exile and their voices rose around him until he could not make himself heard he glanced at kineas shrugged and stepped down kineas motioned to niceas and the hyperetes drew a breath and blew a single note on his cavalry trumpet then he walked forward into the empty ground at the centre of the crowd his appearance was greeted with a grumble nicomedes was what they were used to nicomedes addressed the assembly on every issue that appeared kineas was a mercenary whom they had voted to citizenship a foreigner from athens and as hipparch the captain of the citys financial and social elite but his military reputation stood him in good stead and he received a silence punctuated only by a handful of complaints imprecations and conversations men of olbia he began i stand before you almost a stranger and yet your captain in war i have appeared in your assembly only a handful of times and yet i will dare to address this one as if i were an old citizen as if i were cleitus or nicomedes or some other voice to whom you are accustomed according to the tyrant of olbia whoever that is today i am no longer a citizen kineas gestured at the camp the horses and wagons and herds of the sakje learn the lesson of anarchises the scyth kineas said you are the city you the citizens are the city the walls and the citadel are nothing they hold no vote in the assembly not one stone will speak to defend the archon or cleomenes not one house will proclaim him as king or as tyrant no roof will speak to vote a law in his favour no statue will rise to defend the archon do not be slaves to your walls men of olbia you are the city will you vote to continue what you have started you not the archon hold the city in your hands you have the power to make war or peace the presence of a garrison in our citadel is of as much moment to you men of olbia as would the presence this moment of a thief in your shop or rats in your granary it is something we will have to deal with when we return from this war silence the hillside was quiet enough that horses in the kings herds could be heard whickering to one another nicomedes has related how this assembly voted on each step of this war you are not the aggressors you have not marched with fire and spear to burn the lands of macedon or sent mighty fleets to raid their shores and take their women his mockhomeric language and the absurdity of the image olbia launching aggressive war against macedon got him a laugh you sought peace and only sanctioned war when zopryon made clear that he would not accept peace kineas paused took a breath and when he spoke his voice was level quiet but assured zopryon is losing this war he said a hundred voices the men who had ridden north and west to fight the getae were raised kineas lifted a hand enough of you rode north to speak here or anywhere of how badly we defeated zopryons barbarian allies but there have been other conflicts the men of pantecapaeum met the macedonian squadron and destroyed it even now they cruise the hellespont taking a toll from any macedonian ship bold enough to venture north of byzantium even now our allies the sakje are harrying zopryons advance killing his foragers riding in close at night and shooting arrows into their campfires or killing men who go beyond the circle of fires to have a piss zopryon has garrisoned a dozen forts between here and tomis he has divided his force and divided it again to force a passage over the sea of grass and now when his doom is close and the hooves of the sakje echo in his dreams the tyrant of olbia declares that we should put our spears on our shoulders and slink home or face exile the tyrant has betrayed us like tyrants everywhere he thinks that his word can order the will of all men and like a tyrant he gives orders without consulting you kineas found it difficult to decide how this was going down his eyes strayed to familiar faces ajax and leucon and the young men of their generation who stood closest to him were already in full agreement but what of the older men who stood farther back and eumenes stood alone his eyes red today for all his beauty and his heroism he had no friends too late to worry over it today we here are the city of olbia the archon or cleomenes or whoever holds power today in the city has revealed by his proclamation that he is a tyrant kineas raised an arm and shouted he is a tyrant and the assembly responded with shouts and calls he began to feel that he had them his laws are not valid his proclamation is worthless the tyrant of olbia can sit in his citadel with his macedonian garrison and proclaim himself the great king of the medes and the absolute lord of the moon here right here are the bones and sinews of olbia if we stand with the sakje we can destroy zopryon and then we can march home and deal with the rats in our manger at leisure or we can tuck our spears between our legs and drag our asses home to olbia and proclaim ourselves slaves have it as you will you are free men there was a silence and then eumenes came forward leaning on his spear like an older man the crowd parted for him as if he had a disease kineas stepped aside for him and the young man raised his voice my father he said is a traitor the archon is a traitor and i will remain to fight beside the sakje whatever you vote he turned away kineas reached out to him but he turned his face away and walked through the crowd kineas was glad when he saw that ajax was following him other men spoke no man spoke directly for the archon but there were those who questioned their right to assemble and vote barracks lawyers of the commonest sort and more who wanted to march on the city immediately and seize it back from the archon kineas stood with his hand clenched on the bronze socket of his spear he could smell the rain in the air and feel the throb of distant summer lightning he ceased to listen to the men who spoke because he was an owl flying out over the sea of grass flying out of the sun towards the clouds that rose like pillars over the advancing macedonian host and their dust rose like another pillar an ugly brown one at the feet of the monster of dust and men the sakje toiled knots and bunches of them riding close and then riding away he looked for srayanka but from this height the riders were dots in the sea of green they were close though close and the storm was getting ready to break cheers brought him back nicomedes greeted kineas by clasping his hands both of them and embracing him leucon and ajax and men he didnt know as well crowded around many of them were deeply moved one tall man wept openly and others were close to tears or hoarse from shouting even memnon was moved he grunted and smiled before he caught himself kineas and nicomedes were in the middle of more than a thousand men buffeted to and fro by the storm of congratulations i take it we carried the day kineas said as he looked about he felt that the emotion of these men was affecting him his throat was closing his eyes hot nicomedes rolled his eyes my dear hipparch he said you may be the man for an ambush or a cavalry charge but you dont know much about managing an assembly if you had spoken last you might have seen but you didnt as it was nicomedes shrugged i was only worried once when was that kineas asked shouting the sacrifice nicomedes shouted helladius cannot be bribed the old fool a bad omen might have sunk us other than that you were right hipparch to tell them early and often had this treason taken us by surprise suddenly i shudder to think but prepared with time to grumble and drink some wine they never hesitated thank the gods kineas said i must go to the king nicomedes nodded certainly but kineas may i advise you when this war is over our world will change the tyrant will have to be deposed and we will have to have new ways of doing things the way you act with the king all of our relations will set the path for the next generation of men who rule in the euxine cities dont rush to him as if he was our patron act his equal dont appear like an eager supplicant to him send him a message declaring our whole support tell him that we carried the assembly without a count put his mind at ease but do it with a message so that the olbians see that we dont dance to their tune we are allies not subjects kineas gave nicomedes a hard look thinking that way could sink an alliance the man shook his head glare at me all you like an empowered assembly an assembly that has just rejected tyranny is a dangerous powerful animal kineas made a face i dont like it he said there is already too much between me and the king but he waved to ajax ajax went to the king and returned a band of patient wolves came into camp with empty saddles and many wounded a troop of sauromatae nobles armoured from head to foot rode off to the west in close order kineas found that he was standing in the flap of his wagon watching the kings laager and trying to will the man to send for him he was starved for news and his dream his waking dream told him that the danger was close philokles came up rubbing his hands on a piece of linen his hair was clean and his skin newly oiled i have made sacrifice to all the gods philokles said kineas nodded it is a good day to greet the gods he said his eyes still on the kings camp i believe diodorus is doing the same philokles sat on the wagon step using a small knife to get sacrificial blood out from under his nails he nodded absently at the mention of diodorus and said when we get to this battle yes kineas asked he misunderstood philokles purpose itll be different in battle the sakje have some heavy cavalry i was surprised by how well armoured the nobles are and you saw the sauromatae theyre like brick ovens on horses but they cant manoeuvre like us he glanced at philokles and saw that he had missed his mark thats not what you wanted to know is it he said with some embarrassment philokles shook his head no interesting enough but no where do you die do you mind if i do something to prevent it kineas frowned then smiled i think im too used to it it has become the central fact of my existence and yet it is like a burden released i know the hour of my death i know we will triumph it seems almost a fair exchange he shrugged because there was no explaining how he felt about it the fatalism i dont worry as much as i used to he said hoping that this would sound like a joke philokles face grew red and his eyes sparkled and he smacked the wagon bed with his fist so that the whole wagon moved bullshit bullshit hipparch you do not need to die i have great respect for kam baqca but her trances come from drugs from the seeds they all carry i say it again she has foreseen her death and it colours all her dreams he paused took a breath tell me where you die kineas sighed he pointed out at the ford it is not here but it is very like there should be a huge tree on the far bank and driftwood on a beach also on the far side big driftwood whole tree trunks thats what i remember he shrugged i havent really looked philokles stood like a bull breathing through his nose angry or frustrated or both you havent looked do you think the battle will be here looking out the flap in the wagon tent kineas could see eumenes and niceas standing with a third man a big man niceas gestured toward kineas kineas saw that the third man was the sindi smith he poured himself a cup of wine he gestured silently at philokles who nodded and he poured wine for the spartan while he responded i think it will be here yes the road runs to this ford and this is the best ford for stades dozens even hundreds of stades the king assures me this is true even as kineas said this he considered the assertion it was untested he should be exploring himself the sakje were superb horsemen but they were not professional soldiers and hed already seen the difference between their observational skills excellent and their scouting reports pitiful his own sense of fatalism was sapping his professional competence philokles took the wine so what zopryon will just march up to the river see our camp and force a crossing kineas could see niceas and the smith walking up the hill toward the wagon it will depend on how badly the next week hurts him on the spirit that motivates his army i think he will march up to the ford and camp leaving a strong force to block the ford this will free him from night raids and allow his men to sleep and if the sakje have harassed him for a week that sleep will be valuable after hes rested his men and horses for a day perhaps two hell make his move straight across the ford philokles asked alexander or rather parmenion had two ways to deal with this one was to force a crossing with the cavalry and then use them to cover the taxeis when they cross kineas smiled wolfishly that would not work against the sakje if zopryon attempts it he will be beaten swiftly so rather the second method to send the taxeis across with shields locked push up our bank and then move cavalry across under cover of the pikes kineas nodded to himself ive seen it done it has the added charm of demoralizing the foe every unit you get across and formed in line seems like another stitch in his winding sheet philokles finished his wine so it will all hinge on memnon holding the taxeis at the river kineas shook his head no if i have my way well let him cross unopposed well let him have our camp philokles nodded slowly are you perhaps more sakje in your heart than greek is not the loss of your camp the ultimate humiliation kineas shook his head slavery and defeat are the ultimate humiliation but yes in this i am more sakje than greek philokles watched the three men coming they want to speak to you listen then i want to fight on foot with the phalanx im wasted in the saddle and if you are going to sacrifice yourself for glory i refuse to watch it his voice was tight with emotion he looked away steadied himself and his voice became lighter memnon seems to feel that he could use me to keep some youngsters in line kineas suspected it was all prebattle jitters even spartans succumbed he rested a hand on the iron muscles of philokles shoulder fight where you will i swear i intend no sacrifice i would rather live he thought of the ironcoloured horse and the dreams which grew more frequent they were true dreams but he wouldnt tell philokles the details it is almost hubris this assumption of doom philokles put his cup down carefully i tell you if i can break this this dream of ill omen break it i will he grabbed the rib of the wagon tent and swung himself to the ground brushing by niceas and walked off into the evening you remember hephaestes here niceas asked jerking his thumb at the sindi blacksmith kineas swung down with the pitcher of wine he glanced automatically at the kings laager and saw a man dismounting his arms moving feverishly kineas made himself turn away and offered watered wine to niceas then to eumenes whose face had aged ten years in the last day and finally to the smith the smith took the wine cup and set it carefully on the ground i become man of you he said without preamble kineas pursed his lips and shook his head say again he said in sakje the smith nodded my village is destroyed i have no family i will swear gutyramas to you kineas looked at eumenes i dont know that word eumenes shook his head some of our farmers hold land by gutyramas it is more than tenancy almost like joining a family a loyalty bond not just a deal for cash eumenes shrugged farmers bound that way are better workers and more demanding lawsuits dowries like i say they feel they have become family like being adopted as a cousin kineas spread his hands i have no land to give you smith i hold no land the smith rubbed the back of his neck we broke men he said and he pointed down the hill at the other sindi refugees from the north some of us the cruel hands accept others no mans man are no family no farm gone in the smoke he looked up met kineass eye they take me for leading yes i have nothing i offer it and them of you me i seek death but for them i seek life am i speaking so that you hear kineas nodded wishing he had ataelus but ataelus was pursuing his dream of a horse herd with srayanka and the cruel hands to niceas he said can we feed them fifty men i expect we can what would we do with them camp servants we have enough niceas raised an eyebrow kineas nodded he gestured to the smith whats your name he asked temerix he said then frowned the sindi form of hephaestes eumenes put in come with me then he said finally an excuse to go to the king he walked up the hill to the kings laager followed by temerix and niceas nobody challenged them at the gate of the laager and the king sat on the tongue of his wagon straightening arrows with marthax kam baqca sat on the grass her leather skirts gathered around her sipping tea kineas the king said getting to his feet his pleasure was unfeigned kineas stopped and gave a military salute and then led the smith forward he explained the situation in a few words and the king watched him carefully and then asked the smith sharp questions in unaccented sindi the smith answered in single words the king turned to kineas if you do this thing you may create tension with the cruel hands these are their people it seems to me that theyve been allowed to fall through the cracks in the pot while we carried on the war this man says you rescued his band and he wants to swear his oath to you the kings displeasure was obvious if i let him swear to you i make you a lord he said i am not sure that i am prepared to make you a lord and i suspect i would insult my cousin srayanka will not forgive either of us knowing that will you accept his oath and be his lord kineas shook his head i do not desire to be any mans lord the king was visibly taken aback then he said just when i think i know you greeks you shock me again that you must vote to make a war that is already upon you that you will own a slave but will not take a mans oath of service kineas held the kings eye i will not be his lord he said i will take him and all his men in service as psiloi and i will pay them a wage and see that they are fed and when srayanka returns i will see that those who wish her lordship receive it the king nodded and rubbed his chin he spoke again in sindi and after a while the smith nodded he offered kineas his hand and they shook and then niceas took the smith away to find him and his band a place to camp instead of the wet river bank where they had been in hiding for days what news kineas asked when they were gone the king glanced at marthax and then at kam baqca the three held each others eyes excluding kineas then they all turned to kineas together we wondered how long you could remain absent the king said kineas took an arrow from the kings pile and held it up to the sun the arrowhead had three blades each wickedly barbed on the back cast in bronze i have to act the hipparch he said finally what we did in the assembly the effects will linger a long time in effect we deposed the archon who may already be dead kam baqca said in her odd ionic greek you have seen it i see nothing but the monster on the sea of grass but people tell me tales the king nodded and the distance kineas had felt on the ride back from the getae campaign was there and deeper too there was pain in the kings eyes i too have to act i have dead this day kineas too many dead because as you said zopryon learned quickly thessalian cavalry smashed the patient wolves a simple trap a hundred empty saddles and an angry clan kineas bent his head the king went on your tyrant killed those men if you had been here to advise they would not have ridden off so eagerly so blindly the second time or they would have marthax said with a harsh shrug dont make too much of it lord we have dealt raking wounds and taken a bee sting in return the king swung to kineas just as you predicted he learns quickly now the boat is fully in current is it not and i must ride it until it washes up at my destination or smashes on the rocks this battle it is close now is it not he glared at both of them i am now committed to the battle you wanted kineas stood still he looked at kam baqca and she swirled the tea in her cup and looked at the last leaves there he could smell the resin and pine odour of her drug on the wind there was a brazier lit at her feet she raised her head and their eyes met her eyes were huge deep and brown and in them he could see the column moving across the sea of grass as he swooped lower and lower and he could see the bands of sakje spread around the column for stades in all directions the macedonian column came on like a mans boot kicking an anthill but the ants rode in closer bolder than real ants and every ant dealt a wound but the seeing faded into another seeing and the macedonian column became a snake with a huge head or a giant maggot eating everything in its path and spewing wreckage out the tail chewing on sakje and olbians on triremes and city walls exuding the excrement of burned homes and fields of stubble fresh graves and unburied corpses and she grimaced at him a very male look on her madeup face it is all i can see she said there was pain in her voice you too yes said kineas it comes to me awake now she nodded it will come more and more often you are a strong dreamer she looked at her tea leaves for the first time i begin to hope for death because i cannot bear to watch the monster cross the plains the defiler the tyrant everything it touches is polluted stripped killed it will take me soon enough she narrowed her eyes my body will be dung for the monster she whispered kineas glanced at the king and marthax marthax seemed to pretend he had heard nothing the king turned away embarrassed or saddened it is all i can see she said again i am no use to the king and i fear to tell him anything lest i rush him to this battle i have raised the spirits that will fight i have done what i can now i just sit and drink tea and wait for doom kineas nodded it is close he said he found that despite everything he wanted to comfort her she looked at him across her teacup and her eyes drew him again he looked away rather than fall back into the dream the smell of her drug was powerful she said kineas it is all balanced on a knife edge the king ignored her and waved at the plains we havent slowed him as much as we hoped his vanguard will be here tomorrow or the next day at the latest kineas nodded the king gave a small shrug since we began to harass him he has pressed harder his army is wounded as marthax says we have hit hard the faster he moves the more stragglers he has and no straggler lives to see another dawn but he is moving fast now another day perhaps two hes leaving everything behind to make speed kineas nodded best recall the clans we want the army on this side before zopryon closes the ford the king gave him an angry glance im doing my best hipparch kineas leaned forward let me help the battle was closer closer by a week than he had expected a week less of life when he allowed himself to think about it he was neither completely committed to the idea of death nor had he thought through all of the ramifications of his dream the battlefield for instance if his death dream was accurate the battle would not be fought at the great bend this thought had tripped across the stage of his mind before but this time fresh from the king and riding a surge of excitement and worry kineas elected to do something about it and the time was now his battle was upon him no more than two days away hed spent an hour thinking just how the battle would happen philokles had challenged his assumptions philokles was right he hailed niceas and ordered him to fetch heron the hipparch of pantecapaeum heron had learned quite a few lessons at cleituss knee if three weeks had not transformed him into the image of hektor if he had not yet learned to be courteous professional or polite he had learned to be silent he stood at every command meeting among the greeks a little distant from the others a little hesitant to join in comment or laughter he was a tall man and he loomed over them silent and at times sullen kineas wanted to give the man a new start and raise him in his own estimation heron he said as the man came up hipparch heron replied with a civil salute he was so tall that he appeared clumsy and his legs were too long to look good on a horse and he was dour perhaps a reaction to being born ugly he crossed his arms not from nerves but because they were so long that he had to do something with them kineas who was too short to be accounted really handsome felt some fellow feeling for the boy due to his ungainliness heron had something about him that suggested that when he was tested he would not be found wanting despite his attitude after offering him wine kineas went straight to business i need the river scouted north and south the sakje tell me there are no fords for a hundred stades id like to know that myself im going to give you the picked scouts of all the troops go south first the greatest calamity at this point would be if zopryon got between us and olbia kineas winced even as he made the comment with the archons treason if zopryon could slip past them to the south he could rest his army at olbia receive supplies and march up the river at his leisure it had occurred to him that zopryon might march straight to olbia trusting to the ferry at the river mouth to get his army across and into the city that was a possibility against which kineas and the king had no plan kineas rubbed his right hand over his forehead and down his nose sighed and looked up at heron who stood silently i need the river scouted as far south as the bend of trees have your men test the water really look at it we cant afford a surprise as soon as you have swept the south come back here and go north heron straightened very well he saluted with ill grace i perceive that you send me from the camp where do i find these picked scouts kineas gestured to niceas crax sitalkes antigonus and twenty more of your choice niceas and lykeles with laertes as acting hyperetes niceass eyebrows twitched yes hipparch he said with a shade of edge to his voice heron this is a vital task do it well listen to lykeles and laertes ride like the wind i need to know my flank is secure by nightfall tomorrow heron saluted nothing about the man suggested that he was pleased to be given an important mission nor did he offer any hint of insubordination he walked off back stiff and niceas shook his head diodorus would have been more the mark if you dont mind my saying kineas picked his cloak off his equipment pile by the fire and threw it over his shoulders i need diodorus we may be fighting by tomorrow night he shrugged call me a fool something tells me that young heron will do well and hes the man i can spare he shivered darkness was falling and the weight of all his responsibilities was pressing rational thought from his mind zopryon where would he try to cross would he march to olbia the olbians would they fight would their newfound attempt at democracy last through a cold night before battle or would they melt away food firewood fodder for horses the number of lame mounts srayanka was still across the ford so were half the sakje horse and most of the clan leaders srayanka he clamped down on those thoughts zeus guide me he muttered niceas pressed a cup of warm tea into his hands and he drank and shivered when the warmth surged down his throat thanks he said now get me all the greek officers memnon included its time to talk through how we will fight diodorus was the first in despite his worries kineas was pleased to see how naturally diodorus had taken to command indeed it was now hard to imagine that the man had been a gentleman trooper for four years of campaigning grumbling about taking his shift on guard complaining about the weight of his javelins he appeared taller and his splendid breastplate and crested helm even his stance with his legs a little spread and his hand on his hip spoke of a commander as did the slight hollows under his eyes ive barely seen you kineas said taking his hand diodorus had taken command of the pickets around the camp as soon as kineas took command of the olbians he returned the pressure and took a cup of hot wine from one of the sindi men around the fire cleomenes he said quietly bastard worse than home kineas raised an eyebrow knowing that diodorus meant the thirty tyrants in athens the vote wasnt even close the men will be fine diodorus shook his head i saw it coming philokles saw it coming we all saw it and we couldnt prevent it he took a drink of wine and glanced at eumenes who stood with ajax at the next fire and that boys father killed old cleitus its worse than fucking athens he glared and now the bastard can swing south and have a base kineas nodded watching memnons black cloak coming towards the fire im taking precautions if he knows he can cut straight south march right past us and cross at the ferry diodorus drew a rough map in the scorched soil at the edge of the fire pit kineas raised his hands to the gods i dont think he will i think his own image his idea of who he is will require him to come right up to our army and fight it he frowned cleomenes im assuming hes in charge in the city has raised the stakes in exchange for personal power he has traded our futures now if we lose zopryon really will get the city and if zopryon knows that all the more reason to fight a battle he must think that one big fight and the whole sea of grass is his the euxine cities the gold of the scyths everything while they talked the others had gathered and the last light was gone from the sky so that a ring of faces pale and dark listened intently as diodorus and kineas discussed the campaign memnon stood with his lieutenant licurgus and the commander of the phalanx of pantecapaeum kleisthenes nicomedes stood with ajax and leucon with eumenes and niceas kineas turned from diodorus to face all of them the waiting is over zopryon has made good time he has according to the king abandoned his weak and his wounded to move faster in the last week and he is almost upon us tomorrow the king will recall the clans who have harassed zopryons march we will stand to from the rise of the sun the phalanx of olbia will draw up to the north of the ford right here at the base of our hill the phalanx of pantecapaeum will draw up to the south of the ford as soon as you are in place you will drill in closing the ford kineas drew in the black earth the phalanx of olbia will practise closing files and marching by ranks to the left the phalanx of pantecapaeum will practise marching by ranks to the right you see how this will allow us to close the ford quickly without panic all the officers nodded memnon snorted we dont need to practise marching by ranks hipparch kineas looked at memnon memnon met his eye but shifted oh all right well march up and down a little kineas relented even if the men dont need the practice it will help show the sakje what were about fair enough memnon said whatre you fancy horse boys doing while we pound the dirt kineas pointed off into the gloom to the west diodorus and nicomedes will take their men across the ford at first light they will establish a line of pickets five stades out from the ford diodorus will have the command he will make sure that the ford is not surprised he will pass every returning clan and provide them with a herald to pass the ford leucon will keep his men right here as a reserve and as messengers for me and for the king should he need them leucon will take the men of pantecapaeum under his command until their hipparch returns everyone understand were going to provide security at the ford until the kings army has returned the loss of the ford to a surprise would be a catastrophe ajax raised a hand are there other fords kineas rubbed his beard with his right hand the sakje say not i have heron of pantecapaeum scouting the river for a hundred stades either way to make sure he made a sour face i should have been scouting them three days ago now were pressed for time any other questions memnon grunted if they do come for the ford what then kineas raised his voice tomorrow and until i say different if they make a dash for the ford we close our ranks and stop them its not the battle i want but we cant give up the ford until our army is back so we have no plan for tomorrow beyond this hold your ground memnon nodded i like a simple plan how big a fight will this be as big as issus kineas thought over what the king had said and what he had seen in kam baqcas fire yes as big as issus memnon jerked his thumb at the huddle of sindi men at the next fire where do you plan to put them kineas shook his head i hadnt given it any thought he said feeling foolish memnon had the ability to get straight under his professional skin memnon grinned psiloi cant win a fight but they can change one ill put them in the trees right by the ford where theyll have a clear shot with their bows right into the unshielded side of the taxeis leave it to me kineas agreed so muster them with the hoplites he said anything else nicomedes leaned forward what are the odds he asked kineas gave the man a thin smile ask me tomorrow ask me after i lay eyes on his vanguard right now were all starting at shadows my stomach is flipping like a flute girl in the last hour of a symposium and every time i glance at the rising moon i think of ten more things i ought to have done he hoped it was the time for such frankness if zopryon will cooperate by coming here and camping across the river and offering the battle weve prepared for all summer then with the aid of the gods i would say we were worth a sizeable bet he shrugged thinking again that the great bend was not the site of his dream battle eumenes eyes brimmed with pain and hero worship you will beat them he said from your lips to the ears of the gods kineas replied flinching from eumenes obvious passion he poured wine from his cup as a libation and his hand shook and the wine flowed over his hand like dark blood with dawn came thunder that shook the earth rivalling the hoof beats of the returning sakje fog covered the sun and swathed the riverbanks for a stade so that a man could only see the length of his spear and every returning sakje warrior was a cause for alarm ten horses sounded like a hundred a hundred sounded like ten thousand by the time the fog burned off the nerves of the greek contingent were stretched taut but they had become accomplished at passing the returning clans across the ford the king came with the sun he was on a plain riding horse a short chestnut and he wore no armour and rode alone he pulled up next to kineas and sat silently as memnon and his officers marched the two phalanxes back and forth on the flat ground just short of the ford i hope you approve kineas said do you really think zopryon will try to surprise the ford satrax asked kineas scratched his jaw with the butt of his whip no he admitted but wed look like fools if he did and we werent ready marthax rode up on the kings far side he was on a warhorse with his gorytos belted on and a short sword although he wore no armour he pointed across the river rain today more rain tomorrow he said all three of them knew that rain could only benefit zopryon hour by hour the clouds blew in from the east and the sky darkened hour by hour the sakje came in from the west some triumphant some beaten there were empty saddles and bodies sprawled over the backs of horses a barechested woman reared her horse at the edge of the ford to show the heads she had taken and a troop of sauromatae eyes redrimmed from fatigue halted in front of the king to show him their trophies hair a helmet several swords the king rode among them congratulating the victorious speaking softly to the wounded teasing a reluctant clan leader and praising another for brave deeds kineas dismounted to drink water and stretch his legs and then remounted in midafternoon the thunder heads finally came to them and the long line of darkness that seemed like the herald of the macedonians moved into the river valley and the rain began a few messengers had ridden up every hour since midmorning their hoof beats the only sign that time was moving but as the rain came faster and harder the number of messengers increased the king had moved down the hill to the ford as kineas watched the kings household knights joined him he dismounted and two men began to help him into his armour kineas rode down the hill with his own staff he knew ataelus as soon as the man rode out of the wall of rain to the west ataelus had been with srayanka kineas found his heart beating faster kineas pushed his horse through the kings household they were grimfaced ataelus greeted him with a weary smile too tired for fighting he said too much damn fighting the king had just settled his scale hauberk on his shoulders srayanka is covering the last group shes pressed hard ataelus put a hand on kineass arm big fight cruel hands and standing horses and some patient wolves we trick them they trick us we trick them fight like he swept his hand like a man stirring a pot round and round we shoot until for no arrows bronze hats fight until horses fail then draw off and the lady srayanka lets for go let patient wolves ride then let hungry wolves ride he pointed out into the rain just there they come and cruel hands come after kineas stared into the gloom i have two troops across the stream a hundred heavy horse let me fetch her in marthax nodded vehemently good take greek horse and sauromatae here go with one hand he physically restrained the king you sit here and wait he said to kineas he called remember brother this is not the battle we want the king had his armour on he spoke in rapid sakje his voice imperative he was telling marthax that he intended to ride to support srayanka himself with his household knights kineas turned his horse back lord you must not he said selfinterest and the needs of the allies marched together and he spoke with confidence this is not a risk we can take the king drew himself up his mouth was hard under the sides of his helmet do i command here he asked marthax grabbed his bridle no he said and to kineas he shouted ride kineas didnt hesitate he turned his horse and rode for the ford he had niceas at his heels sound the rally he said to sitalkes he called my charger the trumpet rang out echoing strangely in the moist air kineas waved to leucon who could still see him sitalkes came with thanatos kineas mounted his tall black and pushed him into the ford the ford seemed vast in the rain kineas felt too slow as if his men were riding in honey not water are you calling us back called nicomedes from the far shore kineas clenched his knees and rose on the horses back no form on your bank leave room for leucon disembodied nicomedes called assent he could be heard wheeling his men into line other voices could be heard to the south the rain came down harder trickling cold between the shoulder blades and back plate of bronze running over the helmet to soak into a mans hair thanatoss hooves were on gravel and then on grass and he was clear of the ford he put his horse to a canter and aimed at nicomedes voice niceas was right with him still blowing the rally it was hard to look straight into the rain but kineas finally saw nicomedes his cloak was unmistakable his men were already formed in a solid block half a stade to the south diodorus was rallying his pickets and forming kineas reined in and pointed to niceas leucon right there he said pointing to the north of nicomedes troop leucons men and the troop from pantecapaeum were coming across the ford in good order beyond them the heavily armoured sauromatae were crossing just the way they moved showed that their mounts were tired ataelus rode up kineas leaned over and put a hand on his back i need to know exactly where srayanka is he said can you link us up ataelus grinned he blew his nose in his hand jumped off his horse and swung up on a remount he had on a lead sure he said he waved and rode off into the rain kineas rode to leucon i need eumenes he said leucon nodded kineas continued hold the line dont lose your place if we have to charge halt the moment you hear the signal and retire in good order if everything goes to shit get back across the ford we do not want a battle tonight understand leucon saluted line retire in order avoid a general engagement kineas returned the salute youll make a general yet he turned to eumenes leave your troop and go to the sauromatae stay with them and pass my commands for the moment they are my reserve try to explain reserve to them without twisting their reins eumenes nodded and rode away shoulders slumped leucon had not yet said anything about his fathers murder but neither had he spoken a word to his hyperetes in three days except to give an order kineas rode back to niceas the line was formed three dense blocks of men with a looser line of sauromatae in the rear sound advance kineas said to niceas the whole block began to walk forward in twenty steps the ford was gone behind them in forty steps they began to lose sight of the hills beyond the ford a band of sakje appeared out of the rain riding hard their first appearance gave alarm but just as quickly they were identified patient wolves they showed their empty gorytos as they rode by and indicated by gestures that the enemy was close lightning flashed in the time it took to illuminate the faces of his men kineas realized that this might be it the fight his death silly thought equally true for every man there kineas rode along the front too busy to dwell on mortality he ordered all three troops to put their flank files out to prevent surprise they passed another band of patient wolves and then the first cruel hands easily identified because every horse had the painted hand on its rump then more and more hundreds of them pouring by not routed but drained done ataelus rode up to him she just ahead now he said bronze hats not so close careful since heard for trumpets he pointed at niceas for emphasis the rain was coming right into their faces halt kineas called niceas played it they sat on their horses as the rain fell drowning out the noise of the plain and even whatever sound of fighting there might have been kineas couldnt hear anything but the beat of the rain on his helmet he pulled the thing off tucked it under his arm he turned to niceas intending to speak and niceas pointed silently over kineass shoulder she was right in front of him just a few horse lengths away she was riding looking over her shoulder kineas tapped his stallion into motion and cantered up to her the hoof beats warned her and she turned in time to see him and she gave him a tired smile it was the first smile hed had from her in a long time even if it was only the smile of one commander to another almost they are beating me she said she was feeling in her gorytos for an arrow and not finding any take your people straight through kineas said useless admonition she had only a dozen of her household about her he put his hand to her face and withdrew it it had gone there without his conscious volition straight through my line ill cover you he said as much to reestablish their military roles as to inform her cruel hands cover the rear always her eyebrows were up and her eyes still had a spark in them then she rolled her shoulders bowstrings wet no more arrows long day kineas saw more and more cruel hands emerging from the murk it wasnt just the rain afternoon was turning to evening srayanka raised a bone to her lips and blew on it and her trumpeter rode up hirene had a length of linen around her arm and blood on her saddle but her face had fewer lines than srayankas she raised her trumpet and blew a twotone note with a trill a barbaric sound that rang harshly through the rain and was soaked up by the grass and suddenly the rain was spitting cruel hands pushing their jaded horses into a gallop or changing horses abandoning the most blown kineas had the impression of many wounds and immense fatigue and then the last of them were past him streaming through the gaps between his troops get across the ford he said in his command voice he pointed with his whip she raised an eyebrow and motioned with her whip touched her heels to her mount and galloped off her back straight and her head high as she rode off he thought of all the things he might have said instead of bellowing orders at her instead he turned to ataelus how far he asked pointing into the rain how far to the enemy ataelus pulled a strung bow from his gorytos set an arrow to the string and shot it in one fluid motion the arrowhead pointed almost to the sky before he loosed arcing away into the grey and dropping a horse screamed just there ataelus said zeus father of all poseidon lord of horses kineas swore and then turned to niceas sound advance niceas blew the signal as they walked forward i thought we were avoiding a general engagement sound trot kineas called he could feel his three blocks keeping their line feel it in the sound of their hooves and the vibration of the ground it could all be a vast trap he was half turned to order the charge his throwing javelin just transferred to his right fist when he saw the plumes and then the whole man emerge from the rain two horse lengths away charge he bellowed they were thessalians yellow and purple cloaks good armour big horses and they were at a stand kineass charger leaped from the trot to the gallop in two strides and kineass javelin hit the thessalians horse their ranks were well formed firm and tight but he took in their fatigue in his first glance kineass horse shouldered past the wounded beast and pushed between the next two lashing out with teeth and hooves to clear a way and the whole troop flinched at his assault kineas used his second javelin like a sailor with a boarding pike sweeping it to the right and left tangling the troopers and knocking them off their mounts and then the whole weight of his olbians arrived and the enemy formation shattered whatever their cautious officer had expected a charge out of the rain by formed cavalry wasnt it they were gone in an instant they ran like professionals leaving only a handful of bodies on the ground the rain swallowed them up kineas rose on his horses back and bellowed niceas in a voice that threatened to burst his lungs here replied his hyperetes here i am sound recall kineas pushed his horse out of the mob of his own troopers too many of them were gone into the rain showing their inexperience by pursuing the thessalians he rode back along the line of their advance until he saw the damply gleaming shapes of the sauromatae eumenes were retiring we had a fight no idea what we hit well rally at the ford cover us he turned and rode back to his own men who were falling in on the trumpets and turning about a dangerous manoeuvre with the possibility of an unbeaten enemy somewhere in the rain kineas watched them it seemed to take an eon and then another he could see movement in the rain bright colour to his right red cloaks new enemy cavalry nicomedes troop was half a stade to the rear and well formed ajaxs voice ordered men into the line to close tight close tight diodorus was well clear gone into the rain leucon was having more trouble with the mix of men he had kineas rode over now leucon he called leucon shook his head the men of pantecapaeum were having trouble finding their places in the rain and excitement there were shouts to their front niceas pointed too many unrallied men and now theyre getting snapped up we need to get out of here kineas could feel the enemy cavalry gathering to his front he heard a trumpet leucon he shouted away run for the ford leucon pushed his helmet back swatted a man with the flat of his sword and opened his mouth to shout an order a javelin punched through his neck and he seemed to vomit blood and then he was down and a line of thessalians came out of the rain and smashed into leucons troop kineass horse was away with his first touch flying ignominiously for the ford he was well out front safe enough and he looked back for niceas who was right at his heels the rain cleared a little and he saw the sauromatae charge straight through the broken line of leucons men they struck the thessalians with a sound like a hundred men beating a hundred copper kettles with spoons and the thessalians were stopped in their tracks leucons men were the youngest and best among the olbian hippeis the moment they saw the allied sauromatae they turned the red cloaks were evenly matched javelins flew and men fell the whole line both lines threaded through the combat like shuttles on a loom and then swirled into chaos in a matter of hoof beats kineas tore his eyes away time would be counted in heartbeats now the engagement he didnt want was starting half his command was committed and if zopryon had more cavalry to commit he could win a sharp victory before nightfall kineas bore right for diodorus diodorus was there before him his men already wheeled off to the left and reformed follow me kineas yelled and turned his horse the stallion responded again a magnificent animal the best war mount he had ever possessed he led diodoruss troop up the right flank of the enemy guessing their location by sound and intuition their arrival panicked the red cloaks and they broke but this time they were tangled in the melee to their front and they took casualties breaking off their horses were done and they died in dozens cut down from behind or trapped in the mud on foundered horses and the relative freshness of the olbians began to tell then kineas heard another voice like a giant in the dark ajax with nicomedes troop closing in on the doomed red cloaks from the other flank and even in the murk he could see eumenes his sword wet with blood exhorting the younger olbians to rally to press harder scenting victory kineas harried them unhorsed a trooper cut another mans arm and then killed their trumpeter in three quick fights in a flash of lightning he saw their commander in an ornate gilded breastplate and he charged the man a man he knew but the officer declined the combat and galloped for the safety of the rear his horse at least had the energy to run phillip kontos kineas thought a man he respected and now sought to kill kineas pursued a half a stade reined in peered into the gloom he was alone he realized that he was farther down the field than he had intended and that he had lost his hyperetes rally he called his voice hoarse rising cracking with the third repetition a sauromatae rode up to him and pointed back to the ford as if he was a young trooper who needed direction ataelus came up out of the rain grabbed at his reins and shouted pike men and pointed into the rain kineas squinted and saw far too close a column of heavy infantry he pulled his horses head around in the middle distance he could hear niceass trumpet hed ridden too far been a fool carried away in the charge he leaned forward on his horses neck and put his head down in case the macedonians had archers this was their army he was right in among them a stade or less from their pike men he pulled up at the first big knot of his own men he was pleased to note that his horse still flowed over the ground and shouted shrilly for them to fall back the pike men a full taxeis were forming from column into their combat formation with gestures with the flat of his sword with ataelus calling in sakje he moved his men back back to the line of the first charge and then back to where niceas was sounding the recall niceas was exactly where he ought to be he had a cut on his bridle arm and his helmet was gone and he was still blowing his trumpet and his face as kineas came out of the rain was like a fathers with a strayed infant love relief anger all born together niceas put his trumpet on his hip and glared at kineas where the fuck were you he yelled playing achilles like a fool kineas yelled back they were forming again kineas was proud of them hard enough to form after a fight you win harder to form after two and leucons men had been shattered lost their captain and they were pushing into their ranks ready for a third go their horses were done and no one had a javelin heavy or light kineas expected it to be darker it was as if no time had passed from the first encounter off in the rain and the ground fog that was rising to meet it a macedonian trumpet sounded and then another a few stades to the south there was shouting niceas panted for a few breaths are we winning or losing he asked then he grinned arent you the man who ordered us to avoid a general engagement kineas shrugged his attention focused on the rallying troopers i take your point old man lets get across the river where are the sauromatae niceas pointed to the centre of the line eumenes got them halted all but a handful kineas rode to eumenes take command of your troop he said leucon is dead eumenes face fell his mouth opened and shut like a gaffed fish and nothing came out kineas pointed again take command he said his voice betrayed him coming out as a squeak the reaction hit them all after they were successfully across the ford riding in good order despite the rain and their own wounded they were cold and wet and tired too tired to cook or curry horses and the officers had to bear down nicomedes and ajax were as brutal as kineas using the whip of their tongues to berate any man whose horse was untended or gear abandoned on the grass niceas pulled one of the younger men away from a fire and threw him to the ground discipline was restored and then after the first few minutes the soul fatigue passed kineas thanked all the gods for the sindi who sprang into action building fires tending wounds and cooking warriors came from the other camps olbian hoplites and then a few standing horses and some patient wolves they came in the rain with a jar of mead or a skin of wine or a haunch of cooked meat and the fires roared higher pushing the rain back into the sky men ate their food and drank some wine or gifted mead and the silence broke suddenly everyone had to talk to tell his story kineas still had his breastplate on and his helmet under his arm standing cloakless in the rain watching for another outburst of insubordination already beset with the next phalanx of worries philokles had missed the whole engagement but waiting had taken its own toil now he was half drunk and he pawed at kineas trying to get his armour off dont be an idiot kineas snapped i dont want it off yet whos an idiot philokles answered i didnt ride off into the macedonian lines ajax says you were like a god are you looking for death or are you a fool kineas shook his head im a poor general once i start fighting im lost blind i focus on the man in front of me and then the next he shrugged his own reaction beginning to set in i ran across an old rival put him down asked philokles he ran kineas said philokles pulled the helmet out from under kineass arm get this statuary off your hide brother live a little step out of the tyrants grasp for the evening go kiss medea if i cant bring you to sense perhaps she can kineas relinquished his helmet youre drunk brother bah i am drunk you should try it greek wine gives dreams from greek gods no dreams of death who dreams of death asked diodorus he was rubbing his hair with his tunic and was otherwise naked that was the ugliest action ive ever been in ajax came up behind him he was flushed i wondered it was like no fight you described kineas put an arm around ajax that was the animal he said to the young man and gave him a squeeze you did well kineas dreams of death philokles said into a moment of silence and then shut his mouth with a snap diodorus went on did we surprise them did they surprise us i dont even know who won what he looked at philokles and then at kineas you have dreamed your own death kineas fumbled with the sash he wore around his breastplate philokles is drunk diodorus took the spartan cup from philokles hand and drained it good plan death dreams are all pigswill i should know i always dream my death before an action i dreamed of death last night and doubtless ill dream of it again tonight philokles gazed at his nowempty cup will it be tomorrow he asked quietly he didnt seem so drunk of a sudden kineas got his sash untied and managed to open his breast and back plate maybe i dont know he looked around the campfires wheres heron niceas appeared from the rain with arni ajaxs slave arni pulled the wet tunic over kineass head and pulled a drier one down over him niceas shook his head heron isnt back neither are his men crap kineas said wheres ataelus niceas shrugged he got a couple of horses at the end of the fight he said i think hes wooing a girl of the cruel hands kineas pulled his wet cloak over his almostdry tunic ill find him he hated to leave them they were in the glow that comes after successful action and he was headed for black depression but something nagged him heron kineas crossed the hill to the cruel hands and his back was slapped many times sakje offered him wine or mares milk or spiced tea in deep mugs and he drank some of each as he passed from fire to fire asking after ataelus he found srayankas wagon first he heard her laughter and he rested his hand on the wheel wondering he had never sought her out since the night by the river and now he felt foolish like a suitor waiting in the rain more laughter carried through the felt of the tent on the wagon bed kineas heard parshtaevalts deeper laugh and he pulled himself up on the step and called hello in greek parshtaevalts hand opened the flap the tent was lit by a brazier and dense with smoke from the seeds and the stems the pinepitch scent flowed past him into the night hah called parshtaevalt he put a hand on kineass neck and hugged him then pulled him through the door to the bench that ran the length of the wagon seat by day bed by night the wagon was full of people stifling with wet wool and smoke hands reached out and pushed him prodded him until he sank into a warm space between two bodies one of them was srayanka and before he was on the bench one of her hands had snaked into his tunic and her mouth closed over his he kissed her so deeply that he breathed from her lungs and she from his and the fire in his skin burned his tunic dry as she curled around him on the bench it was dark in the wagon the red coals in the brazier threw no real light and despite his knowledge that hirene was under his left hand he felt as if they were alone and every breath of the air intensified his desire you came she said around his kiss as if she didnt believe it he had come looking for something his hand was under her tunic tracing the line where the soft ivory of her breast met the lusher skin of her nipple and she sank her teeth into his arm and he gasped taking a deeper breath of the smoke off the brazier the worm was close the mandibles of its mouth chewing away at everything in its path and his gorge rose as it ate leucons face off his skull ataelus kineas cried he pushed her away he wondered if he was going mad she grabbed his hand and he resisted but she was strong and she pulled him pushed him and suddenly he was falling it was wet and he was slumped at the wheel hub she jumped down on the wet grass beside him you are easy for the smoke she said she admonished him with a finger breathe deep go under wagon and breathe stay with me he said but she shook her head too much too fast you breathe i find ataelax he with samahe do what we should do but for sastar baqca and the king and she was gone his head was clear when she came back with ataelus behind her like a spare horse kineas didnt feel like a commander and he knew he didnt look like one but he pulled ataelus close i sent heron the hipparch from pantecapaeum downriver this morning to scout for fords no ford downriver ataelus answered there was another man with him no a woman she had her arms crossed over her chest and anger dripped off her with the rainwater this samahe wife for me he grinned twenty horse wife kineas shook his hand which was inane i need to know where heron is and what he found ataelus frowned and looked at kineas from under his brows you ask me to ride off in the rain now for this heron kineas said yes ataelus took a deep breath for you he asked for me kineas said he lacked the language to explain just why he was so worried suddenly about his missing hipparch but he was when he was gone samahe protesting volubly after him kineas sat on the dry ground under her wagon srayanka sat against his back they were silent for a long time finally she said if we win when we win you bring me twenty of horses is that your price he asked she laughed a low rich laugh i am beyond price she said in sakje leaning around to look at him i want you like a mare in heat wants a stallion and i would go with you for a handful of grass like a priestess that is one woman i am she threw back her head and her profile was strong against the light of the nearest fire but i am ghan of the cruel hands and there is no bride price to buy me she shrugged the king would make me queen and that would make cruel hands rich i am woman and i am ghan she looked into his eyes hers were picked out with reflected campfires but if we win this battle she said again if we are free of the sastar baqca will you ask me to wife kineas pushed his back into hers if we live i will ask you to wife he kissed her felt the movement of her eyelashes against his cheeks i know baqca what is sastar she wriggled slightly in his arms what is the thing the word you say when man rule over other men and will not hear them rule alone no voice but that man tyrant kineas answered after a moment tyrant she echoed sastar is like tyrant sastar baqca the baqca that allows no other voice she turned and put her arms behind his head no more greek and sakje no said kineas death seemed far away and everything seemed possible i will marry you he kissed her again she grinned even through the kiss pulled away and looked at him truly she asked she smiled kissed him and then pushed him away bring me zopryons head as my price then she leaped to her feet kineas got to his still holding her hand their eyes were locked she gave his hand a gentle pressure and then she was stepping away the rain sobered him and in moments it all came rushing back the battle plans worries where in hades is heron and the plain fact this is foolishness ill be dead but he forced a laugh and said its a high price she slipped out from under the wagon and turned it will make a good song she said with a smile you know they already sing of us kineas didnt know really he called after her she paused in the rain on the step up to the wagon we may live for ever in a song he stopped at the kings laager to report then walked drenched down the hill to issue his last orders at the campfires the night was half spent when he pushed through the curtain into his wagon he had the energy to strip his tunic to hang his sodden cloak from the ridgepole and then he lay down on the bed he lay awake for a time and again he wondered if the gods had sent madness to him he didnt want to close his eyes and then he did the worm was moving a thousand legs pushing its obscene bulk across the wet grass to the river a dozen obscene mouths chewing at anything that came under their jaws dead horses dead men grass he circled above the worm seeing it with two visions as the worm was the monster and as the men and horses and wagons that composed the worm like reading a scroll and understanding the whole of it at the same time or like seeing every stone in a mosaic and seeing the whole design he pushed against the dream and the owl turned away from the worm and flew south the first time he had been in control in a dream the owl beat its wings and the stades flew by grey and indistinct in the constant rain but he saw horsemen moving on the west bank of the river a dozen parties pushing south then he let his dream self have its head and turn north back to the worm on the sea of grass it was horrible but the horror had a familiarity to it because he himself had been the legs of the worm and the mouth he knew the smell his dream self turned east over the river which had a dull glow in the dream rain and then he was descending and there was the tree no longer a tower of greenblack majesty the tree was dying the cedar bark was hard under his talons the leaves and needles fallen away in swathes like sick animal loses hair exposing bare wood and rotten bark and the top had already cracked and fallen away he landed grasping a solid branch and it too cracked and he was falling from his horse an arrow in his throat choking on the hard pain and the rush of blood bitter copper and salt in his mouth in his nose and in his last moments of life he tried to see tried to remember if the battle was won but it all went away beyond his eyes leaving only her voice singing and he couldnt remember her name he listened to her dawn somewhere above the rain said a voice a hand pulling at his shoulder good news for you get up huh he asked he felt as if hed been beaten like bread dough dawn eumenes is ready to ride your orders are you awake asked philokles he was naked and wet laertes is here with a prisoner kineas sat up the tunic he had stripped off before sleep was as wet now as it had been when he put his head down so was his cloak he threw the cloak over his shoulders and swung down from the wagon stifled in the smell of wet wool philokles swung down behind him its not cold he said were not all spartans kineas said in fact he was as always hesitant to show his body naked even on the edge of battle he smiled at his own vanity ataelus was sitting at his fire with laertes crax sitalkes and another warrior a man lay at laertes feet with curly blond hair and bare legs covered by a dark red cloak the prisoner unless he was already a corpse the rest of them were passing around a horn cup that steamed kineas intercepted it morning he said the meaning of ataelus presence hit him through the last of his sleep he put a hand on craxs shoulder where is heron he asked and then he pointed at the stranger in the cloak whos he crax grinned hes a fool i caught him he prodded the recumbent form with his boot sitalkes hit him too hard kineas began to stretch his muscles i think i need the whole story laertes grinned and snatched the cup back herons thorough hipparch give him that we went sixty maybe even eighty stades and we pushed our spears into every bank on the damn river sitalkes spoke quickly tripping over the greek in his excitement and showing a scalp on his spear but laertes spoke over him he pulled an arm free of his cloak to point at ataelus thank the gods you sent him he said all the feeder streams are full hard to cross themselves we were lost in the dark when ataelus found us he gestured at sitalkes we tangled with their patrols twice but they couldnt make it across this idiot laertes ruffled sitalkess hair killed a man with a javelin and then swam across to get his hair barbarian kineas felt the warmth of the tea spreading through his stomach so there is a crossing south of here laertes shrugged exchanged a glance with ataelus theres a dozen crossings if you want to swim your horse or if you can pick your way in single file nothing for an army not really even a crossing for a patrol kineas rubbed his eyes howd you end up fighting these he asked indicating the prisoner they must have had boats laertes said heron made us look for them but we never found them it took time in the rain and then we got lost he shrugged ataelus grinned at the other warrior with him kineas realized she was his wife samahe the black one she gave her husband a wry smile i for find greek horse she said see in dark ataelus gave her the tea good wife he said find greek horse find crax find enemy all samesame where is heron kineas asked he looked at the prisoner again the man looked familiar or the cloak did laertes held the horn cup out and one of the camp slaves came and refilled it rolled in his cloak he means to go north as soon as we have a rest kineas nodded give him my thanks get some rest yourselves they all grinned pleased with themselves and pleased with his praise spare as it had been they made him feel better philokles took the cup and drained it eumenes is waiting he said acerbically he wiped his mouth im going out with him he put the cup on the ground ill see what i can get from our prisoner when i get back kineas walked down the hill thinking about macedonian patrols south of the ford his intuition which had burned all night had been right then he understood what he had heard philokles was not often an active soldier why he asked why are you going out the rain was soaking him again and his beard was too full it felt like an alien on his face he wanted to shave too many days in the saddle philokles shrugged it is time to fight he said eumenes was mounted at the head of leucons troop the hippeis of pantecapaeum were mounted as well and beyond them in the rain were half of the phalanx of pantecapaeum most of them were naked holding their shields and a single heavy spear beyond them a pair of heavy sakje wagons kineas walked up to eumenes straight across retrieve the bodies and get back eumenes had his eyes on the ford we wont disappoint you there will be no repeat of yesterday he said in a hard voice kineas stepped in close where he could feel the warmth of the horse yesterday could have happened to anyone thats war eumenes claim the bodies and get back here and no heroics eumenes saluted a sindi one of temerixs men trotted up to philokles and handed him a helmet which he pushed on to the back of his head then a heavy spear hard black longer by a span than other mens and as thick as kineass wrist philokles hung a shield on his shoulder a plain bronze shield with no mark on it youre going with him kineas asked again he was at a loss philokles smiled grimly memnon made me the commander of this two hundred he said he raised an eyebrow the benefits of a spartan education philokles turned on his heel his old red cloak billowing behind him with a casual shake of his head he dropped the helmet off his brow so that the cheek pieces covered his face from the helmet came an inhuman voice so different from philokles voice that kineas would have said it was a different man well run all the way said the voice any man who falls behind is left for the birds ready they growled spears beat on shields kineas watched them run off to the ford keeping their space in close order and wondered the expedition to cross the ford and retrieve the dead from yesterdays running fight was almost uncontested kineas kept the phalanx standing ready held the balance of the olbian horse under his hand and then crossed himself for a quick reconnaissance in the second hour before the third hour the men of pantecapaeum were back still running singing the paean of their city as they came behind them came the wagons full to the beams with their grim cargo and a handful of wounded who had survived a night in the rain last came eumenes and his troop they had seen a handful of macedonians as had kineas eumenes had another prisoner kineas called his officers and they gathered around the fire by his wagon i dont like it he said im going to the king zopryon should have tried to close the ford eumenes didnt agree im new to war but i think they felt beaten last night and retired from the ford to get clear fearing the same battle we feared niceas gave the young man a proprietary grin sounds like sense to me he said kineas nodded it is possible i have to guard against all the possibilities get the men under cover rotate the pickets and see to the horses this weather will cost us more horses than a battle diodorus youre in command of the pickets has anyone seen heron already gone diodorus said tried to find you when you crossed the stream and said your orders wouldnt wait and he was headed north with our scouts he seemed to know what he was about i sent ataelus with him kineas couldnt stifle a grin he ought to he has all our best men send him to me the moment he returns or any of his men im for the king philokles still an alien figure in a heavy helmet spear in hand spat expertly through his helmet ill see to the prisoners he said niceas has them separate well see what they say kineas nodded eumenes if you can stay awake i need you eumenes nodded wearily and kineas dismissed the rest up the hill the view was better as his legs brushed through the wet grass kineas could see the herds well off to the north and the camps of each of the clans the rain would be debilitating for both armies but the sakje with their huge herds of horses and their dry wagons for sleeping would be more comfortable the sky was lightening the clouds raising wisps of low cloud obscured his view but on other lines he could see five stades or more and although the rain was steady it lacked last nights vehemence in athens he would have expected the rain to end towards evening to the west he could see a line of fires at the limit of his perception the fires were small and their smoke was black almost out of firewood kineas thought out of wagons out of food hed flirted with zopryon twice in the rain and despite the outcomes he had a feeling for zopryons army they were desperate kineas had a thought so beautiful that it was dangerous he didnt want to express it to himself much less say it aloud to others lest he somehow change the world by speaking of it but it kept poking into his plans and his worries and the thought was zopryon does not yet know that cleomenes has betrayed the city the king was just summoning his clan leaders he had a big felt tent and his guardsmen had erected it in the clear space at the centre of his laager kineas was still in armour from his reconnaissance he kept his cloak around him the more so as the clan leaders came in srayanka among them she lay down on the rugs next to him marthax sat on his other side and the king sat on a folding stool he served them wine with his own hands in heavy gold cups glanced disapprovingly at srayanka and turned his head away the last of the chiefs came in and a pair of sauromatae and then kam baqca she bowed to the king and slumped at his side as if the energy of standing had exhausted her the king pointed his whip at kineas our thanks to our allies we would have had many empty saddles without your actions at the ford kineas rose and pointed a bare arm at the sauromatae they turned the tide he said bluntly without them we might have been beaten even as it was i lost young leucon one of my officers the blonder of the two sauromatae rose and returned his bow he spoke rapidly to the king and the king translated with pleasure prince lot says that he questioned you as allies and now he asks no more questions and hopes that the quality of the offence was altered by the brotherhood on the field kineas smiled at the tall blond man the king nodded it is good that we have the army together and it is good that we struck zopryon a blow at the edge of dark marthax marthax rose he cracked his fingers and stretched his arms in greek he said it is good through eumenes he said zopryon flinched from the contest eumenes translated although as was increasingly the case kineas understood almost every word my sense is that he was afraid of what started in the dark and rain and he retreated the other chiefs roared approval kineas could sense that their morale had shifted in the night they were eager and the king looked happier only kam baqca had hollows under her eyes and pale cheeks kineas raised his hand and the king waved to him i had scouts to the south he said they saw patrols and took a prisoner zopryon is looking for a ford he has scouted us well his men knew where to expect us last night even in the rain srayanka spoke from the rug at his side those thessalians are tough bastards she said another chief across the tent swallowed his wine and their companions are just as good he said kineas nodded as we said from the first this is where he is desperate he must either destroy this army or cross to the south and go to olbia kineas shrugged hesitantly he enunciated his dearest thought if he even knows of cleomeness treason and nothing we have seen so far suggests he knows he grimaced at the irony of it zopryons greatest advantage might be unknown to the man the gods punished hubris in just such ways he made a gesture learned from his nurse pure superstition to avert any part he might play in such hubris kineas continued he ought to push to the ford today if he does not we should consider pressing him again sending raids across the river marthax rubbed his moustache and drank some wine already it is late in the day and the rain soaks everything the king nodded there is standing water in the camp it will be worse where the macedonians are srayanka looked around the circle i dont want to fight today she said and other chiefs nodded with her and gaomavant lord of the patient wolves rose to his feet we need rest lord the horses are weary and the warriors too many are hurt the rain does not help lot of the sauromatae shrugged despite the weight of his armour he spoke through the king who matched him gesture for gesture we are not tired show us a line of bronze hats and we will cut them down the rain does not wet our lance heads if you are tired think how the bronze hats are today kineas shook his head the taxeis are not tired they can march through a hundred days of rain he looked at the king and shook his head again we are drier and more secure than the macedonians we will rest better you have more remounts to replace those who are lame and i hesitate to shout this to the gods lest i offend by hubris but nothing nothing we have seen in two days suggests that zopryon knows that olbia is open to them if my council carries weight here then i suggest that the freshest clans cross the ford and block zopryons access to the south cut him off from any message strike his southern pickets and wear at them a few hundred horse at most if they are cut off when zopryon moves to the ford they can harry his rear or simply ride off into the grass the king rubbed his beard he glanced at marthax warlord he asked marthax shrugged what do we want lord he asked bluntly the campaign has always come to this do we avoid battle or force battle and fight to destroy this enemy utterly risking our own destruction did we not decide from the first to take that risk we might have ridden into the grass in the spring even now we might be with the messagetae we are here enough council let us cut this zopryon off from the south that is sense and goad him to the fight let him cross the ford in the morning marthaxs look at kam baqca was almost tender we will be stung but the hornets nest will be destroyed utterly so say i the king glanced around the circle but it was clear that the chiefs were with marthax and only the king hesitated he said i remind you that when we first planned this campaign we discussed a parley at this precise moment a token of submission the chiefs growled next to kineas srayanka stiffened and her face set the king looked around at them he pointed to kineas your friend the spartan says that war is a tyrant and nothing makes it more clear than this his bitterness was evident the taste of blood has excited you you want to risk all so that this menace may be destroyed or so that we may all be remembered in song he glanced at srayanka or so that past injustice may be wiped clean the tent was silent while he toyed with his whip none of them made a noise and the sound of hoof beats carried clearly from outside the king looked at kam baqca but she turned her face away and raised her hand as if the kings eyes might scorch her the hoof beats came closer and stopped and in the unnatural stillness kineas heard the sound as the riders feet hit the ground the king flinched at kam baqcas reaction then he drew himself up and kineas who knew the weight of command could all but see the full load settle on the kings shoulders he raised his whip and pointed at the lord of the grass cats the king i must see the king said a strong voice from the doorway of the tent the messenger was young wearing nothing but a gorytos over breeches and boots and a short knife he threw himself in front of the king lord there is a herald at the ford demanding our submission a herald from the bronze hats as soon as kineas saw cleomenes sitting on a tall mare at zopryons side he knew the worst the rain was clearing a veil of cloud moved fitfully along the river valley separating the two armies but in the heavens the sun was gradually conquering the element of water kineas looked up and saw an eagle or a hawk far far to the north his right a good omen below on the earth a hundred macedonian cavalry sat a halfstade to the west while a hundred of the kings household sat at the edge of the ford and between them were two halfcircles the king of the sakje marthax and srayanka lot and kineas across a horse length of grass zopryon flanked by a macedonian officer and cleomenes and a herald the good omen in the sky hardly balanced the disaster of cleomenes presence the macedonian herald had just completed reading his masters requirements the submission of the sakje a tribute of twenty thousand horses and the immediate repudiation of the armies of olbia and pantecapaeum kineas watched cleomenes cleomenes met his eye and smiled when the herald was done zopryon nudged his horse into motion he wore no helmet but a diadem of white in his hair i have olbia in the palm of my hand he said his words were arrogant they belied the look on his face fatigue and worry he went on with olbia as a base i can ride against your towns i will spend the autumn burning your crops save me the time submit none of the sakje flinched cleomenes spoke to kineas you are wise to bring no man of olbia to this parley mercenary but my men will find them and tell them and they will march away from you and leave you to die with these traitor false hireling for you my lord zopryon will have no mercy kineas gave no more reaction than the sakje instead he turned to the king and the king who had sat slumped relaxed or perhaps tired while listening to the herald now drew himself erect when news of your herald came he said in his excellent greek i was in council with my chiefs ever they urge me to battle and ever i hesitate because to fight a battle is to submit the fate of my people to chance and death o zopryon your words have cleared the air for me as the sun burns away every fog in the end do you know your herodotus zopryons face darkened do not toy with me submit or take the consequence even now kineas could see that the man was in a hurry even with olbia in hand just three hundred stades away the desperation was still there a flicker of hope relit in kineass stomach the king reached out and took a basket from srayanka who rode at his side here are your tokens o zopryon he shrugged and appeared as young as he really was i hadnt time to catch a bird he pushed his horse into motion the horse took a few steps and all of the macedonians reacted but the king handed the wicker basket to the herald and then stopped his horse nose to nose with zopryons horse zopryon motioned impatiently the herald took a linen towel off the top of the basket and a frog leaped clear the herald dropped the basket in shock he turned to his master vermin he said mice and frogs the king reached into his gorytos and withdrew a handful of light arrows which he threw on the ground at zopryons feet i am the king of the sakje that is the answer of the sakje my allies may speak for themselves the king glanced at kineas and sat straight and then he turned his horse and rode away cleomenes was as red as a spartans cloak the heralds horse shied from the mice in the grass kineas leaned forward his hands were clenched with tension but his voice carried well enough his tokens mean just this zopryon unless you can swim like a frog burrow like a mouse or fly like a bird we will destroy you with our arrows zopryon reacted angrily enough to confirm kineass suspicion that the man was at the edge this embassage is ended mercenary be gone before i order you dead kineas pushed his horse forward floating on the promise of his dream try zopryon he said try to kill me zopryon turned his horse you are mad drunk with power kineas laughed it was a harsh laugh a little forced but it did the job does alexander know you wear the diadem kineas called do you have an ivory stool to match it he saw the shot go home zopryon whirled his horse he put his hand on his sword hilt kineas sat still and his warhorse didnt stir cleomenes leaned forward over his horses neck you are a dangerous man and now you will die kineas stood his ground his laugh was derisive and he was proud that he could conjure it and he needed to goad zopryon he needed the man to commit to his desperation your horses are starving he yelled your men walk like corpses you are burning your wagons for firewood zopryon was two horse lengths away his hand was still on his sword and his face was moving kineas pointed at the kings arrows cleomenes he said mockingly you have chosen unwisely he held the mans eyes you are a fool this army will never get to olbia alive cleomenes didnt flinch i demand that you give me my son and all the men still loyal to the archon kineas shook his head if i sent eumenes to you he said he would kill you himself to zopryon he said olbia is on our side of the river your scouts will have told you that there is no ford south of here whenever you think you can force the ford come and face us if your horses dont starve first zopryons rage began to boil out of him and kineas rode away at the ford he caught the king he must not be allowed to march south marthax nodded we know let the grass cats cross the ford as soon as varo their lord can be ready the king said let us show them their future kineas found that kam baqca was watching him he met her eyes and wondered if the same emptiness lay in his own the grass cats rode off across the ford as the rain tailed off to fitful spurts in early afternoon and a damp sun made portions of the sky overhead lighter if a man was an optimist kineas ordered diodorus to take a patrol across and scout the enemy camp or their patrol line he wanted to do it himself but he needed sleep his nap was dreamless but he had a sharp feeling of dream when it was the same damp arm that woke him and philokles voice in his ear huh he asked as before your prisoner philokles said the one laertes brought hes a kelt one of the archons athena protectress shield of our fathers lady of the olive all the gods kineas swore but he was out of his wagon into late afternoon light a pale sky sun too weak to cast a shadow but drier than rain he followed philokles to the fire pit where the prisoner sat on a stone watched by a trio of the blacksmiths friends he had his head in his hands and kineas could see that the back of his head was swollen look at me philokles ordered in his ares voice the man raised his head and kineas knew him despite the bruise over his eye so kineas said it was not hubris the gods smile on us unless others slipped past philokles shook his head a dozen kelts and a pair of macedonians and cleomenes left the city together ataeluss wife discovered them in the dark and led herons men to them this one thinks they are all dead kineas rubbed his beard balanced on a knifes edge if he and srayanka if she hadnt found ataelus if ataelus didnt have a new wife to ride with him it wasnt over yet kineas rubbed his face with cold water cleomenes made it to zopryon he said a day too late i think i hope he shrugged im for hot water a shave and a strigil he said tomorrow we fight philokles nodded ill comb my hair he said marthax pushed more of his lightest freshest cavalry across in late afternoon with orders to cause as much chaos as possible among the macedonians the next hours saw a constant skirmish just out of sight of the ford sakje would ride back to change horses get arrows or tend a wound kineas sent diodorus to support them and to gather what information he could there was yet an hour of light or perhaps more when kineas saw the stir at the ford he waved to memnon who approached at a run horsemen olbians were coming across the ford at speed he could see a sakje messenger going up the hill to the kings laager another sakje coming from the north on their side of the river galloping through the herds at a reckless pace and a greek diodorus as it proved coming to kineas at the gallop from the ford theyre moving diodorus panted kineas rubbed his trimmed beard theyre going to fight now diodorus struggled to catch his breath memnon arrived theyre going north the parley must have been to cover them the whole army is in motion theres cavalry as a screen we were lucky and theyre tired we got a glimpse kineas stretched as tall on his mount as he could as if he could see farther the last of the rain was blowing away in the east but the visibility was still soft and the middle distance of a few stades was already losing colour north he said the reckless sakje rider was coming to him a stade away kineas could see it was ataelus his heartbeat quickened he had a sense almost the sense of his baqca dreams of knowledge ataelus was coming from heron heron was searching north diodorus said the macedonians were marching north kineas could see it zopryons desperate lunge the desperate boar gores kings ataelus didnt bother to dismount he pulled up so close that horse sweat showered his audience heron finds ford north and macedon find ford too kineas felt the weight of the inevitable future clamp down another ford with a wide shingle and a big dead tree no doubt the ford was just north of their northernmost herds just by the shrine of the river god ataelus said that it was as wide as four wagons and no deeper than a mans knees and that there were macedonians on the far side just a handful but more arriving and that heron was determined to hold the ford as long as he could kineas didnt wait to hear it all he turned to memnon im off to see the king take the phalanx and march immediately you have to beat the taxeis in the race they have a head start but you have the inside track memnon nodded they wont cross tonight kineas shook his head theyll try go he turned to his own officers eumenes your men are the most rested every man take two horses mount all the sindi ride like every one of you bestrides a pegasus nicomedes go with him as soon as your men can mount ill push the slaves to get a wagon in motion and youll have a late dinner thirty stades he asked ataelus ataelus shrugged an hours ride diodorus pull your men back from the ford rest now youll ride with me in an hour kineas looked around we must win the race to the ford they all nodded kineas said this is his last throw this will be the battle hes stolen a march and we know he can march fast now we show what we can do philokles put a hand on his shoulder enough orders he said see you at the ford kineass news only served to reinforce what the king had already heard marthax was blunt maybe the ford maybe not the ford he made a motion with his hand we cannot allow him to march away go south go to olbia the king looked five years older were taking the sakje across the river he said we will follow him crush his rear guard impede his march kineas took a deep breath he will have a three hour head start he will march all night you wont catch him until morning if im right hell be crossing kineas ran a hand through his hair we have the smaller army and we intend to divide it the king shook his head we have the faster army we watch all of his motions and we rejoin to fight kineas shook his head he may force you to fight on the sea of grass and ill be hours away unable to help marthaxs face was set he spoke rapidly and the king translated we have no choice if he gets ahead of us to olbia weve lost kineas could see that their minds were made up they were tired everyone was tired and there was no time to talk he thought about a battlefield he had never seen except in a dream he thought about the king his friend and rival riding away to leave him he knew what mattered now after a moments hesitation he said leave me a clan i cant hold the ford with the greeks alone he was more afraid of how the olbians would feel waking to find that they alone were to bear the weight of macedon the king frowned but marthax nodded grass cats standing horses you keep both you know chiefs grass cats fight all days tired not ride all night standing horses take hardest fight yesterday he sent ataelus for the chiefs through the king he said i think zopryon will go to the ford we will catch him two hours after dawn i think you hold him we will catch him the other chiefs were hurrying up the hills those that werent already across the river fighting kineas saw srayanka already mounted giving orders to her household knights philokles ran by her at the head of his lightarmed two hundred setting out at a run and even as he watched philokles lifted his spear to her and she shrieked a war cry in return that was taken up by her clan eumenes troop was already vanishing into the gloom nicomedes men were mostly armed and the slaves had two wagons loaded the whole column was moving with memnons heavy phalanx marching at the rear kineas was proud of them kaliax of the standing horse came first he was nursing a badly cut arm and he was pale but he agreed to serve at kineass command varo of the grass cats looked better he spoke quickly still full of the daimon of the fight and he spoke eloquently in sakje of the daylong skirmish beyond the ford the puncturing of the enemy screen the discovery that the enemy camp was being packed kineas tried to be patient but his heart was with the olbians moving swiftly up the river they might be fighting in an hour right or wrong kineas wanted to be there he had the eye for the ground and his was the voice that all of the other greeks would obey even memnon it occurred to him that he might die today this very evening if the fight started immediately he felt his stomach clench and his heart race it was here now he wanted to see srayanka again the last time she was at the foot of the hill just the length of a racecourse away instead he turned to varo and kaliax there will be fighting at the river gods shrine by nightfall he said it is an hours ride for you how soon can you come kaliax flexed his injured hand sunset he said varo nodded some of my cats are still across the ford well need remounts food sunset at best kineas nodded grimly he hadnt hoped for any better come on my right flank he said he had to search for the words and after a minute of confusion and worry he slid off his mount walked to a campfire grabbed a burnt stick and a scrap of linen that covered a pot despite the protests of the sindi woman at the fire he put the linen over his knee and drew river he said then two lines at right angles like a road the ford and the shrine he said and the two chiefs nodded he sketched a block a simple rectangle the greeks he said and another crossing the river macedon both chiefs nodded kineass stick was out of charcoal he walked back to the fire and chose another he drew a line and then a broad curving arrow you come north he said swing east away from the river along the ridge both men nodded sunset said varo go with the gods said kineas he could feel the thing moving the whole course of events the preliminary to the battle sweeping along like the river in the kings story he wanted his warhorse and armour wanted to make sure the slaves had sufficient food for a hot meal for every one of the greek allies wanted to see srayanka he had no time to talk to srayanka he would probably never see her again he mounted took one look at the column of olbians vanishing into the deep grass along the river and rode down the south side of the hill to where she sat her horse one hand on her hip and the other holding her whip she smiled at him now she said now you will see how we fight something in kineas was too weary to talk he had only come to say goodbye but she was so alive so like a goddess the poet often said that men and women were like gods in their best moments and there she was he didnt want to die he wanted to be with her for ever his silence and something in his eye moved her she leaned forward threw her arms around him pressed her cheek against his so that he felt the warmth of her and the bite of her gold gorget against his neck tomorrow she said i will find you or you will find me and the sastar baqca will be lifted he thought of many things to say he realized because he was a brave man that what he wanted was her comfort and that the best thing he could give her was his silence about the dream so that she would ride to her battle with her hope undiminished he pressed her to him you shaved she said patting his cheek as their horses pulled them apart always look your best for battle he said its a greek tradition he tried for humour but she nodded seriously with that inane exchange they parted they were commanders they had roles to play kineas looked at her one more time and she was looking at him her eyes across a widening length of grass and then she turned to bark an order he took a deep breath and rode for the horse lines arni had the command of all the slaves the wagons were moving and the remounts were coming along but arni had kineass warhorse ready and stood at the animals head despite his other responsibilities master ordered me he said he gave his lopsided smile blankets and gear with the baggage heres both your best javelins and your armour clean tunic ajax said your best so its your best kineas grinned his heart was lifted by seeing srayanka and because part of him didnt believe in fated death and because right or wrong hed planned the summer away for this battle and it was his he slid off his mount it took too long to change his tunic too long to get his feet comfortable in the long boots of the heavy cavalryman too long to close his breastplate and tie his sash upriver they might be dying now he took his fancy gilt helmet and put it on the back of his head and threw his best cloak blue as her eyes over his shoulder start the fires as soon as you come up kineas said to arni choose the camp yourself youve seen it done often enough get there in time to feed us and ill see you a free man tell your men if we win every one of you will be free my master said the same arni said with satisfaction diodorus came up with his helmet on ready he said he gave kineas half a smile he was exhausted and so would his men be not as tired as the macedonians he reminded himself kineas relinquished the reins of his best riding horse to arni and mounted thanatos pick a good camp he said and set the stallion to run it was easy to follow the army they had beaten a road in the tall grass as wide as memnons phalanx it ran along the river for a few stades and then went straight as a bowstring at a tangent cutting across the long sweep of the bend kineas was impatient of the speed of diodoruss troop he forgave them their fatigue theyd earned it but he needed to be there he found himself pulling ahead and finally he turned rode back to diodorus and shook his head pardon me old friend i have to go diodorus waved kineas pointed with his whip at niceas and the two of them set off at a gallop he caught the phalanx at the top of the ridge that dominated the river valley he waved to memnon and kept going memnon would not expect a chat he rode down the ridge passing the first wagons that arni had dispatched where they were delayed by soft ground men were cutting brush and tying it in bundles to hold the weight of the wagons kineas rode on beyond the bulk of the phalanx of pantecapaeum was clear of the marshy ground and there were officers shouting at them to close up close up men were taking their shields off their backs and putting them on their arms battle was close from here on the last heights of the ridge kineas could see that there was fighting at the ford archers were firing on both sides and there were bodies on the ground he could see his own cavalry formed well clear of the ford itself and he could see a body of infantry it had to be philokles running up to form a line stragglers trailing away behind them few men could run thirty stades over bad ground without pausing even after a life of training they might be so tired from the run that theyd be useless in a fight but they were there niceas pulled up behind him orders he asked he looked calm but one hand beat at his trumpet and the other was at his neck rubbing at the smooth face of his owl his horse dropped its head and its sides heaved kineass stallions head was up and alert he appeared as though hed gone for a walk kineas patted his neck you my friend are a champion he looked back at the chaos around the wagons and memnons phalanx behind he shook his head tell memnon to leave a few files to help the wagons and press on he said im going down from here the whole field was clear the river gods shrine was a cairn that stood on a short isthmus that stuck into the stream near the ford like the thumb on a wrestlers hand the thumb and all the ground around it where it met the main bank were thick with big old trees oaks and big willows just north upstream of the thumb was the ford in the light of the setting sun the ford was obvious perhaps because there were slingers standing in it to cast but the water flowed wide and shallow and logs and a big rock betrayed the path of the ford east of the ford on the near bank the rivers floodplain stretched for stades hard to judge in the red light of evening but the grass was short and the ground flat and damp the ford was half a stade wide and the far side was as flat as the near side flat and treeless perfect ground for the taxeis there wasnt a sign of the macedonian main body and he could see for ten stades he saw cavalry and some peltasts and men in cloaks thrake he suspected he took one last look and pushed thanatos down the last of the rise through the reeds at the edge of the marsh that dominated the south end of the floodplain and up a short rise on to the firmer grass along the river he rode looking at the ground his stallions hooves squelched as he cantered but it was firm enough under the surface water and it would be drier tomorrow he cantered easily across the front of philokles two hundred and they cheered he raised his fist to them in salute as he rode past he rode up to nicomedes who sat with ajax in front of the line nicomedes looked very fine clean neat and calm but the strength of his handclasp displayed his nerves by all the gods kineas ive never been so glad to see any man he grinned command of armies you can have it ive been in command an hour and ive aged a year ajax tipped his helmet back he was cautious he said as a tease behind him heron trotted up to the command group and saluted kineas returned the salute and rode over to the gangly young man well done sir well done heron stared at his hands when he met kineass eye his own were bright did my best he said all i did was listen to your veterans niceas laughed the worlds full of men stupid enough to fuck that up he said gruffly take the hipparchs praise you earned it kineas slapped his back and his hand rang on the other mans armour well done he said again and transferred his attention to nicomedes nicomedes pointed to the ford i refused to be tempted into a fight in the water if their slingers want to engage our sindi so be it the sindi seem happy enough with the fight and none of us are being hurt kineas nodded curtly you were correct we only need to hold i think they will try one rush before sunset he glanced at the line many of philokles men were down on their knees or leaning to the ground breathing hard but more of them were already standing tall shields resting on their insteps spears in hand kineas gestured to eumenes who rode up immediately who have you appointed as your hyperetes he asked cliomenedes eumenes replied indeed the boy was right behind him the youngest of the boys who had made the winter ride probably still among the youngest in the troop yet kineas had seen his sword at work among the getae he wasnt really a boy very well take your troop to the south of philokles and cover his left flank if we are pushed off the river bank we retire south so you will be the pivot nicomedes where are the sindi at the shrine yes they went into the trees and now all that comes out is arrows nicomedes laughed with a nervous edge kineas nodded well leave them there he looked to the south and east to find memnons column they were coming slowly across the marsh kineas gestured with his whip at philokles and then led the mounted officers towards the spartan to reach him faster he rubbed his beard looked across the river again felt his heartbeat increase and reined in his horse with philokles at his feet theyll try for us in a few minutes gentlemen philokles those are thrake peltasts really but with big swords theyll come for you at a rush their flanks covered by the cavalry philokles had his big corinthian helmet on the back of his head he looked himself a big pleasant man the philosopher but when he spoke he sounded like ares well stop them right here he said i have never fought them myself but i know them by repute only their first charge is worth a crap he smiled and it was the sarcastic smile of philokles i think we can manage them kineas caught the eye of his cavalry officers and pointed at the very slight rise in the ground to the south if we are broken we rally to the south let the thrake come philokles will hold them when their cavalry comes across they will be badly ordered let them get across and then charge them before they form look to me for the timing but dont fear to make your own call ill ride with the infantry in fact it felt odd to be sitting on a horse well clear of the front line giving orders but that was his work now he rode back to the small phalanx really more like a handful of peltastoi with philokles the big spartan gave him one grin and then tipped his helmet back down on his head and ran to the front of his men he pointed across the river and the two hundred gave a cheer like a thousand men a cheer that sent a surge of energy through kineas like a beneficial lightning bolt across the river the macedonian slingers were retreating on the far bank clear in the fading light kineas could see the thrake and the cavalry and beyond them something it was hard to measure distance and harder to detect troops moving on wet ground without dust but there was something there a taxeis perhaps still a few stades away the thrake bellowed a cheer and then another and they raised their shields there were quite a few of them they beat their big swords against their shields and they began a chant then they started across the ford they kept no kind of order and their ranks spread as they crossed kineas had dismissed the handful of sindi the blacksmiths men as unimportant but from their position on the thumb immune to the thrake and unafraid they shot arrows right into the side of the charge the thrake flinched away from the thumb crowded to the north side of the ford and came up the bank too slowly with much of the impetus of their charge lost to the water and the arrows a chief rallied them at the rivers edge and led them forward a hundred or more and they crashed into the front of philokles men with a noise like a dozen blacksmiths working on as many forges the chief leaped a fantastic move straight from the run of his charge up to the rim of the shield wall and then down his long sword taking a greek head even as he fell but four spears pierced him before his body came to rest and the gap that he opened was filled in three thuds of kineass heart with dead men greek and thrake and then the epilektoi pushed from the second rank and the wound in the phalanx was healed as they closed their shields more thrake were coming up the river bank every man seemed to make his own decision and some ran off towards the base of the thumb to end the galling fire of the archers while others threw themselves into the fight in front of them kineas tore his eyes away from the fight to watch the enemy cavalry they were trapped in the ford now they were the victims of the deadly archery and they couldnt push forward because of the crowd of thrake the width of an athenian street away philokles plume showed in the front rank and his roar shook the air kineas saw the great black spear rise and fall back and forth held onehanded on the spartans shoulder and he punched with it as if it had no weight back and forth like a machine for killing men he was not alone he was at the corner of his threatened line yet he killed five men in as many breaths the great black spear shooting forward with brutal economy straight through a nose into a mouth into the soft flesh under a mans chin and out the broad blade never sinking past its greatest width philokles arm was black at the hand red as high as his shoulder and he was red down his side where the blood of other men ran down his naked skin even as kineas watched the greek line solidified and philokles roar was answered by a push a heave that threw the thrake back on their heels some men actually falling to the ground and the line stepped over them and spears in the rear rank rose and fell the whole phalanx like a loom weaving death the thrake broke they were being massacred against the round shields the strength of their charge was spent and fear took them they broke and fled into the ford already choked with latecomers and their own cavalry supports kineas rode up next to philokles who was leading his men forward they were singing and kineas had to bellow to be heard halt he yelled he poked philokles helmet with the butt of his javelin halt the black spear whirled and the buttspite paused a fraction of a foot away from his face philokles glared at him with dull recognition he shouted his pipe player shrilled a call and the victorious men of pantecapaeum stopped kineas whirled his mount put his heels to the stallions flanks and raced to eumenes now he yelled into the ford eumenes wasnt ready clearly he had been waiting for the fight to develop as kineas had predicted it hadnt kineas had expected the rush of thrake to push philokles little band back to give the trap space to develop philokles victory had happened too fast now kineas bellowed eumenes waved at clip sound advance he called kineas rode away wishing for niceas this was too slow the trap would never be sprung now the men of pantecapaeum had fought too well and the thrake had broken too soon he waved to nicomedes harder to see now nicomedes started for the ford but halted before kineas reached him there wasnt room for both troops abreast eumenes men swept by already at a gallop and hit the river in a spray of water reform the line kineas yelled he waved with his sword and nicomedes led his cavalry back the little distance they had advanced philokles men walked backwards their shields to the enemy herons troop had never advanced they were too far to the flank to even see the fighting niceas rode up well have a camp in an hour he said he pointed at the ford whats that kineas shook his head a trap gone wrong he said sound the recall out in the ford eumenes men were killing fugitive thrake but the enemy cavalry were already formed on the far bank eumenes men returned in good order the sting of their rout expunged and the ford was full of dead men but the actual damage inflicted on the enemy was slight he peered into the dusk trying to read what lay on the other side of the ford he felt that a taxeis had come up but he saw no proof behind him on the ridge a fire winked into life and then another memnons column marched on to the edge of the dry ground and began to form kineas watched the ford he praised the men riding along the line he took the time to manoeuvre memnon into the line right in the centre facing the ford with the main phalanx of pantecapaeum on his right and the epilektoi under philokles on his left and the cavalry covering their flanks by the time they were all in line kineas couldnt see across the river and there were fires all along the slope of the ridge behind him he gathered his officers again and sent niceas to get the sindi blacksmith from his fortress of trees when they were all present he saluted them we stopped them he said we won the race we almost hurt them badly now we have to hold them until the king comes he looked around in the last light at all the faces new men and old friends and philokles he couldnt adapt to philokles as a killer this is my plan the whole army will retire to the ridge to camp and eat well hold the ford with a rotation of pickets cavalry and infantry in every watch four watches but he looked around gathering eyes making sure he had their attention when they come we give them the ford i think theyll come at dawn theyll push a whole taxeis across at a rush let them come he pointed to temerix who stood a little apart you have enough arrows he asked in sakje the blacksmith laughed all we do for day and day is cut arrows he said can you hold the shrine all night and as long as you can in the day kineas asked the blacksmith shrugged i am your man he said and i came here to die river gods shrine is good place for man to die kineas shook his head too tired to argue about ordering a man to his death dont die he said just hold it until they get across and run to us he looked around the circle the rest of you form just as we are formed now but here at the edge of the marsh we push up the little rise thats our line with our flank on the river philokles said and the other flank in air kineas shook his head and pointed to the ridge even in the near darkness the silhouettes of riders were visible our friends from the grass cats and the standing horses will take care of the open flank he said we let zopryon if hes here come across hell be at right angles to our line a terrible position to start a battle hell use more time to reform his line and hell have no way to expect it which will cost him time we advance at my word and well pin them against the river he gave a small smile until they get their second taxies across and then we give ground he motioned over his shoulder we have a great deal of ground to give gentlemen about thirty stades stay together keep the line and dont get routed as far as i am concerned we can spend all day retreating i want to hurt him early on and then retreat until the king comes thats all and tonight eat well and sleep they nodded laughed a little their spirits were soaring kineas mounted thanatos again and spared the ford one more look it was lost in the darkness the macedonians had fires now too then he rode back to camp they cosseted him the sindi the slaves his comrades his kit was already laid out and he had a tent ready pitched the only tent among the hippeis on a fine summer night with the stars like a canopy of glory across the sky his cloak and armour vanished as soon as he had them off and a bowl of cheese and meat and bread was put in his hands philokles came to the fire the blood washed from his arms and side wearing a tunic he had a spartan cup brimming with strong unwatered wine which he set on a rock by kineass hand just beyond the periphery of his vision arni and sitalkes worked together on thanatos washing the mud from his legs brushing the dirt and sweat from his coat and he stood calmly enough and bore their attentions and beyond thanatos a hundred fires rose into the dark towers of light and smoke from wood carefully gathered by slaves and free men and at every fire messes of horsemen and hoplites ate hot food and stared into the flames and thought about what morning would bring the old comrades lykeles and laertes and coenus and all the rest came to his fire from their separate troops and sat in a circle but they left space for newer comrades eumenes was there ajax and nicomedes and clio hovering uncertainly around the edge of the firelight until coenus who had taught the boy all winter waved him to the fire they were silent for a time kineas ate his food and drank the wine in silence his eyes on the column of fire rising into the night sitalkes finished the big stallion to his own satisfaction and arni took the horse away to the picket lines in the darkness and the getae boy now a man and a tall man at that came and sat by ajax agis rose to his feet and cleared his throat and hummed a little to himself an agora ditty from olbia then he bowed his head raised it and said as through the deep glens of a parched mountainside rageth wondrousblazing fire and the deep forest burneth and the wind as it driveth it on whirleth the flame every whither even so raged he every whither with his spear like some god ever pressing hard upon them that he slew and the black earth ran with blood and as a man yoketh bulls broad of brow to tread white barley in a wellordered threshingfloor and quickly is the grain trodden out beneath the feet of the loudbellowing bulls even so beneath greatsouled achilles his singlehooved horses trampled alike on the dead and on the shields and with blood was all the axle sprinkled beneath and the rims round about the car for drops smote upon them from the horses hooves and from the tyres but the son of peleas pressed on to win him glory and with gore were his invincible hands bespattered and agis continued the story until then the son of peleas uttered a bitter cry with a look at the broad heaven father zeus how is it that no one of the gods taketh it upon him in my pitiless plight to save me from out the river thereafter let come upon me what may none other of the heavenly gods do i blame so much but only my dear mother that beguiled me with false words saying that beneath the wall of the mailclad trojans i should perish by the swift missiles of apollo would that hector had slain me the best of the men bred here then had a brave man been the slayer and a brave man had he slain but now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be cut off pent in the great river like a swineherd boy whom a torrent sweepeth away as he maketh essay to cross it in winter so spake he and forthwith poseidon and pallas athene drew nigh and stood by his side being likened in form to mortal men and they clasped his hand in theirs and pledged him in words and among them poseidon the shaker of earth was first to speak son of peleas tremble not thou overmuch neither be anywise afraid such helpers twain are we from the god and zeus approveth thereof even i and pallas athene therefore is it not thy doom to be vanquished by a river nay he shall soon give respite and thou of thyself shalt know it but we will give thee wise counsel if so be thou wilt hearken make not thine hands to cease from evil battle until within the framed walls of ilios thou hast pent the trojan host whosoever escapeth but for thyself when thou hast bereft hector of life come thou back to the ships lo we grant thee to win glory he stopped there well short of the death of hector declaiming that part of the tale brought men ill luck when he bowed his head to show that he was done the space beyond the fire was black with men standing in silence to hear him and there was silence thick and black as night when he was done as if by staying perfectly still they could win more words from him but he bowed his head again and went back to his place and sat then the men beyond the firelight sighed and the sound was like the wind in tall trees kineas stood and offered libation to all the gods from philokles cup and their dwindling store of wine he raised his voice and sang i begin to sing about poseidon and every man in earshot responded and they all sang together the great god mover of the earth and fruitless sea god of the deep who is also lord of helicon and wide aegae a twofold office the gods allotted you o shaker of the earth to be a tamer of horses and a saviour of ships hail poseidon holder of the earth darkhaired lord o blessed one be kindly in heart and help those who ride on horses kineas had at his feet a wreath of oak leaves made by ajax and eumenes working together by firelight when the hymn was done he lifted it from the ground walked across the fire circle and placed it without further words on the brow of philokles when the wreath touched the spartan they roared a single long note and then the men were silent feeling the nearness of the gods and of death niceas broke the silence walking up to agis he put a hand on agiss shoulder better than guagemala he said agis shrugged clearly drained when it comes to me he said it is like a spirit speaks through me or a god i am no actor and sometimes i cant believe that i can remember the passage the other men who had known him for years all nodded even kineas thought that the megaran was godtouched but ajax smiled in the bright sun of battle that boy was altogether gone but he was beautiful in the firelight and in his face lingered the boy who had followed them off to war from his fathers house i love to hear the poet he said it is almost like the hymn to listen on such a night and the eve of battle nicomedes rolled his eyes and philokles gave a snort almost the bray of a donkey and ajaxs head went back in resentment the poet knew war philokles said and he did not love it he told a great tale the tale of one mans rage and through that rage the tale of what war is ajax you are no longer a virgin a rude chuckle from the fire war is madness like the rage of achilles ajaxs chin was still up and his voice was strong every man here made war today he said you philokles were a hero risen from the very lines of the poet philokles stood up and on his head sat the wreath a crown of valour and he seemed the tallest man at the fire red and gold in the firelight war makes men beasts he said i fight like a wise and cunning beast a predator i killed nine men today or perhaps ten he shrugged and seemed to shrink a wolf might say as much and a wolf would stop killing when his hunger was sated only a man kills without need ajax stung said if you hate it so you need not fight philokles shook his head the firelight played tricks with his face his body was red and gold but his face had black hollows for eyes and his grin raised the hair on kineass neck hate it he said through his grin hate it i love it like a drunkard loves wine and like the drunkard i prate about it when im sober he turned away and plunged through the circle into the darkness beyond kineas followed on his heels he followed the spartan along the ridge past a campfire of olbian hoplites and then another and down the hill a ways stumbling on the uneven ground in the dark until he saw the pale shape of his friends back settle philokles was sitting on a great rock that stuck up from the ground like an old mans last tooth kineas sat next to him i am an ass philokles said kineas who had seen a great deal of bad behaviour on the night before battle punched the spartan in the arm yes he said he keeps his eyes so tightly closed to the horror he wants war to be like the poem he doesnt see how often they crash to the dusty earth clutching their guts philokles voice was soft it is easy to kill a man or a city yes too damned easy kineas said philokles nodded talking to himself as much as to kineas if you train your whole life to be a warrior offering nothing to the gods learning no poet perhaps even illiterate you might make a superb killing man yes kineas nodded unsure where the spartan was going with his argument you might be the finest fighter in the world deadly with a sword deadly with a spear mounted on foot with a rock with a club however you chose to fight and you might spend all of your money on equipment for it armour shields swords the best of everything yes im sure youre going somewhere with this kineas said but his attempt to lighten the tone failed philokles grabbed him by both shoulders just so that you could protect yourself because it is so easy to be killed you could imagine every threat that might come against you every man who wanted your purse every man who sought to steal your horse or your armour you might live your life in a wilderness to be able to see the enemy coming or perhaps you would fight for power so that you could bid other men to protect you like a tyrant kineas said because he thought he understood perhaps philokles said dismissively because my point is that you can live like that you can spend your entire life on security either as a man or as a city and a child with a sling stone can kill you dead in a moment there you are dead and you have lived a life without a single virtue except possibly courage you are illiterate brutish and dead kineas began to see or philokles looked out over the water or you can live a life of virtue so that men seek to protect you or emulate you or join you kineas thought about it for a moment and then said and yet we killed socrates philokles turned back to him his eyes sparkling socrates killed himself rather than relinquish virtue he made a rhetorical gesture like a man about to speak before the assembly the only armour is virtue and the only excuse for violence is in the defence of virtue and then if we die we die with virtue kineas allowed a slow smile to creep over his face now i think i know why i havent heard of other spartan philosophers philokles nodded were a violent lot and its always easier to die defending virtue than to live virtuously kineas had heard a great deal of philosophy in the hours before battledawns but philokles made more sense than the others he gripped his hand i think you and ajax have more in common than you would have me believe philokles grunted hes an ass too listen to me brother i have a favour to ask kineass voice was light but he put an arm around philokles a gesture he seldom made of course on the night before battle i like to listen to agis and then i like to hear the voices of my friends because you are right but tonight we are not beasts we are men come with me back to the fire philokles had tears in his eyes that glittered like jewels in the moonlight he wiped his eyes and his fist brushed against the wreath in his hair why did you give me this thing he asked i am no hero kineas pushed him off the rock and the two climbed up the hill their feet loud on the hard turf so that philokles might never have heard kineass reponse yes you are kineas said but very softly and later that night before battle they circled back round to the same again ajax couldnt leave war alone kineas who had commanded men for too many years knew that ajax sought to justify on the eve of battle the death he would face and wreak with the dawn if we are beasts he said after brooding for an hour while the others spoke and sang and lykeles danced a spartan military dance to philokles astonishment if we are beasts how do we plan so carefully kineas leaned past philokles determined to avert disaster which plan of mine have you known to carry through the battle he asked niceas laughed with the other veterans nicomedes glanced at ajax as if embarrassed for his friends bad manners and kicked his outstretched ankle ajax shook his head we plan he began again and something exploded in kineas its a fucking shambles he said too loud silencing other conversations madness chaos he pointed at ajax you know better you have seen the animal night and day for months a man has to be in the grip of delusion to believe that order can be imposed on war philokles put his hand on kineass shoulder ajax was recoiling leaning away from kineas as if his commander might strike him philokles spoke softly we plan for war to mitigate the chaos we train so that our muscles will move in a certain sequence when our minds fall to panic and we become as beasts in sparta we perfect the making of men into automata nicomedes rose to his friends defence a dance troupe does the same and so does a chorus they train and train so that they will automatically do what is right but they are not beasts ajax was almost pleading you he said pointing across the fire at niceas and antigonus at lykeles and coenus and andronicus and all the old comrades you are all men of war do you truly hate it philokles began to stand but antigonus rose to his feet antigonus who never spoke in public because he was ashamed of his bad greek he was a big man covered in scars he had fought his whole life and he looked the part he liked ajax loved him as they all did and he gave the young man a smile that no one could resent somewhere he said in his bad greek there is a man so bestial that on the eve of a great battle he proclaims his love for war antigonus gave a rueful smile i fear death too much to love war but i love my comrades so i will not flinch that is all i can give and all any comrade can ask he held aloft a skin and shook it so that they could hear it slosh no good will come if we talk of war tonight i have wine lets drink memnon who most often professed his love of war smiled took a drink and stayed silent later kineas who wanted no anger on his conscience on his last night went and flopped on the ground by ajax i snapped at you he said because i too am afraid of death and you seem immune ajax embraced him how can they say such things he asked when they are so like the heroes themselves kineass eyes were suddenly hot with tears they are better than the poets heroes he said and they speak the truth wine and song and the company of his friends kept thoughts of death and the absence of srayanka at bay until they went to their cloaks kineas walked among the fires saying a few words to men who lingered awake and then spent circled back to his own as it chanced kineas chose not to lie in his tent alone but threw his cloak next to philokles and found ajax on his other side as if a year had vanished from their lives and they were crossing the plains north of tomis he smiled at the warmth of his friends and before death could haunt him he was asleep but death caught him later in his dreams he was wet with blood and beneath him flowed a river of the stuff and it smelled like every festered wound he had ever known septic and evil and he climbed to drag his body clear of the corruption his hands were on the tree his feet clear of the roots and he climbed wishing to take the form of an owl and fly free but the blood on his hands prevented him somehow and all he could do was climb he thought that if he climbed high enough he might see across the river count the fires of the enemy or see the worm and know he couldnt remember what he wanted to know he climbed bewildered and the blood on his hands ran down his arms and from his arms down his sides and it burned where it touched fresh skin burned like saltwater on sunburn sunburn on his face clear of the water salt in his eyes and his hands tangled in the mane of the great horse the water dragging at his legs and his heavy breastplate pressing him down at every attempt to mount a weapon rang off his helmet turning it so that he was blind a blade scored across his upper arm scraped across the bronze of his cuirass and then bit into his bridle arm the grey startled bolted forward and dragged him out of the stream and up the bank he had so recently left hanging from her mane which panicked her so that she tossed her mighty head luck and the strength of her neck dragged him a hands breadth higher than his best effort had reached before so that he got a knee over her broad back he glanced around and all the warriors behind him were strange all sakje in magnificent armour and he himself wore a vambrace of chased gold on the arm he could see through the slits of his helmet he was dry sitting tall on a horse the colour of dark metal and the battle was won the enemy broken and across the river the enemy tried to rally in the driftwood and by the single old dead tree that offered the only cover from their arrows and he raised her whip motioned three times and they all began to cross the river he was ready for the arrow when it came and he almost greeted it he knew it so well and then he was in the water hands grabbing at him again he woke because ajax was shaking him that was an evil dream ajax said kineas had thrown his cloak free of his legs in his sleep he was cold philokles had rolled away probably looking for a quieter partner a glance at the stars and the moon told him that he had slept well enough and that dawn was less than an hour away he rose ajax rose with him kineas pushed at him you have an hour he said ajax hung his head i cannot sleep he said kineas pushed him back down and threw his own old cloak over the younger man its a magic cloak he said youll sleep now his fire was burning bright and a dozen grass cats lay around it while two troop slaves heated water in a bronze kettle one of the slaves handed him a bowl and he took it in silence wolfed down the contents odd how the body continued the tyranny of its needs even when he had only hours left to live he threw on a cloak and picked up a javelin not even his own he felt very alive he felt tall and strong free even the fear of the last month the fear of death the fear of failure the fears of love were far away he walked to the horse lines and caught thanatos the horse was restless and kineas fed him carefully whispering to him in the dark and then mounted him bareback and rode down the ridge to the marsh and across the marsh a handful of grass cats greeted him they were alert and they all pointed across the river something in the dark lots of motion and a steady hum of noise the noise of an army kineas rode right down to the waters edge the grass cats hard at his heels no arrows whistled out of the dark he could hear the hum even over the river noises dawn was just two streaks of purplepink against the dark sky but already there was more light he had to know if zopryon was there and he suspected that they would be in a state of chaos as their column formed up he pushed his horse into the stream one of the grass cats laughed fear and delight mingled in a single giggle and all of them slid into the water their splashes covered by the steady cacophony on the far bank midstream and they were still undetected kineas felt a wild spirit rise in him as if a god had dared him and he pushed his horse forward and the big stallion responded rising from the water like poseidons own son and springing to a gallop in a few strides a man shouted his guttural macedonian clear in the dark who the fuck is that scouts called kineas thanatoss hooves were on solid ground now he could see the head of column men with their shields propped against their legs and their enormous pikes planted erect in the ground and other men with torches relief washed over him win or lose he had been right the taxeis were here zopryon was here he galloped at the front of the phalanx men looked up a little fearful in the dark but hardly panicked he put his javelin into a man who looked like an officer and turned thanatos on his haunches he saw all of the grass cats shooting drawing and loosing and drawing and loosing with smooth and deadly efficiency and then he put the stallion at the river behind him he heard the grass cats laughing the air was full of arrows in the dark coming from both banks kineas kept his body low and something passed a few inches from his face the stallion hesitated a moment on the far bank and then they were up safe one of the grass cats had an arrow through his bicep and another warrior a woman cut the head free and pulled the shaft out through the entry hole all in a few strides of their mounts without stopping kineas had to prod thanatos to turn he was suddenly sluggish he reined in at the base of the thumb and temerix emerged from the dark foliage at his call hold as long as you can theyll come in half an hour then run back south before they cut you off understand temerix leaned on his axe and the shadow hid his eyes yes lord kineass horse was already in motion i am not your lord he called over his shoulder he thought guiltily that he had never arranged for the sindi refugees to meet with srayanka another task left uncompleted the stallion made such heavy work of climbing the ridge that kineas dismounted and checked his hooves for stones but they were clear the animals eyes were wild and kineas put a hand on his neck today he said then he remounted and the horse finished the climb kineas went straight to his own fire where most of the officers were waiting the light was already bright enough to show them the points of the macedonian pikes across the river memnon swatted him as soon as he dismounted are you a boy or a strategist ares prick that was a stupid thing to do he grinned of course since you lived and since every spear in the army watched you do it theyll all think you are a god kineass face was red he couldnt explain what had driven him across the river niceas just shook his head i thought i taught you better than that he said ajaxs eyes sparkled philokles glared ataelus came up mounted and pointed to the south and east kam baqca he said and some friends he leaned down from the saddle the grass cats say you airyanam niceas touched his amulet and downed some tea the grass cats are idiots too kam baqca came up the ridge in the full regalia of a priestess with a high helmet of gold topped by a fantastic winged animal she had a gorget and scale armour all covered in gold and she wore it over a hide coat of unblemished white she rode a dapple grey mare and behind her came another rider as magnificent carrying a tall pole decorated with bronze birds and horsetails and it was covered in bells that made an eerie noise like waves of the sea as she moved with her were half a hundred men and women as well armed and armoured as she every horse had a headdress that made the animal look like a fantastic beast horn and leather worked to give each horse antlers and a crest of hair and their horses where their skin showed beneath all the armour were painted red their manes were filled with mud and had dried erect most of the horses had scale armour of gold and bronze like the warriors so that they might have been griffons or dragons born from myths they were the most barbaric sight kineas had ever seen behind them came petrocolus and the last troop of olbian horse in the wedge of time before the fresh cavalry arrived kineas issued his orders or rather reviewed them at his feet they were already being carried out licurgus was forming the olbian phalanx at the edge of the marsh and the men of the main force of pantecapaeum were filing down the hill and over the marsh forming up as soon as they were clear of the wet ground petrocolus came up on his right hand he looked down the hill under his hand and then saluted were in time he said wearily a late guest is still a welcome guest kineas said he offered his hand and they clasped we tried to catch cleomenes petrocolus said with a shrug he made it to zopryon kineas said i know petrocolus said so we pushed on here kineas leaned over and embraced the old man welcome then his stomach rolled over and he made his mouth move leucon is dead he said petrocolus stiffened in his arms and his face was grey as he pulled away but he was a man of the old school and he pulled himself erect he died well petrocolus asked saving his troop kineas said petrocolus grunted cleituss whole line dead he has no other children alive the archon will take his fortune no he wont said kineas when we are done here you and eumenes will go settle accounts in olbia that vipers son still walks the earth petrocolus spat do not hold eumenes responsible for his fathers treason kineas said petrocolus avoided his eye and spat again kam baqca came up on his left side her face was a white mask of paint and the paint and the gold rendered her inhuman i thought you would go with the king kineas said this is where the monster must be stopped she said so this is where i will die i am ready the inhuman face turned towards him are you ready she asked their eyes met and hers were calm and deep the hint of a smile cracked the paint at the corner of her mouth i see it to the end she said and it is still balanced on the edge of a sword indeed on the point of an arrow im ready he said he had his armour on and all his finery a little worn from two days in the saddle but still fine and the king he asked gone to the sea of grass she answered will he come in time kineas asked not for me she answered kineas nodded he motioned to sitalkes waiting patiently like all the men of his troop for their turn to descend the ridge stay at my shoulder and carry my spears he said the young getae saluted like a greek and took his javelins kineas pushed past the horses of the other officers to where a troop slave stood with thanatos the big animal was trembling kineas vaulted on to his back and the stallion grunted slumped and fell kineas just managed to get clear without tangling in his cloak what the fuck he said he pointed to the slave get me another mount there was an arrow ironically it was a sindi arrow it stuck out of the big stallions chest with just the fletching showing the poor beast and hed never seen here they come cleitus said kineas ran to the edge of the ridge the taxeis was coming out of the ford their ranks were disordered and they were bunching to the north side of the ford kineas knew immediately it was the rawer of the two taxeis hed seen he turned back to his officers here we go he said his heart pounding in his chest and all the calm of the early morning drained away his hands shook like leaves in the wind you know the plan he said his voice high with tension and fear philokles had his helmet on the back of his head once again he was naked except for the baldric of his sword over his shoulder the black spear was in his hand he handed it to kam baqca and stepped forward to kineas and embraced him go with the gods brother he said then he took his spear from the icon on horseback and clasped her hands go with the gods he said to her philokles men were already standing in their ranks to the left of the olbian phalanx now philokles tossed his helmet down over his oiled beautifully combed hair tossed his spear and ran straight down the face of the ridge disdaining the trail so that he ran across the face of his men before arni could bring kineas a fresh horse his men roared niceas handed kineas an apple it was sound despite its age kam baqca brought a bag he said kineas took a bite and the smell caught him so that he thought of ectabana and persopolis of alexander and artemis and victory at his feet the raw macedonian taxeis was trying to restore its order the blacksmiths men on the thumb were merciless they poured arrows into the shieldless flank of the taxeis men were dying not many but enough to make the whole block flinch away from the thumb just as they had when they crossed the ford until their own psiloi came up and cleared the thumb they had to take the harassment and having crossed they had to wheel to the right to face memnons angled line a difficult manoeuvre at the best of times rendered more difficult by the arrows of the sindi the raw taxeis was followed by the veterans they crossed in perfect order and started to form to the left of the younger block the first taxeis was supposed to be anchored on the river while the veterans had the more difficult task of covering the endless open ground on their left where sakje scouts already rode in close to put arrows into the phalangites from his vantage kineas could see the cavalry preparing to cross next zopryon was committed now hes made a mistake kineas said quietly he took another bite of apple niceas was mocking enough of a mistake to save us at odds of three to one he waved and the arc of his arm encompassed the whole field at their feet how long do you think our city hoplites will hold that and where the fuck is the king kineas took another bite of his apple and chewed carefully because it covered his nerves and put something in his stomach besides cramps those are the questions he said niceas nodded your stupid heroics cost him time ill give you that he turned to look at kineas will he let you die here to win the lady hipparch redcloaked companions were coming up on the right flanking the veteran phalanx and behind them more cavalry companions and thessalians kontos would be there now trying to get his men formed to face the sakje men on exhausted horses kineas made his decision he tossed the apple core as far as he could another boyish gesture and mounted his spare warhorse a big sakje gelding big but nothing on thanatos petrocolus stay right here form to the right of the sakje he pulled the horses head round follow me he said to niceas and drove the horse down the trail straight across the marsh the trail was all mud but the ground was already drier and then across the front of eumenes troop of horse hold here for my order he said to eumenes eumenes saluted kineas rode to memnon the macedonians were half a stade away and memnon never took his eyes from them kineas reined in were going to attack right now i need you to push the raw taxeis to the right he said every pace matters let them come as far down the field as you dare and then try to push them to the right memnon still had his shield on his foot and his helmet on the back of his head he took his eyes off the macedonian line long enough to flash kineas a victors smile didnt i tell you it would come to this the spear push against macedon he turned away from kineas saying best ride clear hipparch this is where things get dirty and as soon as kineas had his horse in motion memnon bellowed spears and shields like an old bull accepting a challenge as kineas rode down the front ranks every olbian pulled his helmet down over his head set his shield on his arm and lifted his shield kineas drew his sword and lifted it in salute and they started to cheer silence roared memnon cheering is for amateurs and they were silent to his right the phalanx of pantecapaeum copied their motions indeed not a single pace separated the two formations kineas came to the front of philokles men philokles himself was at the front right corner kineas leaned down the eyes in the helmet were alien ferocious bestial when you hit push right kineas yelled every pace will count kineas pointed down the field where the macedonians were coming on just a hundred paces or so away the veteran phalanx marched as if on parade the other phalanx was still being galled by the arrows of the sindi and its files closest to the river were disordered men on that flank had their eyes on the oak trees next to them and arrows came out of the trees at point blank range to punch men screaming from their feet not many men but enough the front rank had an enormous bend in it and the middle ranks were not closing up and the whole taxeis was angling away from their tormentors on the riverbank a space fifty paces wide had opened between the rightmost file of the phalanx and the riverbank as they tried to avoid the arrows i see it said the voice of ares from philokles helmet kineas rose erect on his mount go with the gods he said and rode down the line to where eumenes waited as he came up eumenes was pointing at the gap dont point kineas said at this range a single gesture could alert one of the enemy officers to their peril memnon had his men in motion their spears were down their shields up and the whole line went forward as one and the macedonian pikes were coming down and beyond them the heavy cavalry was moving toward kineass right flank time for the grass cats and the standing horses time for nicomedes and heron but they were on their own kineas was here there was a roar from the olbians or the pantacapaeans or both and an answering roar from the macedonians just to kineass right philokles men moved faster breaking into a trot the macedonian pikes were longer than the oldstyle hoplite spears a man had to be very brave to face the prospect of pushing his body his shield and his head through the wall of pike points philokles men were brave and they had proven their mettle the day before they went into the iron forest without hesitation at the trot and kineas heard philokles war voice roar now and then the lines met shield to shield from kineass place on horseback he could see the spartans transverse plume of scarlet and he saw the eddy of carnage the spartan left behind him and the whole of the epilektoi made a noise like cattle or thunder and the macedonians whose front hadnt been perfectly formed to start moved it was all a matter of two paces the epilektoi struck and then two paces later the olbian spears were in memnons challenge carrying even over the sound of war the raw phalanx of macedonians contracted and men fell as they lost their balance and suddenly philokles plume moved forward three paces five the macedonians were struggling to restore their order a lot of men were dying kineas rode to the head of eumenes troop he faced the men we will go right along the edge of the phalanx he said at my order we will turn and charge there will be no room there will be no time the river waits for a man who pushes too fast on the left and the spears will eat a man who pushed too far to the right philokles charge had gained them another five paces they had a gap of perhaps sixty paces between the macedonian flank and the river kineas tried to catch every eye we will turn the block just as on the drill field it must be done well everyone see it this is where you show that you learned your lessons time was flowing away he took his spears from sitalkes even sitalkes looked grim kineas had no time for men even those he loved he turned for niceas niceas nodded his bridle hand at his throat he was murmuring his prayer to athena walk kineas ordered as soon as the block of fifty was moving he ordered trot to the right the epilektoi were faltering even disadvantaged the macedonians were deeper their files stronger they were pushing hard the transverse plume was still leaving an eddy of death memnons men were locked there were horses dying farther to the right and kineas could hear their screams like a demand for his attention but he had chosen his foe and almost at his feet the terrified eyes of the rightmost file leader in the young taxeis locked with his kineas rode past him along the highway of the empty ground where the new men had flinched from the sindi the deeper he got the more ruin hed cause the rightmost file was raising their pikes kineas didnt think that one file could stop him but neither did he care to lose men right turn kineas yelled ten paces separated him from the flank of the pikes an absurd distance the men behind the right files were already defeated his heart swelled with a dark joy charge he said they were only fifty men but the taxeis couldnt endure the invasion of their files and men in a phalanx panic when they sense an enemy behind them for good reason kineas threw one of his javelins into the unshielded side of a pikeman and then he was among them wielding his heavy javelin twohanded reaching out over his horses neck to plunge it down into his foes while his horse bowled men over or kicked them he struck and struck again more concerned to sew havoc than to finish off wounded men his good javelin was suddenly gone jammed into a mans skull where the helmet failed to cover his cheeks and then the egyptian sword was rising and falling the macedonians had heavy glued linen cuirasses and idle blows did no damage to them but their backs were turning under his weapon they broke slowly a file at a time and the irony of the olbian charge was that the collapse of the riverward taxeis occurred after the olbian attack had lost all of its impetus in the press of bodies but the pressure on their front was relentless and the threat of the cavalry was enough the rear ranks flowed away and then the whole mass almost three thousand men was pouring away the olbian horse had to let them go they were already spent and they were only half a hundred niceas was blowing his trumpet and they were slow to rally the flank of the veteran taxeis was open but the olbians were too slow too tired and the veterans had seen the threat their flank files turned smartly and their pikes came down while their main force pressed to the front forcing the lightly armed men of pantecapaeum and the olbian phalanx back foot by foot kineas didnt like the sound of the battle on the right he glanced at the sun still early morning for all that he felt that he had fought all day kineas reined in by eumenes who had lost his helmet you have the command here kineas pointed at the gap the road that still ran all the way to the ford do all the damage you can he said eumenes looked at his tired men and the gap are we winning he asked kineas shrugged you just broke a macedonian taxeis he said what more do you want wheres the king asked eumenes good question thought kineas as he rode for the right flank he rode up the ridge with niceas and sitalkes at his heels he had to see the rout of the riverside phalanx had evened the score but no more and the veterans were holding memnons men or even pushing them back zopryons main effort was falling to the right of the olbian infantry there was a cavalry melee to the right of the spearmen companions and thessalians olbians and sakje it stretched from the right flank of memnons men all the way to the north end of the ridge in persia there had always been dust dust was kind it hid the bestial panorama beneath a shroud of earth the poet called it the battle haze the damp ground of the sea of grass was not so kind and kineas was looking down at a cauldron of death with no disguise no shroud of dust the armoured mass of macedon had fallen like the smiths hammer on nicomedes troop and the grass cats kaliax of the standing horse had hidden in the tall grass to the north and west of the ridge had swept into the flank of the macedonians and stopped their advance but that was all the whole fight was balanced a great circular melee of cavalry that stretched from kineass feet to the north of the ridge three stades of dying men and horses the balance was about to be broken there were fresh macedonians coming across the ford they had to push through the broken taxeis but someone would rally the raw men soon balanced on the point of an arrow kineas thought but only until the fresh macedonian horse pressed into the sakje on the far right then the cavalry fight would unravel like a skein of yarn and the thessalians would fall on the flank of memnons infantry and the rout would start where is the king kineas asked the sky and the gods under his eye sakje shot macedonians at arms length and macedonian lances emptied saddles and men fought with spears and swords or bare hands and daggers kineas fought the urge to do something it was hard to sit and watch his reserve was pitifully small his attempt to deliver a great blow against zopryons line and withdraw had gone awry there was no longer any hope of withdrawal like two wrestlers the two armies could only fight until one was beaten they were locked close kineas thought he saw zopryon a big macedonian in a purple cloak was pushing up the bank of the ford and even as he watched the man pointed at the cavalry melee and shouted an arrow plucked the man at zopryons side from his horse the sindi on the thumb were still fighting still slowing zopryons manoeuvres across the ford kam baqca was at his side she gestured with her whip more like a staff of white wood i curse them and they die she said the grass curls around the legs of their horses the worms open holes for their hooves kineas drank from a gourd of water handed to him by one of the slaves zopryons horses are exhausted even with his advantage in numbers hes having trouble he grimaced i was a fool to make a stand i cannot break off and the king is late he met her eyes i need you to charge yes i will charge i will hold him she answered but she returned his smile a singularly sweet smile like that of a young girl receiving praise i am ready to die now she said and now is the time for me kineas shook his head and for me not yet i think she said goodbye baqca perhaps this will teach you the humility i never learned she motioned with her staff and her escort formed around her at the top of the ridge they formed an arrowhead with kam baqca and the standard at the tip kineas wanted to remonstrate that they couldnt ride straight down the ridge but they were sakje and he knew them she flashed him one last smile charge she shouted in a mans voice they fell down the hill like an avalanche of horseflesh and they punched through the nearest ranks of macedonians like a cleaver through meat dozens fell nicomedes beleaguered troop was saved and the survivors rode clear dismounted drank water kam baqcas risk allowed her to cut straight into the heart of the cauldron and her fifty riders were like an arrow of gold flying through swirl of fog and mud kineas sat with sitalkes at his shoulder and watched the charge so great was their impetus and so hot burned their fire that the cauldron of the melee moved away from the marshs edge in the centre the macedonian cavalry flinched away from memnons men kineas pulled his gaze away from the sakje priestess at his feet the veteran taxeis was no longer pushing memnon back philokles young epilektoi were into their flank files from the height kineas could see philokles plume could hear his battle rage even as he watched philokles tipped his great shield slammed it into a new opponent and rolled his enemys shield down with the force of his arm and then killed him with a brutal spear lunge into the mans unprotected throat the men behind philokles victim shifted uneasily farther to the west between the thumb of oaks and the flank of the veterans the empty grass was filling with peltasts and thrakes and there were thrake cloaks amidst the trees hand to hand with the sindi who had stayed at their post to the end and whose arrows had been the margin on the left eumenes would charge the thrake and win or lose either way the left would hold philokles and memnon were spear to spear with the best macedon had to offer and nothing kineas could do would change their fight at the north end of the ridge grass cats and olbians milled at the edge of the maelstrom leaderless the golden arrowhead had gone deep and the beast was wounded but golden men and women were falling now kineas could no longer see zopryon but he could read the mans thoughts zopryon must think that the golden arrow was the last throw and that the golden helm was the king of the sakje and off to the west another flash of gold came across the river and out on the sea of grass his heart rose the king it was just midmorning and he needed an hour one more distraction would buy time and keep men alive if the right held then the centre would hold and the king would come to find the men of olbia alive if the right collapsed then the king would come only to build pyres for the dead and if the kings delay was deliberate kineas turned to petrocolus who looked older than his fifty years follow me he said without a word he rode down the north flank of the ridge even from the last of the ridge he could still see the horsetail standard well out on the plain he wondered what would happen if he refused his fate and rode away he laughed he motioned to nicomedes men where they were drinking water and they remounted to follow him swelling his numbers farther east there were grass cats getting remounts and a dozen of diodoruss troopers and diodorus these gentlemen gave us fresh horses diodorus said his helmet was gone and his red hair was almost blond in the sun he had a nasty wound across his shoulder and one of the straps on his breastplate was severed its been warm work here i thought we were going to withdraw kineas shrugged too late diodorus started to struggle with his breastplate and sitalkes handed him a length of leather the two of them worked to tie the breastplate tighter niceas was organizing the survivors into a single troop wheres the king diodorus asked kineas pointed out to the west with his whip the king is coming he said men stopped what they were doing to listen and he shouted it pointing across the melee and the rising dust the king is coming and the word spread like a grassfire on the plains diodorus gave his cynical halfsmile of course he is he said and slapped kineas on the back plate lets ride to meet him kineas made a motion with his whip and the olbians fell in on him and grass cats rode in a loose knot at their right as they rode north more men joined them wounded men and men who had perhaps had enough of the fight and now felt differently kineas didnt harangue them he just gathered them his eyes on the horsetail standard every sakje eye was on the horsetail standard and every macedonian eye sacred to the one royal to the other kineas gathered his men while the maelstrom swirled to a new centre he kept them moving north pecking at the melee to disengage those who could be pulled free the ground was losing its moisture and the dust of the deadly battle haze was finally starting to rise kineas watched the battle as he pushed north the macedonian horses were done ruined by the campaign not the battle and they could never pursue when the sakje gave ground so that he was able to take men out of the battle lines and the macedonians could do nothing in response but watch it took time and he saw too much he saw nicomedes body pinned under ajaxs horse just a spears length from the mangled remains of cleomenes the traitor he saw lykeles with a broken lance straight through his body and gentle priestly agis would sing no more of the poets words with a sword cut across his face and neck the olbian cavalry had held the worst of the first macedonian charge and paid and varo of the grass cats was surrounded by his household with a ring of dead enemies like a hill fort the survivors were grim faced but they rallied under the leadership of varos daughter urvara he gathered them and moved north while the attention of his enemy was locked on the horsetail standard and then the standard fell every sakje gave voice together and despite the distortion of a thousand voices kineas knew the word baqca they cried by then kineas had almost two hundred men olbians and men of pantecapaeum diodorus and andronicus coenus ataelus heron and laertes with a length of linen tied around his bridle hand two dozen grass cats and a handful of bloody standing horses as well as niceas petrocolus and his troop he was as far around the flank as he could spare the time to go and he prayed to athena that his two hundred men would like kam baqcas charge distract zopryon and his army for a few more minutes the sun was high in the sky above the dust he pointed to where the standard had fallen thats where zopryon is he called his voice still strong sitalkes put a javelin in his hand he looked at his friends there was no tree across the stream he was on the wrong horse no ford the whole thing was insane but the feeling of victory that suffused him was the same and so he knew that this would be the time and he meant to see it finished zopryons head is srayankas bride price he yelled and his voice held they laughed because of whom they were hellenes and sakje laughing together and their laughter was terrible charge he said for the last time the macedonian horses could barely stumble along and many of the macedonian cavalrymen were fighting dismounted his two hundred appeared out of the dust and bit into the redcloaked companions to his front as a complete surprise and they were knocked flat many died and many more fought back like desperate men kineas found phillip kontos in the battle haze the mans horse reared throwing back his magnificent cloak and kineas knew him and gave a yell kontos knew him too and they came together with a crash of armour and horses chest to chest kontos was his match blow for blow and their horses bit at each other the enemy officers stallion a better mount than his but luck was against him and kineass weakest blow went past his guard and fingers sprayed away from his adversarys sword hand like twigs from an axe and the man fell against the mane of his horse and from there to the ground kineas circled him wanting his horse and his javelins kontos clutched the ruins of his sword hand and looked up at him battle rage spent and before kineas could consider mercy ataelus shot him dead kineas whirled his brute of a horse and looked around the battle had moved past him ahead coenus was dismounted collecting javelins and sitalkes was finishing an opponent ataelus pushed past him to shoot and every time he had an arrow knocked he reared his horse for an extra span of height and every arrow emptied another saddle while kineas pushed his horse into motion diodorus engaged an officer cut hard with his heavy javelin and a thessalian lance caught him in the back plate and unhorsed him kineas dug in knees and heels and his horse responded flowing over the ground kineass sword flicked out right through the eyes and nose of the thessalian a blow rang against his helmet and he cut backwards underarmed and saw ataelus behind him rising to shoot even as kineass new enemy whirled his javelin to strike again kineass sword cut the mans thigh and ataeluss arrow emerged from the bronze of his helmet and then kineas had diodoruss wrist in his hand and he got him up behind without stabbing him with the sword while ataelus continued to fire point blank into the melee im not a general anymore kineas thought he saw kontoss riderless horse rode at it and it shied but ataelus was there with a lasso diodorus slipped off his gelding and got a leg over the strange horse apollo hes a giant he called they were almost alone a minute away from the combat and it had moved south the ground had dried and the dust was rising faster the familiar dust that gathered over every melee nothing was visible a javelins throw away closer than that men were just shapes moving in the dust like ghosts kineas took a breath looked around put his heels to his gelding and the brute responded kineas had time to be pleased and then he was back in the madness something had changed the noise was different and the whole shifting mass of the fight was moving west like an ocean current kineas pressed after it a flurry of blows his sword bit deep and locked in the bone of a mans arm and it was gone behind him in the brawl he had no time to regret its loss he had a dagger and his whip and he used both pressing his next opponent close slashing the sakje weapon across the mans face and then finishing him with the dagger clutching his mount with his knees to keep from slipping something caught him in the hip a flare of pain and then nothing more and there was a javelin trapped between his leg and his horse he grabbed at it pulled it clear of his girth strap and fell straight to the ground as the strap gave under him he never felt the blow that put him down horses hooves all around him grunts the scream of a horse and he couldnt get his feet under him right leg wouldnt answer dust in his mouth filling his throat a horse stepped on him and stepped away without testing his breastplate with its whole weight and he still had no breath dust everywhere and hooves and a javelin kineas screamed coenus he whirled a javelin swinging it twohanded like a thrake sword clearing a space around his commander and sitalkes was there he still had a javelin to throw and he threw hard killing the man at kineass right and then he unhorsed another and pushed his horse past kineas and coenus had one of his wrists and niceas had the other he was up ataelus had another horse he grinned his face a mask of grime with two burning blue eyes somewhere between him voices cheered apollo and ataelus reached for his gorytos and came away without an arrow kineass right hip was aflame and the leg was unresponsive he could just stay astride the new horse it hurt his balls to canter because he couldnt get his knees to lock he looked right and left he could see nothing but battle haze and shadowy figures but the sound to his left was the paean of apollo and he could hear as the olbian hoplites pressed forward he didnt need to be able to see what was happening invisible in the murk the veteran macedonians were giving way somewhere in the dust the king was finally on the field nothing else would have the same effect they had won kineas knew the feeling having felt it in the dream the certainty of victory he glanced around at his friends and then without a word he pushed into the cloud again feeling the strength of a god despite his wound the daimon that lifts a man above himself in the eye of the battle storm knowing that these were his last moments and determined to ride fates horse to the very end he followed sitalkes who left a swathe of dead the width of his reach because the enemy was in the cloud and because thats where the rest of his friends were now and srayanka there were grunts and calls and animal screams but the song had changed the battlefield was a hymn to victory for the greeks rout for the macedonians and there was cheering from the ford apollo again from the left athena from coenus at his right hand the macedonian army was dying kineas had a javelin too long and too heavy and the gods knew where hed gotten it he thrust it at a macedonian face and the man went down taking the javelin with him and kineass horse was astride the broken body of kam baqca gold and dirt mingled beneath his horses hooves another red cloak and sitalkes swept him from the saddle the dust was rising faster or the sun was stronger the falling red cloak had the horsetail standard in his fist kineas hit him hit him again lashing him with the whip screaming his war cry in the mans panicked face sitalkes got a hand on the standard and together they killed the man and sitalkes held the standard high sakje voices cheered fresh voices and closer now more macedonians where were they coming from kineass head snapped back as something hit him a hard blow he couldnt see but he hung on his whip rising and falling and then he was free like a ship at sea that cuts loose an anchor and he had his reins and the gelding was still under his command he whirled his whip his arm feeling like a chunk of wood the tendrils of the weapon caught at an enemy helmet as soon as it tore free he saw sitalkes cut a man from his horse and a dismounted macedonian cut at his side clanging against his breastplate and sitalkes fell amid the hooves gone in the dust the standard going down again coenus killed the macedonian and ataelus caught the standard kineas was eye to eye with zopryon there was no shock the man was where he ought to have been at the centre of the battle cloud kineas had long enough to see defeat in his eyes and rage kineas lashed him with the whip two quick blows and one of them went home a tendril of the lash wrapping under the brim of the mans gilt helmet and taking an eye but zopryons back slash with his sword cut through the sakje whip leaving kineas with a handle of gold and no weapon kineas leaned forward and the gelding responded rushing the bigger horse and catching him broadside on the geldings teeth bit hard and the stallion struck back but kineas caught zopryons rising sword arm with his left hand and trapped it with his right used the other mans strength and his strong left leg against his horses spine to clasp him tight and pull him down and they were in the dust the horses a storm of teeth and hooves above them kineas fell on top and their bronze breastplates bounced and winded them both kineas got an arm around the mans neck nose to nose zopryons breath was foul like a bad wound and his eyes were those of an injured boar zopryon by luck or skill forced kineas back against his injured leg and kineas screamed twice zopryon got the pommel of his sword against kineass helmet and his head rang with the blows and darkness threatened kineas had only one good leg but rage and thirty years of wrestling broke the macedonians bridle arm in a scream of sweat and blood the crack of the arm seemed like the loudest sound on the battlefield but pain rage desperation strength born of despair allowed zopryon to roll back rise to his knees in the dust and ignoring his shattered left arm cock his sword for a killing blow kineas went for his second dagger trapped by his injured leg too slow the first arrow went into the macedonian just above the circle where his neck emerged from his breastplate and then he seemed to grow arrows like some trick of a stage machine one then four kineas was on one knee and he couldnt think very well but he raised his head and her blue eyes were there above a tall horse and above them the dust rose like a funeral pyre and even as he looked at her the dust opened and he was looking at the sky the sky above the dust was blue and in the distance far out over the plain clouds rose in pristine white up there in the aether all was peace an eagle best of omens turned a lazy circle to his right closer less auspicious birds circled a hand grasped his hard as iron on the calloused side and soft as doeskin on the back under his thumb and darkness took him he was sitting on a horse in the middle of a river a shallow river with rocks under his horses feet and pink water flowing over and around the rocks the ford it was a ford was full of bodies men and horses all dead and the white water burbling over the rocks was stained with blood the river was enormous he lifted his head and saw the far side where piles of driftwood made the riverbank look like the shore of the sea and a single dead tree rose above the red rocks of the shore there were other men behind him all around him and they were singing he was astride a strange horse tall and dark and he felt the weight of strange armour is this any river you have ever seen kam baqca asked mockingly no he admitted feeling like a boy with his tutor the hubris of men and their vanity is beyond measurement she laughed and he looked at her and the white of her face paint could not obscure the rot that had taken most of the flesh of her cheeks youre dead he said my body is dead she said and mine he asked even as he spoke he looked down and the skin of his arm was firm and marked with all the scars that life had given him she laughed again go back she said it is not yet your time there were three of them sitting on the branches of the tree and each was more hideous than the last the one on the lowest branch reached above her and took something from the crone on the next branch and when she looked at him she had just one eye but that was as bright as a young girls she held up her hand and from it dangled a thread or perhaps a single hair of a child and it was bright gold and shone with its own light although it was shorter than the width of a mans finger not much left she said and she cackled but better than nothing eh enough to father a child or two giggled one of her hideous sisters enough to defeat a god roared the one on the highest branch but only if you hurry
