gerald seymour the unknown soldier prologue i had a life it was not the best not the worst but it was a life it was hard a struggle but i did not complain because it was the life that god had given me i had happiness the voice dripped sometimes it faded away was lost under the noise of the combivans engine sometimes it was little more than a whisper i was blessed my wife was muna our son was three years old our daughter was close to one year they were fine children the girl had good eyes that were the colour of the earlymorning skies in summer and she would have been beautiful we lived in the village with my wifes parents and four houses away were my parents her father had fields for goats and my father had an orchard for apples and peaches her father said after our marriage that he no longer wanted to drive the taxi and he gave it to me it was generous of him to give me the taxi and i thought that one day i would have enough money to buy a second vehicle and employ a driver it was what i hoped a man with two taxis is a man of substance caleb thought the driver talked to stay awake the others slept the combivan stank from the engines fumes and from the oil that thev used to clean the weapons none of them had washed for more than a week caleb could not sleep because he was squashed tight against the driver and each time the driver twisted the wheel or reached down for the gearstick an elbow nudged into his ribcage and jolted him three of his friends had crammed into the rear seats with their rifles the rocketpropelled grenadelauncher and the rucksack with the missiles three more were immediately behind him cradling the rusted old calibre machinegun taken eleven years earlier from a russian paratroop platoon his own body separated the chechen from the driver to whom only caleb listened we did not think the war would come to us we thought the war was for the cities for kabul kandahar jalalabad once there had been a camp for the foreigners near to the village but it had not been used for two years and we did not think we would be a target why should we be it was an early morning like any other i had prayed in the dawn at the mosque and the imam had spoken to us and then i had gone to bring wood for my father and for my wifes father and i had drawn water from the well and had washed the taxi windows and its body and i had measured the oil and then i had told my wife when i would be home in the evening we were worried for our son because he coughed but i had said to my wife that i would try in the town in the day to get medicine that day my father was going to select a goat for slaughter because we were close to my wifes birthday and my wifes father was going to cut back dead wood from the trees in the orchards it was like any other day and the war was far away i said goodbye to my wife and i held my son while he coughed up on to my shoulder and i kissed my girl god forgive me but i spoke sharply to my wife because my sons phlegm stained my shirt and that would not be good when i went into the town to hope for passengers in my taxi i left them i drove past the mosque and past my fathers fields where his goats were and past my wifes fathers orchards and as i went down the hill very slowly because the road is not tarmacadam but crushed stone i saw the trails of the aeroplanes in the skies to the chechen who had a patch of leather fastened with elastic over his right eye and whose left hand was replaced with a chromecoated metal claw caleb was abu khaleb he and the other men had fought in the north and on the plain south of kabul and then north of kandahar had fought and fled when disaster was about to overwhelm them then fought again and fled again for a week they had not rested had barely eaten for each of them pressed into the combivan the taxi it was hard to accept defeat they were now on a flat plain featureless without trees or hills without cover and their destination was the mountains where if those were their orders they would finally stand and fight from caves ravines and high ground if they reached the mountains i was driving down the hill from the village very carefully so that the holes would not damage underneath the vehicle and the trails from three aeroplanes were coming towards me they were very high and i could not see the planes themselves only the trails they loft behind in our village we knew little about the war everything we knew came from the imam who had a radio set and who listened to the broadcasts of the leadership from kabul but we were far from kabul i remember i was angry with the dust that came up from the road because i had just washed the windows i had no interest in the aeroplanes it was a good morning and the sun shone i thought i was blessed by god and i was thinking of the feast for my wifes birthday i regretted that i had spoken sharply to her about my shirt his head rocked his chin drooped even if caleb could have slept he would not have done the elbow butted into his ribcage but the taxidriver who used only the sidelights of the combivan had swerved twice on to the rough gravel beside the tarmacadam and each time caleb had snatched the wheel heaved it over and prevented them spewing off the road in the toyota pickup with the calibre machinegun mounted over the cab they had been at the back end of a fivevehicle convoy fleeing for the mountains it would have been chance luck that the first four pickups had twisted and negotiated a way through an old roadblock of concretefilled oil drums and had missed the coil of loose barbed wire their pickup had caught it they had driven on hearing the scraping of the tangle of wire and had thought they would lose it they had not the front left tyre had gone first then the rear right within a kilometre the two tyres were shredded and they were detached from the convoy with the cold til the evening gathering round them there had been an argument in a babble of voices caleb had said they should stay by the road and the chechen had backed him he was the chechens favourite four hours later the taxi van had come down the road another argument when it was halted at gunpoint they were outside the part of afghanistan they knew they were strangers there caleb had said they should use the driver and again the chechen had backed him three hours later and caleb smiled ruefully at the thought of it he knew the driver the drivers immediate family the drivers distant family and the drivers village in the heat of the vehicle he had shrugged out of his camouflage tunic the floppy hanging trousers the longtailed shirt and the wool cap without a peak made warmth enough i saw my friend omar he had gone down the road from the village to see if there was grazing lower on the hill he is a good man we used to talk and take coffee together when i was not in the town with the taxi i was slowing when it seemed as if the world exploded the taxi was lifted up from the road if i had not seen omar and braked to talk to him the taxi would have gone off the road i would have been killed better if i had been killed but that was not gods will i was two kilometres from the village or perhaps a little more and the noise was like thunder but greater than anything i had ever heard before i braked i ran from the vehicle and lay in a ditch with omar my face in the water i thought the thunder would break my ears then it was gone when i dared to look up i saw the trails of the aeroplanes going away but i could not see our village there was a great cloud over it a cloud of dust the cloud was from the camp that had not been used for two years right to my village and past it the old camp and the village were underneath the cloud and there was quiet you would like to see a photograph of my family caleb nodded he knew how the story would end a wallet was passed to him and he opened it he saw the identification card behind brittle plastic fawzi alateh he saw the date of birth the driver was twentyfive years old four months older than himself there was the photograph of the driver faded in black and white probably taken on his wedding day but with a straggling beard and a wispy moustache the drivers finger jabbed at the picture beside the identification card in it fawzi alateh stood tall beside a slight woman who wore the dark chador robe caleb could not see her face the driver held their son against his shoulder and the wife held their daughter against her hip he held the wallet down by his knees so that the dashboard lights lit it they were all dead my wife my son and my daughter were dead my parents were dead and my wifes parents the imam was dead the family of omar were dead a helicopter flew over in the afternoon but did not land we buried all of the dead that we could find but there were still some that we had not reached but who we could smell i think god was kind to me because we buried my wife my son and my daughter and my wifes parents but we did not find my father and my mother it was six days before help came foreigners in soldiers uniforms they were americans and they gave money to omar and myself i kept my money god forgive me but omar threw their money back at their feet and they beat him then took him away in their trucks i was left there was me and some dogs and the goats that had been in the fields i took my taxi down to the town i the spotlight blazed in front of him its beam bouncing in the dust encrusted on the windscreen he saw the shape of a man shadow thrown grotesquely forward rifle at the hip an arm raised high above the symmetric shape of a helmet maybe the driver panicked maybe terror locked his foot down on the accelerator maybe he had never been confronted by the halflit silhouette of an american soldier the combivan surged past the soldier for a moment it was clear of him and free locked in calebs hand the wallet was unseen unfelt there were cries shouts of awakened confusion behind him and a claw dug into his arm as the chechen tried to steady himself as the van swung in the road the sidelights caught the prone figures of men in camouflage uniforms beside the tarmacadam caleb heard the shouts then the first shots hit the van he glimpsed the wideeyed terror on the drivers face then seconds later felt the warmth as the mans blood spattered on his cheeks and in his beard the van out of control slewed off the road rolled once from side to roof to side then came to rest a door careered open and caleb was hurled across the drivers torso and head his breath squeezed from his lungs the gunfire went on bullets hammered the carcass of the van shouts burst in his ears watch the motherfuckers dont go fucking close careful guys careful hit the fuckers another endless rattle of firing on automatic raked the van caleb hugged the ground between the rocks that had broken his fall from the door it was more than two years since he had heard words in that language it was from his past from a rejected culture a moment of silence then a low moan from inside the van a final rattle of gunfire killed the moan he lay on the ground his teeth chattering his mouth filled with dry earth the spotlight played over the van he had seen men when they were about to die the haunted faces of men in the trenches as the helicopters went over men being led across the football pitch to the crossbar of the goal where a noose hung men who followed the northern alliance and had used all their ammunition all their grenades and now faced captors who were without mercy the spotlights beam roved off the van and edged towards him seemed to nestle against him then held him if he was to be shot this was the moment did they want a prisoner or another corpse he heard the young voice shrill with excitement sergeant theres one alive over here one of the fuckers is alive he awaited the shot the only part of his life flickering across his mind was the last two years because the older past was forgotten he heard the answering shout more distant and anxious watch him kid watch him close he moves his hands shoot him im coming go careful take no chances caleb was his past and erased he was abu khaleb and that was his present in his hand was the opened wallet with the photograph of a taxidriver his wife and children the identification card of fawzi alateh his brain at flywheel speed worked for his future and his survival and his lifeline was the photograph that almost matched his face chapter one the aircraft banked on its final circuit then its nose went down and it started the descent above him the voice was loud shouted over the increased pitch of the engine noise t tell you this has been a journey from hell a voice barked back you want to do it every week sir then you get kind of used to hell its the shit bucket isnt it thats the smell i cant get rid of id say sir that having to wipe their arses for them is worse than the smell he was ignored might not have existed he was as much a piece of cargo as the crates loaded with them on to the transport aircraft after he and the four others had been secured on the steel floor it might have been four days or five since the journey had started he didnt know they had landed three times or four for refuelling now the aircraft dived he knew it was the last leg if it had not been for the straps that held him he would have slid down the floor of the fuselage then cannoned into an obstruction he did not move could not he sat on a small cushion of thin foam but the floor rivets were too prominent for the cushion to protect his backside and the cushion was damp from the urine he had leaked during the bad security thats the policharki gaol and youre going to dump them there thats a nonnegotiable maybe you dont understand captain but i have been with these ragheads the last four days all the way from guantanamo i need a cot dont you hear lieutenant you drop these losers at the policharki then you come back here and find a cot got it yes sir a secondary argument started up sergeant im taking these men into town their restraints have been removed i want them put back on no can do sir that is an order manacle them sorry sir as loadmaster sergeant i have authority over all air force equipment such equipment does not leave my sight does not leave this aircraft manacles chains ear baffles mouth masks goggles and cushions are airforce property goddamnit sorry sir oh and eleven hundred hours is takeoff time you better be back by then if you want a ride out good luck sir he knew the book he had been in military custody for twenty months he knew how the book was written the arguments had not amused him and he sat bolt still with his head down when the goggles were pulled up from his eyes he kept them closed he gave no sign that he had understood a word of the disputes within his hearing a vehicle pulled up manoeuvred close to the open tail and a door was slid open hands lifted him up his eyes were open now but he did not look around him in a stumbling slide he went down the tail and the freshness of the air caught him it was the first time he could remember scenting fresh air since he had been with the chechen his friend and the others beside the long straight road where the pickup had lost its tyres there had been no clean air in the taxi van and when he had been thrown clear at the ambush the stink of cordite had covered him then the stench of the enemy in the personnel carrier and the smell of a holding prison that was exchanged for the shit bucket of the aircraft out there had been no clean pure air in the camp not even in the exercise compound he sucked in the air he was to be taken to kabul and dumped at the policharki he knew the gaol he had taken prisoners there for interrogation men of the northern alliance who had fought against ai qaeda and the taliban but that was long ago deep in the recesses of his memory shared with the policharki was a vague vision of the road from the bagram base into the city if he reached the policharki he would be dead and he had not come home to die he was lifted up into a van with smoked windows the driver was yawning using his forearm to wipe sleep from his eyes a marine was in the back with a rifle grumpily making room for the prisoners as the officer took the front passenger seat the driver grinned and handed back bars of nougat chocolate they drove away and an open jeep followed with a machinegun mounted on a brace behind the driver he remembered the base as a place of ghosts and ruins he remembered it abandoned and looted without turning his head he saw new prefabricated blocks and tent camps then a gate topped with coiled razor wire flanked with sandbags guarded by men in combat fatigues he took heart for twenty months he had existed in a vacuum of time and information that changed the gate was guarded which told him there was still the chance of hostile action on the fifty kilometres of road through flat and featureless farming country between the bagram base and the capital city of kabul as the sentries raised the bar at the base gate the machinegun on the jeep was noisily cocked they left the arclights and the perimeter wire behind them and the driver switched on the radio caught the forces programme and smiled toothily at the officers discomfort it would take as he remembered it an hour at most to reach the outskirts of the city his sole hope was in open country they passed a village the officer ignored the nosmoking sign in the cab and lit a cigarett the driver grimaced if he were in the policharki if he were interrogated by afghan security the hard bastards of the northern alliance he would fail he would be dead memories of the road silted in his mind a village as he had known it more than twenty months before flashed past in the headlights two ruined compounds gutted in earlier lighting wore on the right there were open fields and scrub then if his memory held there were trees beside the road both sides his fingers played with the sharp edge of the plastic bracelet on his wrist he coughed was ignored and coughed again the officer turned irritated and the cigarette smoke wreathed his face he looked pathetic and cringed then pointed downwards the officers eyes followed where he pointed to his groin the driver too had turned back to look shit man the driver whined not in here not in my vehicle im not having him piss in my vehicle the driver didnt wait for the officers agreement he braked hard swerved on to the gravel stopped i take onestar generals in this vehicle im not having it pissed in the officer climbed out threw down his cigarette and opened the back door he climbed out and the officers hand steadied him he smiled his thanks he went to the side of the road and knew he was watched by the men in the jeep who had the mounted cocked machinegun he stepped down off the road and into scrub he fiddled with the zipper at the front of his overalls behind him the strike of a match lit another cigarette a torch played on his back he was coiled tense he did not know whether he would be able to run after four days in the aircraft and the months in the camp if he reached policharki he was dead he ran the torch wavered off him as he wove his legs were leaden he was already panting when he reached the first of the trees a single shot crashed in his ears he heard shouts and the officers voice no dont he isnt worth killing he ran panting gasping for air trying to kick his legs forward hes only a taxidriver he lost the lights and sensed the freedom he ran till he fell then pushed himself up and ran again dawn came across the mountains and the mountain peaks in the east made sharp funnels of sunshine the light speared the coiled wire on the perimeter fence of bagram the sprawling military base originally sovietbuilt an hours drive west across the plain to kabul and slashed at the night mist glinted on the bright corrugatediron roofs of the repaired buildings caught the wan faces of troopers sleepwalking to the shower blocks burned the smoke rising in still air from kitchen stacks lit the dull camouflage of transport aircraft parked on the aprons then threw shadows down from the angles of the wings and tail fins of two small whitepainted planes that were being laboriously manhandled and wheeled out from under shelters of canvas they were like toys in a mans world teams of men not in military fatigues heaved their weight against the slight wings and directed the planes towards a sliproad leading on to the main runway they bent their heads away as a bomber careered past them on full takeoff power these two planes were different from anything else flown off the bagram runway length twentysix feet and eight inches wing span fortyeight feet and six inches height above the oilsmeared tarmac six feet and one inch width of fuselage widest point three feet and eight inches narrowest point one foot and eleven inches they seemed so fragile so delicate ballet dancers in comparison with the clogbooted brigade that screamed up the runway i he planes were each powered by a single twoblade variable pitch pushpropellor capable of flying the machine at top speed of miles per hour and at loiter speed of seventyfive miles per hour when fuel conservation was necessary what a stranger to the base ignorant of modern technology would first have noticed about these two planes was that unbroken white paint covered the forward area where there should have been cockpit glass for a pilots vision what he would not have known was that the planes the unmanned aerial vehicles were regarded by those who knew as the most formidable weapon in the occupying powers arsenal they seemed so innocent in their bright white paint so harmless but their name was predator the dawn light rested on a young man and a young woman walking quickly away from a camouflaged trailer parked beside the sheeting from which the predators designation mq had been wheeled oul by ihe ground crew they passed a satellite dish mounted on a second trailer hitched to a closed unmarked van marty wore baggy brown shorts and a tshirt emblazoned with a yellowstone park brown bear and flipflops she wore jeans with frayed hems and patches at the knees a loose plain green sweatshirt that was crumpled as if shed slept in it and a pair of old trainers his eyes were masked by thick pebble lenses secured in a metal frame his skin was pale his hair a mass of untidy mousy curls his physique was puny lizzyjo was taller but plumper from the weight never discarded after childbirth her dark glasses were hooked on the crown of a wild mess of auburn hair scooped at the back of her head into an extravagant yellow ribbon the stranger seeing them would not have known that between them they controlled the predator temperamentally they could not have been more different he was quiet withdrawn she was noisy exuberant but two common factors bound them into their relationship both were employed by the agency took their orders from langley and were not subject to the military regimen that controlled the base both worshipped in their differing ways the power and meanness of the predator version mq initially when they had been posted to afghanistan the bagram base they had existed inside the inner compound used by the agency and had lived alongside the agency teams and those from the feds who ran the detention block behind a double inner fence of razor wire with its own sleeping eating and recreation quarters an apartheid cocoon for the elite that separated them from the air force people and the marines units at first they had not been part of the general life of the huge base but the war was winding down the al qaeda targets were harder to come by and old disciplines were discarded the best breakfasts at bagram were served in the marines compound the marines had the best cooks the best variety of food the best coffee and a good breakfast would last them through the day in the stifling heat of the ground control station he wore his id card hooked on his belt hers more provocatively was clipped to her tshirt between her breasts after a sentry had checked them through the gate into the marines compound they joined the queue in the canteen in front of them a lieutenant was bitching at a loadmaster sergeant they listened rolling their eyes at each other entertained the lieutenant dead tired and slurring as if hed barely slept said i just felt such a goddamn idiot i never figured that the little bastard was setting me up to do a runner what am i supposed to do mow the little fucker down didnt seem right he was free useless to us no risk but id his name on the docket and was tasked to hand him over at the policharki i tell you my only piece of luck the people that were there at the gaol they never even read the names never did the counting just kicked inside the four we brought i just felt such a fool at falling for that old trick wanting to pee just some simple gook and free after where hes been in the cage at guantanamo why would he want to run dont worry about it sir i mean he wasnt bin laden was he you said just some taxidriver they dressed down marty and lizzyjo to emphasize that they were not military foulups in the military were always entertaining it had made a good start to the day a halfhour later with the dawn on full thrust and killing the mist in the ground control station marty took the predator first lady up off the runway working the small computergame joystick on the bench above his knees carnival girl the second craft was backup and would stay grounded unless needed lizzyjo thwacked her fingers on the console keys and watched as the first pictures flickered then settled on the screens above her the mission that day was for reconnaissance over the tora bora mountains to the southwest the bird climbed optimum conditions with light northeast winds at fifteen thousand feet she reached across tapped his shoulder and pointed to the central screen which gave the realtime image from the belly camera she giggled on his way to the garage to collect his yellow cab eh below the camera clear and in sharp focus on duncoloured scree the figure in the orange overalls was running but slowly marty grimaced not their business the predator hunted meatier prey the orangesuited figure tripped fell and stumbled on then the cameras field surged forward and he was lost what do you think its like in guantanamo dont know and dont care marty murmured side of mouth im going up to seventeen thousand feet altitude whichll be our loiter height ok ok i suppose guantanamo would be kind of scary camp xray guantanamo bay it was the end of the first week and he was learning he had not failed the hardest test hardest was not to respond when an order in english was screamed in his ear no movement no obedience until the order was translated into pashto or a gesture was made to indicate what he should do the numbers coming into the camp were so great that it had taken them a week to process him hands gripped him pulled him upright in front of the white screen a fist took his chin lifted it and lie stared into the camera the light flashed he was manhandled again and turned so that his head was profile to the lens and the light flashed once more the fists took his arms and he was shuffled out through the door and in front of the desk the chains were tight on his ankles and his arms were pinioned behind his back the manacles were fastened to a chain looped round his waist they put the face mask back over his mouth a heavybuilt soldier with a swollen gut and a shaven head gazed up at the number written in indelible ink on his forehead then riffled through the mass of files on the desk beside him a woman sat middleaged her greying hair covered with a loose scarf right boy well start at the beginning name he stared straight ahead and saw the first flicker of impatience in the soldiers eyes the woman translated in pashto the chechen had said that if they were captured the americans would kill them they would torture them then shoot them they would rape their women and bayonet their children the chechen had said it was better to die with the last bullet and the last grenade than to be captured by the americans t am fawzi alateh i am a taxidriver i you answer only my questions i want only answers to what i ask got me she translated fast he had been beaten at the first camp he had been brought to he had not been allowed to sleep questions had rained on him with the fists noise had bellowed in his ears shrill howling sounds played over loudspeakers lights had been shone into his face and if he had slumped in exhaustion he was kicked back upright and made to resume standing then he had been put on the aircraft he had not known still did not the destination for a week he had been in a wire cage in a block of cages and if a man talked through the mesh wire to the prisoner alongside him guards came and shouted and manhandled their victim away there were prayermats in the cages and buckets he had learned from watching the men brought to the camp with him and from those already there some had fought struggled spat at the guards and were kicked for it some had collapsed disoriented and they were loaded on to wheeled stretchers held down with straps and taken away he did not know where to he had been searched had stood naked while fingers in plastic gloves had pried into his ears his mouth and his anus but he had not resisted when it was hardest for him every time it was worst he groped back in his memory for each phrase every word of the story of the taxidriver each detail and every fact of the life of the taxidriver listen here boy you are a prisoner of the united states of america you are held at camp xray at guantanamo bay you probably dont know geography but guantanamo bay is a military base under united states control on the island of cuba you are not classified as a prisonerofwar but as an unlawful combatant you have no rights you will be held here as long as we consider you a threat to our country you will be interrogated here so that we can learn the full extent of your involvement with al qaeda my advice to you is to cooperate with the interrogators when you are brought before them failure to cooperate will lead to harsh punishment measures at camp xray you are a forgotten person you have disappeared off the face of the earth we can do with you what we want you may think this is all a bad dream boy and that you will soon be going home forget it the translators voice droned in his ear as if it was a familiar routine as if the words meant nothing to her behind him he heard the clatter of boots then felt something fastened to his right wrist take him away he was led back to the block of cages flies played on his face but he coidd not swat them because his arms were chained the chain at his ankles constricted his stride and the guards dragged him so that he had to hop so as not to scrape his toes in gravel he was brought down corridors of wire covered with green sheeting he had no comprehension of the size of the camp but from all around he heard the moaning of men whose minds had turned he understood the muttered words of the guards what they would eat that day what movie they woidd see that evening but he showed no sign of his understanding he thought that if they knew he was caleb who had become abu khaleb he would be dragged out one dawn and shot or hanged he thought it would be as the chechen had said the interrogators when he was brought before them would torture him his only protection was the taxidrivers name and the taxidrivers life every detail of what he had been told as he had rocked in tiredness in the front of the van was protection against the fear he was brought to his cage he realized the hatred of the guards they wanted nothing more of him than that he should fight kick spit and give them the excuse to beat him the chains were taken off his ankles and from his waist and the manacles at his wrists were unfastened he was pushed crudely into his cage he squatted down huddled against the back wall near to the bucket and a little of the wind off the sea filtered through the wire at the sides of the cage he held his right wrist in front of his eyes he saw his photograph on the plastic bracelet the reference number usafdp his sex height weight date of birth and his name he tried to remember everything of fawzi alateh it was the only strand he had to cling to the dawn widened ahead caleb saw a greyblue strip the mountains separating the peaks from the skies were patches of snow topped by cloud bundles the high ground was his immediate target he crossed a wilderness of bare ground broken by low outcrops of rock before capture before the twenty months in the cages of guantanamo first at what was called camp xray and then the movement to the newly built and permanenttolast camp delta he had prided himself on his ability to run or travel at forcedmarch pace when he had been proudly in the brigade with saudis and yemenis kuwaitis egyptians and uzbeks he had been one of the fittest twenty months in the cages fawzi alateh the taxidriver had leached the strength from his legs had squeezed the capacity of his lungs if he had not been at home if he had not needed to return to the ranks of his family he would not have been able to move at such speed across the bare stonestrewn ground at the training camp the chechen who had recruited him always made him go first over staminadegrading assault courses because the chechen knew he would do well and would set a standard for the other newcomers afghanistan was the only home he knew and the brigade was the only family he acknowledged everything about a life before the training camps was expelled from his mind it did not exist for twenty months he had been taken out for two sessions a week of fifteen minutes exercise his legs had been shackled his steps stumbling and short within the constraints of the chains length a guard had held each arm and his sandals had scuffed the flattened worn dirt of the circuit in the yard in those twenty months he had been walked the hundred yards to the interrogation block nine times his leg muscles had atrophied but still he ran he sobbed from pain in front of another man an instructor at the training camp an arab in the brigade a guard or interrogator at camp xray or camp delta he would never have shown how pain hurt him he was alone the pain was in his legs in the muscles of his calves and thighs the unworked muscles seemed to scream as he pounded forward when he fell many times he scraped the skin off his knees and elbows and blood stained the cotton of his overalls there was no water and his throat rasped with dryness his lungs sucked in the growing warmth of the air the only time he stopped was when he came to a rutted track and lay in scrub near to it with the scent of wild flowers in his nose he waited till his heartbeat had subsided to listen for a vehicle or a man or a goats bell when he heard nothing only the wind he crossed the track and went on somewhere in front of him by the base of the line of the mountains was the family he yearned for across afghan mountains the iranian land mass and the chasm of the gulf of oman the same dawn rose over a limitless desert of salt flats and razorspined dunes of ochre sand the desert the largest sand mass on earth was flanked to the north by the saudi arabian province of a najd to the east by the oilrich region of al hasa based on the refinery complex near the city of ad dammam and the statelets of the united arab emirates to the south by the hills of oman and yemen to the west by the saudi mountains of the asir range whipped by the winds the desert sands continually moved lorming new peaks and patterns and the great area that was a thousand kilometres wide and six hundred kilometres in depth was perpetually burned by the suns ferocity the itinerant bedouin tribesmen who alone could exist in the deserts privations called it the rub al khali the empty quarter the dawn light thrown low caught the mahogany wings of a hunting eagle it lit the dark upper coat of a stalking fox and highlighted the tracks of the jerboas that would be food for both the fox and the eagle it glistened the still moist gobbet of phlegm spat out by a camel that had passed two days before the light nestled on a point of black darkness between a cleft of rocks where higher ground rose above the western section of the sands other than in the few minutes when the sun came up in the east the entrance to the cave was hidden a man emerged from it and blinked as the suns brightness blinded him after a night in the dim interior behind him in the depth of darkness a petroldriven generator started up and coughed before the engine engaged he spat out the waste between his teeth and lit the first cigarette of the day staring out over the expanse he saw the single sentry squatting in a cleft below the caves entrance a rifle held loosely in his lap he ground out the cigarette then placed the butt in a small tin box later it would go with other waste into a pit dug in the sand then be covered up he whistled to the sentry who turned his head smiled grimly then shook it only the desert confronted them not danger he called back into the cave quietly others emerged when the cave had first been found when the decision had been made that it burrowed far enough into the escarpment for their needs a compass had been used to determine the direction of the holy city of makkah a line was fixed in the memories of each of them as they came in the halflight away from the cave and on to a small square of beaten dirt between the rocks in unison they knelt among the five pillars of their faith was the requirement that they should pray five times each day the fajr was the first obligatory prayer at dawn they were silent as they knelt each man wrapped in his own thoughts but common among them was the pleading to their god that the opportunity be given them for revenge the chance to strike back against the embracing power of their enemy and common among them also was the appearance of hunted men drawnfaced thinbodied exhausted in spirit very few knew of the cave a satellite telephone was inside it but gathered dust and was not used the generator was capable of recharging the batteries of a laptop computer but that was also left idle once a week or less frequently if the security situation was difficult trusted couriers came across the desert with messages food and water all of those in the cave hunted harried and condemned knew that their photographs and biographies were listed in internet sites for the most wanted and they knew the size millions of the accursed dollars of the reward that would be paid out for information that pinpointed the location of their lair for their capture or for their deaths in a few minutes as the sun rose the shadow of the caves entrance would be lost many hours later the same dawn rose this time a slowgrowing light that seeped through dark gunmetal cloud that was thick enough for a second heavy fall of snow it was the last day of their rental on the cabin and in three hours jed dietrich would be loading the vehicle and turning his back on the wild wisconsin lakes it was too late in the year to have a real hope of hooking a decent muskie but it was what he had dreamed of for the last eight months of duty far to the south he took arnie junior with him and left brigitte to pack the bags and clean the cabin the night cold had left the first snowfall as frozen slush on the ground and the water around the pontoon piers where the boats were moored was thinly crusted with ice he checked his sons lifejacket then his own and he saw that the fiveyearold child was shivering in the cold they would not be out long but he could not have given up the years last chance of a good fish in the boat jed smiled reassurance at his son tugged the engine to life and sped out for deeper water the ice crackling at the bow where jed dietrich worked unaccompanied by brigitte and arnie junior there was sunshine warm water and ideal conditions for goodfighting sport fish but recreational boats were not permitted out of harbour by the patrolling coastguards and the beaches were out of bounds to servicemen and civilians because the shoreline was covered by infrared and heatseeking surveillance beams there he could only gaze out at the sea not fish in it theyd tried for more children a brother or sister for arnie junior but had not been fortunate reason enough to have the kid with him for every one of the precious hours it was possible he slowed the engine to little more than idling speed tossed out the lure and let out line with it so that it would go deep then he dropped off the small spoon with little hope that a walleye perch or sucker would be any hungrier than a muskie and winked encouragement at the boy as they trolled across the lake under the thick and darkened cloud they talked fish talk as arnie senior had to him when he was a kid of bigmouthed monsters with rows of slashing teeth and record weights sunken reefs and rock walls where the muskie might gather their habits and lifestyles the little boy liked the talk when jed was away and he had only the photograph of brigitte and arnie junior for company and the phone calls when the kid seemed forever tonguetied he would savour the memory of these moments for now jed dietrich was at peace he was thirtysix years old a humint specialist on the staff of the defense intelligence agency in the sunshine beside the clear caribbean sea where he could not fish the same peace eluded him he was tall wellbuilt looked after himself and he thought arnie junior would soon shape up after him would be useful at football or softball and would soon be able to handle a boat like this on his own arnie junior was his ongoing obsession a point of focus in a workload that was now tedious pointless boring too often down in the distant south as the translators voice whined in his ear he thought of his kid and found his attention sliding away from his target out on the water with the quiet about him and only the childs chatter and the engine to listen to he had felt the tension drain from him he felt good no matter there were no fish and then his son squealed his rod arching they were both laughing and shouting and reeled in a nineinch smallmouth bass then returned it to the water because jed taught his boy to respect the prey they fished another hour no more takes no more bites but it did not matter the peace was total they would fly down to dc and stay a few days with arnie senior and wilhelmina then brigitte would go back to the onebedroom apartment they rented near to the pentagon and he would take the feeder flight down to puerto rico and on to guantanamo brigitte broke the peace she stood on the dock in her windcheater waved and called them in the holiday was over ahead of him were the camp the prisoners the monotony the cringing answers and the stale routine of going over ground already exhausted the camp seemed to call him and he turned his face away from his son and cursed softly but the kid wouldnt have seen his irritated frown or heard the obscenity camp delta dragged him back a day had passed and a night another dawn another day another night and then the sun peeped up he woke caleb felt the sharp tugging at the arm of his overall jerking and persistent hot breath splayed over his cheeks he opened his eyes and flailed with his hands the dogs backed off they were thin but their eyes were bright with excitement their hackles up the teeth menaced him he rolled from his side on to his buttocks and they retreated further all the time snarling at him one bolder than the others darted towards his left ankle and caught the skin below the hem of the overalls but he lashed out and the heavy sandal hit its jaw hard enough for it to lose courage then the oldest of the dogs fangs yellowed fur greying threw back its head and howled in the night he had seen the dull lights of the village he had staggered to within a hundred yards of the nearest building then collapsed he had lain down on the dirt and stones beside a fence of cut thornbushes had heard voices and known that he did not have the strength to go the last hundred yards from the fence to the nearest building and he had slept the sleep had killed the pain that eked from each muscle in his body if it had not been for the dogs pulling at him caleb would have slept on through the dawn until the sun was high he could see a dozen lowbuilt homes of mud bricks flatroofed beyond a maze of small fenced fields the dogs watched him wary of him and the warning howl had not been answered the doors stayed shut to the side of the communitys homes separated from them was a compound walled with stones and bricks new he thought and above the walls bright flags of white and red and green fluttered from poles and caleb knew that it was a recently constructed cemetery a shrine to men buried as martyrs if he were to find his family caleb needed food water and clothes and he needed help he pushed himself up but his knees gave under him and he sprawled back on the ground the second time he tried he was able to stand his legs were in agony and his arms shoulders and chest he had no choice but to approach the village he bent and picked up a stone hurled it at the oldest dog the pack leader his decision was made he must approach the village in all the life he knew two years and then twenty months decisions had never come hard to him he was too weak to skirt the village to put off the crisis moment of contact he had to trust and hope he knew that his arrival would cause panic at camp xray and camp delta the interrogators had told him that the power of a qaeda was broken for ever in afghanistan and he had believed them and that the leaders of his family were in flight it had been the story they told to encourage him to confess involvement and contacts but he was just a taxidriver fawzi alateh and he knew nothing to return to his family he must go to the village and hope for help the dogs trailed him halfway to the village staggering unable to walk with a steady stride he saw a womans face at the window of the nearest house she ducked away and the nearer he went to the house the greater the cacophony of barking a door opened a man half dressed roused from sleep was framed in the doorway a rifle raised to his shoulder calebs life at that moment hung by a thread he knew that in some villages the arabs of the brigade had been detested seen as arrogant foreigners now he might be shot or he might be bound and sold back to the americans he straightened his back and smiled he spoke in the language he had learned the language he had used in camp xray and camp delta that of fawzi alateh he greeted the man who aimed the rifle at him peace be on you the response was suspicious and grudging on you be peace caleb knew the weapon he could have stripped it blindfolded in daylight or darkness and reassembled it the safety catch was off the finger was on the trigger not the guard he stood his ground and held out his arms scratched and scraped from the times beyond counting that he had fallen he showed he had no weapon the rifle barrel lowered then dropped he ducked his head a pose of humility but he showed no fear like the dogs the man would associate fear with deceit quietly caleb asked for hospitality shelter and help without taking his eyes off caleb the man shouted instructions to the older child caleb understood him the child led and caleb followed the man behind him the store shed was of brick with mud daubed over it the child opened a heavy door then ran caleb went inside he saw goats and their fodder longhandled spades and the door was slammed shut behind him darkness closed round him and he heard the fastening of the door there were no windows outside the man would now be squatted with his rifle watching the door while the child went to bring the village elders he sat on a carpet of hay and the goats nuzzled against him they might kill him and bury his body in the villages rubbish tip or sell him or they might help him he slept later caleb was woken by the sound of the door scraping open he staggered out into the brilliance of the sunshine and sat crosslegged on the ground in front of a horseshoe of the village men the oldest men were in the centre he told his story they might hate the arabs of al qaeda they might have fought alongside them he spoke the truth as he knew it his voice was soft gentle and without hesitation their faces were impassive as he spoke a helicopter flew high overhead his presence endangered the village the village would have wealth beyond the dreams of any of the tribesmen if they sold him on from the moment he held out his right arm and showed them the plastic bracelet with his photograph on it and the name of fawzi alateh and the reference usafdp he knew he was believed he was tall for an arab but had swarthy coloured skin and in his time in their country he had learned their language well they listened were spellbound but it was not until the end of his story when he ducked his head to show he acknowledged that his life lay in their hands that he knew he would not be shot or sold the oldest village man came to him lifted him then walked him to the cemetery a year before fighters had been killed a days walk from the village caught on foot and in the open by helicopters the younger men of the village with mules had brought their bodies here they were buried with honour the fighters were shuhadaa martyrs in the name of god their bodies lay in the cemetery their spirits were in paradise that afternoon a messenger left the village with the name of abu khaleb carried in his mind along with the name of the chechen to travel into the mountains to the encampment of a warlord that evening a kid was killed gutted and skinned and a fire was lit caleb was fed and given juice to drink that night his orange overalls were thrown on to the dying fire and they burned bright he wore the clothes of a young man from the village that week he was the protected guest of the village while the elders waited for instructions on how the journey to return caleb to his family could be achieved and he did not know how long that journey would be or where it would take him or to what fate but he knew that he would make that journey chapter two calebs body and face were flooded by the light the men around him scattered the week in the village had passed quickly he had rested then he had worked at his strength and gone into the hills above the village to exercise his leg muscles and expand his lungs he had eaten well and had known that the villagers used precious supplies of meat rice and flour to feed him when he had left the village armed men had accompanied him he was never out of their sight the code of these people he knew was pukhtunzvali and it had two principles the obligation to show hospitality to a stranger without hope of a return favour was malmastiya the duty to fight to the death to protect the life of a stranger who had taken refuge among them was nanawati twice in that week formations of helicopters had flown high above them once in the distance he had seen a moving dustcloud and thought it would be a fighting patrol of the enemys personnel carriers the tribesmen had stayed closer to him they would fight to the death to save his life because he was their welcomed guest an old man blind sitting astride a donkey led by a boy had come to the village in the afternoon of the seventh day with the answer to the message on that last night in the village they had feasted again used more of their precious stores no music and no dancing but two of the older men had told stories of the fighting against the russians and he had offered his of the fighting against the americans the fires flames had lit them and the old man the blind traveller had recited a poem of combat that had been listened to in silence he had realized at the end of the last evening the fire dying that all eyes had been on him and he had seen in the shadows the furtive movements of the women and knew that they too watched him he had been given a robe of pure white and he had stood and lifted it over his head over his shoulders and had let it fall so that it enveloped him he had not known his own value to the family but the village men recognized it and the women and they stared at him as he stood in the robe while the fires last flames showed their awe of him each of the village men came to him hugged him kissed his cheeks he was the chosen one the next morning the old man had taken caleb a halfdays walk from the village at a point where a path into a mountain pass climbed away he had held calebs hand in a skeletons grip tears had run from his dead eyes and he had left him he had sat for an hour on a rock then watched the little column of men and mules emerge from the pass a few words spoken a few sour gestures and he had gone on with them for nine days he had been with them as they led him with great caution away from the village and to the west they hugged the foothills but had also gone higher where the night air was frosted from the beginning he had known what cargo they guarded in the bulging sacks strapped to the mules backs he could smell the opium seeds they were villainous men he had seen no charity in their faces they carried curved knives at their waists with which they could have mutilated him from the moment of their reluctant greeting caleb had doubted that they acknowledged the code of pukhtunwali they shared food grudgingly they did not talk to him or show any interest in his identity if he had fallen back he did not think they would have waited for him he had never complained had never lost the pace of the march had never feared them but on the eighth day he had seen the slightest softening an extra morsel of dried meat beyond his own ration had been tossed at him during the evening halt and a watercarrier just filled in a mountain torrent had been passed to him later an extra blanket had been thrown in his direction as he had lain between rocks trying to shelter from a fall of sleet he sensed that last night he had won their respect when the grey light under the sleets clouds dipped he saw that the four of them watched him as the villagers had as if something set him apart he did not know by whom he was set apart or for what reason that ninth morning he had sensed the tension among them in the afternoon they had gone more slowly and one of the four had been a quarter of a mile ahead the furthest distance at which his shrill allclear whistle could be heard that evening they had cocked the rifles in readiness and had told with new nervousness of the dangers ahead as they came close to iranian territory with the greatest suspicion they had approached the frontier where the rendezvous was to be made to which they had been paid to bring him where there were frequent and heavily armed border patrols they had been in a gully going slowly so that the mules hoofs would be quieter when the light had snapped on and caught them caleb raised his hands the beam reflected off the white robe now stained with sweat mud and the blood from scratches on his arms a voice called to him from behind the beams source first in pashto then in arabic he was given the instruction to come forward caleb could not see beyond the light he walked and kept his arms high behind him he heard the retreat of the men and the mules the voice had authority the command beat off the gully walls around him in front of him he should hold out his right arm so that his wrist should be seen the light licked at the plastic bracelet and at the photograph and caught the print of the taxidrivers name he was pulled forward and ordered to lie down he lay on the stones in the track there was a final command in a language he did not know at the edge of his vision he sensed the lights beam move on rove further away then the machinegun started the tracers spewed over him bursts of six seven shots then a moments pause then more firing there were two answering rounds the detonation of one grenade from a launcher and silence the machinegun replied the men who had escorted him for the last nine days were trapped between the walls of the gully caleb wriggled his body so that he might make a pretence of burrowing down into the stones and dirt of the path boots came past him a brisk march of power and he heard the final execution shots that would have finished the men and put the mules beyond further pain the boots came back behind him a fist clamped into the back of the robe and he was hauled to his feet his right arm was snatched and he felt fingers on the plastic bracelet you are welcome there was no care in the voice not as a reproach but as a matter of fact caleb said they treated me with respect with courtesy they shared their food with me they brought me now he saw the man who welcomed him an officer in neat uniform with a polished belt attached to the belt was a holster he smelt the cordite the officer was dapper in build and on his upper lip was a trimmed moustache by the markings on his shoulder flaps caleb thought him at least a major perhaps a colonel the officer led him past the troops to two lorries and a mercedes car with smoked windows a driver snapped out of the mercedes and ran round the back to open the rear door the officer flicked his finger for caleb to follow him the mercedes pulled away bumping on a dry track in low gear they left the gully and headed into flat lands beyond a packet of cigarettes was offered but caleb declined the officer lit a cigarette then kept the lighters flame burning his delicate fingers lifted calebs wrist and he examined the plastic bracelet who is fawzi alateh he was a taxidriver he is dead you took his name i did you were brought with his name to the american camp at guantanamo yes the interrogators at guantanamo did not break your story that you were a taxidriver they did not that is remarkable his laughter fluttered across calebs face so i consider two possibilities you defeated the best of the interrogators at guantanamo you were released to spy i hang spies i am a good friend of those who defeat americans what i immediately like about you you do not ask questions without invitation i invite you why were they killed the voice hardened they were not killed because they were traffickers in narcotics criminals they died because they were witnesses it is a mark of the importance with which you are regarded that they were condemned i do not know who you are why you are so valued they saw your face so did the villagers where i stayed for a week the cigarette was ground out the officer put back his head and his breath relaxed caleb thought that within minutes he would be asleep he thought of the village and the trust of its men anonymously the name of the village would be passed by this officer to american agents and bombers would circle over it and death would rain down from the high skies because there they had seen his face he thought of the blind old man and he prayed to his god that the old man who had been unable to see his face would live where are we going the officer murmured you are going where you will be of use if you are not a spy i am a fighter the mercedes took him far into iran and the night was nearly spent when they reached a highwalled villa where heavy gates of steel sheet opened to take him inside he was a bloodstained step closer to his family night lay on the faraway desert the moon was up pitted with stars patterns and the quiet was total two camels one ridden by a bedouin moved on the desert sand going fast and away from the escarpment and the caves mouth a message had been brought and a reply sent far at the back of the cave by candlelight because the generator was switched off at night to conserve fuel a man worked at the interior of a new samsonite suitcase described on its sales tag as an executive traveller that had been purchased seven weeks before at the open market of the bir obeid district of sana capital city of yemen at the frontier roadblocks the soldiers had laughed raucously when they had found a shiny new suitcase being taken home by a vagrant tribesman from the desert and had let him pass and head away into the rub al khali the man working on the suitcase positioning the circuitboard behind the cases lining ignored the quiet conversations around him he had the knowledge gained from a university degree in electronic engineering in prague his eyes ached in the dim interior he knew nothing of where the suitcase would be taken when his work was finished but he had been told by the emir general who coughed near to him because his chest was inflamed that the man who would carry the suitcase had begun his journey to reach them he had also been told that the hazards of that journey which still lay in front of that man were huge but time was short all in the cave knew it they were hunted they were in retreat time ran like sand through their fingers hello im told youre dr bartholomew is that right he was standing at the edge of the room more of a voyeur at the party than a participator he had not noticed her approach he seldom joined the spirit of a party preferring to remain at the edge listening to conversations but not contributing to them his glass was close to his hand but set down on a set of bookshelves he had slopped the saudi champagne when his arm had been jogged leaving a stained ring on the wood he cared as little about the ring as he cared for saudi champagne it was always served early at riyadhs expatriate parties a mix of apple juice american dry ginger and fresh mint leaves cucumber slices floated with the ice cubes he could have gone to a party such as this one every night of the week if he had chosen to could have mingled with the familiar crowd of aerospace workers oil men medical people and their wives and the nurses who were there for decoration the talk around him was the usual numbingly tedious crap the rental price of compound villas the quality of the local workforce the heat the cost of imported food he hadnt noticed her coming dr samuel bartholomew or bart to the many who know me and the very few who love me he realized she had trapped him against the wall he had been a free agent at the party now he was confronted a hifi system played loud music as if the combination of its beat and the alcoholfree champagne would stimulate the guests into believing they were enjoying themselves she was different from the nurses and wives she blocked any escape and her posture with her feet a little apart almost intimidated him and it was an interruption as he always did at the parties he had been listening hard for little morsels of information he sucked in trifles of indiscretion was a carrier of tales and confidences and his hidden existence was the sole pleasure he took from life it gave him power he was fortyseven years old he had been christened samuel algernon laker bartholomew his father had taken two weeks holiday a year one for the guildford cricket festival one for the annual oval test match and his third given name came from the cricketer who had done something to the australians in the year of his birth as a schoolboy with pudgy jowls and a slack stomach he had detested organized sports his maxim then and now was not to run if he could walk not to walk if he could ride others at the party would jog on the pavements round the compound walls in the early morning before the heat became intolerable or would work out in an airconditioned gymnasium his late father had believed that cricket gave a man a code of decent disciplines for life he would have turned in his grave if he had known his son traduced the trust given him im bethany jenkins pleased to meet you miss jenkins bart always used oldworld manners it was the start of his third year as a general practitioner in the kingdom he acted as a link man between patients with real or imagined symptoms and the expensive foreign consultants at the king fahd medical city or the king faisal specialist hospital and research centre or the king khalid eye hospital he passed them on and received a cut of the fees smoothed the way and was rewarded he was losing the drift of a conversation to his right two men from a british companys aerospace software division in earnest talk about the failure of inflight radar in the tornado strike aircraft sold to the air force he tried to refocus on the conversation but her hand was held out he shook it limply but she held his hand too tightly for him to ignore her ive booked an appointment with your secretary for a couple of days time im up from the south going on to bahrain tomorrow a bit of shopping then im coming to see you before i go back down ill look forward to it miss jenkins there didnt look to be much wrong with her she was different from the other women in the room she was tanned hard her legs and ankles arms and wrists her face below the cropped blonde hair weatherbeaten from winds and sun late twenties he thought but an obvious outdoors life had aged her skin the other women in the room fled from exposure to the sun anointed themselves with protective creams when they had to go out wore headscarves and carried parasols and she was different also in her clothing the other women wore cocktail dresses but she was in a blouse that was clean but not ironed and a shapeless denim skirt that hung on her hips she was stocky but he thought that there was no flab under the blouse and skirt only muscle other women wore gold chains pendants and bracelets bought in the souk but she had no jewellery mind if i say something dr bartholomew bart please feel free hed lost the conversation on inflight radar failure he smiled sweetly please say what you want to miss jenkins ok bart she looked directly at him one of those wretched people who had no disguise he detested honesty she reached out and picked up his glass took a handkerchief from her skirt pocket and wiped the base then rubbed hard at the ring on the bookshelf his grin was as limp as his handshake he disliked women who fixed him in the headlights of their eyes he was the rabbit he shuffled the tornado people had split and moved on he was fearful of women particularly those who seemed to strip him down leave him naked it was a long time so long since he had been close to a woman then there had been tears his and arguments hers and the overwhelming sense of private failure he did not know where ann was now where she lived with the children and the shield he used to safeguard himself from that failure was that he did not care you dont look like a man who enjoys being a guest of the kingdom it was an extraordinary remark she knew nothing nothing of his past and nothing of his present he frowned then downed the contents of his glass and slapped it back on to the bookshelf it is miss jenkins im called beth it is miss jenkins almost a privilege to be a humble part of this fulcrum of the sophistication and technological excellence of saudi arabia actually i hate the bloody place and all who sail in her yourself of course excepted her eyebrows arched she laughed richly as if at last he interested her she followed with a flood of questions when had he come here why had he come what were his hobbies where did he live how long was he staying his answers were staccato he deflected her with responses that were rude in their brevity but she seemed not to recognize it he was frightened of close questioning in the expatriate community he avoided the endless discussions about family work conditions terms of service anything that might expose the lie with which he lived you dont want to mind me bart where i live down south i dont get too many chances to talk to people its like one of those monasteries with a vow of silence she touched his hand was smiling then rescue came of sorts he hadnt seen wroughton arrive hadnt seen him among the guests wroughtons fingers pulled at his sleeve his head gesturing towards the door no apology at the interruption but edward eddie to his female friends wroughton never apologized wouldnt have bloody known how to bart blundered away from the young woman followed wroughton into the hall and down towards the kitchen wroughton leaned against the wall then his finger poked in a tattoo on barts chest you cut our last meeting bart i was busy you dont cut meetings with me just pressure of work i waited two hours wasted two hours and i hadnt anything to give you then just pedal a bit bloody harder sorry about that eddie mr wroughton to you got me it wont happen again mr wroughton bart whined listen to me i dont want to be fucked about here its not pleasant believe me but i have you by your shrivelled little balls and i will squeeze and i will twist and what i just heard theres problems on the inflight radar of the tornado aircraft theyve got which squadron dont know jesus youre a useless piece of shit have you been listening youre going to have to do better or ill be squeezing and twisting wroughton was gone bart stood in the corridor and gasped little spurts of breath bubbled on his lips he mopped the sweat from his forehead when he had composed himself when his breathing was regular he went back down the corridor the noise from the room bayed at him his host barked in his ear not got a glass bart more champagne or are you going to hang around for a bit and have something better a nod and a wink bart smiled weakly he was looking for the hostess a guest a woman in a bright floral dress tried to intercept him and he started to hear her query on the best preventive tablets for diarrhoea but he slipped her his card pointed to his surgery number and moved on he saw bethany miss jenkins her hand easily on her hip talking to oil people the hostess said not going yet bart surely not its just warming up he said he had a callout embellished the excuse with a casual mention of septicaemia and thanked her for a wonderful party quite lovely bart drove the mile back to his own compound and his own threebedroomed villa which cost him the riyal equivalent of twentytwo thousand pounds in annual rental and which he could comfortably afford in the daytime he used a chauffeured car but at night a short journey through light traffic he drove himself the security men at the gate recognized his mitsubishi fourwheel drive waved to him and let him through two more parties were blaring out over the compound lawns he let himself inside the darkened villa nothing of his life adorned his home no pictures no photographs no ornaments no mementoes from his past even the cat the sole centre of affection in barts life mutual love couldnt help him escape from the place he hated wroughton left he knew he had the whispered reputation of a sexual goat but he would not have made a pass at the nurse with the ghastly accent falkirk or east kilbride his conquests were with wives mature enough to maintain discretion the reputation was never proven he headed for his bachelor apartment in the diplomatic quarter as the station chief attached to the embassy eddie wroughton was allocated an armourplated land rover discovery with bulletproof windows but the plates inside the bodywork and the reinforced glass beside him through which he looked on to the deserted road would only have been noticed by an expert he despised men like samuel bartholomew one of the hardships of his life as a senior officer of the secret intelligence service was the requirement to deal with firstdegree scum but against the hardships there were purple moments when he gloried in his work saudi arabia was a class posting interesting intellectually challenging and above all a steppingstone to greater things he always left an expatriate party before the alcohol was served he left before the champagne was exhausted before the home brew was offered or the brown tea was poured usually ostentatiously from a china teapot most often jack daniels but sometimes johnnie walker and always taken neat it would have been bad for his career probably terminal if a party he was attending where alcohol was available was raided by the mutawwa the zealots of the committee for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice he always went home early if he needed to drink the bottles were in the sideboard of his apartments living room premises protected by diplomatic immunity and in the safe of his embassy office few knew him only the wives he bedded the most valued of the agents he handled and his one friend in the kingdoms capital could have passed a serious judgement on eddie wroughton he appeared a caricature of an englishman abroad and he played to that superficial image day and night at work at the ambassadors dinner table as a guest of the princes of the ruling family or on a field trip out of the city he wore a creamcoloured linen suit that was always pressed and creaseless a brilliant white shirt a knotted silk tie and burnished brown brogues he wore dark glasses indoors or out in the heat of the sun or the cool of an evening few knew the strength of those eyes and would have recognized in them traits of character they were bright ruthless glinting mocking they were cruel he was a clever man and knew it in his apartments kitchen in the microwave he heated himself a curry for one then washed his hands with regard to samuel bartholomew he had two distinct certainties he dominated him and at some moment in the future the domination would pay off bigtime the microwave bleeped he knew the doctors history had read it in the confidential file sent to him when the wretch had arrived in riyadh he served his meal and took it on a tray to his favoured chair he thought the man pitiful knew what he had done in palestine thought him beneath contempt but potentially so very useful one day al mazan village near jenin occupied west bank it was only the end of the first week and already he had played his part bart stamped out of the wooden hut and jumped down from the doorway on to the thick gravel that made a path across a sea of mud he turned held up his medical bag and waved it angrily at the man now leaning against the door jamb it had been his first meeting with the shin beth officer his handler you know what ill tell you what you dishonour the human race your behaviour is simply beyond the pale bart shouted his handler lit a cigarette threw the dead match down on to the mud and gazed back at him with indifference and ill tell you something else and wipe that smile off your arrogant little face you are a fucking disgrace to your nation he rather liked the handler hed expected a man manipulative and brusque but hed found instead a sensitive frail young fellow perhaps fifteen years younger than himself would he like coffee how was he settling into the village were the signs good was he trusted could anything be done to help him the handler joseph worked and slept cooked and ate in the hut close to the checkpoint of course joseph wore military uniform with the same insignia flashes as the troops controlling the checkpoint im going to report you for gross obstruction as a uk national engaged on humanitarian work funded by my government i can raise a storm i hope that storm lands on your disgusting little head stopping a doctor of medicine going about his work shames your uniform you see if i dont make waves in the hut over coffee bart had been shown photographs of local leaders of islamic jihad and hamas he had pored over the map of the village and its satellite communities he had a good retentive memory josephs briefing on the local security situation had been excellent calm detailed and lacking in political rhetoric joseph was professional hed had pictures in a threadbarecovered album of the aftermath of suicide attacks on haifa buses jerusalems market and tel avivs cafes but bart had already been shown similar albums in tel aviv and in jerusalem where this stage of his journey had begun and from the start of that journey he had never had the chance to refuse to step off the treadmill as he walked away crunching over the gravel the rain spattered on him and the mud seeping through the stones caked his shoes dont forget my name its sam bartholomew you bastard bart shouted over his shoulder but youll wish youd never heard it by the time im through with you the soldiers had finished searching his car he heard the door slam by the time he reached it the rain had soaked what hair he had left ran down his face and dampened his clothes a corporal scowling held open the car door for him but bart shouldered him aside as if he refused to accept any belated courtesy from a member of the israeli defence forces standing in the rain perhaps forty palestinians were held up at the checkpoint it had taken bart twentyfive minutes apparently to be processed at the roadblock but it would take the palestinians half a day to go through if they were lucky and half a day to be turned back if they werent their faces men women and children had been sullen when he had emerged from the hut but they had heard his abuse and those who understood it translated for those who did not as he climbed into his car decorated with red crescents the palestinian equivalent symbol to a red cross on the side doors and on the roof there was a ripple of applause and he saw little rays of pleasure break on their faces it was as intended he drove away his head slumped his eyeline was barely above the rim of the dashboard he was trapped he could tell himself hed had no option if his father had learned to where his son had sunk he would have strangled him but his father was dead he drove on towards jenin where he would go to the clinic make friends and collect what few of the basic medicines were available he cut his father out of his mind and the need for medicines so that he could better remember the map he had been shown and the photographs of wanted men joseph had told him that he must beware of selfdoubt that he should not hate himself that above all he should not entertain the luxury of conscience if joseph had only known samuel bartholomews conscience was long gone they reached the quayside at sadich the map shown to him told caleb they were on the southern extremity of the iranian coastline the dark seascape in front of him was the gulf of oman he felt a raw drifting excitement because he was about to take a further step in his journey the officer spoke in arabic you are my friend an enigma to me i cannot think of the last time that a man surprised me you have achieved what i would have believed an impossibility a confusion in my mind i call you my friend because i do not know your given name or the name of your father i am given tasks by my government that are of the greatest sensitivity and trust is placed in me for the reason that i have a reputation for delving into the secrets of mens minds but after eleven days in your company i have failed you are not a taxidriver and i consider also that abu khaleb is only a temporary flag of convenience before i pass you on who are you it was certainly not a town barely a village they had left the mercedes and the driver in the car park beside the building for the cooperative that boxed fish and put ice into the boxes before the lorries came at the quayside there were trading dhows fishingboats and a little flotilla of a halfdozen launches with large twin outboards all poorly lit by the high lights the wind came in hard and sang in the rigging stays of the dhows and rocked the launches at their moorings caleb gazed at the sea did not respond to the officers question as he had not for the past eleven days and nights some of those days had passed fast some slowly some of the nights he had slept for others there had been no end he had been questioned by the colonel inside the locked shuttered villa but for most of the hours between meals he had watched iranian television and had used the weights and the rowing machine offered him he had alternately rested and built his strength he imagined that messages had gone ahead that answers had been received but he did not know where the messages had been sent or from where they had been returned what he had learned in those long days and longer nights was that his importance and value to his family were confirmed further as they had been during the time he had waited in the village in faraway afghanistan the seas blow whipped his long robe and the importance gave him pride not that he would boast of it do i need to know your true identity no but i like to have the loose threads tied there is your accent the arabic i speak is from iraq i learned the arabic of iraq from prisoners of their army captured in the fighting on the faw peninsula but i do not know egyptian arabic or yemeni syrian or saudi i tried tricks on you you remember the morning i woke you with a shout an order in english but you did not respond at lunch two days ago without warning i spoke to you in the german language five days ago when we walked in the garden it was russian you are a man of great talent my friend because you did not betray yourself you have no name you have no origin think that is your value he looked out beyond the breakwater of heaped boulders beyond the navigation light raised on rusted stanchions and he saw the whipped white crests of the incoming waves he felt the chill of the wind at the villa behind the walls and the steelplated gate the robe had been taken from him and laundered now the wind plastered it against the outline of his torso and legs and you have no history perhaps because you are ashamed of it perhaps because it is irrelevant to you perhaps because you are in denial of it you appear in landi khotal on the pakistan side of the common border with afghanistan some four years ago a little less and there is nothing before that only darkness you frustrate me you are recruited trained placed with the brigade captured and by deception i promise you i admire the deception are freed word is passed that you have escaped the americans and instructions are given at the highest level that you should be moved on your worth is weighed in gold it is not my business i know i only carry out instructions given me in great confidence but you are a man of value i do not know who you are or what your history is or what it is hoped you will achieve i tell you in great honesty my friend when you are gone i will wake in the nights and that ignorance will be like a stone in my shoe on the quaysides rough concrete men were working in the faint light to repair nets and others were climbing down the quayside ladders to the launches he heard the deepthroat roar of the outboards starting up they cross the gulf to the omani shore they go empty and come back with cartons of american cigarettes we permit the trade it is useful to have a route out of and into the country that is not observed you have to go my friend time calls may i say something more i am certain of you if i had doubted you i would have hanged you i do not understand your motivation your commitment but i believe in its steel strength you will strike a great blow against a common enemy i do not know when or where but i am satisfied that i will have played a humble and insignificant part in your strike and i will listen to the radio and watch the television and when it happens i will be happy to have played a part may god go with you the officer put his arm on calebs and they walked together towards the launches the war goes badly there have been setbacks have regard to the power of the enemy and its machines only the hardest man can succeed you look at the men who will carry you across the gulf and they will have seen your face have no worry they will return with cigarettes they will be taken by the customs police and they will go to gaols in the north they cannot betray you he stood above the ladder five of the launches were already edging out into the harbour behind the breakwater the last was held against the ladder you have seen my face and i have seen yours my friend already i have forgotten you even if i wake in the night and i have no fear of your betrayal you will never again be captured you will taste sweet freedom or sweeter death god watch you caleb went down the ladder he felt the night close round him and the cold what the hell man i was asleep what time is it marty blinked at the ceiling light the duty officer who manned nighttime communications in the agencys corral stood over him the time is about ten minutes after the best and the brightest have finished a good lunch in the senior staff diner at langley an excellent time they believe to fuck with the lives of lowrank footsoldiers local time if you need it is ten after midnight read this marty and inwardly digest seems clear enough even for a pretend pilot marty worked the sleep from his eyes reached out and took the offered sheet and read he read it again the duty officer was raking round the little room with its low ceiling and hardboard walls he read it a third time like he hoped it would go away but it didnt shit whos seen it george well hes the one whos going to have the headache i felt he should be first george khoo the chineseborn mission technical officer was responsible for keeping first lady and carnival girl maintained and operationally ready down the corridor through the thin door and the thin walls of the rooms marty heard a door slam then boots hammering away and he heard a shout of protest at the disturbance george wouldnt have cared not now hed been given langleys orders so what did george say thats a real nice picture that is pretty cool nothing id care to repeat there was a framed photograph of his parents outside their cabin in the hills up north from santa barbara but the duty officer was staring in fascination at a big picture in a goldrimmed frame martys pride and joy hed seen it on the internet offered by a firm in london and it had arrived at bagram six weeks back the legend under it was the last stand of the th regiment at gundamuck it showed fourteen brit soldiers clustered in a little circle rifles raised and bayonets fixed a couple of them had sabres drawn and plenty more brits were spread round the group dead or wounded and the tribesmen were coming up the hill towards them it didnt seem that the brits had a single round left between them behind the tribesmen were snowcovered mountains it was by william barnes wollen born died that is a really cool picture marty grunted and pulled himself off the bed it was the first picture hed ever owned and it had cost him seventyfive dollars for the print ninety dollars for the frame and for shipment but it had survived the transportation in front of the men who were going to die and knew it an officer stood sword in one hand a revolver in the other straightbacked like all brits were supposed to be and he wore a suede coat with fur lining under the coat the golddecorated flag of his regiment was wrapped round him and worth defending the officer lieutenant souter had been spared because the afghans thought him too important he had the flag to castrate and kill so hed been ransomed marty had done research on the internet but he didnt tell the duty officer has lizzyjo been woken up thought id give that pleasure to you the duty officer left him marty swigged water from his bottle and spat it into the sink then unhitched his robe from the door hook he knocked on lizzyjos door heard her went in she sat up in her bed and didnt seem bothered that her pyjama top was open marty said were being moved were pulling out in the morning heading to saudi arabia dont know for how long george god and i wouldnt like to be near him has gone off to get the birds in the coffins the plane to lift us is being readied she heard him out then told him to switch off the ceiling light and turned to the wall he went out only lizzyjo could go back to sleep in the face of such crazy intrusion into the routine of their work it would have taken an earthquake to frazzle her as the night ended the flotilla broke formation five of the launches veered to the south his carried straight on the parting was at speed and the farewell shouts the other crews to his were drowned in the engine noise and the hull beating on the swell of the waves he watched until the wakes of the five were gone then subsided again into the corner of the low cabin where hed wedged himself he had been sick twice and his shoulders were bruised where hed been tossed against the forward bulkhead of the cabin and its side wall the crew were two kids in jeans and windcheaters with long hair he wouldnt have talked to them if they had wanted it but they didnt he was as much a piece of cargo as the cigarette cartons they would bring back he assumed they had been paid generously by the intelligence officer for transporting him and had no suspicion that when they returned to the harbour on the southern shore of iran they would be arrested then left to rot in prison cells above the engine he heard the shout the one at the wheel had his hands cupped at his mouth then pointed he saw the excitement on the kids spraysoaked face he peered through the cabins porthole he saw the great hulk a tiny bow wave parted as the aircraftcarrier edged towards the launch it was grey against a grey sea and a grey sky he saw its massive power the other kid passed him binoculars and he steadied himself elbows on the ledge below the porthole focused and looked the image danced before his eyes he saw sailors on the decks walking as if they were in a park like in jalalabad or by the zoo in kabul he saw the aircraft stacked at the edge of the deck some with their wings folded back the kid at the wheel jerked them away from a closing course and he dropped back into his corner they would have thought walking on the aircraftcarriers deck that their power was invincible he held his head in his hands crossing the gulf wearing the white linen robe that had been given him caleb sensed the complexity of the plan to move him closer to his family he had come to the village pathetic in his weakness and now out on the sea and speeding towards a distant landfall he understood the great effort made to return him to the family it lay as a burden on him which only he could carry chapter three the launch knifed into the surf of the shore and surged as if on a collision course with the beach the final quarter of the sun balanced on the ridges of distant hills caleb watched the approach from the cabins porthole all through the journey across the gulf the kids had not spoken to him and they had not fed him his only contact with them had been when a canvas bucket filled with seawater had been dumped at the entrance to the cabin he had realized its purpose and rinsed out the vomit from his robe then had used his hands to clean the cabin floor much of the time they had watched him but when he had looked up from his place against the bulkhead they had turned away their eyes as if they understood that unarmed alone he had carried danger to them as the sun fell below the hills caleb failed to see any movement on the shore three or four miles to the right when they had been further out at sea he had seen what he thought was a fishing village but as they came closer it had disappeared abruptly the kid at the wheel swung it caleb was thrown across the floor his shoulder thudded into the far wall and spray drenched him through the cabins open door on his hands and knees he crawled to a hard chair that was screwed down and held tightly to it then the kid who was at the controls throttled down the two outboards allowing the waves to carry the rocking launch nearer to the beach the kid at the wheel jerked his head gesturing for caleb to come out of the cabin he could barely stand and he used the chair then the edge of a table and the doorway to support himself he could see the beach where the surf broke and he heard the little ripples of sound as the sea ran on sand and shingle then fell back fast they had him by the shoulders and arms and propelled him towards the launchs side not only was he no sailor he had never swum he did not resist they had had time to learn every contour of his face they could have described the shape of his nose the cut of his jaw the colour of his eyes he could have told them the fate of four men who trafficked opium who also had seen his face they lifted him up his stomach scraping on the launchs side he told them nothing had they stopped pulled back his head by the hair at the last moment and looked into his face in the dying light they would have seen the harshness of his features but they did not caleb was pitched over the side he saw the twin grinning faces and then he went under the shock of the water forced air from his lungs he went down into blackness he was scrambling with his feet kicking and the salt water was in his mouth his nostrils and the pressure on his chest was leaden his feet flailed into the sea bed when he broke the surface gasping and coughing the launch was already under full power arrowing away from the beach the limit of his memory was the few days in landi khotal and the wedding party before that there was nothing the same blackness as when he had gone under the water and after that there were memories of afghanistan and more memories of the camps at guantanamo bay nothing in that cutshort memory told caleb how to swim he was a man who could fight with skill with resolve a man who could trek and endure the confines of a prison cage constructed to destroy a prisoners soul but he had never swum he lashed at the water the thrashes of his legs and arms and the power of the waves pushed him towards the beach he felt no guilt that he had not told them of their fate his mind was as cold as his body in the water his feet hit the bottom his sandals had stayed on he stood at his full height and the waves broke against his back he waded towards the shore when he was clear of the water caleb sank down on his haunches then rolled on to his back and little pebbles pressed into his spine above him a low shaft of moonlight came off the water and covered him his life as he knew it had begun at a wedding party on the outskirts of the town of landi khotal and before that there was the same darkness as when he had gone down into the water off the launch he had no wish to clear the darkness because older memories threatened him on his back looking up at the stars he saw the man with the eyepatch and the chrome claw always watching him he had felt then that the one eye was never off him the party had drifted on and food had been eaten and when the evening had come the man with the eyepatch and the claw had sat beside him lit by hurricane lamps in which moths danced he had seen the scars spreading out from under the eyepatch and up the wrist to which the claw was strapped it had been the start of the journey of calebs life a light flashed in the trees winked at him his sandals slithered in the sand he went towards it for a whole minute the flashes guided him but when he reached the debris left by the tides highest point the light was killed he blundered forward in darkness and wove between treetrunks thorns caught at his robe his clothes were sodden and the cold of the coming night swaddled him caleb was not ashamed of fear since the wedding he had been afraid many times the chechen had said that fear was unimportant that the control of fear was the talent of a fighter if he was to return to his family he must take every step on trust he trudged through the trees he pulled the robe clear when it snagged caleb had control of the fear because the camps at guantanamo had hardened him he was a survivor he passed a palm trees trunk his arm was grabbed and the light fell on the plastic bracelet on his right wrist then his arm was loosed the fear was gone in the low light the farmers approached the corpse with caution they had walked up from the track among the rocks because they had smelt the stench of the body the track ran from the yemeni town of marib across the border and on northeast to the saudi town of sharurah they had left their donkeys and sheep by the track where a bulletscarred car had burned out they came to the corpse the head had been cut from the neck and the hands from the wrists flies crawled over the torso and already some of the flesh had been torn away by foxes holding his shirt tail over his nose one went close enough to the body to reach out and check the pockets but they were empty and when he pulled up a sleeve there was no watch the farmers circled the corpse and threw stones on it until they had made a cairn to cover the body then they ran leaving the smell and the stones behind them is that right we let some out just five only five it was about pressure image so whats the big deal it was five guys why does that matter across the desk the supervisor glowered at him to jed he looked drawn stressed in the neon striplight washing over his face it highlighted the strain at his mouth and the sacs below the eyes if jed hadnt gone down with the headcold he would have returned to guantanamo a week earlier by the time he had gone back with brigitte and arnie junior to the apartment near the pentagon the headcold had been streaming out of his nose hed had a raw throat and a hacking cough hed delayed his return to gitmo he held the list of names in his hand the days that jed dietrich in his time with the defense intelligence agency had called in sick could have been counted on the fingers of one hand it had hurt him a conscientious man to be back late off leave and the winnowing guilt fuelled his show of temper it matters edgar because two of them are on my work list the hell it matters and as i said pressure and image played their part those factors may not figure at your level jed but they do at mine coming across my desk is pressure to improve the image of this godforsaken place so we let a few out and the pressure eases the image improves now it may be the end of the day but i still have a shitload of work to do the supervisor grinned cagily and i imagine jed youll want to look after that cold of yours get your loot up so you dont lose any more time here it was dismissal his supervisor had fifteen years on jed and three grades of superiority perhaps because the headcold had tired him perhaps because the connection out of san juan had been late perhaps because victories at camp delta were in short supply jed persisted shouldnt have happened not names on my list they shouldnt have been released not without consultation did they just come out of a hat for gods sake look at that the supervisor waved at his piled intray i have work to do did you authorize the releases was it your decision to a few colleagues jed dietrich was dedicated to most colleagues he was a plodder he liked things done right he had nearly almost cleared two of the names on the list but nearly and almost were not good enough for him a frown clung to his brow he knew the way it would have worked out in his absence the bureau and the agency had authority dia was down the ladder bottom rung jed said the blind one i dont have a difficulty with him but this guy fawzi alateh he was unfinished business what are you trying to say the supervisor menaced him im just saying that its not professional its crazy to clear a guy edgar when interrogation hasnt run the full road youre on a roll this morning the supervisors smile was grim its not crazy it was an order i thought about him did you well let me say it when im up for vacation i wont be thinking about any of them about anything to do with this place he was just a taxidriver lighten up forget about him all you need to remember is that hes gone this is your new roster the supervisor handed jed the printout of his interrogation duties for the coming week jed held it in one hand in the other was a list of the five names of men released when hed been away from gitmo the first week of his vacation the names and patterns of the questioning had drilled in his mind by the time hed reached the cabin in wisconsin overlooking the lake theyd been scrubbed out but on seeing the name on the list the itch and irritation had returned he must have been scowling damnit jed didnt you get any fish up there he stood up and went out into the evening air the maghrib prayers were being broadcast over loudspeakers beyond the wire fences flooded by the arc lamps light he heard the murmured response of six hundred men a droning cry like the swarm of bees he passed the interrogation block his workplace where ceiling lights blazed and came to the prefabricated wood building that was his workhome he hated the place because here even little victories were hard to come by in front of him was the concrete building not of prefabricated wood where the agency and the bureau were installed they took the cream of the prisoners they weeded out the best from which bigger victories might be squeezed they were the kings of gitmo in his cubicle barely wide enough to take a single outstretched boat rod long enough for a single float rod for bank angling jed studied the roster for his weeks interrogations there were names he didnt know which would have been passed down to him because other interrogators had finished their gitmo posting there was a rhythm and routine at camp delta that added merely to a sum result of failure he swore later he would sign himself out at the compound gate take the shuttle bus to the ferry and go across the bay to the main marine corps base from his sparsely furnished room he would phone brigitte and hed tell her everything was dandy fine but first he had work his fingers hammered on the computer console the message was to defense intelligence agency at the bagram airfield in afghanistan could a check be run on fawzi alateh ref no usafdp could a report be sent back on the return of fawzi alateh to his community had he been quizzed on the reasons for the request jed could not have responded with any coherence might have been merely pique that he had not been consulted might have been a feeling far down in his gut it would be a month if he was lucky before bagram replied he sent the signal the marine eyed him as if he was an intruder and not welcome eddie wroughton smiled back left his opinion like flatulence hanging in the air that the marine corporals hostility was of no concern the messenger from the front desk of the embassy left him at the gate the suite of offices used by the central intelligence agency was high in the building the outer walls had been strengthened the windows were shatterproof and the inner doors were steelplated the marine watched over the grille gate into the suite wroughton gave his name and flashed his passport before the marine could telephone for instructions juan gonsalves had bustled from an inner room the gate was opened wroughton was admitted his name went into the ledger they embraced gonsalves led wroughton through an openplan work area the territory of the juniors and secretaries eyes followed wroughton echoing the hostility of the marine corporal precious few of the embassys own american staff seldom even the ambassador and no other nonnationals were permitted access to this inner sanctum where riyadhs heat and dust could not penetrate the airconditioners purred what wroughton knew juan gonsalves didnt give a shit eddie wroughton was the only foreigner allowed into the heartland of agency territory they went past a desk and a junior bent forward awkwardly to hide his papers a secretary flipped the button to blank her screen they walked on wroughton wore his linen suit and ironed white shirt his tie knotted over the button gonsalves had faded jeans low on his ample hips and his shirt tail had worked out of the belt they were opposites but they had mutual trust because they fed off each other and they shared a common enemy it was however an unequal feast eddie wroughtons greatest problem in his riyadh posting was bringing sufficient food to the table too often and it nagged him all he had was a fistful of crumbs he was led into a side office the room was a mess wroughton knew there had been an inspection team out from langley three months before and he presumed that his friend had made an effort to shift chaotic heaps of files off the floor the table and chairs to have the coffeecups and wine glasses washed and laid to rest in the cupboard to clear away the fastfood packaging to put a cover sheet over the updated most wanted photographs to keep the safe locked but it was now twelve weeks since the team had gone home and standards had slipped again his own office in the british embassy was presided over by an assistant who was prim and elderly with her hair netted tight in a bun above the nape of her neck she kept the room pristine as if she feared provoking his criticism wroughton stepped carefully between the files removed a box of papers from a chair selected the least dirty coffee mug held it up and gazed into the crowded depth of the open safe above him when he sat down the faces of the most wanted stared down malevolently some with a chinagraph cross daubed across their cheeks with the date of their capture or death the majority were still unmarked a plate with a halfmoon of pizza abandoned on it lay beside gonsalves steaming kettle coffee was made and an old biscuit tin passed to him dominating the most wanted photographs was the image of the first fugitive a long face topped by a white cloth that hid the hairline bright sparkling eyes a prominent nose a range of uneven but white teeth a moustache that came wispily past a laughing mouth to merge into a straggling beard of which the centre was greying and the extremes were dark around the throat was a buttonedup brown overshirt above the first fugitives head had been written in a juvenile hand the death of the martyr for the unification of all the people to the cause of god and his word is the happiest best easiest and most virtuous of deaths medieval scholar wroughton was thinking of the men who had climbed on to the passenger aircraft less than three years before and was wondering if theyd known those words gonsalves slumped in his chair tilted it heaved his feet on to the table scattering papers and slopped his coffee ok eddie can i shoot fire gonsalves languidly gestured to the most wanted and the first fugitive sipped his coffee then shot they are screwed in trouble hunted they have problems they are in disarray they are looking over their shoulders not capable right now of the big hit they are hurt but but they are intact juan but they are intact bulls eye eddie right in the inner circle so in retreat a commander looks to find a new defence line somewhere he can hunker down and and regroup juan afghanistan is finished for him pakistan is hot and difficult for him iran is iiran is quietly cooperative useful as a transit and shorttime hideaway iran is not a place for a longterm base camp chechnya forget it somalia and sudan are past history for him the games moved on were hearing talk from elsewhere what do you know eddie about the empty quarter eddie wroughton could have said that what he knew about the empty quarter was that it was empty could have said that it wasnt a part of saudi arabia to which juan should take his teresa and the tribe of children for weekend camping could have said anything facetious but didnt when he fed from his friends table he cut the smartarse quips ive flown over it of course i used to have that major in the border guard youll remember him but hes posted up north now i know precious little about it it isnt siglnt and not eiint and its most certainly not humint its just rumour i did some reading anyway except for some mountain in the himalayas right on the peak the empty quarter seems to be as remote as you can get its a huge area like the name says but i have confirmation there have been no satphone links out of there or radio and there wouldnt be unless theyre suicidal and all i have to go on is a rumour of couriers passing through northern yemen and heading up to the border and people coming back three days ago it got kind of interesting a story from gonsalves was like water spilled on linoleum it meandered but it kept going it did not sink quickly into sand without the morsels of agency information wroughtons own work would have been harder and his future darker we dont have people in north yemen not on the ground but we have the yemeni military weve trained three days ago our liaison officer in sana was brought a cardboard box like it was a present the sort of size box youd put groceries in there were guys standing around and giggling and he was invited to open it up there was a head severed and two hands all sawn off with a knife and there was some squidgy sort of shit i mean it a guy had approached a roadblock had seen the military had jumped out and left his vehicle then run for cover in the rocks they did well the military but not quite well enough before they shot him he was seen to swallow something ok ok hes dead so what they did eddie was they disembowelled him they got into his upper intestine down the bottom of his throat and they got out a scrap of chewed paper what youd use for homemade cigarettes then they took off the head and the hands you understand for identification i think our liaison guys putting in for counselling maybe for a transfer i mean it they slit his stomach and got out his tubes then cut into them christ we got some allies what was left of the paper went back as an image to the laboratory at langley but we cant break into whatever writing there was all we end up with is a courier carrying a message so tiny it might not have been found so important it was worth swallowing and dying to protect it and we dont have identification and theres no databank in yemen that could match the fingerprints off the hands the other thing earlier the roadblock military had seen a small camel train waiting down the track nearer to the frontier we trained those boys well theyre bright and keen as soon as theyd filled the cardboard box they skipped back up the road to where the camels had been and two bedouin the sound of shooting carries a long way across those hills and the sand no camels no bedouin what do you think id say thats promising maybe interesting what were doing eddie this is between you and me this is between friends or itll be my head in the next cardboard box is were going to put some toys down in the empty quarter were big kids toys you could say that anything you hear top of my agenda your toys whats going to be their status with the locals fifteen of the hijackers came out of here theyre bankrolled from here the families of the twin towers are serving writs here for punitive damages then theres the war the angst i wouldnt trust any last one of the bastards they get to know the sum total of damn all id appreciate your help what were saying is the indications are that the empty quarter might just be a good place to regroup eddie wroughton was escorted out and the marine corporal slammed the gate after him he remembered his one flight over a desolate heatbaked wilderness his step was jaunty god he fed well off the agencys table the swollen fingers where the flesh bulged over gold rings took his hand dont look into my face caleb said dont remember me the mans head dropped as if he took a point of focus for his eyes on the dirt and gravel at the centre of the intersection of the two tracks but his slugthick fingertips moved over calebs hand and on to his wrist clumsily they unravelled the cloth then the wrist was pulled gently forward and the head twisted to look down at the bracelet in a soft voice the man recited fawzi alatehs name and the reference number given at camp delta calebs wrist was let go the man walked with a waddling stride back to his car and bent to retrieve something from the safe box under the passenger seat he was a parcel and was passed on a van with smoked windows had met him at the omani shoreline and driven him inland he had sat in the back at the side away from the field of vision of the drivers mirror he had been left at a roadside near to a town ad dari on the far side of a mountain range traffic had sped past him until a japanese fourwheel drive had ploughed on to the roads dirt shoulder scattering dust over him through the open window his wrist bracelet had been examined he had been driven away again in the back seat and taken beyond the wadi rafash he had been dropped off at a crosspoint where trees in leaf threw down a sweet pool of shadow he had waited there an hour or more and then the audi had come and the grossly overweight man had levered himself out and come to him the plastic bracelet from camp delta was his identification as important as the passcode numbers used by the guards when he had been brought from the cell blocks to the interrogation compound the mans robes flapped loose in a light wind he carried back a small but heavy silken pouch whose neck was held tight by a woven thong he had forgotten himself and had stared momentarily at caleb then remembered and ducked his head he gave the pouch to caleb caleb squatted down his robe dry from the sun starched from the salt water was tight between his thighs and made a basin in which to empty the pouchs contents gold coins cascaded on to his robe they shimmered in the light caleb counted out a fortune in money then carefully replaced each coin in the pouch and put it into the inner pocket of his robe the man looked away studiously up the empty roads his voice was soft like spoken music i do not know your name stranger or what is your business or where you go you are a person held in extreme value by your friends may god go with you wherever he takes you as a hawaldar i have no eyes and no memory you do not seem to me to be from oman you are too tall and too heavily built and i do not think you come from the gulf deal in transactions of cash ten dollars or a million dollars i do not require your name because j do not need your signature haiual is the name of the trade in our tongue in oman and the gulf it is a word that means trust there is no trail of paper i say you have received the money and those who are your friends will believe me the trust is absolute rather than betray you i would go to my grave rather than betray those who have sent you the money i would cut out my tongue he looked down into calebs face the sincerity was there and loyalty he seemed to drink in the features of calebs face to gorge himself he crouched beside caleb i tell you my young stranger that the intelligence agencies of the americans and the british hate detest loathe the system of hawal money transfers are made coded signals and they cannot suck up the messages into their computers and so identify me you and your friends they blaspheme in frustration the links are secret and you should have no fear caleb leaned forward and kissed the mans cheeks he saw the admiration in the mans eyes and was confused may god go with you may your destination be paradise the poet hasan abdullah alqurashi wrote glory in life is complete for the one who dies for a principle for an ideal for a grain of sand i have admiration beyond bounds for your courage and for your willingness to sacrifice yourself i know you are of great importance were you not the effort to move you would not have been made it is my privilege to have helped you you are like the bright star in the night the brightest the man pushed himself up and went to his car the dust spewed behind him as he drove away at the crossroads where the tracks met where the shadows lengthened caleb sat his head bowed after the vehicle had disappeared the quiet was broken only by birds chatter with each step he had made since he had run from the road between the base and the prison he had sought only to return to his family but each man he had met who had moved him on had shown the same fascination awe of him why far away a dustcloud careered off the northern track and came closer was he already marked with death had the family chosen him for death the words were hammer beats in his head glory in life is complete for the one who dies for a principle for an ideal for a grain of sand the poets lilt had gone an old dustcoated pickup stopped then reversed and sped bumpily away he was taken north and sat close to a bleating lamb between two hobbled goats bart worked late the surgery was in a sideturning off the alimam abdul aziz ibn muhammad street the glassfaced block was easy to find halfway between the central hospital and the riyadh museum he reassured the german banker that his stomach pains came from ulcers in the lower gut not from bowel cancer prescribed the necessary remedies and showed the grateful man to the door the banker would pay his receptionist and the fee would be generous no expatriate was using his own money it was either from an insurance policy or from the company employing him the banker wrung his hand in thanks at the diagnosis then headed for the receptionist and ferreted in his pocket for either his cheque book or his wallet with the credit cards bart smiled balefully after him then closed the door he washed his hands at the sink then stared out of the window through the slat blinds at the evening traffic in the morning the reward for his diagnosis not a lifethreatening tumour but a simple ulcer would be electronically moved to a numbered nameless bank account in geneva then its trail would scatter via liechtenstein and gibraltar to the cayman islands it was his nestegg but where would he spend it he assumed that one day when wroughton had no more use for him he would be cast off and allowed to drift away but he did not know where he would eke out his last days then wherever he would be alone at the mercy of a conscience oh yes samuel algernon laker bartholomew had a newly developed conscience in the nights it gnawed at him he would wake sweating and in the days it stabbed him he dried his hands his buzzer went she was shown in by the malaysian nurse bart beamed good evening miss jenkins i hope you havent been waiting too long its beth remember no not too long how was the shopping in bahrain bought a couple of pairs of jeans some smalls some pasta a new pair of sand boots oh i read a bit swam a bit crashed out really it was just good to feel the sea her voice bart thought was money educated money and class money she was one of those young women he felt who had only certainties in her life for whom things happened because she wanted them to there was about her that same confidence he had seen at the party she was he recognized it a little breath of freshness in the daily routine that cocooned him in the sealed consulting room good glad it worked out he said vacantly well how can i help you im hoping you cant help me at all she was rocking on her feet staring back at him she might have been gently mocking him she wore the same skirt and the same blouse as she had at the party he wondered if she had stayed for the brown tea but doubted it she didnt look to bart to be the sort of expatriate who needed slugs of jack daniels or johnnie walker for survival in the kingdom bart said very few people come to see me merely to indulge in conversation she laughed sorry sorry ive been here just short of two years i ve never had a checkup i live down south and im the only woman there the quacks used to dealing with men falling off drilling platforms i just wanted to make sure i was all right before going back i hope i m not wasting your time very wise a checkup youre not wasting my time anything thats worrying you he was glad he hadnt to ask her to strip her directness frightened him he took her blood pressure he listened through the material of her blouse to her heartbeat women who caught his eyes and held them had always frightened him ann had and the senior partner in the practice at torquay and his mother her blood pressure was good and her heartbeat was fine he tapped her chest poked her a little with his finger and felt the solid wall of her stomach muscles nothing wrong with her reflexes the stomach muscles told him she was as strong as an ox and he saw that her biceps bulged against the cuffs of her shortsleeved blouse he went through his checklist menstrual problems she hadnt any pains in the kidneys none ten minutes later he stepped back from her nothing to worry about thanks it was just that i dont know when ill next be up here in civilization something about her disarmed his caution as it had at the party the examination finished the nurse had left them not that i wish to contradict you miss jenkins but we have differing ideas about civilization i would think you have to be fresh out of a cave to regard this place as civilized in my book the construction of glossy buildings wide roads and an extravagant spending power bordering on the obscene do not add up to civilization the culture here is of corruption its a society of skimmers fixers and intermediaries one bloody great family freeloading off the oil resource im here like every other expatriate to feed the greed she asked with that inbred directness so why do you stay bart blanched we dont all have options miss jenkins he stammered right any problems and you dont hesitate to call me oh if its not impertinent how did you hear of me i was down at the embassy logging in with the new people i was talking to one of the second secretaries and asking him about a doctor a checkup another chap wandered up to us must have heard what i was asking for he gave me your name oh i must thank him its always good to know the grapevine works who was he she paused seemed to trawl in her memory then smiled got it wroughton eddie wroughton thats who you should thank bart stiffened she had made him reckless he hardly knew her but she had weakened all the defences he arrayed round himself hes a parasite he feeds off people no im wrong hes worse than a parasite wroughton is as poisonous as a viper he caught himself have a good journey back down south later when his waiting room was empty and the nurse and receptionist had gone he looked through the papers she had filled in she was twentyseven years old her handwriting was like her personality b o l d he rather hoped he would never see her again her address was a post box co saudi aramco at shaybah he knew where shaybah was and that little morsel of knowledge comforted him he would not see her or hear of her again he rang for a taxi ft seemed to him that when hed touched her her chest muscles and organs hed touched danger and when hed looked at her into the sparkle of her eyes hed looked into the depths of danger before the sun had dipped far away to the west over the asir mountains the pilot had called marty and lizzyjo forward had parked them in a jumpseat and the copilots and had given them the birds eye view they had flown over the desert and the map devoid of recognizable features or the green of vegetation or any sign of habitation had been on lizzyjos knee the red sand lit by the falling sun had been scarred only by the dune formations and what the pilot called their slipfaces and hed talked about crescentic dunes star dunes fishhook dunes and linear dunes and had identified all the strange and naturally made shapes at twentyeight thousand feet below them and hed pointed out the sabkhas the saltcrusted playas of sand between the dunes hed told them his dry texan voice clear in their headphones that the rub al khali covered an area of close to a quarter million square miles and that trying to map the dune features was time wasted because they moved prodded and reshaped by the winds hed said that right now down there and under the suns blaze the current ground temperature was well over degrees fahrenheit three years back an fa hornet overflying the rub al khali had gone down out there in the middle of nowhere and a sandstorm had prevented helicopters with longrange tanks getting in the rescue party from the prince sultan airbase at al kharj on the northern fringe of the desert had finally reached the wreckage using hummer fourwheel drives and had been too late it was like the sun had burned him to death dehydrated him taken every last drop of juice out of him and he was a trained guy and the last day hed been alive it was reckoned the temperature had hit one hundred and forty degrees maam then the light had gone and theyd started a gradual descent you folks drive the predator the pilot was on manual but found time to talk he wanted conversation the uavs were in their coffins behind the bulkhead with the ground control station and the trailers on which the satellite dishes were housed perhaps he thought that a young man with distorting spectacles tousled hair and short trousers didnt look like any pilot that he a military man had ever known or perhaps he thought the young woman in her short skirt didnt seem like any sensor operator hed ever met what we do as with all agency business is rated as classified marty said just asking dont mean to put my nose where its not meant to be lizzyjo said hes the pilot for what weve got mqls i sit beside him and do the fancy stuff telling the truth there should be two of me but the guy whos supposed to be lizzyjo thats classified marty snapped she ignored him supposed to be alongside me is down at bagram with amoebic dysentery we have to make do the pilot was almost old enough to be martys father where have you flown son marty said that he had flown at nellis nevada for his training and out of bagram and he looked defiantly at the pilot at nellis there had been veteran pilots and at bagram from the usaf and theyd all been spare with words but had not hidden their contempt at his age and appearance flying for them was a killing game when the hellfires were on the pods under a predators wings for marty flying was as intellectual a task as working the machines in a kids arcade he scowled and waited for the sarcastic retort from the pilot about his inexperience he didnt get it perhaps yall know all this in which case youll say so feel the turbulence thats standard here we have big winds over the dunes forty knots or fifty what i heard predator doesnt like winds it can cope marty said cant even take off if crosswinds exceed fifteen knots lizzyjo said and its pretty difficult to get decent imagery on screen if its rough up high the winds are bad and then theres the heat over the sand when youre up we find theres a densityaltitude barrier its what the heat does even if there had been no sandstorm when we were trying to get that navy pilot at the downed hornet the helicopter people were not keen on flying what im saying is its difficult territory for aviation it takes understanding nothing moves nothing lives you could call it a death trap its one hell of an unfriendly place down there its the pilot broke off he was holding his stick tight the copilot came behind lizzyjo and told her to vacate the seat he replaced her strapped himself in and reached across to lock his hands over the pilots helping him hold the stick and fight a wind powerful enough to throw the big transporter off line the pilot didnt loosen his grip on the stick but gestured to his left with his head lizzyjo tugged at martys arm and pointed port side of the cockpit window the darkness below them was broken by a spasm of light the first light they had seen since the sun had dropped not a prick of light in the rub al khali until the brilliance that the aircraft now banked towards the light was like an inland sea and around it was a wall of blackness then nothing coming closer the lights broke their solid formation and marty recognized runway lights road lights compound and perimeter lights and buildings lights god marty said is that it thats it lizzyjo said thats our new home how long you sticking around for the pilot grimaced about a halfminute after your offloading is completed ill be powered up they went down the wind shook them the pilot was good and feathered them on to the runway they taxied but the pilot didnt cut the engines when hed braked far at the back they heard the metal scrape of the tail being opened the pilot sipped from his water bottle then smiled at them take my word this is hell on earth i hope what youre going to do is worth the effort marty said any mission we are sent on is worth the effort lizzyjo cut in we dont know what the mission is but i expect someone will tell us when its convenient for them they went back into the fuselage and gathered up their gear two bags for her one bag and his framed print for marty he was subdued everything the pilot had said about wind turbulence and heat played in his mind he was sort of nervous they walked down the tail and george khoo already had the maintenance team at work they carried their bags to the side and dropped them but marty held his picture under his arm the coffins were rolled down the tail on their trailers the pilot was as good as his word in a halfminute after the last of the gear had been offloaded the engines were revving to full power they walked towards the dirt at the end of the runway where within a halfhour george had started to supervise the erection of a tent camp they were off the track when without warning the pickup swerved to the left the lamb screamed and a goat fell into calebs stomach then kicked with hobbled hoofs to be clear of him ahead there was a single low building no village no huts no compound walls caleb crawled to the pickups tail and jumped on sidelights the pickup left the moons glow fell on the building there was a sliver of brightness at one window and another under the door caleb clenched his fist and hammered on the wooden planks he called out his old name the one the chechen had given him a bolt was drawn back scraped clear of its socket the door whined open caleb went in on an earth floor at the centre of the room a hurricane lamp threw out a dull light and the stink of kerosene beside it there were three plates with meat and rice on them and on one a halfeaten apple beyond the lamps light in shadow stood a pile of olive green wood packingcases but he could not read the writing stencilled on them there were crumpled blankets discarded cigarette packets boots caked in old dirt and from the deeper shadows a shaft of light fell on a rifle barrel aimed at his chest as he slowly and very carefully raised his arms the barrel tip of a weapon was pressed hard into the back of his neck then he heard breathing close to him and smelt the breath behind him away from the rifle there was a scurrying movement and then the lamp was lifted a man held a hand grenade the pin gone from it in one hand and the other held the lamp in arabic caleb said if you drop the grenade or throw it at me everyone in the room is killed me and you you should put the pin back he heard a little giggle of nervous laughter from the side where the rifle was the man put down the lamp then fumbled in a trouser pocket and replaced the hand grenades pin caleb saw the face of the man old tired and thin the weapon stayed against his neck but calebs right arm was wrenched down he felt the cloth strip taken from the plastic bracelet the light was lifted his arm was released and the weapon dropped from his neck each in his own way the three men gazed at him one slipped a pistol into the belt of his trousers one stacked the rifle against the wall the elder one grimaced and dropped the grenade into a coat pocket then they were eating but still they watched him not with awe or fascination not with wonderment their glances were of rank interest and they seemed to strip him bare to the skin it was as if each weighed his appearance against the value given him it was he understood the first contact with the outer layers of his family they gave caleb their names but spoke indistinctly because they were all eating as if food was scarce he thought the elder one who had had the hand grenade called himself hosni the one with the rifle was fahd the man who had held the pistol against his neck and who had examined his wrist said his name was tommy they wolfed the food until the plates were clear then wiped the plates and sucked their fingers for the last of the rice and sauce caleb sat at the side in the shadow leaning against the stacked crates and his stomach growled he could have given his own name or any name but did not caleb asked where do we go tommy cleared his throat and spat with venom at the floor fahd laughed shrilly as if in fear the elder hosni said without expression we will be in gods hands we are going into the sands chapter four he was shaken caleb had not slept well the coughing snoring and wheezing had prevented it fahd stood over him pulling at his shoulder it was still dark inside the room but the light outside pierced the window where the plywood cover did not fit at the moment he was woken caleb had been in a restless dream world that nudged him to the limit of his memory took him to the chasm but would not let him step over into the void hosni stretched and caleb heard his joints creak tommy sat on his blanket and without purpose ran his fingers through his cropped hair as if that were his waking ritual they went outside for prayers fahd took the line for them and sank to his knees the others followed the first low sunlight caught the tips of the wadis low boundary hills and far beyond them was the holy city makkah he had said in the first training camp near to jalalabad la ilaha ilia allah muhammadiin rasoola allah in old language from back before the memorys void he had known he said there is no true god but god and muhammad is the messenger of god he had said facing the shooting range and the obstacle course that he believed the holy quran to be the literal word of god revealed by him believed that the day of judgement was true and would come as god promised accepted islam as his religion would not worship anything or anyone except god he said the prayers taught him and watched the others beyond his dream where his memory did not go there was no god hosni prayed quietly as if it were a time to gather personal dignity fahd rocked forwards and backwards and his face contorted as if mans inability to match the demands of his god made an agony for him around caleb were the whispers mumbles and cries of devotion he thought fahd was the zealot and marked it in his mind there had been zealots in the trenches and they were dead there had been more zealots in the cages and they were driven to insanity did caleb believe the words he spoke soundlessly he could not have answered the prayers finished as the sun caught their faces he sat in the dirt against the mud wall and watched corridors of ants come to him crawl over his ankle and pass on he was told they would move in an hour was told transport would come the dream returned staring into the sunlight his eyes were closed the dream was clear the wedding a veranda of wood planks in front of a small villa with white rendering on the walls a garden with flowers driedgrass lawns with chairs and rugs scattered among shrub bushes sharp in his mind the bride was farooqs cousin the bridegroom was amins second cousin caleb was the outsider a feast a celebration welcomed because he was the friend of farooq and the friend of amin shown the hospitality that was true and warm a feeling of liberation because he had made a great journey but his memory no longer accepted where he had come from from what he had been freed he had been watched by a man sitting on a bench back from the veranda among the shrub bushes and who was dressed in a black turban a longtailed black shirt and loose black trousers guests came to the man and spoke quietly into his ear and all who came near him ducked their heads in respect but the mans one eye was fastened on caleb he was only aware of the attention focused on him there at the wedding party he did not know that that attention had lighted on him when the message had come from far away to the town of landi khotal that farooq and amin were bringing their friend to this distant corner of the northwest frontier of pakistan could not know that from the hour of his arrival he had been observed followed tracked and noted neither could he have known that the interest he created in the days leading up to the wedding was sufficient for a message to be sent across the border into afghanistan what was learned of him and relayed in the message had been enough for the man with the eyepatch and the chrome claw to have travelled to witness him at first hand at the celebration a hawks eye was on him and he was in ignorance of it once when the bridegroom carried a tray of glasses filled with apricot juice to the man the claw had hooked his elbow and pulled him lower a question had been asked the claw pointing at caleb and the bridegroom had answered it two iambs had been killed for the feast and a kid only the remnants turned on the spit over the fire of cut wood but the scent of the meat drifted in the smoke to calebs nose and the man watched him as the dusk came younger men drifted away and while caleb struggled to be understood by the relatives from the village of amin and farooq there were shots beyond the garden the man came towards him farooq whispered in calebs ear that the man was from chechnya a hero of the war with the russians but caleb knew nothing of any war the man was at his side and reached down the claw caught calebs arm and lifted him no smile no greeting no warmth farooq had tried to follow as if anxious about his friend but had been waved away the man from chechnya led him to the fence that marked the extremity of the cultivated garden four men were there with rifles they fired the targets were a lentils can at the base of a driedout thorn tree and further back one that had held cooking oil wedged between stones then far beyond a fuel drum some bullets shook the targets some caused little dust spurts near to them and the whine of ricochets the man and caleb could not speak had no common language but another came to calebs side and with a guttural accent translated the heros words and calebs answers do you shoot i have never tried and no one ever showed me it is a gift from god not taught a man who shoots is a man who respects himself do you have respect for yourself ive never done anything of value to get respect a man who shoots well is a man who can fight a fighter has supreme selfesteem he is valued by his friends trusted by comrades loved i wouldnt know you would not know because you were never given the chance to be valued trusted loved i was given such a chance to shoot to fight i learned it close to here against the soviets we ran they followed us we ran further and still they followed we hid among rocks they lost us we were quiet as mice they went past us they stopped we could shoot at their backs we killed all of them we killed all of them because we were fighters and born to it and then we were valued and trusted and loved does my story frighten you a great plunging breath i dont think so no it is precious to have selfesteem would you look for it the breath hissed from his lungs yes caleb was given a rifle he had never held a firearm the translator had slipped away he was shown the sign language of the claw how to hold it the four men had stood back only caleb and the chechen had been at the fence the whole hand had adjusted the sight he had fired the rifle stock had thudded against his shoulder the can had toppled his breathing had been steady the sights range had been changed caleb had seen the cookingoil tin dance in the slackening light his squeeze on the trigger bar had been constant the sight had been altered the fuel drum had rocked he had lowered the rifle and turned to receive praise on the chechens face he saw grim approval away beyond the gardens fence far above the targets a hillside was spotted with boulders cut with little ravines and at the summit was a precarious hanging rock the chechen had the rifle and pointed the barrel at it caleb had understood he had dropped off his suit jacket and loosened his tie he had torn the seat of his suit trousers on the barbed wire as he had gone over the fence he had run he wore shiny shoes polished for a wedding that slipped on the rock surfaces gave him no grip at first there had been shots above him he had hugged rocks had crawled into the clefts the firing had become less frequent his suit trousers had ripped at the knees his shirt was sweatsoaked dirtsmeared he had reached the top bright in the last of the sun exhilaration had swamped him he had stood on the hanging rock his arms outstretched in triumph and he had come down sliding stumbling and making little avalanches of stones the dream had been near to the waking moment when fahd had killed it since the scenes of the dream he had never again worn suit trousers a suit jacket a clean shirt with a tie polished shoes he was a chosen man at the fence when he reached it the chechens claw had gripped his shoulder and held him close and he had known that an outsider he was a man respected and wanted through that evening he had sat at the feet of the chechen farooq and amin had not come near him in the morning before dawn he had left with him he was the chechens man it had been the start he was called the dream was finished he was the member of a family and there had never been a family before he helped fahd lift the boxes from the back of the buildings one room they grunted under their weight and their bodies were close as they struggled with each through the door what do we call you caleb said that he had many names did a name matter what was the first name you were given caleb said that it had been the outsider but he had been told the name did not mean he was without trust then you are the outsider not from a grouping or a faith or a tribe but held in value if it had not been for that value we would not be here we call ourselves by the names of our enemies better to remember them the box was set down who is your enemy i am saudi fahd was the king when i was blessed by god and received into al qaeda his wealth was grotesque it was twenty thousand million dollars when he went on his holiday to europe he took three thousand servants with him he allowed the infidel soldiers into the kingdom the crusaders of america he is a hypocrite an idolator an apostate to permit the americans in the holy land of the two cities and hosni he is egyptian his enemy is hosni mubarak who follows the americans is their paid servant who tortures and hangs the true believers in the room hosni folded the blankets had washed the plates from the previous evenings meal had prepared a breakfast of bread and fruit and who is tommys enemy do you not know about iraq i know nothing about iraq since i was taken to guantanamo do you not know what happened in iraq fahds voice whistled in astonishment we were told nothing in guantanamo caleb said simply you did not know the name of tommy franks i have not heard that name let him tell you tommy did not help them but sat on his haunches in the sun cleaned the weapons and did not look at them there was sour concentration in his eyes they set down the last of the boxes are you here and hosni and tommy because of me caleb asked because of you we waited here for twelve days she had taken the early flight down from the king khalid international airport at riyadh claimed by the kingdom to be the most perfect in the world and had arrived at the oasis of steel and concrete before the heat had settled on the sands around it she had dumped her shopping in her tworoom bungalow changed and had kept running beth had been ten minutes late for her first class of the day a blackboard behind her workers from saudi yemen pakistan and the philippines in front of her she taught english language the majority of her pupils were older than her they were engineers chemists construction managers and surveyors and the english she taught them was not that of polite conversation but would enable them better to scan manuals and technical work the workers were the cream of the kingdoms oilproduction personnel the site where they brought up extralight crude from one hundred and twentyfive wells was called the most advanced in the world and was praised as the most ambitious they were good students determined to learn other than the three nurses in the medical centre beth was the only woman at shaybah standing before her class she wore a long plain dark dress that hid her ankles the shape of her body her wrists and her throat a scarf covered her hair if it had not been for the patronage of the provinces deputy governor she would not have been there but she had that patronage in riyadh jedda ad dammam or tabuk it would not have been acceptable for a lone woman to teach men or to drive a vehicle or to eat and use the library in the compounds club but the pioneering site at shaybah deep in the rub al khali desert was beyond the reach of the mutawwa the religious police of the committee for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice had no remit at shaybah and it was known throughout the compound that beth had the patronage of the deputy governor the job teaching english oilextraction language allowed her to pursue the love of her life the love was in the study of meteorite geology and far into the sand dunes from shaybah but reachable was the meteorite impact site at wabar considered by scholars to be the most remarkable on the earths surface the job and the patronage enabled beth to fulfil her passion apart from the nurses beth jenkins was an only woman among some seven hundred and fifty men the compound was two hundred and fifty land miles from the nearest habitation the living accommodation offices the club the highrise constructions of the gasoil separation plants the towers of piping and the airfield covered fortyfive hectares of desert production exceeded half a million barrels per day shaybah was the jewel in saudi aramcos crown the statistics were daunting million cubic metres of sand had been moved kilometres of pipeline carried the extralight crude to the refineries in the north cubic metres of concrete had been poured tonnes of fabricated steel had been shipped in to make kilometres of interconnecting pipes beth thought herself blessed to be there the men she taught came and went worked short spells away from their families took the shuttle flights out whenever they could griped about the harshness of the climate and the conditions beth did not complain she would have said that she wanted nothing more of life she would have claimed she could hack the heat and the isolation she would have refuted the mildest suggestion that she was isolated she would have been perplexed to know that she was described behind her back as brutally rude and aloof away from the classroom in her little bungalow where her clothes were strewn she kept her books and study papers on the wabar meteorite site all she cared for one day beth jenkins would write the definitive paper on the site where black glass and white stone had rained down with the explosive force of a primitive atomic detonation on to what science called an ejecta field she had the class reciting in unison as if they were the kids way back at an ascot convent school the phrases proven reserves api gravity gas compression plant wellhead stabilization and separation and she looked out of the window the haze was thickening the runway that linked shaybah to the world outside was indistinct and hard to focus on at the far end deep in the haze there was a small collection of tents and vehicles two satellite dishes mounted on trailers and wide canvas awnings she had not seen them when the flight had come in had been asleep till she was rocked awake by the landing momentarily she wondered why they were there at the extreme end of the runway by the perimeter fence then she began to set the work for her students to be done before she next met them they filed out another class came in no she was not alone and inadequate yes she was blessed the queue failed to move bart hissed moved his weight from foot to foot whistled his frustration through his teeth coughed but the queue did not shift he needed a new iqama it was renewal time for his residents permit he had with him the one that was about to expire his drivers licence a certificate from a colleague of a satisfactory eye and blood test the document confirming employment by his local sponsor at the hospital and a further fistful of bureaucratic crap in front of him beside and behind him corralled in a narrow corridor flanked by ornate rope was a collection of the foreigners who took the kingdoms shilling and were treated for their efforts with all the respect shown to a dog with mange god he loathed the place but there was no way round the queues no avoidance of them the key word was patience bart knew all the stories of expatriates who had filled in their forms and sent a minion down to the ministry to avoid the queue the bastards at the desks always found fault and sent them back the highly placed and lowranked had learned that the only way to get a residents permit renewed was to stand in the damn queue around him the need for patience would be muttered in a dozen tongues in arabic and german urdu and dutch bengali and english a few the more important had bodyguards who idled in the chairs away from the queue bodyguards were a barometer of the deterioration in the security situation in postwar times bart paid only lip service to security in daylight hours but would not have walked a street at night certainly not in the areas where the kingdoms new reality of economic depression had spawned beggars and the women who raided refuse bins for food scraps the servants of the kingdom bought with petrodollars shuffled and wheezed and watched the painfully slow progress towards the counters at the end of the queue there were four desks two were occupied by men in the traditional flowing white thobe on his head each wore a ghutrah held in place by rope the igaal that in former times when they were all in the sand and not in concrete and glass follies was used to hobble a camel now they rode not on a camels back but in chevrolets men worked at two desks the other two were empty why were the desks not taken when the queue stretched back to the bloody door bart boiled some of the expatriates occasionally wore a thobe and thought the gesture impressed their hosts did it hell the days when expatriates were the chosen elite of the kingdom were long gone there was even talk that income tax for expatriates might be introduced they were not wanted only tolerated and they were made to queue but that day god favoured samuel bartholomew doctor of medicine five hours in the queue patience rewarded and at the head of the queue just before the break for lunch he produced an oily smile presented his papers remarked in his passable arabic what a delightful day it was outside he was good at doing lies his life was a lie he had done lies well since childhood the son of algernon bartholomew accountant and hermione nee waltham bartholomew housewife he had told the lie often enough about a happy childhood in a loving home in a rural village near the surrey town of guildford and maintained the lie of contented boardingschool life at the school about as far away in the west country as they could afford to send him put him out of their sight and out of their minds he had learned the law of survival never explain never apologize never trust poor at games unloved and lonely to the point of tears he had comforted himself with lies it served him well as he walked back down the line the stamp on his renewed iqama a little smile spread on his mouth caleb saw it but could not hear it the argument was about the boxes he sat on one on the old olivegreen paintwork was the stencilled legend department of defense fima there was a date seventeen years back when he had been a child now blacked from his memory he knew the weapons loaded into the boxes had handled one briefly in the training camps had felt its weight on his shoulder and had seen one fired in the trenches but he did not know its workings and guidance system there were six boxes and they had created the dispute caleb sat with hosni and tommy and watched the argument between fahd and the farmer away to the right barely visible was a village with surrounding irrigated fields clumps of date palms and lines of bright washing further up the watercourse taking no part in the argument a man and a boy squatted beside the legs of six camels there were three more camels with fahd and the farmer and the price for them was contested six camels were sufficient just to carry a guide his son fahd tommy hosni and caleb with food and water to their destination but the six camels could not also carry the six boxes for that more camels were needed the farmer had more camels and a price for them fahd had to have the extra camels but bridled at the price the farmer was a thief and an extortioner each time he was insulted the farmer moved away and fahd had to chase after him they had been more than an hour sitting with the boxes in the full heat of the day caleb stared at the camels that were needed he said why is it him who negotiates hosni shrugged because we are close to saudi because he is saudi because he speaks the same language because that is his job but he fails hosni picked up pebbles threw them down each of us has a responsibility in this matter it is fahds why not you hosni sniggered as if the question were an idiots i am from cairo from a city i know nothing of camels as a child i played at the gezira club camels were for peasants i would not know a good camel from a bad camel a lame one from a whole one i do not take responsibility why not him caleb eyed tommy hosni snorted where he came from what he did he would only have seen a camel from behind the closed window of a mercedes saloon where will the guides and the camels take us into the sands and across them what are the sands the egyptian shuddered he was the eldest among them he had frail bony shoulders and there was no weight in his arms or at his stomach his check jacket which was torn at the elbows and frayed at the cuffs hung loose on him and his beard was sparse and untended caleb assumed the gezira club in cairo was for the rich and he thought the egyptian had made great sacrifices and had given up comfort in the name of a qaeda and that the sacrifice had weakened him you will find that answer and what is across the sands when hosni spoke the breath wheezed in him across the sands if we can go through them are the people who wait for us who have called for us especially they have waited and called for you thank you why do we not shoot the farmer and take his camels then all the village knows we have been here they make a blood feud against us they send for soldiers and police then we are dead and you do not reach those who wait for you caleb thought it a good answer he stood and stretched and the heat bathed him the weight of the pouch was in the inner pocket of his robe he walked away from hosni and tommy he went to the guide who sat as if uninterested and his hand ruffled the hair of the child and he said that the child was a fine boy a boy to be proud of and he asked if the camels were capable of the journey the guide nodded but did not speak caleb went back down the watercourse to the farmer fahd and the hobbled camels he led fahd a few paces away so that their voices would not be heard by the farmer and told him to go and sit by the boxes he looked into fahds eyes into their brightness and fury he gathered his strength took hold of fahds hand and pushed him away back towards the boxes they had not yet started out on the journey a journey that made hosni shudder and caleb knew he would travel with an unforgiving enemy fahd stumbled away from him caleb sat beside the hobbled hoofs of the camels and smelt them and he stroked the leg of one then he took the pouch from the inner pocket and on a flat rock he spilled out all of the gold coins that the hawaldar had given him on trust he told the farmer that he wished to buy the three camels and he asked the farmer to take what coins they were worth a fortune lay close to the farmers gnarled calloused hand sunlight danced on the coins trust counted trust showed friendship the hand hovered over the coins pecked at them lifting and dropping them trust the farmer took three coins then gazed up into the impassive face confronting him he took three more coins smuggled the gold into the pocket of his trousers then reached out his hand caleb took it in his life as far back as his memory took him it had never been hard for caleb to lead he retrieved the remaining coins from the flat stone and dropped the pouch back into his hidden pocket the farmer kissed him and started to remove the camels hobbles caleb waved for the guide to come to him an hour later with all the camels loaded they started out camp xray guantanamo bay he squirmed back into the recess of the cage each day others had been taken hours later as long as a day later some had come back shivering some had been pitched into the cage and had huddled with their heads bent on to their knees some had wept or cried for their mothers one had spat at the guards when they returned him had been dragged away again and rechained caleb had not seen him since he had waited his turn and the fear had built three men and a woman crowded into the cage they were huge in their uniforms and they towered above him the chains were for his ankles waist and wrists hostile faces reddened by the sun he seemed to read in all of them but most particularly the woman that they wanted him to fight he thought he had been in the cage for three weeks but on a few of the days as dusk had gathered and the arclights had brightened he had forgotten to scratch the little mark with his fingernail on the back concrete wall to mark the passing of that day the fear was bad worse than the shock of capture worse than the beatings or the disorientation the fear held him as the big hands and the womans reached forward seized and heaved him to his feet up to now they had only taken him out of his cage for the first processing and photographing for weekly exercise and showering but he had been exercised and showered the day before the fear caught in his stomach and he knew the little routine that he had learned was broken the chains were tight on his ankles and wrists and further chains were linked to the one that circled his waist then he was blindfolded they took him out he was a taxidriver the fear was in his mind and his body he was fawzi alateh the fear made his bladder burst the wife of fawzi alateh and the children his parents and hers had been killed by the bomber that made the trails in the sky the warm wetness ran down the inside of his legs and he heard the sneering laughter he was from a village in the hills above a town where he drove his taxi he was taken into a building the blindfold stayed on his feet were kicked apart he was pushed forward a blow in the small of his back and his fingers took his weight against a concrete wall and when his feet wriggled closer to the wall to relieve the weight the boots hacked at his ankles to drive them back his weight was between his toes and his fingers a screeching sound filled his ears he was a taxidriver the sound blasted into him penetrated his skull and his mind he was fawzi alateh he could not escape the noise and the pain grew in his fingers and toes the sound blistered him but again and again he repeated silent words that alone could save him he fought the wail of the noise he did not know for how many hours he stood against the wall then silence then a new voice drawled all right hand him over he tried to fall hut hands caught his overalls and he was propelled back up and he took the weight again on his toes and fingers and his bladder again burst give me your name the demand was in english he felt each grain of the concrete against his fingertips he bit his tongue i said give me your name arabic he closed his eyes behind the blindfold and bit harder on his tongue what is your name accented pashto as if from a classroom not spoken with the softness of the people he had known i am fawzi alateh what is your occupation taxidriver where are you from he named the village the town the province the pashto of the questions was poorly phrased as if the interrogator had learned the basic language on a brief intensive course a little of the fear was lost everything he had learned in the van he told he stumbled through his answers a pause he heard water poured into a glass then it was drunk the voice said the same drawled english you never know with these ragheads whether theyre lying through their teeth or whether theyre snivelling the truth give him another dance and ill call him back give him some more victim of circumstance or a killer how do i know god get me a beer a door closed the noise started again at least twice he fell and each time he was hoisted up and he could smell the breath and the sweat on the men who lifted him and threw him back against the wall the noise wailed around him and he coidd not shut it out a second time the questions were asked they were in pashto and he cherished the little victory slumped held up by their fists unable to swing his shackled legs he was taken back to his cage he had told his whole story he was fawzi alateh taxidriver he had been driving at night and alone when his combivan had been seized by armed men he had never seen those men before he had driven them at gunpoint if they had not been so tired or if they had known that part of the province they would have killed him and driven themselves the cage door was opened and he fell inside some had shivered some had huddled at the back of the cage some had wept and some had cried for a loved one caleb lay on the mattress and slept because for the first time he had lost a little of the fear and was able to sleep the whitepainted cessna twin engines circled once then levelled out for a slow approach marty watched it yaw in the headwind the same wind blowing in his hair threw up a screen of sand from the edges of the runway everything the pilot had told him on the transporter was seared in his memory though he didnt believe the air force flier would have realized how deeply hed drunk in the information crosswinds heat making a densityaltitude barrier and upper turbulence had all played in his mind overnight hed barely slept lizzyjo had she didnt take responsibility for keeping first lady and carnival girl up and operational lizzyjo was back in the ground control station would be checking out the camera and satellite systems after the journey behind him he could hear george khoo lecturing the ground crew under the slung tarpaulins as the wings were bolted back on the fuselages of his girls he watched the landing saw the cessna waver before it set down here at this oil dump he would have no wise head to feed off when he flew the girls at nellis or at bagram there had always been a veteran pilot to take into a corner and quiz about conditions that he had been awake in the night was the mark of his anxiety the cessna taxied he went to the door of the ground control station he rapped the door lizzyjo the head honchos down a man climbed awkwardly from the cessnas hatch he was big bloated and his shirttail flapped out of his trousers in the wind he was unshaven was mopping his forehead already in the few short yards he had walked across the tarmac and was clinging to a briefcase as if it held his life savings holding it against his chest he came towards the little ghetto of tents awnings and vehicles that george khoo had made in the night at the extreme end of the runway george worked the men hard and the noise had disturbed marty nearly as much as the worries about flying conditions you marty yup thats me sir the man looked at him quizzically it wasnt said but the man gave him the feeling that he had expected marty the pilot to be ten years older or fifteen not looking like a student just out of high school it was the way hed been looked at by the other agency guys and the air force men when hed first pitched down at bagram he was getting used to it but it still annoyed him im juan gonsalves god flyings a bitch we were tossed around like rats in a sack wish i could do your sort of flying what is my sort of flying sir just sat in a cabin airconditioned no airpockets and no turbulence hey im not suggestin you dont do the real thing look where can we talk where are there no ears i mean no ears theres people at ground control back in the tents theres people sleeping sir id say theres no ears right here sir marty waved expansively around him they were a hundred yards from the tents and the awning shelters where the wings of first lady and carnival girl were going on to the fuselages the sun was high at the top and his shadow was around his feet lizzyjo came out hopped down the steps he introduced her and gonsalves broke off from the mopping to shake her hand then took a map from his briefcase spread it out on the dirt and put small stones on the corners you been in this sort of heat before marty no sir were lookin at one hundred and twenty degrees christ do you know what pisses me off marty more than the heat no sir its being called sir call me juan i may not be prettier than you son but i am your superior funny thing is that great temple our mutual employer has given you a job that i cant do and me a job that you cant do so today that makes us about equal nice to meet you marty and how dya do lizzyjo what else you need to know about me is that the love of my life is teresa and our kids and the hate of my life is al qaeda id like to say i live and sleep teresa and the kids but i dont i live and sleep al qaeda each time we nail one of those arabs i get a hardon nothing personal you know its not that anything has happened to anyone i know but its the obsession that rules me what i say to anyone who raises an eyebrow thinks im a freakin lunatic is if we dont throttle that organization right now then well sure as shit end up on our backs with their boots on our throats thats what i say marty gaped at the intensity the sweat now ran on the mans face and he squinted as the sun came back up off the dirt and the map his thinning hair was plastered wet gonsalves pressed on i am a technophobe and an intelligence officer i do not own a power drill but i understand the cellsystem intricacies of al qaeda in my house teresa has to change the lightbulbs but i know the way the mind of a qaeda works and dont ever try to blind me with the science of your machines i dont care lets do the map marty saw that the nails were short but still had dirt under them and the first two fingers of the right hand were nicotinestained the hand splayed out and passed over the map of the southern quarter of saudi arabia what i predict and heres where im gonna stick my neck out is that this is the next big war zone forget afghanistan most particularly forget the stuff in iraq youre looking at the new ballpark it is the rub al khali which is the arabic for empty quarter it is what the bedouin simply know as the sands its bigger than you or i can comprehend amigo it is as hostile as anywhere on the good lords earth you see its where id crawl to if id taken a bad punch and was down and the count had started except im going to beat the count and i want the bell i need to hunker down in my corner and get my breath and focus id go to the rub al khati its where id be and im confident i know their minds believe me its where they are and i bet my shirt on it he grimaced i dont take everyone at langley along with me they still want paratroops and mountain forces and rangers tramping in the pakistan tribal lands and the afghan mountains but i say thats history what i say is theyre right here right now they are wounded hurt as dangerous as a maimed bear they are supplied by couriers they have no phones and no electronics and do you think i can call on the saudis for help hell no first off theyre suspicious of anyone telling them what to do second theyre not capable of doing it third man theyre so insecure i tell them nothing and they tell me nothing well i beat on the temples door often enough for the langley people to get freakin sick of me you know they want to shut me up get me nice and quiet so they sent you what are we looking for lizzyjo was subdued and staring at the expanse of the map now covered by a film of sand wish i knew marty said we have to know what were looking for its one mother of a playing field more map boxes than weve ever tried to cover we have to know age tiredness seemed to lodge on gonsalves face marty craned to hear him better he spoke as if he knew what he said was inadequate well not wheels not big groups in caravans not on roads because there arent any theres only one track that goes nowhere small groups maybe three or four guys and three or four camels out where nothing exists a pinhead in a dump truck of dirt maybe the camels are carrying gear maybe they arent people where they shouldnt be this is not a refuge for lowlife but for the leadership they must send and receive messages and retain control only a very valued few will be summoned to their hole in the ground people they need to see cant help any more than that lizzyjo said well give it our best shot he pushed himself up and shook the sand off the map then folded it and made a mess of that gave it to marty he told them what their cover would be and he said hed get down again as soon as was possible but meantime hed speak each day gonsalves started to walk back to the cessna his head down as if he knew hed failed to convince he stopped its good this equipment youve got he waved his arm airily at the birds under the awnings marty said we got the best if theyre out there then were gonna find them sir lizzyjo said our two first lady and carnival girl are the oldest uavs the agency has deployed theyre nearly ready for a museum this cries out for global hawk or for an rq weve got mq thats the way it is marty savaged her with his glance gonsalves didnt pause ripped at him with his hoarse voice but youve brought hellfire marty nodded yes weve brought hellfire then lets hope you get to use i t any last questions marty said softly what sort of guy do you think is gonna come to this shit hole the man they need the man that can hurt us most with gear gonsalves went to the cessna clinging to his briefcase they watched the plane take off and fly away low over the sands that were without end neither marty nor lizzyjo spoke there didnt seem anything sensible to say then she punched his arm and said shed go make some coffee the new idea of the director general the new broom was to expose senior officers at the london headquarters building of the security service to external opinions and to encourage more lateral thinking michael lovejoy sat in the auditoriums back row he always chose a back row when he had not volunteered behind his folded newspaper his study of the crossword interrupted he yawned but he listened as he scanned the clues the psychologist from a northeast english university gripped the lectern tightly what we have to understand a disturbing and unwelcome truth but nevertheless a truth is that terrorist leaders have a better understanding of profiling than the people charged with countering political violence on your side ladies and gentlemen you look for obvious and naive stereotyping not so with your opposition they in particular osama bin laden and his lieutenants have refined a skill in identifying young men of varying social backgrounds and economic advantage who are prepared to make supreme sacrifices for a cause they look for men who may be willing to die may want to die as a price for the attacks success but whether suicidal or not will drive home that attack we are fond of using the word brainwashed about our enemy it is inappropriate and erroneous they are patient and work by gradual progression to the stage where a man is prepared to crash an airliner into a public building plant a bomb in a crowded concourse carry a suitcase filled with explosives and lethal chemicals or microbes into the heart of a city they lead him towards that goal they do not hurry they set ever greater hurdles for him to climb and all the time he is wrapped in the familial culture isolated in training camps or in a wilderness of desolation he loses contact with any world other than that which is close to him the family becomes the only society he knows and he will develop intense pride in that association they are better at spotting the right man than you are there was a little sucking intake of breath in front of lovejoy he was an old hand with the service insults no longer disturbed him the psychologist had his interest and fifteen down the patrician of coriolanus eight letters went unanswered it was only the newspapers quick crossword you look upon the terrorist groups and al qaeda specifically as parasites that lure young men into their ranks you have the catchall word of loner i imagine you search through your special branch files looking for these loners friendless and inadequate boys who are impressionable drifters and therefore may easily be drawn towards commitment to terrorist outrages are your targets have you done well i dont think so al qaeda has stood a quantum leap in front of you loners may be satisfactory as footsoldiers good enough to wash the plates in afghanistan but quite inappropriate for the war that i guarantee stretches for years ahead of you look for a simple stereotype and please believe me you will fail the psychologist paused gazed balefully at his audience then sipped from the glass of water on the table beside the lectern lovejoy imagined irritated frowns settling on the foreheads of the younger generation who had taken forward seats the profiling of loners was taught as a creed in d branch he thought he rather liked the cut of the academic ive taken up most of your lunchhour and i know youre busy people but may i leave you with a final couple of thoughts a retired soldier recently wrote to me and his notepaper was headed along with his address a beaten path is for beaten men the stereotype of the loner is a beaten path and if you follow it you will be the beaten men and the beaten women i urge you to look elsewhere where for quality for ability for the best because it is those young men that the lieutenants of bin laden search for imagine also the excitement of being a part of that select fugitive family picture the personal selfesteem conjure up a sense of the adventure and purpose no no i promise you the young man who can damage us wound us to the quick revels in that excitement his true religion and in the adventure that life brings him thank you as quiet polite applause rippled in front of him lovejoy wrote menenius in fifteen down the watercourse was far behind them they had climbed and scrambled up a steeper slope and now on the summit the wind whipped them and their shadows splayed out beyond the sun sank fahd prayed he cried out as if for help and his eyes were closed as if the view ahead overwhelmed him the saudi was tall and gangling and he seemed to plead to his god as if god alone could save him beside him the guide knelt the boy at his side tommy made no pretence of worship but had his old army boots off and his socks and massaged his feet he moaned hosni did not pray but sat on a rock by the camels who shredded the feebly growing thornbushes caleb sat close to the egyptian and thought he had not heard such passion in prayer since the first days at xray and delta when despair was greatest he gazed in front of him how far do we go only the guide knows perhaps a thousand kilometres caleb said its late to ask it but why dont we drive where there are roads for a vehicle there are blocks and checks the military has blocks and checks they wait for us for you those who have called us in a place of death where there are no roads no eyes to watch for us it is a place of death but also a place of dreamers and fools are you a dreamer hosni said in a murmur i think i am a fool the guide collected together the camels and tommy hurriedly pulled on his socks and his boots they went down the hills reverse slope past a cairn of stones that was the border ahead of them limitless stretching towards dusks infinity was the desert that was made red gold by the sun caleb saw the empty quarter where his family waited for him chapter five rashid the guide was at the front and walked beside the lead camel the egyptian the saudi and the iraqi rode then came the baggage camels with the tents and the water and they were followed by the three camels that each carried two of the boxes at the back walking were caleb and the boy ghaffur it was the third day since they had entered the desert the sun beat down on him the heat pierced the ghutrah that wrapped his head and wound round his mouth and jaw it burned his exposed cheeks and nose and the reflected brightness devilled in his eyes and the boy talked in his ears was the soft singing of a light wind the muffled strike of the camels hoofs in the sand and the groaning murmurs of the saudi they left behind them a trail of broken sand indented with hoofmarks and footprints but even the gentle wind had the strength to shift loose sand into the little pits they had made when he looked back as far as he could see their trail was already covered lost the boy questioned him as thoroughly as had any of the interrogators at xray or delta ahead of them what he saw through squinted eyes was an endless sandscape to the horizon caleb set himself the target of each horizon a dune ridge that met a sky that was without a single cloud and when that horizon and ridge was reached another faced them the treble pitch of the questions was like a flys attention distracting but not irritating and he ignored it as he would have ignored a fly at his nose who was he where had he come from what was his purpose why did he travel they might have been the questions of interrogators then he had hung his head and had quietly repeated the life story of the taxidriver now he swatted the questions away with a smile or a grin that was hidden by his ghutrah they skirted the higher dunes where they could but some were so vast that they could not be avoided and then caleb and the boy helped to drag the stumbling sliding animals up the lee side where it was steepest and on the way down they would let the camels loose so that their angled legs danced awkward steps as they careered down on top of each dune driven by the winds were razor ridges that made slight avalanches when broken mostly caleb looked at his feet because then he did not see the horizon and had less sense of the pitiful slowness of their progress and the distance to the next dunes top it was only the beginning last evening they had stopped at a well and the camels had been allowed to drink their fill and he had heard the guide rashid tell the egyptian that this was the last well on their route that morning after prayers before the suns heat had gathered they had left the well which was merely a little box of mud bricks with a dead wood beam across it and a rope stretching down to a hanging bucket the water had been brackish stale foul he knew because he had sipped it then spat it out his own questions played in his mind and mirrored the boys who was he where did he come from what was his purpose why did he travel he could not have answered them they halted in the middle of the day not for food or to drink but to pray they had eaten and drunk before they had left the well and would not do so again until they stopped and pitched tents by walking at the back of the caravan with the boy caleb had distanced himself from his unchosen companions the last evening before they slept fahd had told him briefly with a sneer of the disaster to iraq the fall of the regime that american tanks had driven at leisure through the wide avenues of baghdad then tommys glance had settled on fahd and the story had been left unfinished in front of him astride the camels and perched on the humps they all suffered the saudi would yell out his pain and twice the egyptian had tumbled into the sand rashid had lifted him up without sympathy then thwacked the camels back to get it moving again he sensed constant in his mind the resentment they held for him because they had waited twelve days for his arrival they climbed scrambled descended and each in his own way would have prayed for another of the saltcrusted flats that made plateaux before the next line of dunes and the heat was unforgiving and it was only the start the questions had started again the piping voice demanded answers no caleb said you shall answer me what he saw the triumph on the boys face a response had been won how long do we travel mischief lit the boys face he grinned how fast can you go and the others i think we go slowly how many days the camels drank this morning how many days can the camels travel after they have drunk for eighteen days is eighteen days enough time how fast will you go what happens after eighteen days the camels die the boy ghaffur said and his eyes sparkled but we must have water how many days can we live without water two days then we die the boys smile wreathed his face has your father been on this route before i do not think so not with me he has not said it more questions bounced in calebs mind all had the same core how did the guide rashid know where he was going what markers did he use what pointers guided him they were unspoken they had barely started it was only the beginning on every camel goats stomach skins bulged with drinking water two days after that water was exhausted they would die of thirst and after eighteen days the camels would die caleb had not seen anything that told him men and beasts had gone this way before the sands were pure there were no tramped trails where hoofs or feet had been and he did not think there was any possibility however remote that a vehicle could have ploughed through the soft shifting sands of the dunes twice in that mornings march the guide had stopped and looked ahead had seemed to sniff at the air and his concentration had been total the first time he had veered towards the right a sharp angled turn and the second he had gone to the left a softer turn but the boy said his father had never been here before he realized it their lives depended on the instincts of the guide who strode ahead of them led them further into the sand wilderness caleb asked does anyone come here god is here he walked faster the straps of his sandals were making blisters on his heels he saw nothing that supported life only the dunes no track no bush or dead wood no trail if he had not been important then the challenge of crossing the wilderness would not have been given him but he did not know why he was important he walked faster but his legs were leaden and his mouth cried out for water the boy gambolled beside him mocked him he staggered the boy caught his arm but caleb angrily pushed him away and the horizon was blurred by the sweat in his eyes he seemed to see in his mind the bones of the dead who had exhausted their water and the bones were stripped white by the sand and the wind he blinked then wiped the sweat savagely from his eyes he had stared into a trap of selfpity as men had done at xray and delta he screamed and the sound of it soaked into the dunes walls and the cloudless sky he checked his list for the day three interrogations they would all be dross the bureau and the agency ruled in joint task force and the dia ran a poor third bottom of the heap in his cubicle jed had scanned his overnight emails nothing that couldnt wait then turned to the files of the three men the bureau and the agency worked the prisoners who stared at the ceiling and soundlessly repeated holy quran verses or fed out the disinformation snippets or gazed back at the questioner with silent contempt the bureau and the agency had the bigtime game of trying to break into the silence or the lies and that was good stimulating work the men given to the dia were the nohopers the unfortunates on the edge of nervous collapse in the morning he would see a kuwaiti who said he was an aid worker in jalalabad in the afternoon an afghan would be brought in who said his father had given offence to a tribal chief in paktia province and the chief had therefore denounced him in the early evening across the desk there would be a german passport holder from tunisia who claimed the pakistanis had handed him over when he was only an arabic language student it was pitiful by now any benefit of jed dietrichs vacation was eroded he wouldnt have told his father arnie senior but the work at guantanamo bored him a few times he felt compulsive anger towards his targets the men he faced but the armys interrogation manual was clear cut on the boundaries he must not cross he was permitted to use psychological ploys verbal trickery or other nonviolent and noncoercive ruses he was warned that the interrogator must have an exceptional degree of selfcontrol to avoid displays of genuine anger and absolutely forbidden was the use of force mental torture threats insults or exposure to unpleasant or inhumane treatment maybe if he had responded to that anger and kicked shit out of them life at guantanamo might not have been so dreary it would not happen he supposed that what kept him sane what kept a man buying a lottery ticket or what kept a guy out on a rainy day walking mud fields with a metal detector was that something one day might just turn up he started to read the case notes of the kuwaiti who claimed to have been doing charity work in jalalabad a clerk brought the signal to him he signed for it watched the clerk close the door and read it he hadnt really the time to ponder on it not if he were to get the kuwaiti done in the morning he read it a second time he bit at his lower lip and dug his fingernails into his palms but couldnt beat the frustration from lebed karen dia bagram to dietrich jed dia camp delta guantanamo bay subject fawzi alateh ref usafdp hope the suns shining and the swimmings good concerning the above individual no can help afghan national fawzi alateh did a runner exclaimer he escaped from usmc escort en route bagramkabul a mess double exclaimer subject should have been collected by afghan security yeahyeah but incoming flight was delayed and theyd gone home believe me subject pleaded nature call and was allowed out of transport but didnt drop his trousers just ran anyway ivhy the query wasnt subject cleared for release subjects home village is not accessible to us unless in battalion strength bandit country low priority means followup assessment is not possible ok ok so he wenr home early wishing you a happy day best lebed karen he winced ever since his supervisor had told him of the taxidrivers release the irritation had come to him in spasms it was not a tidy wrapup he could go back in his mind to the first day of the vacation up in the cabin by the lake when the faces across his desk had been clear clean images he had identified something enigmatic about that subject a tall young man softly spoken never shaken in his story all the others who pleaded innocence as the taxidriver had had tried to prove their nonassociation with al qaeda by naming men theyd met or men theyd heard of who were in the brigade or men theyd seen this one the taxidriver had never met an al qaeda member never heard of one had never seen one it was such a small point so trivial and by the second day on the wisconsin lake hed forgotten it it would not have resurrected in his mind if the bureau and the agency had not walked in big boots over his supervisor it had made a niggling suspicion he filed the signal he went to work he walked between the block where his office was and the block used for interrogation he could see the beach the wind came off it it should have been a place of beauty but it wasnt it was a place of fences and cages of howled misery and failure hed complained more than five months back to arnie senior about the numbing tedium of the interrogation sessions but arnie senior had done his draft time in the central highlands of vietnam where questioning was robust take em up in a chopper three of them get up to a thousand feet make two take a hike and then ask the third some questions never fails arnie seniors eyes had glazed over sort of manic and jed had never again talked about his work to his father the translator was from pittsburgh second generation american syrian stock and jed disliked him didnt trust him the translator lounged and pared his nails the chair opposite the desk was empty they waited for the kuwaiti to be brought in jed had talked three times to the taxidriver sitting in that same chair he had found him cooperative and wordperfect on his story each time hed done the oldest of tricks what they taught at the training of interrogators go back suddenly over a fact given an hour before but every time the taxidrivers story had matched and the trick hadnt caught him truthful and he wouldnt have admitted it not even to brigitte hed rather liked the young man and the story of the familys death from the bombers had kind of hit him he looked up the chained prisoner between the guards was shuffled into the room his thoughts of the taxidriver where he was and what ground he walked were shut from his mind he looked into the pleading face of the kuwaiti the birds soared she flew the peregrine the shahin he flew the saker falcon the hurr they were high specks in the sky beth and her host the deputy governor were out for a days sport with four vehicles and a retinue of drivers falconminders and servants to pitch an awning when they broke for the picnic there were bodyguards with rifles and a tracker from the murra tribe to bring them back to shaybah if the gps system failed she would have preferred just her and him one fourwheel drive and the two birds it could not be the deputy governor a prince of the kingdom required such a following as a symbol of his rank the birds high enough over them to make her arch her neck and struggle to follow their flight searched for prey had they been alone two persons in the wilderness of sand she would have experienced what she loved the solitude the quiet and the serenity the desert captivated her lawrence had written threequarters of a century before that this cruel land can cast a spell and she understood him she was captivated by the emptiness and the infinity of the horizons its imprint she knew would mark her mind for the rest of her days she watched for the diving stoop of the peregrine waited for it to spy out a bustard that would be condemned they were a dozen miles off the road running to the north alongside the pipeline the meteorite impact site of wabar was a hundred and twenty miles to the west the deputy governor would have been apoplectic had he known that she went alone to the ejecta field had found a route for her land rover he believed she only travelled there when he authorized drivers a backup vehicle and servants for the camp she must have with a cook a tribesman from the murra and troops from the border guard with that crowd she felt constricted and watched unfree she had no fear of the desert that lawrence had called cruel once a month beth slipped away on her own to walk among the black glass and the white stones to map and examine them and once every second month she took the deputy governors deputed escort she had been told by a bedouin trader who had come to shaybah of another place south of wabar where the glass and stones had fallen from the heavens and had been given landmarks perhaps a place where no human foot had ever been she would be there alone with the quiet if her land rover could get her there the birds searched had not yet found a prey below she was there because she had written the letter to the saudi embassy in london and had requested a visa for scientific research of meteorite impact sites she had of course exaggerated her academic qualifications and eggedup her field experience her mother and father had lectured her that the kingdom was not responsive to foreigners intruders three months later she had whooped when a positive response had dropped through the letterbox signed in person by the deputy governor instructing her to go to the embassy where a visa would be issued to her everyone she knew in london said it was a miracle that she had won admission to follow her studies the birds came down but not in the dive to strike their flight back to the cluster of vehicles was frantic and in fear above them distinct and threatening an eagle hovered the sport was finished no bustard would be taken the peregrine and the saker falcon would not fly again if an eagle dominated the sky the picnic was laid out and the birds shivered in fear in their cages she watched the eagle felt its presence a killer over the sands danger where before there had been none he followed the example of the guide rashid and the boy he must have the respect of rashid caleb had seen looking up the length of the caravan that when rashid glanced back there was no respect on his features for the men who rode the camels he stopped bent and unfastened the buckles of his heavy sandals he let his bare feet sink into the sand then hitched the sandals straps to his waist he took the first step he must have respect he was driven to find it the heat of the sand scorched the flesh on the soles of his feet the grains clogged between his toes the second step and then he was climbing a dunes lee slope and each step set fire to the skin under his feet which was pink and protected between the calluses and the new blisters but his grip was better than it was with the sandals his toes dug into the loose sand and he did not fall the burning ran from his feet to his ankles and up to his thighs caleb gasped his teeth locked on his lip he would not cry out they tumbled down the dunes reverse slope he fell but did not scream as the pain surged the boy ghaffur was gone caleb was alone abandoned by the caravans stampede down the reverse slope he scrambled to his feet he saw the boy sprint surefooted past the pack camels and past the camels on which fahd hosni and tommy clung as if for their lives he plodded after them the gap growing and the pain burning the boy reached his father at the head of the caravan and tugged at his fathers sleeve rashid seemed to listen to his son then turned tears welled in calebs eyes his bare feet gouged into the sand he saw through misted eyes the moment of disinterested contempt on rashids face heard faintly the cough and the spit then rashid resumed his march at the caravans head the next dune line was at least a mile in front it was as if bulldozers had scraped off the sand bed scalped it down to a surface of grit and chipped stones rashid led the camels on to the new ground the boy waited for him each step on the burned grit and the sharp stones was rich agony the boy waited and watched him calebs own craving for respect made him hang the sandals at his waist if now he dropped the sandals to the ground slipped his feet into them and refastened the buckles he could not win respect the vista stretched ahead of him and he started to count numbers to divert his mind from the shoots of pain the boys gaze wavered between calebs wet eyes and his feet he thought the boy understood the boys feet were hardened as old leather and ghaffur stood and waited for him caleb counted each step he came closer to the boy and the distance to the end of the caravan and the last bull camel carrying two of the boxes had widened he reached the boy still counting and passed him and kept on walking and each step hurt worse what do you say the voice piped i am counting what are you counting caleb grunted i am counting each step i take i have never heard of such numbers the boy said and shook his head he counted the next number and realized the pain and the heat the grit and stones under his feet had pushed him beyond the chasm that was the limit of his memory he cursed softly an old language had seeped into his mind his past he stamped on the memory and walked on caleb endured at the base of the next dune line where there would be soft sand rashid had called a halt fahd prayed but the egyptian and the iraqi squatted in the shade of their kneeling camels caleb reached them tommy sneered what do you wish to be a soldier or a peasant when the saudis prayers were complete they went on the boy stayed close to him eyes never off him because the boy had heard the evidence that the life of the outsider among them was a lie who was he the boys question had almost been answered caleb was able to hold the pace that rashid set the traffic was fierce lunatics hurled cars vans and lorries around barts chauffeured saloon his driver a favourite with the expatriates at the compound was slow to anger and seldom treated the roads as if they were stockcar circuits manoeuvred among the hazards with caution was a byword for calm and therefore was in demand they had just left the supermarket on the northern edge of central riyadh where bart had filled a trolley with mealsforone it was always a risk for an expatriate to drive himself a foreigner was inevitably considered to be in the wrong at an accident scene a european foreigner could be milked for rich pickings if a saudi was injured or his car dented no access to a lawyer and no help from the embassy he sat in the back of the chevrolet believed the companys sales pitch on the strength of the vehicle and was relaxed he was going shopping the supermarket had merely been his first call and his last call would be the englishlanguage bookstore but next in line was the pakistanistaffed mens clothes emporium there at least he would be treated with courtesy made to feel valued and so at their prices he damn well ought to be little luxuries had come late in life to samuel bartholomew none at home as a child none at school where pocketmoney allowances were grudgingly paid by his father none as a student in london he was looking for a couple of ties silk and a couple of shirts best egyptian cotton barts student years and the prequalification studies had been an endless miserly existence nine years in all and always his wallet had been light through preclinical and clinical through his preregistration year with six months as a hospital house physician and six more months as house surgeon and during the final three working as junior scrote at a general practitioners surgery in east london and back again into a south london hospital he had suffered unrelenting penury the legacy of it was that todays purchase of shirts and ties had importance being able to shop when the mood took him was even now a small sign of personal achievement the traffic wove and schemed around them the blast of horns and the roar of speeding engines was filtered in the airconditioned interior ahead over the drivers shoulder he saw a land rover discovery pull up to the kerb a blonde woman quite young and european stepped out and kids spilled from the back he could see the nape of a young mans neck tilted back against the drivers headrest an arab holding a plastic bag paused by the near side door hesitated on the pavement his own driver was slowing the trafficlights in front were against them around his car he heard the scream of brakes god worse than castration for these people would be the loss of their vehicles horn the arab crouched was hidden by the discovery and when he stood again he no longer held the plastic bag the lights changed and suddenly the arab was running the driver saw nothing concentrated on the surge of the traffic towards the junction the plastic bag was half under the rear door of the discovery there was a waft of cigarette smoke through the front window on which a tanned elbow rested bart knew every three months in batches expatriates were summoned to the embassy for sessions with the security officer and eddie wroughton would usually slope in unannounced and without introductions and stand at the back as the security officer briefed the audience of bankers accountants surveyors and defenceequipment engineers on precautions that should be taken where the nogo areas were and the dangers during the war when al jazeera and abu dhabi tv had pumped out twentyfourseven images of destruction and mutilation in iraq expatriates had been advised to stay at home keep off the streets and boycott work now the families were back but care should at all times be exercised the security officer had said at the last briefing bart had attended usual routes should be varied and vehicles should not be left on the street it was sensible to check under a car each morning bart understood what he had seen he sat rigidly upright in the back of the car they passed the discovery he said nothing he saw the young man lounging relaxed in the drivers seat waiting while the wife and kids browsed in a jewellers shop through the plateglass front of the shop he saw a flash of the young mothers hair and the kids beside her his own driver accelerated then they passed the arab sprinting and his thobe billowed against his legs as he ran his face was close to bart he seemed to be reciting his lips moved as if in prayer his eyes were behind spectacles his cheeks were clean and his moustache trimmed he was like any other of the young men who paraded the pavements and hospital corridors and sat behind ministry desks his driver was picking up speed the arab was lost from barts view he had swivelled in the back seat inside the constraint of the belt and looked back at the discovery could just see the young mans face first posting abroad making the sort of money he could not hope to match back home living in a villa with servants and a pool for the kids and the discovery was a hundred yards behind them they went through the junction he could have turned his head away looked instead over his own drivers shoulder but did not he saw the flash its blinding light he saw a door come off and cannon across the pavement into the glass of the jewellers window then a bonnet the discovery seemed to be lifted up and when it came down the duststorm gathered round it there was the thunder his driver braked every vehicle around them braked they were spewed across the road jamming it bart imagined his own driver swung his body and lifted the medical bag black leather and embossed with the initials salb off the front seat and was passing it into the back bart imagined the blood spurting from severed arteries legs amputated because they always were in a vehicle explosion a head crushed against a shattered windscreen hardly turning from what he watched bart pushed away the medical bag he imagined the young woman frozen in the jewellers shop cut by glass and the kids clinging to her legs he imagined the quiet groans of the young man in the discovery as the pallor settled on his face because death from vehicle explosions always came later in accident and emergency he knew it because he had seen it when his life was a greater lie he faced his driver who still clung to the medical bag which held the morphine and syringes that killed pain when death was inevitable what he should have done what he had practised and become expert at before moving to the kingdom was debridement if there had been the smallest chance of saving life there in the road while the patient groaned in shock and pain he could have cut out the wounds and lifted clear with forceps they were in his bag the worst of the blasts debris plastic from the dashboard cloth material from the seating clothing old techniques developed by napoleonic surgeons and still valid drive on bart said amazement and confusion wreathed the drivers face bart was a qualified medical doctor had passed the exams and been inducted as a member of the royal college of general practitioners he had sworn the oath named after the father of medicine hippocrates to follow the ethics and duties required of him he was he knew it dirt did he care so much of his life was betrayal he did not care dont get involved dont get caught up was the mantra of expatriates in the kingdom dont put your nose in because no onell thank you and youll get it bitten off instead fuck the shirts screw the ethics fuck the ties and screw the duties the oath had been sworn too long ago he hated himself and disgust squirmed in him where to doctor the driver asked back to the villa i think thank you when the traffic moved when the sirens were in the road they drove away bart had justification to hate himself al mazan village near jenin occupied west bank the patient had acute diarrhoea he had been called by the patients father it was now four months since he had been embedded in the palestinian community and trust for him was growing bart was escorted into the bedroom in lozv light other members of the family ringed the walls but only the mother was beside the bed where the girl lay four months before the smell would have made bart retch he was used to it now the mother held her daughters hand and spoke soft comforting words to her what astonished bart was that the whole of the village was not laid out prostrate with acute diarrhoea that part of the village was a shanty town of homes thrown together with corrugated iron canvas and packingcase boards no sanitation or running water when he had left his car he had seen that this corner of the village used an open sewer the girl was pale and weak from dehydration he had learned already that hospitalization was not an option for the shantys community at home at what he still thought of as home there would have been an express ambulance ride to the royal devon and exeter he was not at home and l ikely never would be clean drinking water care and love were the best that the girl could hope for he had the water and the parents would give the care and love from the fathers description of his daughters symptoms bart had known what to expect and had brought with him four tzvolitre bottles of evian water and he told the mother how much should be given by spoon to the girl and how often he made a point of urging her to wash the spoon in boiled water there was a picture of arafat on a wall and near to it another of a young man with doe dead eyes and a red cloth band tight round his forehead bart never talked politics in the village never talked of the struggle of arafats people never passed comment on the martyrdom of the suicide bombers he did not have to the whole village the shanty area and the homes round the central square knew of his bitter denunciation of the military at the roadblock outside the village he was the worm in the apples core the door at the back of the room was open beyond it was a cooking leanto with a table and bowls for washing and a stove threw off the scent of damp burning wood it was not warm enough for rain not cold enough for snow the weather was driving wet sleet what blankets they had were piled on the girls bed and he thought the other children and the parents would sleep cold that night if they slept the girl was a waif reduced by the severity of the diarrhoea but he smiled warmly and predicted she would be fine at the back of the cooking area there was another door and from it came the draught the main door behind bart which opened on to the mud alleyway where the open sewer ran creaked open and the wind was carried inside he saw the mother look up and flinch bart did not react it was what they had told him he should react to nothing however minor and however major to react was to betray himself betrayal was death he was saying when he would next visit at what time the next evening he heard the boots the mother had flinched when the first man had entered but her face lit with brief relief traced with concern at the sight of the second or the third bart saw a smile glimmer on the face of the sick child three young men crossed the room and the last momentarily hugged the father and grinned at the girl the third would have been the son the brother the face of the third young man was on the edge of barts vision a good face a strong face a fighters face bart talked about the next visit and the need for quiet for the girl as if that were possible in the shanty where the families were crushed together refugees from the destruction of inner jenin when the tanks had come in seven months before and he had the mothers hand in his as reassurance for her the three young men went through the cooking area and outside into a small yard with a shed of nailedtogether plywood and planks they disappeared inside it he recognized the face of the son the brother the last time he had seen it had been in a photograph album front on and profile monochrome with a serial number written underneath it the mother clung to his hand did she believe him could the decline of her daughter be arrested he smiled back his best smile trust me he left them do nothing that creates suspicion they had told him if you make suspicion bart you will be watched if you make the smallest mistake when you are watched you condemn yourself a condemned man is a dead man they had told him he had lingered at the outer door with the father had held his arm tightly and had remembered the features of the face of the fathers son he had gone to another patient who had the symptoms of hepatitis an old woman and to the home of a small child with posttraumatic stress syndrome and then he had driven to the roadblock he shouted at the soldiers israelis the same age as the three young palestinians bawled at them as they ordered him out of his car oh yes what are you looking for this time the way you behave is criminal he was quickly propelled into the hut larger and warmer than the one in the yard of a home in the shanty part of the village joseph made him coffee when the coffee had warmed bart the album of photographs was retrieved from a safe he had a good memory excellent recall within five minutes after eight pages he had identified the young man joseph was expressionless did not congratulate him and did not tell him what importance the young man was given did joseph admire his agent or did he consider him scum immaterial really neither the admiration nor the contempt of the shin beth officer would have freed bart from the treadmill he walked on joseph took him to the door back out in the street bart shouted just you wait your time will come justice will catch you you are as much a criminal in wilfully obstructing a doctor of medicine as any of those serbs at the hague i wonder after what you do how you can sleep at night no decent man would sleep he drove away through the chicane of concrete blocks and the sullen eyes of soldiers tracked him marty took first lady up for the first time from shaybah he could not see her as she sped along the runway the windows of the ground control station looked out over their tent camp the predator mq needed sixteen hundred metres of runway to get airborne lizzyjo called the variants of crosswind but they were inside what was manageable hadnt been the day before the first flight since shed been unloaded from her coffin and put back together would be an hour not a lot more but theyd get to the ceiling of altitude and go on maximum speed and loiter speed and theyd run first ladys cameras and infrared systems all the gear theyd check the satellite link to langley and that the agency floor in riyadh had a realtime picture the liftoff was fine the forward camera showed the perimeter fence disappearing beneath them and then there was the sand only the sand his place was in the ground control station with the joystick in his hands and the screens in front of him but where hed like to have been was outside with his hand shading his eyes watching her go she was the most beautiful thing he knew back at bagram marty had always wanted to know when the other agency birds or the usaf mqls were going up like a bird such grace worst thing hed known was a ride on a black hawk and seeing below the helicopter the wreckage of an air force predator that had gone down with onwing icing a broken bird shattered scattered among rocks his bird first lady had a maximum operational radius of five hundred nautical miles and an operational endurance time of twentyfour hours but for the first flight theyd do little more than an hour with close to seventyfive nautical miles covered lizzyjo talked first to langley yes they read her well yes the pictures were good she switched to riyadh theyd taken off away from the control tower and away from the cluster of office buildings and accommodation blocks the control tower had had to be informed of their presence and of all their flight movements it had a vaguely worded sheet of paper from the prince sultan base up at al kharj testflying evaluation of performance in extreme heat conditions the bare minimum the zooms on the belly camera showed wide landscapes then blurred till they refocused on the individual rims of dunes marty thought the place had beauty but the pilots talk still hurt him the guy whod parachuted down from the navys hornet had done what was right stayed by the wreckage and died of thirst and heat stroke he reflected that beauty did not have to be kind there could be dangerous beauty shed found a bush a bush that was ten feet high and maybe six feet across and he had first lady at twelve thousand feet and climbing at a ground speed of seventythree nautical miles per hour lizzyjo had a bush to show to riyadh on the screen the bush was clear and all of its branches and most of what leaves it had thats cute she said into the bar microphone over her mouth there you are mr gonsalves fantastic life is up and running in the empty quarter wow the voice came back over martys headphones incredible ive never seen that before extraordinary you could recognize a man one man i am in awe but the wind at that altitude caught first lady and tossed her like she was a childs model and the bush was lost and the picture for all the gyroscopic kit rocked and wavered correction i was in awe is that the wind marty said it was the wind sir understand me im not making excuses here but this will not be an easy place to fly out of its where we are you are cant base in french djibouti too long a range if it was at prince sultan were telling the world a hostile one where we are and what were at its about security you got to live with the wind you got to learn to fly with the wind security is paramount they have a saying here you want to send a message then tell it and swear her to secrecy to your daughterinlaw you dont talk to anyone outside your perimeter and most certain you do not permit anyone entry you draw as little attention to yourselves as possible its like these people who hate us have their ears down on the railtracks i tell you believe it security counts but you can fly there no problem right marty said we can fly here lizzyjo muttered im not about to promise how effective well be marty said dont worry well get the show on the road i got a meeting thanks guys marty chipped you didnt tell us when you were down here if we get a target whats the status youll have hellfire on the wings when you go operational im running late for my meeting if im right in what im predicting and its a courier route then you track but if youre at the end of your fuel load and cant stay and track then a target is shoot on sight adios amigos the static burst in martys headphones he threw the switch and cut the link he felt the excitement and looked at her lizzyjo winked a big brown eye at him shoot on sight they had all prayed even tommy caleb thought it a mark of the brutality all around them that when they had reached the stop point of the day with the light going down on the dunes they had made a line and sunk to their knees then he and the boy had gone foraging and left rashid to build the night camp and hoist the tents it amazed him on the whole of the days march he had seen no wood nothing that lived and nothing that was even long dead the pain had throbbed on the soles of his feet even as the sand had cooled and he had been selfabsorbed by his discomfort and his pursuit of respect three times where caleb had only seen ochre sand the boy crouched and scrabbled with his hands like a burrowing rabbit and had triumphantly produced driedout roots the roots were brought back broken and lit rashid used the old ways worked his hands under the smallest and narrowest of the stems sliced a flint across the blade of his knife again and again until the spark made smoke and then flame the fire darkened the desert beyond the small circle of its light and the outline of the tents caleb watched he had much to learn where the fire flared rashid scooped a hole under the widening embers not seeming to feel pain he had a metal bowl filled with flour and he sprinkled salt on it then sparingly poured water on to the flour and kneaded the mess to little shapes when hed worked them and was satisfied he put the shapes into the hole and pushed sand over them their eyes met rashid the guide stared at calebs feet caleb tried to read him was he impressed rashid had the face of a wolf under his headcloth held loosely in place with rope his forehead was lined and wrinkled his narrow eyes savaged what they lighted on and his nose was as prominent as a hook thin lips were above and below yellowed uneven teeth and around them a tangle of hairs made the moustache and beard no comment was given rashid moved on hid his feelings there was no sign of respect when the sun had gone before the moon was up and when the blackness cloaked them beyond the little fires range ghaffur took the bread from the hole shook off the sand and passed each of them two pieces rashid measured the water ration poured a cupful they ate the bread drank from the cup and passed it back then they were given three dates caleb held them in his mouth and sucked until the stones had no more fruit on them he said quietly to the egyptian what are you doing here why are you with me what is my importance hosni smiled and the shadows of the fire crackled across his face he blinked and caleb saw the opaque gloss on his eyes in the morning perhaps inside the cool of the tent the pain at last ebbed from calebs feet he knew so little if the memories had crossed the chasm he would have known more he slept dreamlessly his mind as dark as the night outside the tent chapter six the scream pierced the morning air startled caleb looked around he saw the guide rashid loading the boxes on to the pack camels with his son ghaffur fahd was clumsily folding the tents hosni kicked sand over what was left of the nights fire that the signs of it might be hidden the scream was terror from the depths of a man he saw the iraqi tommy tommy had never not since they had set out into the desert helped with the loading of the boxes or with folding the tents as if that were beneath the dignity once belonging to him tommy had walked away after they had eaten the last of the bread baked the evening before once the work to move off had started he had walked fifty paces or sixty from the camp and had squatted to defecate that completed he had sat apart from them and watched them as if he were not a part of them the scream shrieked for help as caleb saw it the iraqi sat with his hands out behind him to support his weight his legs stretched in front of him he was rigid as if not daring to move staring down at the skin between his boots and the hem of his trousers the guide was the first to react rashid ran with a short scurrying stride towards tommy and ghaffur followed hosni looked into the distance at the direction of the scream but seemed unable to identify its source fahd scrambled to catch the guide but when he was at the bedouins shoulder he was abruptly pushed away caleb went slowly after them but hung back he looked past rashid gazed at the iraqi he stared at the eyes which were distended he raked over the chest and the open jacket and on to the trousers still unfastened and around the groin then on down to the trembling ankles caleb saw the scorpion the sun not yet high fell on the scorpions back identified each marking on it it was small would have fitted into the palm of his hand its head was hidden in a fold of the trouser leg but the tail was clear it was arched over its back and below it was an angry reddening swell with a puncture hole at its centre tears rolled on tommys cheeks his lips quivered the scorpion was still but the tail was up poised for a second strike and caleb could see the needle at its tip rashid allowed only his son ghaffur to come forward the man and the boy were at either side of tommys legs each knelt then each edged slowly towards the legs until they were within a hands reach of the ankles and the scorpion caleb heard rashid murmur to the iraqi but could not hear what he said then he spoke with great gentleness to his child caleb saw ghaffur so slowly rock backwards and forwards as if he prepared to strike with the speed of the scorpion father and son kept their bodies and heads low almost to the sand so that their shadows did not pass over the legs and the scorpion the father did not tell the son when or how had trust in him as though he knew his sons reactions and movements would be faster than his own he would make a better strike than himself the trembling spread from tommys head to his chest and hips if he could not control it if the creature were further disturbed more venom would be injected into him ghaffurs hand flashed forward caleb gasped the finger and thumb delicate slight and unprotected caught the tail half an inch from the poison tip and then the boy was grinning and holding up the writhing little creature the iraqi seemed to have fainted ghaffur marched with the scorpion first to fahd who flinched away then held it in front of hosnis dulled eyes then brought it to caleb the scorpion thrashed and its pincers limbs body and head crawled against ghaffurs hand small spurts of venom came from the needle tip caleb saw momentarily the pride on the fathers face before the mask slipped back the boy took the knife from his belt and with a slash as fast as his strike had been he cut the tail from the body the scorpion fell at his feet writhing then the boy threw the tail and its tip carelessly over his shoulder rashid used his fingernail to stroke the bitten wound the yellowish body and legs and the darker pincers of the scorpion were still dead in the sand rashids fingernail stroked towards the centre of the swollen place where the pinprick was pushing the venom back from the extremities and towards the hole rashid barked an instruction at his son caleb followed ghaffur the boy returned to the camels bent close to them and started to refasten the hobble ropes what does your father say my father says the man is not fit to travel that we will lose half a day before he is well enough to move my father says we have to wait until he is stronger it is bad you did well with it where you come from are there no scorpions caleb grimaced was guarded against the question there had been scorpions at xray and delta only once had a guard been bitten many scorpions in the corridors and cages and the guards had stamped their heavy boots on them or the prisoners had flattened them with their sandals he lied i have never seen a scorpion before the boy shrugged it is easy to kill them but we may lose half a day and that angers my father away across the sand near the dune wall rashid had torn a strip of cloth to a bandage width and was binding it round the iraqis shin just below the knee he began again to stroke his fingernail across the swelling caleb went to the egyptian we will lose half a days march we cannot move until he has recovered it was a revolting creature any snake is revolting hosni said with bitterness yes any snake caleb stared at the dulled eyes and knew i did not see it well i stayed back i saw the boy take the head off was it a viper i dont know snakes caleb said last night i asked you why do you travel with me why am i important important because of where you come from think on it where you have come from they tell me you are not a believer to us you are the outsider that is what you have to consider when you ask of your importance can you admit it where you come from from the brigade from guantanamo and before you were recruited caleb took sand in his hands and let the grains fall between his fingers before the wedding and his recruitment was the darkness he had imposed he remembered arriving in his suit with farooq and amin at the celebration after the wedding and remembered the way that the chechen had watched him then set tests for him everything before was in blackness the next morning he had left and he could remember it clearly landi khotal before dawn he had been told by the chechen that he should forget his friends farooq and amin a pickup had taken him through the border and through the last of the narrow passes and he had been brought to jalalabad and then straight on to the camp at the camp two days later two postcards had been given him the reverse pictures on the postcards had not been shown him but he had read the words opera house and ayers rock and he had written two bland messages that he was well and on each he had written a name and an address but the name and the address were now erased from his mind a small tired smile played on the egyptians face you are the outsider you are separated from us i am not offended to us the outsider is the most valuable he can go where we cannot he has access where we do not he can walk unseen where we are noticed who are we lesser creatures what use do we have small nothing that is strategic we will watch you go and we will pray for you after you have disappeared into darkness but we will listen to the radio and will hope to learn that the trust given you was not wrongly placed once the iraqi cried out the only sound against the whisper of the egyptians voice and the restless grunting of the hobbled camels hosnis fingers stubbed and wrinkled came and touched calebs face and they moved across his features as if discovering them ran over his nose and his chin through the hairs round his mouth and it was a long time before they dropped away dont go all shy on me what did your miss jenkins have to say for herself eddie wroughton always varied the meetingplaces with samuel bartholomew a bookshop a museum a hotel lobby the hotel was sumptuous fitted to the highest specifications of carpets on marble flooring lighting and furnishing hed ordered the orange juice which was garnished with lemon slices but bartholomew hadnt touched his she paid for the consultation didnt she strong as a good bay mare id have said so what did she say opposite him

governor of the province friendly enough to be allowed to live down there whats his pillow talk didnt she gossip just a little such a wonderful consultationroom manner you have wroughton leached sarcasm surely a few minor confidences were exchanged as you poked round her while she had your disgusting fingers crawling over her surely there was some gossip be a good chap cough it up he knew he frightened the man that he was supine at the age of fortyone wroughton was young to be station chief at so prestigious a posting as riyadh his last two overseas bases had been in sarajevo and riga but now he was top league there was one overriding catastrophe in his life a cloud that darkened the suns glory he had no money he lived off his salary spent cash only on what could be seen was a pauper behind the privacy of his front door there was no investment portfolio ticking over in london only a rabbit hutch of an apartment on the wrong side of pimlico his poverty was kept as hidden as his sharpness and intelligence playing a wealthy dandy a buffoon did him well but the irritation at the lack of personal money was only battened down by his workload he lived for work i dont push business your way out of the goodness of my soul i expect payback miss jenkins is down there in the sand a place where a saint wouldnt survive didnt you pedal a bit faster just a little shes unique where she is might just be the most interesting corner of this whole hideous place she goes out into the desert got eyes in her head hasnt she what did you talk about her menstrual cycle money promotion status in the service had never mattered to wroughtons father or to his grandfather he was from a dynasty not a financial dynasty but a dynasty based on the precept that a grateful population must be allowed to sleep safe in bed his father had done time in moscow and prague during the cold war his mother had been in library sifting filing and annotating until his birth his grandfather had been seconded to mi after the dunkirk evacuation and then had had a good war turning the agents the abwehr parachuted in and having them broadcast back misinformation his greatuncle had hunted down war criminals after ve day and enough to have filled a small bus had gone on the dawn walk to the gallows all through his childhood at sunday lunches the glories of intelligence and counterintelligence had been preached no chance he could have gone elsewhere he had been groomed as a youth for the secret intelligence service to wroughton bartholomew was more pathetic than the agents his father had run behind the iron curtain more pitiful than the turned germans who saved their skins more disgusting than the hanged butchers i sometimes think you forget your situation do you if we cut you adrift then slip the word round youre a gone man those nice little accounts earning a low rate of interest but safe the nestegg for the future can each have funds withdrawn at the pressing of a button we have any number of people who specialize in that didnt you know with your history a quiet word from me and your future is sleeping under cardboard beside waterloo station just that i sometimes think its necessary to remind you if she ever comes back to you from that trackless wilderness make sure shes pumped dry theres a good chap to reinforce it emphasize his argument wroughton manoeuvred his right foots brogue then kicked hard against bartholomews left ankle wroughton had never believed his mother had liked him let alone loved him or that his father had respected him on the day of his first induction interview at the service his grandfather had offered him the stern advice that he should look in the city for employment but eddie wroughton had never flinched from meting out punishment to this repellent man most of his work was in the sifting of publications less of it was in mixing with the saudi elite as they liked to be regarded a little of it was cohabiting in the gutter with scum bartholomew was scum the best of it was with juan gonsalves his friend the best brought the praise from london the certainty of advancement and the probability of an augmented salary if she comes and sees you again with as much as a pimple on her sweet little shin then you gut her and fillet her and you damn well learn something of what goes on down in that bloody place dont snivel plenty goes on there and shell know it i dont think youre big on scruples so it shouldnt be too hard he kicked again then stood he looked down on bartholomew from his pocket wroughton took a slip of paper a name was written on it and an address go and see her take the time give her a bit of tender and loving care what youre so good at and learn something what she saw what if anything was shouted out any warning or any denunciation then report back course you will wherell you be the voice squeaked from between the hands away for a couple of days then ill hear from you all that perspiration it makes you look old and revolting do something about it you havent finished your juice its thirty riyals a glass dont waste it wroughton smiled sweetly at the concierge who held open the outer door for him he had no conscience as to dealing out a bullys mows at samuel bartholomew from his childhood days at the sunday lunch table he had learned that the relationship between handler and agent should be master and servant no emotion no affection no relationship like dogs they should be at heel and obedient lack of engine thrust had grounded first lady the fourcylinder rotax push engine was playing delicate george wanted time on it half a day theyd already had carnival girl up once but she was backup so george would have his half a day and lizzyjo could kick her heels she had her problem it was not a problem to be discussed with marty most certainly not with any of the rest of the team marty was in the tent beside the ground control station was by the fan that circulated stinking hot air had his feet up and was reading back numbers of flight international im going to go find a shop she told him but he was too absorbed with the magazine and last years articles to respond with anything more than a grunt i need to look for a shop she called to george and he looked up from the engine pieces and nodded i need to do some shopping wont be long she said to the armourer who sat facing the space left in the barbed wire coiled round their perimeter he wore a multipocket khaki waistcoat that concealed his shoulder holster and the colt he had a baseball cap low over his face and he shrugged there must be a shop the encampment was at the extreme end of the runway beyond their own wire was a single strand fence then the desert and set in the sands in the near distance were the landing lights of the strip halfway up the strip on the far side was the cluster of buildings that she presumed were the accommodation blocks for the workers there would be a club a gym a clinic and a shop she walked briskly as a new yorker she walked everywhere briskly the temperature on the thermometer hanging from the support pole of her tent had shown fahrenheit in shade for decorum local sensibilities and that crap she had a blouse over her tshirt and shed slipped on long loose trousers and had a headscarf over her hair she skirted the end of the runway looking up to check there wasnt an incoming flight that might if the wheels were down have taken her head off selfishness had brought lizzyjo to shaybah the electronics expert was a selfish woman she had made a career out of selfishness ever since the air force had sent her on the sensor operators course she had been with predator from the start at the far side of the strip she turned and started out on the long tramp to the buildings she could have taken wheels but the restrictions on their movements away from the encampment would have meant the fullest of explanations about her problem to the armourer and to george and marty her problem was not theirs shed done air force time then seen the recruitment notice posted by the agency for uav personnel shed left the air force and been taken on by the agency and then the selfishness had ruled rick had been with her at the air force camps and clara but the agency didnt do married accompanied rick sold insurance now in north carolina and last year had been his companys salesman of the year in the state his parents looked after clara theyd divorced while she was at taszar hungary doing sensor operator for flying over kosovo a longrange divorce that spared her meetings in lawyers offices and she was not it was her justification for selfishness a natural mother what rick wanted out of life was to sell death benefits to customers what she wanted was to find pictures on first ladys cameras the heat shimmered on the dunpainted buildings ahead and the sunlight burst back from the buildings windows and behind them was the city of pipes and containers cranes and stacks she had seen that marty had his old afghan war picture propped against the metal cupboard beside his cot lizzyjo had a small tent to herself womans privilege and beside her bed a collapsible side table with the picture of rick and clara she assumed that rick had a picture of her beside his bed not that it mattered to her she wrote to them not more than a page every three or four months birthdays and christmas and once a year she wrote to her own people in new york her own people she knew didnt hold with divorce were fervent christians and disapproved of her abandonment of clara it was tough shit for all of them she wanted to be with the predator team and reckoned the eighteen months of operation enduring freedom out of bagram had been the best time of her life she d idnt regard herself as selfish just as professional it mattered to her she was closer lizzyjo could make out what she thought was a recreational building fronted by a veranda she hit her stride there was a sign for a shop and she followed its arrow she walked inside and the airconditioned cool punched her she followed the shelves wove among men some in robes some in slacks and shirts who carried wire baskets or pushed trolleys there was food frozen trays vegetables and fruit confectionery chocolates and boiled sweets clothes for men toiletries for men and cosmetics for men juices of every shade and taste stationery and software music dvds and compacts then she found the chemists section headache pills sunstroke creams insect repellents eyes were on her when she met them they dropped or turned away but she felt that as soon as the eyes were behind her again they fastened back on to her clung to her but the problem had to be answered it was part her own fault and part the agencys the instruction to travel and the takeoff from bagram had given her too little time too many of the few hours available between the order and the flight out had been taken up with downloading the computers and checking the loading of the gear they were her computers her gear and she had fussed over them not permitting the technicians free range over what was hers and she had not been to the base shop she joined the queue to the cash desk the man in front of her robed edged away from her pushed against the man in front so that a distance might be between her and him oh sweet jesus at the cash desk an older man a dishtowel over his head a moustache and fat jowls repeated in a strident voice everything asked of him by his customers she was next to the head of the queue the customer in front of her paid for a bag of fruit and a tube of shaving soap she said it again to herself and she could feel the sweat on her back the cashdesk man looked up at her then averted his eyes lizzyjo said it out loud like she would have done in a new york drug store do you have tampons tampons thats what i said tampons if you have them i cant see them tampons its a pretty simple question what your wife the cashdesk man shook his head a great rolling movement the voice behind lizzyjo was crisp clear english no they dont lizzyjo spun eyes dropped swivelled fell from her six back in the queue was a woman younger than herself and she caught the grin like it was contagious they dont have tampons no not a great call for them here look why dont you wait outside or by the door ill sort you out lizzyjo went past the younger woman and saw that her basket contained an insect repellent spray an antiinflammatory cream and sunblock so lizzyjo met beth who took her to the club they sat out on the veranda and were shaded by a table parasol they drank iced lemon juice and she learned that beth jenkins was the only woman resident with the run of the shaybah oilproduction works and im assuming youre with those little aircraft i saw one take off a pretty little thing why here lizzyjo said quickly too quickly just test flights performance evaluation in heat over desert mapping a little frown puckered the young womans forehead she would have thought there were about a million and ten places that were easier for that evaluation and a hundred thousand and ten places that were more of a priority for mapping the explanation was not queried anyway cant stay ive an english literature class my top group were doing dickens oliver twist they like that bestial english society makes them feel good got to go how long have i got you desperate not now i will be by the end of the week ill drop some by dont worry my tongue doesnt flap i wont see anything as she walked back along the side of the runway strip lizzyjo reflected that shed made a poor job of the security of the mission but maybe just once security took second place tampons counted she reflected also as she turned at the strips end that a young woman who took a stranger for a drink when she was short of time and late on a class commitment was lonely not alone but lonely lizzyjo didnt do loneliness but the thought of it frightened her george and his technicians had the casing back on the engine and were standing back from first lady the light caught the forward fuselage clean and virgin she remembered the words loud in her headphones shoot on sight they had lost half a day worse than the hours lost was the water used caleb watched the pot brought to the boil and more of the withered dry roots that ghaffur had kept the fire alive with rashid took the sodden plants from the pot clasped them in his hand and seemed not to feel any pain as the scalding water seeped between his fingers the plants were slapped on tommys inflamed ankle the iraqi cried out then rags were bound over them tommy writhed there was no sympathy from the guide caleb sensed rashids concern what to do with the water wait for it to cool more time gone throw it on to the sand what is that caleb asked the reply was curt it is ramram is it an old cure what my father would have used and my grandfather tell me we learn from the sands there are lizards they are not bitten by the snakes not bitten by the scorpions we watch and we learn and we hand down what we know the lizards eat the ramram plant and they roll in it wherever they find it it is a protection against the poison it was said matteroffactly without feeling first the majority of the venom had been drawn out by the stroking fingernails now the poultice would extract what remained old practices and old times at camp delta when the guard had been stung by the scorpion alarms had rung medics had charged to the scene an ambulance had come with the siren wailing panic had been alive and within two days the guard had been returned to the block that was the new way but the old way of rashid had been quiet calm and competent rashid swung his foot kicked over the pot and the water momentarily stained the sand then he shouted for ghaffur to pick up the pot and stow it the guide lifted tommy on to his shoulder carried him to the kneeling camel and heaved him on to the saddle on the hump again tommy cried out again his pain was ignored the caravan moved on the wisp of smoke from the fire was left behind them caleb walked beside hosni who rolled on his saddle twice caleb reached up to steady the egyptian it was not a journey for a man of his age the question welled in him what is the first thing that i should know the voice wheezed you should know your only loyalty is to your family us and those who wait for you and the second thing your duty is to your brothers us and those who wait for you again he put the question what should he know you have no nationality it is behind you none of us has a country we are the rejected tommy would be taken by the americans or their puppets and would be put before a military court or a sham court of their stooges and he would be executed fahd if he were arrested here would be tortured by the police then taken to the square in riyadh in front of the central mosque and beheaded i if i were held would be flown to cairo and if i survived the interrogation i would be hanged in a prison and you you would be hosnis voice died what would happen to me no answer the question was ignored a new fervour came to the egyptian you are a jewel to us men will give their lives that you should live is that not enough at a chosen time you will go back where you came from or to america you will be the servant of your family and your brothers and you will resurrect your memory you will strike the blow that only you are capable of enough hosnis eyes as if they hurt or disappointed him were closed caleb dropped back if only hed come with me she sobbed if the silly bugger had come with me hed have been all right but he didnt he wasnt interested her behaviour the anger in it was predictable to bart he knew the pattern from road accidents back in torquay and from his time as house physician in london melanie garnetts outburst was what he would have expected if hed been called out earlier just after it had happened he would have heard a horrified description of the bomb detonating under the land rover discovery no he wasnt interested in that necklace he said we were saving money were supposed to be were only here for the mortgage god what other reason would anyone be here he didnt have the guts to tell me i couldnt have it so he stayed in the discovery clearest in barts mind was the image of the man at the drivingwheel elbow out through the open window and the puff of his cigarette smoke she was a fainter image blurred behind the glass of the jewellers shop he wondered where the children were now oh yes theyd be round at a neighbours with the lego out on the tiled floor yesterday there would have been the horror today would be the anger tomorrow the guilt the anger was easier to deal with even if he had stopped done his duty as a man of medicine he would not have been able to save the man he wanted to save for a mortgage sos we could live somewhere posh when this three years of hell was over somewhere like beaconsfield or the chalfonts and it killed him damn him i mean whats a threebedroomed semi in beaconsfield worth worth getting killed for an older woman shared the sofa with melanie garnett widow she would have been a longterm matriarch of the expatriate society and knew her stuff she was doing well made a soothing listening post with her shoulder and didnt interrupt ann would have interrupted ann never could keep her mouth shut bart examined her he murmured little questions not to calm her but to pump information from her what had she seen what had she heard had there been any threats nothing nothing and no nothing seen nothing heard no threats it would be a negative report to wroughton but he had asked the questions while he took her pulse and heartbeat he looked around him the furnishings were sparse the decorations minimal the sense of a home was missing except for the heap of toys in a corner and childrens books on the table he looked for signs of the familiar expatriates scam alcohol bootlegging then there would have been flash opulence but there wasnt any ann would just have bought the bloody necklace charged it to his card and the first he would have known of it was when she wore it he could blame everything on ann the size of the mortgage the scale of the overdraft the fees for the private school that the kids had to go to the two foreign holidays a year and the remedies hed sunk to were all down to ann his mother had come to the wedding been barely civil but his father had not his mother had told him in a stagewhispered aside well into the reception that ann was common and unsuitable and that her relatives were plainly vulgar and thank the good lord hermione bartholomew had not lived long enough to crow at him that she had been right in the kingdom all the deaths of expatriates by bomb or bullet were put down to alcohol turf wars this one would be too but bart knew better he prescribed diazepam a maximum of ten milligrams a day two tablets from his open bag he took the bottle and counted out sufficient to last three days he should have felt beneath the professional exterior serious sympathy for melanie garnett what had she done to deserve an encounter with a bomber she was without blame he was almost shocked at his reaction as near to being shamed as was possible for him he put the tablets into an envelope and scrawled the dosage on the label i really wanted that necklace wasnt a crime to want it if hed come with me if hed come with me just to look after the kids he didnt come with me the kids were arguing and hes dead what i hate about him the last i saw of him properly saw of him he was all stonefaced and getting his fags out not a kiss not a love you not a cuddle but looking sour thats the last i saw of him damn him to his mind rebellion was alive in the kingdom and soon pray god the whole stinking edifice would come down bart had always been good at learning lines but then his talent was to play a part the part of a liar against the weeping anger of the widow he was able to recite in his mind perfect recall my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair the towers of glass and concrete airports and luxury hotels wide highways and people of such mindnumbing arrogance were floating on oil and the edifice was crumbling a bomb here and a shooting there work for the executioner in chop chop square a frisson of fear eddying into the palaces each time he read of or heard of an atrocity a little raw excitement coursed in bart round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away he hoped damn it that he would still be there to see the decay come to fruition be able to scent it his mothers on the flight tonight what am i going to tell her if her precious son hadnt been so bloody mean to me his wife hed still be alive do i tell her that tomorrow would be worse for the widow she would have his mother there organizing her and she would have her guilt posttraumatic stress syndrome would crucify her with guilt if she had not wanted the bloody necklace her husband would be alive her kids would have a father the guilt would churn like a whirlwind in her mind poor little cow ann had never felt guilt even when she had brought him to his knees he went into the kitchen where a maid cowered poured a glass of water and carried it back into the room the matriarch slipped a tablet into melanie garnetts mouth then gave her the glass bart waited until she was quieter then left out in the compound spied on by the neighbours the sliver of independence deserted him he walked to his car preparing what he would say to eddie wroughton he was in fear of wroughton and knew it he flopped into the back of the car and the driver took him away he was as pliant as putty and he knew no route for escape no track that could free him he fumed but his experience of recent years had taught eddie wroughton to mask fury had he shouted abuse at the omani policeman he would have lost him he had been driven a hundred kilometres or so west of the capital to ad dari a trading town en route to the interior he should have been at the police station in an interrogation room instead he was shivering with anger and from the cold in the refrigeration room of the hospital mortuary the british staffer in muscat city was green so lacking in experience with the secret intelligence service that wroughton on hearing of the arrest had caught the first available flight from riyadh the man he should have been questioning with relish and vigour was now a corpse frozen solid death had come in a spasm of pain that the refrigeration plant had preserved the attendants hadnt even closed the mans eyes which were wide and staring cardiac arrest there was nothing we could do the omani intoned yes there bloody well was he could have been properly searched on arrest had goons in his cell and his hands manacled behind his back t h e autopsy will be tomorrow the staffer intoned emptily like he thought it was his failure dont know what theyll find wroughton could have reeled off a list of poisons right for selfadministration that were quick but painful while they did their work he turned away he had no more need to look down at the trolley and the body the man was late fifties or perhaps early sixties but his age would be confirmed over coffee in the policemans office his name and occupation were paramount particularly the occupation which had brought wroughton scurrying off the plane his last sight of the man was his fat fingers and the width of the two gold rings one on each hand over which the flesh bulged they walked along the corridor towards an office it was a rumour mr wroughton from information we received we acted on it immediately the police officer said ingratiating and ashamed we heard that this prominent hawaldar had travelled a few days ago upcountry he was a wealthy man prominent in his trade and he had gone to a place where there is only poverty we said and i discussed this with your young colleague that he must be arrested immediately the staffer flinched because now the blame was shared wroughton understood the western members of the financial action task force regularly and predictably targeted the gulf states for the movement of money that benefited al qaeda there had been a gesture of action and the action had led to catastrophe the hazval system was the nightmare money moving without paper or electronic trace and big sums were not needed an investment of wisely spent on flying lessons simulators and cheap motels would cost the americans billion for the rebuilding of the twin towers and the economic losses post the hijackings what was required was money to follow to track breaking into the hawal networks was as big a priority as existed in eddie wroughtons life and the man was dead the bastard was a stiff guilt was proven a man who took a pill after only cursory questioning was a man harbouring a big secret a man who would die rather than face indepth interrogation im sure you did the right thing wroughton said without charity there would of course be mobile and landline telephone records to work on but he doubted they would show up anything beyond inconsequential dealings they sat the first coffee was poured into a thimble cup he sensed a nervous energy building in the staffer they talked of the hawaldar s connections his links they hacked at his special branch file it was nearly an hour before the staffers energy burst out there is something else you should know mr wroughton an american navy helicopter came in here recently with a casevac a crewman needed facilities they didnt have on board the carrier i met the navigator off the helicopter he just told a silly story we were talking smuggling you know cigarettes going from here to iranian fishing villages fast speedboats maybe it wasnt much of a story well if its silly keep it short please yes of course the navigator explained how they regularly track the speedboats keep them on radar because of suicide attacks they were following this formation when it broke one speedboat detached from the main group and took a line that was going to bring it close to the carrier the navigators helicopter was put on immediate intervention alert it was all armed up missiles live for firing they didnt have to take off the single speedboat headed away and they tracked it it went right in to the omani coast then up the shoreline and rejoined the others on the return trip there was the same number of them as with the original formation have i explained that well it was the day before the rumour put the moneylender upcountry where there was nothing for him that we can identify i thought you ought to know wroughton didnt thank him did not praise him he hid the increased pulse beat in his heart he asked for a map it was spread across the table he asked where the speedboat from iran had hit the omani coast and he made a cross at that point with his pencil then he asked where rumour had put the hawaldar upcountry and he made a second mark could they please bring him a ruler when the ruler was given him wroughton made a line that linked the coast and a road junction took the line on and traced it right to the saudi border he was in a good humour the corpse and the frustrations were forgotten he told the police officer and his staffer what he wanted from the morning and at what time they should leave in the privacy of his hotel room wroughton would manage a large drink damn sure he would study the map and dream of what the line told him the guide rashid had set a forced pace caleb had thought when they came to the dune wall rising in front of them an almost sheer slope that they would rest there for the night the sun was low the halflight treacherous softspoken but harshly rashid gave his orders his son sulked but obeyed only tommy was the exception but for this one evening only the camels were unloaded the waterskins and the crates were lifted down from them two at a time rashid led the camels up the near vertical slope with their hoofs kicking for and failing to find a grip and tommy scrambled after him on hands and knees fahd carried waterskins hosni struggled with food pouches one at a time caleb and the boy took the boxes with ropes they dragged them to the dunes ridge line gasped for air were glowered at by rashid and went back down for more there was no encouragement from rashid only contempt at his thin and bloodless lips three times caleb heaved a box to the ridge then slid back down the slope the last time he went there were no more boxes at the base of the dune but hosni was there with the last two of the food pouches he did not think hosni saw him until he was beside him caleb lifted the last two pouches on to his shoulder and snatched at hosnis hand put it against the belt of his robe and felt the fingers tighten they went up together it was family they were brothers he would not have done it for fahd or for tommy only for the egyptian twice on the last climb the dunes sand cascaded away from under his toes and he fell back cannoned into hosni and felled him twice he picked himself up each time realizing that the fingers still gripped his belt and they went back up he took hosni to the ridge he flopped and hosni collapsed beside him only a quarter of the sun was left and the desert darkening stretched away beneath them below at the base of the gentler slope of the dune tommy held a tangle of the camels reins and rashid was loading the boxes on to their backs they started down rashid again set the pace the boy ghaffur was beside caleb caleb walked dead saw nothing he did not know from where the boy found the cheerful laughter look look the boy had hold of his sleeve tugged it for attention then pointed thirty yards from where they walked to his left caleb saw the crazily formed white shapes in the halflight he could not identify them but the boy dragged on his arm and led him from the path made by the camels hoofs you see them yes you do he could make out the backbones skulls and ribcages half buried in the sand the leg bones were covered where the sand had drifted but the four sets of bones were clear flattened empty skins lay on the ribcages the same size as those holding water that fahd had carried up the dune the black leather of the skins lay on the bones whiteness shall we find the bones of the men no caleb pulled himself free of the boys hand if the camels died the men died dont you want to find them no caleb grunted over his shoulder after the camels died the men would have finished their water at first they would have hoped another traveller would find them but when the water was finished and no traveller came the thirst would have destroyed them and they would have tried to walk away their bones will be near here against his instinct caleb turned the darkness was coming fast but the bones were highlighted he heard his own voice breathy anxious do we have enough water only god knows they hurried to catch up the light of a small fire guided them when they could no longer see the camels trail caleb felt the pain in every joint of his body he sank down water was passed to him his measured share he drank it down the last drop then scraped his tongue round the mugs sides he imagined travellers who had finished their water and on whom the sun had blazed every joint of his body was alive with pain he waited to be fed huddled by the fire under which the bread cooked and felt the cold settling on him chapter seven the heat drained life energy from caleb the sun was not yet high but still scorched him rashid made no allowance for weakness offered no encouragement no reassurance but he had slowed the pace even ghaffur had lost the cheerfulness and stayed close to his father the camels trudged on but the spring in their stride was gone tommy preferred to walk in a camels shadow rather than ride and be unprotected from the sun an hour back they had passed a little square of baked black sand where earlier travellers had made a fire but there was no trail of hoofprints or footmarks no sign of when they had been there a week or a year before caleb retched and dizziness forced him to cling to the straps holding the boxes on to the camels side he thought he would fall he was the backmarker if he fell would any of them know would they walk on and not realize he had fallen they did not look back the camels would not have cried out if he had fallen two more hours at least before the stop for the dhuhr prayers each step was harder each stride fractionally shorter the sun rising towered over him abruptly he was lifted the sand was caked round his eyes hard like concrete from the tears but he saw it away to his left level with him was a patch of green living luscious wet green confronted him it seemed to call to caleb if he let go of the strap started out over the sand went to the left of the struggling column kept going then the green and the coolness of it would be closer he heard the ripple of water falling and smelt it and he saw the waving of branches heavy and bowed by leaves it was not afghanistan in his mind he saw jumping dancing pictures he clutched the strap and his head rolled the green of a park and the shrieks of kids kicking a ball a fountain of old stone where the water spiralled up then fell back into a pool filled with the debris of potatocrisp packets and caleb gripped the plastic bracelet held it so tightly that his fingers hurt with the pressure against its edges as he squeezed his bracelet he closed his eyes and the sands crust pricked them he shut it out there had been a green grass park where the kids played football in the rain there had been a fountain to an old queen on whose head and crown the pigeons crapped and the water from the fountain came down on a filthy pool he obliterated it only when the memory of the park and the fountain were gone did caleb loosen his hold on the bracelet and open his eyes he walked on the mirage was broken the delirium was beaten the memory was dead he forced his stride forward faster and longer they would have returned for him if he had fallen they were there because of him because of his importance the column stretched ahead and he followed he thought he had glimpsed his weakness and that sight hurt him im sorry maam but i cant admit you the bar was across the entrance and the man stood in front of it he looked as though his mind was made up beth leaned through the open window of her vehicle and gave him a sweet smile the one that usually opened doors or gates raised bars its only a package that i promised to bring round for lizzyjo the man stood in front of the bar his arms folded across his chest she could see the bulge under his waistcoat the small whitepainted aircraft had glided along the runway an hour earlier then lifted off it had climbed slowly and had headed out over the rub al khali the heat was coming up and she had lost it over the dunes in the haze the man said with studied and insincere politeness then ill see she gets it maam she persisted itll only take a minute id be grateful if youd tell her im here no can do maam but rest assured shell get it the package he came to her window and reached out a hand she had wanted damn sure to look around the site hear about it the bar was not about to be raised the woman lizzyjo was not about to be called from whatever work she did the man was not going to shift the combination of the barbed wire the compound at the end of the runway the aircraft that flew without pilots and the bulge under the mans arm all tickled her imagination ok to hell with it she snatched up the plastic bag and thrust it through the window he took it nodded with courtesy and turned his back on her as if she was so unimportant in the order of his day that hed already forgotten her he was back down on his chair and the way he sat chair tilted back the bulge was unmistakable by his feet was a sports bag that she thought was long enough to hold a rifle with a folded stock she gunned the engine made the sharpest of fast threepoint turns she scraped up a dirtcloud with the tyres in her wing mirror she saw the cloud cloak him she paused before pulling away he emerged from the cloud on his chair and he didnt wipe his face or curse her he merely ignored her she drove off back in her bungalow she started to pack what she would need from the bedroom standing on tiptoe at the window she could just make out the distant compound the irritation had grown she should have been focused totally on the trip she was embarking on everything else should have been cleared from her mind if the bedouin traveller had spoken the truth had recognized the stones and the glass had given her the correct direction and landmarks she would be walking the next day on an ejecta field where no man or woman had ever set foot before she had a checklist of clothing and equipment that should guarantee her survival if the bedouins description of the scale of what he had found was correct if the single stone and the piece of black glass he had brought her were samples of a greater scattered mass then the paper the deputy governor had commissioned her to write would make her a scientist of proven worth beth could of course have gone out into the sands with an escort drivers a cook servants to pitch her tent and guards but an escort would have killed the exhilaration of the solitude too many times beth broke away from her checklist dropped the sheet of paper on the bed returned to the window stretched up and peered at the vague shapes of the distant tent tops and the sun beat down on her bungalows little patio beyond the window and on the roof of her land rover and no wind rustled the palm trees fronds camp delta guantanamo bay when the prisoner was halfway down the corridor caleb recognized him it was six days since they had been taken out of the cages at xray shackled and blindfolded had been pushed on to buses and driven to the new camp they had been led down new corridors and had smelt the new concrete and new wire and they were closer to the sea when the chains were off and the blindfold caleb had studied the new cage under the high grille window through which the sea wind blew there was a basin with running water and beside it a squatting lavatory with a tap for flushing there was nothing temporary here they were out of the converted cargo containers and these blocks had been built to last he knew the man he had seen the emir general only once surrounded by his bodyguards the emir general had visited the second training camp to watch the recruits go through the assatdt course with live firing this man with a lean hungered body and eyes that never rested had been on the left side of the emir general he had seen the man again a week after the bombing had started caleb and others of the brigade had been manning a checkpoint and a convoy of pickups had come through the side rear windozvs of the third pickup had been curtained but the convoy had stopped and the chechen had climbed inside it the bodyguard had stood at the back and a machinegun was mounted on the cab roof they had exchanged remarks caleb and the bodyguard nothing talk then the chechen had left the pickup and the convoy had gone on the cage beside calebs was unlocked there were two more guards than usually escorted a prisoner the bodyguard was pitched inside at xray they were moved every fourteen days and put into cages where there were strangers on each side of them caleb understood they did not allow relationships to build the guards came in after him and two held batons threateningly as the prisoners chains were taken off they seemed to expect him to fight seemed to want him to the man gave them no excuse they left him caleb thought they went reluctantly cheated he sensed this was a prisoner of status the guards now came down the corridor every two minutes before the bodyguards arrival it had been every ten or twelve but everything about them was predictable caleb sat against his wall and the bodyguard lay on his bed both in silence and ignoring each other until prayer time the guards did not come down the corridors in prayer times did not spy on them when the call came on deltas new loudspeakers the bodyguard knelt and faced the direction ivhere they were told the holy city was his shirtsleeve pressed against the wire caleb came close they were both kneeling their words were softspoken but were not the words of the holy book where have you come from the bodyguards head did not turn from what they call the cooler the isolation cell i speak to a brother encourage him then i go back to the cooler in a few days they take me from the cooler and put me in another cage i speak more encouragement then i go back to the cooler if i stay in one cage i may damage the chance of a brother the chance of what of freedom they know my identity i am a prize for them wlw are you i was at the training camp i saw you i saiv you also at a roadcheck we had outside kabul we talked with the rocketlauncher at the block on the assault course at the camp each time you were spoken of what do they know of you i am a taxidriver who can denounce you caleb murmured all the men i was with and the chechen were killed when i was taken by the americans when i am interrogated i tell them that i alone survived i am a taxidriver i do not believe they know anything else of me and you are strong t try to be caleb had to strain to hear the bodyguard make a promise for me what do i promise if you are ever freed you never forget you remember your brothers you remember the martyrs you remember the evils of the crusaders i promise i will never forget will always remember there was a great calm about the man he was thin without a dominating stature and his face was unremarkable but his eyes burned and you zvill fight whatever the barriers put in front of you you will cross them you zvill walk through fire you will fight the prayers ended the guards tramped down the corridor the bodyguard did not speak again neither did caleb and they sat as far apart as the cage confines allowed when food was brought when the mosquitoes buzzed close to the ceiling lights when the bodyguards cage door was opened he lashed out with his fool and caught the knee of the guard carrying his tray from the trolley spilling the food more guards came twice he was cudgelled with a baton and he was blindfolded then dragged away caleb felt the new strength he was no longer frightened he was toughened hardened by the encounter he zvas a taxidriver but he had given his promise it broke quickly without warning silence then raised gasping and exhausted voices caleb scraped the crust of sand from his eyes the saudi fahd high on his saddle lashed his foot at tommys shoulder toppling him when tommy stood again fahd worked the camel round so that he could return to kick again he aimed for tommys head but missed the effort almost made him fall from the saddle tommy had hold of his leg and was trying to drag him down but he lost the grip and sagged back a blade flashed tommy had the knife fahd watched it tommy edged closer the knife raised ready to strike the guide rashid came from behind tommy and with the speed of a snakes hit snatched at tommys knife arm held it then twisted it behind tommys back until the mans face grimaced in pain the knife was loosed as it fell tommy smashed back with his free arm and caught rashid on the upper cheek the arm was twisted tighter and tommy dropped to the sand rashid bent to pick up the knife took the reins of fahds camel and led it to the front of the column the march resumed the boy was beside caleb do you understand what should i understand the boys face creased as if in anguish he hit my father he struck my father because he hit my father he is dead nothing else is possible but your father walked away he did not kill him he will at his own choosing it was the worst insult to hit my father caleb asked the question heavily what did they fight over the boy said the one called the other a murderer of the faithful the other called the one a coward and a fool it is what they said and now the other is condemned caleb pushed the boy away gently but with tired firmness he thought death now trudged with them his anger blossomed where they travelled there was no beacon of hope life did not could not exist the sun burned and crushed them madness had made the argument impossible difficulties weighed them down and now they had the new burden of the argument and one of them was condemned he could have howled with his anger most days a wrapped baguette tuna and mayonnaise with a can of coke in his office passed for jed dietrichs lunch he took the chance of the midday break to write up the assessment of the morning interrogation increasingly fewer observations seemed relevant and to prepare for the afternoon session the secretary for defense had called the men he questioned hardcore welltrained terrorists the attorney general had said they were uniquely dangerous but neither the secretary nor the attorney sat in with jed there were six hundred inmates at delta and maybe a hundred of them were hardcore and dangerous and the bureau and the agency had care of them jed never saw them he binned the wrapping from his baguette drained the can wiped the crumbs off the table as the minute hand climbed to the hour the knock came on cue the prisoner was brought in jed doubted he was even a footsoldier god alone knew what questions he would find to put to the man the prisoner the file said came from a small town in the english midlands was of bengali ethnic origin was one of the five per cent for whom antidepressive medication was prescribed by the delta doctor had been studying arabic and the quran at a religious school up the road from peshawar and had gone into the net had been handed over by the pakistani intelligence people who probably felt they needed to show willing and make up a quota number if jed the fisherman had pulled this one out of a wisconsin lake hed not have bothered with a photograph or the scales would have chucked him straight back he had never been to england had no knowledge of the midlands jed was aware of a growing swell of opinion outside the states that demanded either for criminal charges to be laid against prisoners or for them to be freed he was as aware that the courts back home had claimed no jurisdiction over camp delta it was not his business he had no opinion had he gone out of his room for lunch and discussed it with enlisted men he would have found total indifference the agency and bureau men wanted every last one of the prisoners locked up in perpetuity the red cross people had they ever owned up to their true feelings would have condemned delta would have criticized the concept of the camp but he didnt go out to lunch none of the british ones had been brought to jeds room before with a british prisoner at least there was no requirement for an interpreter translators destroyed the chance of an interrogator displaying his skills the man shuffled through the door well not a man more of a boy the file said he was twentythree years old he would have been twenty when he was captured would have had his twentyfirst birthday inside a guantanamo cage jed thought of him as a boy the chains were taken off and the guards stood back the man sat down he put his hands on the table top it was orders that a prisoners hands must be visible at all times when he was unshackled the hands shook jed reckoned they would have shaken worse if it had not been for the antidepressants god was this guy categorized as an unlawful combatant the real enemy he went through what had been asked of the man in previous interrogations why had he gone to pakistan whom had he met in pakistan what had he been taught in pakistan who had funded his studies in pakistan had he ever received military training had he gone into afghanistan at any time the answers were the same word for word as they had been at every interrogation he had the transcripts in front of him and the pages were signed by the interrogators sometimes jed let the answers run sometimes he interrupted and his tone was savage sometimes he smiled and softened his voice as he put the question sometimes he doubled back as the boy was denying ever having been in afghanistan he returned to the funding of the studies jed never caught him out no discrepancies in the story but far down in his mind a thought was developing he couldnt place where it came from whom had he met in pakistan had he ever received military training he felt the stab of recognition jed paused he collected his thoughts they had been chaff a jumble most of his concentration had been on the questions hed asked a little of it had been on his family and on the week gone by he cut away the chaff he sat for a full minute in silence he watched the fingers writhing and the breath come in little pants and let his instinct rule jeds voice was gentle in english friend do you speak pashto the faces of the two guards were impassive he had used the word friend the guards would talk about that afterwards guards hated the prisoners guards knew that any fraternization with prisoners was forbidden would lead to a flight out without their boots touching the tarmac guards knew that a brigadier general camp deltas commander had been summarily fired and that defense sources had claimed he was too soft with the regime hed ordered in delta signs printed by the icrc told detainees their rights and had been posted with the authorization of the brigadier general when the brigadier general had visited prisoners cages he had greeted them in arabic peace be with you hed been sacked but an interrogator had the freedom to call a prisoner friend the man across the table the friend nodded in english because jed didnt speak that language would that be good pashto or only a little pashto i can speak in urdu no no jed leaned forward do you have pashto some a bit there were afghan people in the college i jed used his hand to gesture that the answer was sufficient he used his desk telephone to call the central office he requested the immediate presence of a pashto interpreter there was doubt as to whether one was available he did not raise his voice but it carried enough menace to the clerk he dropped the request replaced it with requirement a pashto interpreter to his room immediately not tomorrow not in half an hour in a drawer on his side of the table the taperecorder turned and microphones were built into the table on his side and on the prisoners he opened the drawer and stopped the tape he waited the quiet clung in the room the man opposite sat bolt upright and still except for the motion of his hands jed wrote in a fast longhand scrawl answers he remembered the answers were not verbatim but as he recalled them ten minutes later when the interpreter came into the room he passed him the two pages now thickly covered with his handwriting he asked the interpreter to translate them on paper into pashto again there was silence as the interpreter crouched at the table and wrote down the translation he could not be sure where this would lead him when the translation was complete the pages in pashto were laid in front of the prisoner ard jed switched on the taperecorder the prisoner was asked to read aloud his host had put bart at the end of the line they had been down to the paddock to inspect the first races runners then had climbed back to the stand they made a party of eight and they waited for the start of the five thirtyfive at riyadh the banker did the book no tote or william hill or oncourse bookmaker the banker wrote down their little bets ten riyals or twenty riyals were the flutters no money would change hands in the stand no winnings or losses would be paid over in public but rewards and debts would be settled at dinner at the defenceprocurement mans villa most of the row of seats in front of bart was empty and the row behind him only sparsely filled not like the old days before the war in iraq then the whole stand would have heaved with expatriates terrorism threat and personal security were the catchphrases of the day only the diehards remained he did not own binoculars and struggled when he looked down the course to the start to see the quartered shirt and cap that he was backing and he listened to the talk in the row stretching away from him here at least indiscretion was possible what i say is the place is cracking up i think its terminal take the servants theres a new impertinence id call it dumb insolence more to the point is saudization is that a real word you know what i mean theyre stuffing lazy incompetents into jobs they cant handle i never go out at night not now not even with a driver this used to be the safest city on earth not any more dreadful what happened to young garnett such a sweet girl that melanie beautiful children its all become so dishonest corrupt the ethos is almost criminal here now i they were off away in the distance the small shapes of the horses and the smaller ones of the jockeys bart could not make out his horse and he didnt bloody care he had not been invited because his host particularly liked him one day he might be useful for a latenight emergency callout it all came back to ann he wondered where she was whether she was still shagging the owner of the saab franchise showroom how the kids were ann demanded private schools two holidays a year that werent package the debts had mounted unopened envelopes carrying final demands had littered the torquay house and the mortgage payments were in arrears by yes he could remember the date clear as bloody crystal shed started the taunting that he hadnt the balls to stand up to the practice partners and demand they offloaded private patients on to him hed faced ruin and hed faced her goading then bart had responded in april that year he had come to the solution to the ills josh a right little weasel had been in the consulting room and had sown the seed josh was an nhs patient there to have his face patched up after a beating josh was a dealer josh left an address in the bedsit land at the wrong end of the town josh had a roll of banknotes in his hip pocket a fat wad josh paid up on the nail cash on delivery and bart had delivered morphine alkaloid tablets were the currency for which josh paid cash and heroin and cocaine any patient on barts books who was terminally ill or any patient with chronic pain from a back injury could be prescribed the morphine tablets and always from the spring of he prescribed big the bathroom cabinets of his patients bulged with the bottles of morphine tablets and when there was a death or when a backs pain was relieved he collected what was left and took it away josh had the leftover tablets and the cash from the roll of notes in joshs hip pocket began by the late summer of to dent the piles of unpaid bills so simple heroin and cocaine were used to help quietly those on their way when life had little more than a fortnight to run relatives were grateful for the release of their loved one from suffering bart called it the bromptons mixture a gin or sherry cocktail with the addition of liquid heroin or powdered cocaine when he signed the death certificate and before the undertakers called bart cleared the unused excess the partnership with the little weasel the bastard josh might have lasted for ever not for a mere eighteen months until the catastrophe there was no betting slip to tear up at the races in riyadh his prediction had been correct his horse was last over the line again the conversation down the line of seats clamoured as if the race had been a minor diversion from the main business of gossip and complaint i really dont know whether we should all get out cut and run but what i reckon back home no one wants to employ a banker of my age that al qaeda its a cancer and iraqs taken the eye off the main hall were all targets now thats what i feel if the kingdom collapses were in deep trouble about as deep as you can get we keep bags packed were all ready to go but if it happened suddenly without warning how would we get to the airport whod protect us and can you imagine pitching up at heathrow with just a suitcase each thats assuming we got to the airport its all so unfair what do you think bart bart im speaking to you the bankers wife tugged his arm peered into his face he jerked his mind away from josh the tablets the cocktail and ann isnt it more dangerous crossing the road in riyadh is that all youve to say about the security situation he was emboldened if you want my opinion a qaedas power is overstated have you plans for a quick bolt bart for emphasis bart smacked a closed fist into the other palm no i have not it was a lie of course he had a permanently packed case whether he would ever use it was another matter would eddie bloody wroughton the marionette tweaker ever permit its use he had nowhere to go without eddie bloody wroughtons sanction i have no plans to run al qaedas threat is probably minimal a few fanatics in the desert or up in the mountains chewing dates suffering from amoebic dysentery i dont rate them no shocked into silence the other guests in the row shuffled their feet and examined their racecards bart thought of nobody but himself himself and eddie wroughton the hosts wife chipped in well thats enough of that i think its time we went back down to the paddock the dung was dried desiccated the line drawn on the map had served eddie wroughton well at each village close to the pencil line they had stopped and wroughton had stayed in the vehicle forcing the police officer to go among the mudbrick homes the routine had led them to the last village then on to the single isolated building there had been signs there of recent use and the fire that had been lit hed photographed the interior then the new bolt and the new lock on the inside of the door no shepherd or goatherd would have sealed a window so thoroughly then lit a fire inside or would have used a new lock and a new bolt on a shed door they had gone on following the pencil line on the map using ever rougher tracks the toe of his brogue brushed the top of a dung stool which fell away as powdery dust but he worked with the toe until he had exposed the stools underside where there was still dampness a week a little more perhaps but not a month from the dung he decided that more than half a dozen fewer than a dozen camels had been there had waited had defecated near to the riverbed there were tyremarks but on the dirt track wroughton could not have said whether they were a week a month or half a year old away to the right there was a cluster of buildings from which cooking smoke spiralled and there were irrigated fields that community would be centred on a well the police officer had been there and had come back with his head down as if he felt ashamed to report back that his questions had met a wall of silence if he was given time if wroughton had allowed the police officer the time to take two of the older men away from the village and drive them to the cells at the station back down the road the questions would still have gone unanswered so he did not permit it the wall of silence denied that strangers had been there within the last several days tribesmen and farmers his experience of the hardship of their lives told him did not respond to inflicted pain slowly taking his time wroughton gazed around him his eyes were shaded by his dark glasses and he could look out over the ground from which the sun reflected when he was satisfied with what he had drunk in seen nothing that interested him he turned and began again he looked for the mistakes that men made a discarded wrapper a groundout cigarette filter tip men who thought their precautions were total always made one mistake most of wroughtons life was dictated by paper paper accumulated on his desk was spewed out by cypher machines and his computer from the paper mountain came clues to the identity and relevance of the prey he hunted but only rarely he turned again stared up at the high ground on the right side of the riverbed and saw the movement horns moved then ears a head and then the goat was gone from a ledge above the right side of the riverbed wroughton looked hard at the ledge and saw that it reached precariously a patch of green and yellow grass and that there were more goals according to his father grandfather and greatuncle the best work of an intelligence officer was in closequarters observation they might not have thought him suitable to follow them not thought he could hack it as a career but he had remembered where there were goats there would be a boy he had left the villagers to the police officer but this was for himself he scrambled up the loose stone he clung to the branches of little sprouting bushes that grew from rock crannies his best brogues were scraped his linen suit was dustsmeared and his purewhite shirt was sweatsoaked but he reached the ledge never looking down he edged along the rock wall to where a small plateau opened out on it extraordinarily there was grass perhaps a tiny spring dribbled water from the upper rocks there were goats and a boy was sitting on the grass among their excrement he caught his breath the occasions when excitement had gripped him were rare enough for him to count on the fingers of one hand the boy watched him as he composed himself he spoke in arabic with the gentleness he would have used to his friend juan gonsalves children twenty minutes later eddie wroughton left the plateau came back along the ledge then started the descent to the riverbed to break his fall he snatched at the little bushes slid on his backside in an avalanche of dust and stones those who had bought camels from a farmer had not looked up and spied a goat high above them his suit jacket was torn at the elbows his trousers at the knees and seat it mattered nothing the boy had seen the men and their voices had carried faintly to him they had been strangers the camels had waited in the riverbed and had dropped their dung while an argument had raged over the price of the three more camels needed to move boxes six boxes ten of the twenty minutes with the boy were taken with his questioning so softly done over the size shape and colour of the boxes five of the twenty minutes concerned the detail of the features and physique of the young man who had closed the negotiations unrecognizable to those who knew him unwashed and his clothes not changed eddie wroughton boarded the last flight of the day out of muscat at the back of a nearempty aircraft he thought of the centuriesold trail that had been the route of the frankincense traders half a millennium before his pencil had traced a line beyond the watercourse over the hills into the empty quarter nine camelsa guide and his son four men and six crates of weapons were now on the trail he had much to be cheerful about but pride of place went to the boys description of a young man unlike any arab he had seen before on the screen the image of the land rover flashed for a moment and was gone then the camera was tracking over sand again lizzyjo didnt point out the land rover painted blue with two vivid green stripes running diagonally up its sides and over its roof marty was doing a banking left turn she did not want to disturb him while he made the manoeuvres to bring first lady on to the lineup for landing shed been in the land rover been driven from the shop to the club in it where shed been lectured about meteorites lizzyjo grimaced marty was hunched over his stick and his eyes magnified by the thickness of his lenses squinted in concentration the former air force pilots for whom shed done sensor work in her first days with the agency had flown the newer predator mqls like theyd have driven cars on a quiet country road upstate but marty always had the look on him that it was life or death he made a good landing she always clapped when he brought first lady or carnival girl down it was her routine had been since the first time theyd flown together out of bagram the sound of her clapping reverberated in the ground control station he blushed as he had the first time she reached over and squeezed his upper shoulder as if she could loosen the tensed muscles he taxied her back he cut the pusher engine they had flown first lady for eight hours covering some six hundred nautical miles the camera had photographed sand and more sand and nothing but sand flat sand steep sand and sloping sand on the workbench between them was the big map with the squares on it and she put a chinagraph cross over two more there were six squares now with crosses on them and ninetyfour without the big man from the embassy had talked of thousands of flying map boxes but that was because he did not understand the predators capability lizzyjo had divided the desert into a hundred squares her eyes ached from gazing at the screen she stood and arched her back she opened the trailer door the heat blasted into the airconditioned interior it blanketed her seemed to suck the life from her a plastic bag lay roasted on the step none of the ground crew was permitted entry to the trailer she looked inside then let out a little whoop of gratitude and thought of the land rover the camera had seen she murmured her thanks then ran for the toilet five minutes later she wandered back towards the trailer she passed the awning where george and his team already had the engine cowling off first lady he called to her how did she go good no thrust problem marty was on the top step at the trailer door and answered for her no problem she was sweet eight hours today twelve or thirteen tomorrow dont reckon lizzyjo and i can take more than that lizzyjo said yes we can do twelve or thirteen tomorrow then maybe take carnival girl up the day after and george shook his head decisively not tomorrow not thirteen hours or one the forecasts a fucker youre not going anywhere tomorrow better believe it nowhere she and marty went to the awning the forecast printout was given to them the orders were strict about as strict as they could get a predator should not be hazarded in extreme weather conditions unless for vital operational necessity there was no argument she was perplexed she thought of the land rover picked up by the camera as it headed away from the shaybah compound and into the emptiness she held the package of tampons under her arm and murmured to herself if the forecast was that bad whyd you think shed be driving off into that nowhere the camel roared and swung its neck caleb was behind tommy who was against the camels flank as if clinging to its bodys shadow the camels movement threw tommy clear and water spilled from his mouth more water cascaded on to the flank of the camel its great tongue flailed to catch the drops ghaffur shrieked for his father rashid ran back the camel snorted and tommy crouched down the truth came to caleb the iraqi had not walked beside the camel for its shade he was there because his head was against a goatskin of water they were all fighting exhaustion all their heads were down their feet and the camels plodded they knew nothing of the water being stolen but the camel had smelt it perhaps as tommy sucked at the neck of the skin holding the water a little had dribbled from his mouth on to the camels flank for days the animal had not drunk was slowly using up its reserves from the well at the start of the sands water clear clean crystals of it fell to the sand enough for one cup or two then for three cups and more the camels neck was arched round as its tongue tried in desperation to reach the drops rashid plugged the skins neck then retied the loosened thong round it he said nothing but his gaze on the iraqi confirmed that tommy was condemned caleb thought at least two days water had been lost from the slack skin the sight of it had worsened the dryness in his throat at the night stop the iraqi sat away from them only the boy went to him with food uncooked bread because there were no roots for a fire and the measured cup of water but fahd and hosni sat with their backs to him as the darkness fell caleb crawled away from the others went to tommy and sat beside him his voice croaked you were called a murderer of the faithful who did you kill there was defiance almost pride i was the hangman at the abu ghraib gaol the gallows were mine i could hang three men at a time or three women first i was the assistant then i was the hangman then i was the supervisor i hanged the principals of the shia who rebelled in and i hanged the agents of america in the north in i hanged men or women who were spies who plotted against the regime who told jokes that mocked the president i could hang them so that death was instant or hang them so that death was slow it depended on the order i was given there was always a note on the execution order that said how it was to be the scaffold was my place it was where i worked in the morning i would dress in a clean uniform always clean and pressed and my driver would take me to the prison some days i was idle some days i was busy at the end of each day i went home to my wife and my children the voice softened a little of its guttural quality left it after i had hanged the kurds who followed the cias instructions in i left the abu ghraib the prison in mosul and the prison in basra and i was given a new posting i became a security officer for the republican guards nebuchadnezzar division i gave up my ropes my pinions and my hoods left them to the men i had trained as my assistants in the division i was the officer who said nothing and heard everything if there was doubt about a mans loyalty i sent him to those men who had been my assistants then came the war then came tommy franks then came the disaster i fled i took my wife and my children and drove them by back tracks to the syrian border i was one of the first to go later the route was closed now my wife lives in a tworoomed apartment at aleppo and my children and they have citizenship and they will never see me or talk of me again if i had stayed in iraq if the shia or the kurds or the families of officers and guards in the nebuchadnezzar division had caught me i would have been hanged from a lamppost or from a tree the voice quavered dont have the arrogance to judge me i looked into the eyes of men put the hood on them the rope worked the lever could you can you i dont know at what time or in what place you will look into a mans eyes or a womans or a childs and pull a lever it is why you are chosen it is why you walk with us in this godfuck place in secrecy so that your safety is preserved if you judge me then you must judge yourself i will go back to iraq and kill americans a few you will look into hundreds of eyes perhaps thousands of eyes the chosen man the voice dropped the defiance and pride had fled thank you for sitting with me chapter eight it hissed on to them swept in with a sudden force that devastated them the storm burst over the dune wall beyond the caravans pitched camp in the dawns halflight the wind surged over the rim the warning of its coming was brief a few seconds then it hit them caleb was outside his tent had slept only fitfully was stretching and massaging his leg and shoulder muscles facing the first peep of the rising sun when he heard the whistle of sound as if a tyres valve was released he turned the cloud of sand careered over the dune and buffeted him he rocked could not stand sank to his knees for a moment he stared at the cloud that followed in the winds wake then the grains were in his mouth and nose and pierced open his eyes if he had not already been down on his knees he would have been felled by the wind the noise deafened him the sand scraped the skin on his upper cheeks and round his eyes his wrists and ankles and ripped at his robe it came in waves that seemed to belt the breath out of him caleb twisted away from it and snatched at the loose sand to prevent himself being carried away by the gale a tent went past him chased by bedding he heard the screaming of the saudi the camels hobbled struggled to escape the winds force but could not another tent followed the first its canopy was caught and it floated then sank raced over the sands surface was lifted again and ripped after the bedding went the cooking pot and plates the mugs from which they drank water and clothing a rucksack ran with the wind through slitted eyes caleb watched the destruction of the overnight camp as the pieces billowed away from him tommy howled abuse at rashid you are a fool an idiot did you not know it was coming were you not paid to know the camels tried to flee the gale and the thickening cloud now blotting out the sun caleb heard their shrill bellowing they could not run their hobble ropes held them they skipped fell rolled and their long legs thrashed before they could stand again watching them caleb realized the scale of the catastrophe that had hit the caravan while the others had still slept rashid and ghaffur had begun loading the camels some had the crates already fastened to their backs others had the water bags and food sacks roped to their flanks caleb forced himself up was tossed forward and tumbled then crawled towards the two shadowed figures in front of him going in wavering strides after the camels without the water they were lost bones in the sand without the camels they were lost bent double rashid and ghaffur were in pursuit of the camels on his hands and knees caleb followed them sometimes the cloud of whipped sand was too dense for him to see them sometimes he could see them clearly father and his son staggering after the camels that carried the water bags the camels that carried the crates were ignored water was the lifeblood of travellers in the desert whenever he stood thrust himself up caleb was immediately tossed down on to his face and ate the sand grains he called out to them that he was coming following but the distance between them and him widened the wind came with a new force stronger hitting harder its cry blasted at his ears and the grains scoured his body he did not know for how long he crawled he could no longer see rashid and ghaffur or the scattered camels the darkness spread over him the only light in his mind was that of the whitened bones of a camels ribcage it was gone as suddenly as it had come his eyes were closed the sand was loose under his hands and knees his robe fell back over his buttocks and thighs the sun as harsh as on any day before beat on his face and eyelids caleb wiped the sand from his eyes he stood and was not felled by the wind the sun blazed at him the cloud was in the far distance stonefaced eyes glinting in anger rashid came towards him leading three camels with two more following away to the guides right the boy brought more two water bags deflated and empty lay in calebs path he saw ghaffur bend and pick up another heard the triumphant cry that signalled that the binding on the neck had held caleb called after rashid how much have we lost there was a snarl in the reply pitched over the guides shoulder too much we have lost too much the storm hovered at the horizon caleb found a crate lying nearly buried he scraped the sand from around it snatched up the fastening rope and dragged it after the guide his son and the camels wretchedly at the campsite they searched for what could be retrieved they had lost water a quarter of what had remained and food that would have lasted four days one camel had broken a leg caleb had turned away as rashids knife had flashed and ghaffur had held the long hair above the beasts throat they had lost a day of the march when caleb found hosni the egyptian was on his stomach his eyes pale and watering the lower part of his body was buried in sand and his shoulders shook with a neverceasing convulsion all that morning as the suns heat grew caleb helped the guide and his son search for the remnants from the campsite but they found no more filled bags of water when the sun was high caleb was beside the boy is it bad my father says there are too many men for too little water the boy said simply george khoo took charge the accommodation tents were streaming from the barbed wire of their inner perimeter fence the clothes and bedding had gone further and were held by the barbs on the fencing at the extreme end of the runway he had fretted all night because of the forecast every hour on the hour his pocket alarm had bleeped on the flooring beside his camp bed hed not undressed had not even shed his boots his only concession to the night had been to leave the laces loose for five minutes in each hour he had paced restlessly round the tethered awnings that sheltered first lady and carnival girl then had gone back to his bed hed lain on his back stared at the tent ceiling and waited for the bleep to sound again hed been lucky the first strike of the storm had been while he was hunched on his camp bed gathering the strength to slide off and go to make the inspection tour it had come in a numbing shockwave with a suddenness that would have paralysed another man into indecision on his orders barked against the wind and split with expletives the twin sets of wings had been taken off first lady and carnival girl they had been dumped without ceremony then the awnings had been dropped to hang loose on the fuselages of the two aircraft ropes had been hurled over the awnings each man and lizzyjo had been given an instruction shouted at a volume and passion that frightened them more than the storm some hung on to the ropes others with lizzyjo clung to more ropes that straddled the roof of the ground control shed and the trailer with the satellite dish while their possessions few enough of them raced to be snagged on the perimeter wire they held the ropes against the wind george khoo heard them cry out yell swear and he ignored their fear he thought it was like combat but there was no enemy no hostile incoming one on the same rope as lizzyjo pumped blood a chair had struck the guy across the forehead close to the left eye he would have been knocked halfunconscious but his grip never wavered on the rope neither did lizzyjos nor the others george had not known before a storm of this ferocity nothing like it in chicago the windy city where hed been reared or at nellis where hed been trained or at bagram he moved best as he could among them and each time he came back past them he blasphemed worse ridiculed their efforts and cursed harder he was near as made no difference double the age of the pilot marty and a full fifteen years senior to lizzyjo and he felt for each of them as if they were his kids his own kids were back in chicago with their ma and their mas ma without george khoos bullying aggression they would not have come through would not have held on to the ropes till the palms of their hands were rubbed raw and bleeding because he thought of marty and lizzyjo as if they were his kids he suffered and cried for them and cheered with them if first lady had turned over had gone in a rolling spiral towards the perimeter crushing the realtime cameras and the infrared sensors then goodbye damn double fast to the mission george khoo knew responsibility for failure was never dumped fairly by the agency failure was failure no excuse permitted failure had a smell that made a mans gut turn failure stank was cruel if the aircraft went the shit would rain down buckets of it on marty the pilot and on lizzyjo the sensor operator and it went on by the wind dropped and the sand haze cleared if he was weak they were all weak he snapped orders guys to go get the tents and awnings back off the perimeter wire guys to go get the wings fitted back in place on first lady and carnival girl guys marty and lizzyjo to go get the electronics tested in ground control and the satellite link guys to get some breakfast made guys to get medical treatment readied guys to go get he felt so damn tired and so damn old and he hadnt the time to think hed done well and he told the armourer to go get the hellfire missiles checked he looked across to where the tents had been and saw marty who seemed to probe in what debris was left there and he saw him lift up the picture that was his pride and joy even at that distance george could see that the glass small miracles was intact and a big smile creased the kids face george khoos gruff cruelty melted lizzyjo stood apart from the team clustered inside and outside the ground control he saw her wipe her hands on her trousers just pyjama trousers that shed slept in she was gazing out over the desert and her eyeline seemed to follow the disappearing tail of the storm there was new blood on the trousers where her hands had wiped god they were good kids all of them he stood behind her lizzyjo said distracted hey you know theres a girl out there a really nice girl i needed some tampons and she sussed some out for me she drove out there and i never saw her come back before i turned in shes out there in that storm no way shed have escaped it sorry george i know its not your problem i know but listen shes all alone it had been like the whiteout blizzards shed known in scotland and norway she sat on the sand the small of her back against the top of the near front wheel casing of the land rover no tears of course not beth jenkins could rage at herself and she could be contemplative about the future but she would not weep she had precious little to sustain her and tears would have eroded what little was left the sand on the near side was banked to the wheel casings on the drivers side it was higher it was madness to have gone out into the desert without leaving a note in her bungalow giving detail and map coordinates of her route and destination she had no satellite phone and she had no classes for three days and she was often away and it might be four days or five before she was missed and a week or more before a search was mounted in her rush to be away from the bungalow she had not done the most fundamental bloody obvious task of consulting the airfield control tower for the weather outlook she was marooned she had been driving on full headlights guided by her gps had been threading between the dunes and using saltbaked flats and was she reckoned within eight miles of the site of the ejecta field she had been told about the fourlitre plus engine had coped just with the ground terrain until the storm had hit when she was about to kill the headlights and use the natural light of the dawn god and it had hit the wind had seemed to shake the land rovers heavy frame and the sandclouds had overwhelmed the wipers shed had the sense to turn and manoeuvre the vehicles tail towards the oncoming storm about the only clever thing shed done she might have gone a hundred yards before the traction was lost the cab had filled with sand insinuated through closed doors and windows and the pedals were covered a minute or two after the wheels had started to spin going nowhere the engine had cut out she had sat in the cab until the storm had passed when it had gone beth had prised open her door had to put her shoulder to it and she had slid and stumbled round the land rover at the back the sand had banked high over the tail door she couldnt see the rear wheels at the front only the tops of the tyres were visible she had lifted the bonnet and seen the coating of sand over the engine parts she had then crawled into the back of the land rover and scrabbled through the film of sand to retrieve her shovel with the sun climbing and the temperature rising beth had dug at the sand round the forward wheels for two hours it had been a sisyphean labour for two hours with the temperature above forty degrees beth had dug away the sand from the near front wheel and each shovelful shed chucked away had been replaced immediately by more soft dry sand rolling into the cavity she had made the tyre was still hidden two hours had achieved nothing then shed drunk water shed loaded enough she reckoned for three days half of what shed loaded was now drunk and even if she had been able to clear the sand from round one wheel down to below the axle there would have been three more tyres needing to be exposed and even if she had been able to get all four tyres free of sand there was the engine which would need stripping down and cleaning she sat against the wheel casing and the sun was too high for the vehicles body to give off shade beth jenkins understood what would happen to her one distant day a driedout clothed body would be retrieved and shipped home a stone would be put over a grave bethany diana jenkins failure idiot life cut short through arrogance spinster she thought of boys and young men and love she had not known she had told herself often enough that her work was more important than searching for love plenty of time for love later now there was no more time she had never met the man she could love never would other young men introduced by her mother from guards regiments and city broking firms had faded from her side when shed enthused about the rocks she studied guards officers and city brokers werent big on granite volcanoes and meteorite glass their eyes glazed and they sloped off to hunt elsewhere she had been left too many times midsentence love had never been offered the sun baked on her she would drink the water what was left she would not hoard it she would not fight for life any more than patients in intensive care who knew nothing of the drugs in their bloodstream and the tubes in their veins beth had her arms tight across her chest and the sun seemed to suck the moisture from her body the sweat seeped and she hugged herself as if that might give her an image of love another lunchtime and the programme of lectures continued michael lovejoys packet of sandwiches bought from the midmorning trolley awaited him on his desk his newspaper crossword was frustratingly held up by the complications of five down groucho on ike three four six seven and seven letters and not that he would have shown it the lecturer interested him diverted him from the clues they had a russian from counterintelligence flown in from moscow young and bright with a flawless command of spoken english and he came with enough good baggage to make waiting for the prawn and coleslaw worthwhile the kernel of what i want to say is that we can too easily be blinkered when we seek out the snake with the intention of decapitating it we look too easily at the obvious and then we are surprised when the television news in the morning confronts us with the newest atrocity and do not ever forget that we bleed in our cities from the same atrocities as you do too readily you ladies and gentlemen and we in moscow and st petersburg and volgograd attempt to target the muslim that we can classify as a fanatic and the bombs continue to kill and maim our innocents take my advice when you stand and look for the muslims whom you believe carry the holy book in one hand and an explosives charge in the other stop consider then turn a hundred and eighty degrees face the other way consider what do you now see four seats down from lovejoy was the military historian retired from the army and from a strategic studies thinktank now doing time with a branch on surveillance a mildlooking senior citizen in a checked sports jacket was unnoticeable in a public library or on a crowded train what do you see at first you see nobody no muslim no fist clutching a holy book no finger on an electrical circuit switch are you looking in the right place you are confused you do not wish to take my advice but you hesitate men appear but not the right men they are people like yourselves and like myself you see white faces you see caucasians and anglosaxons not robes and beards but suits and cleanshaven cheeks let me take you back to an inexact analogy but that will point to the direction in which i travel i believe i have the names correct omar khan sharif and asif muhammad hanif whom you had never heard of before they crossed into israel through the most stringent border checks on the border with jordan journeyed across israel to the gaza strip left the strip and went to tel aviv for reconnaissance then put on the martyr warriors belts and attempted to kill jews in an irish bar what was most significant in this inexact analogy they used british passports they claimed the protection of her britannic majesty not egyptian passports or saudi or moroccan or algerian but british passports that is my starting point and that is where you will not look if you are blinkered i will take it further leaning across without apology lovejoy tapped the arm of the historian passed him the newspaper and rapped his pencil on the clue to five down khan and hanif were still muslims even if they did carry british passports believe in the unbelievable that is what i urge you what if the men recruited by osama bin laden and his lieutenants or the multitude of pilot organizations that swim with that shark were whiteskinned and had no links to the faith of islam where are we then they carry british or american french or german passports they dress like you and me they speak with our accent and they have access a young man well dressed and clearly recognizable as one of you one of us carries a shoulderbag containing a laptop why should he be denied entry to any crowded public building why should he be stopped when he goes down an escalator into a subway or underground station why should he be prevented from reaching the front row of a crowd that greets a prominent figure why should he be regarded with suspicion i hear ladies and gentlemen your silence i do not hear your answers men and women sat statue still but from the corner of his eye lovejoy saw the historian writing busily so what do we do lock everyone up who is too young to be in a care home he does not have to be a muslim does not have to be recruited in a mosque does not have to be asian all that is required of him by the shark is that he should hate dont ask him to debate the subject of hatred because he is unlikely to give you a coherent response somewhere in his psyche or his experience there will be a source of hatred he hates you and me and the society we serve he holds us in contempt he is the new danger a radioactive dirty bomb microbiological agents or chemicals in aerosol form may be built into the laptop he is real he walks among us his power over us is devastating how to stop him do i have the answer i regret i do not can he be stopped we have to believe it or we face disaster i am sorry if i detain you but i have only one more thing to say the newspaper was passed back my final thought is positive i ask whether this man one of us a mutation from our own culture suffused with bitterness from an actual or imagined wrong believes in the seventy virgins awaiting him in paradise is he a martyr does he plan to commit suicide or to survive we cannot know my own feeling is that he would wish to attack and live to watch the results of his revenge we have more chance of stopping a man who wishes to live i offer a trifle of comfort thank you for hearing me as the russian stepped back from the lectern lovejoy read the note scribbled in the newspapers margin it wasnt a groucho original he lifted from a senator kerr of oklahoma then as subdued and stifled applause rippled around him he noted the answer to five down the only living unknown soldier he shuddered how appropriate the unknown soldier who was one of us he went for his belated sandwich lunch one of us that would make him chew the prawns and coleslaw with thoughtful preoccupation caleb sat hunched on one of the boxes by midafternoon with the skies clear and the sun baking the sand the storm would have been a memory a nightmare but for its consequences the camels still traumatized stayed close together body to body as if fenced within a wire corral rashid and ghaffur had been on three separate expeditions away from the destroyed campsite to search for the remaining stores and possessions that had been scattered after they had returned from the third search caleb had expected that rashid would load the animals and order them to move he thought there were at least three hours of daylight left and perhaps they could move further during dusk and the early night the guide gave no explanations his sour face the thin hostile lips under his hooked nose seemed to forbid interrogation when they were small figures caleb heard a little whoop of delight and saw ghaffur hold up a metal mug hosni slept prone on the sand caleb heard fahds slithering approach over the loose sand the temperature would have been a hundred degrees and the wind was now minimal when caleb turned to face him he saw that the man shivered they were all older wiser frightened as the saudi was about to drop down beside him caleb stood come on we have work he said it brusquely an instruction that was not for discussion he saw the mans face fall yes we have work caleb rapped the response was shrill do you now tell me what i should do i am telling you caleb took fahds arm gripped it and led him to the heap of stores and bedding tenting water bags and sacks that had been retrieved by the guide and his son at first the saudi stood beside caleb arms crossed and idle as caleb crouched and started to sift separate and pack suddenly as calebs arm was outstretched reaching for the last of the plates and stacking them fahd reached out and snatched at his wrist his fingers fastened in a bony vice on the plastic identification tag you were at guantanamo i was the fingers stroked the photograph the printed name fawzi alateh and roamed over the identification numbers then they released you after nearly two years they released me why why did they free you because they believed me the saudi freed his wrist he stood above caleb and gazed down at him his shoulders and arms still shook and his lips wobbled with the shiver people more notable than me more intelligent than me have chosen you for a strike that will bring fire pestilence against the americans and the allies of the americans they have chosen you but it is still to be decided as to whether you are trusted hosni says you should be trusted because you were clever and deceived the americans at guantanamo tommy trusts nobody tommy says that the constant purpose of the americans is to put informers spies among us myself i do not know whether to trust you or not to trust you caleb said quietly whether you trust me or not you can help me pack what is here he pushed the pile of sandcovered bedding to fahds feet shake it fold it stack it should i trust you the mouth of the saudi puckered in anger you are the outsider i am not i have no home other than where the organization takes me i have no family other than the organization the organization cares for me and god cares for me god is can you not walk away i am hunted my picture is in the police stations of the kingdom if i am taken alive pain will be inflicted on me and with the pain will be drugs i pray to god if i am taken that i will be strong and will not betray my family at the end of the pain if i am taken there will be the executioner and the executioners sword i have a degree in mathematics i could have been a teacher but i worked as a gardener i was a gardener in the alhamra compound for americans i cut the grass and watered the flowers and i would be shouted at by the supervisor if i left a weed in the earth i did the work of yemenis and pakistanis because i believed in the organization and in god i did the work of a foreign labourer and i watched i was behind the wall and the guards i used the grasscutter the hose the trowel and the broom and i watched i counted the guards and remembered their weapons i saw where the important americans lived i worked late into the night cutting and watering weeding and sweeping and i watched when martyrs drove two vehicles into the alhamra compound last year they used the map that i had drawn for them they died they are in paradise but others lived and were taken they were tortured and they did not have the strength they betrayed the names of many i have been told my home was raided my parents were abused that is why i cannot leave the organization if i am taken my future is the sword i trust you fahd shook the sand grains from a sleepingbag then carefully rolled it then he lifted a blanket and flicked it out i am condemned and tommy and hosni we are all dead men what i regret i will never be able to make as great a strike as you the outsider who are blessed because you are blessed you are also condemned the sand flew in calebs face he blinked the guide and his son walked back towards them and each had again gathered up another armful of the campsites debris rashid gave them no praise for sorting through the heap when the camels were loaded and the sun finally dropping they moved caleb was the backmarker his face was set and sombre he had waved away the boy and walked alone in the last camels hoofmarks the patient swung her legs off the examination couch and smoothed her skirt the patients husband eased up from his chair from the basin where he washed his hands perfunctorily bart intoned the details of the only acceptable recipe for acute depression nerves and stress good old diazepam where would he be without diazepam up the bloody creek no paddle he could have told them to go home get on the big freedom bird at the airport head off for romford or ruislip or richmond but they wouldnt the expatriate community was down to the hard core since the bombs at the aljadawel alhamra and vinnel compounds had thinned out the foreign community those who stayed who could not face life in a london suburb where theyd struggle for work and be without servants swimmingpools and fatcat salaries were now prisoners inside the compounds their lives dependent on the alertness of the guards at the gates a few those who had been with him at the races pretended life was unchanged the majority cowered in the custody of their homes and were reliant on the diazepam he doled out it was all about money for them beside the basin the window gave him a good high view down the street the wind tore at the white robes of men on the pavement below and creased the black robes of women against their bodies a damn storm was up the trouble with storms was that they carried sand it would be all over his vehicle that was always the worst thing about storms coming up off the desert all about money bart knew about money the absence of it at six twentyfive in the morning theyd come two oafish uniforms a plainclothes constable with the weary look of a man close to retirement and a gimletfaced woman whod identified herself as a detective sergeant and who wore an unflattering black trouser suit at six twentyfive in the morning hed had a patrol car and a saloon in the driveway and every one of the bloody neighbours would have been parting the curtains lifting the nets and gawping ann knew nothing ann had hissed stagewhisper as theyd filed into the hall what have you done shed had her dressinggown wrapped tightly round her as if she was about to be raped ann only knew that there were new carpets in the hall holiday brochures on the diningroom table and school invoices in the office desk with many thanks for your prompt payment stamped on them done nothing hed murmured go in the kitchen and make a pot of tea hed led them into the lounge did he know a josh reakes yes he had a patient by that name did he know josh reakes was a dealer in class a narcotics no he did not would he be surprised to learn that josh reakes had named him dr samuel bartholomew as a principal supplier yes he would and it was a damned lie he had kept with the denials stuck with them he learned that josh reakes arrested the previous evening had named him as the source of the morphine alkaloid tablets liquid heroin and powdered cocaine that had been found when he was stripsearched deny deny deny his word against a contemptible little rats a baseless allegation that was poor thanks for his efforts on behalf of one more of torquays addict population they had a search warrant for the house and another for the surgery they went through the walnutveneer desk bank statements and incometax returns each time ann had come into the living room between feeding the kids and getting them ready for school shed looked like an ally of the police squinting at him with suspicion the best thing hed done was give her the housekeeping in joshs cash so the carpets holidays and school fees came out of the bank account and were laid against his salary then down to the surgery a full waiting room for him to tramp through with his escort into the records of the quantities of morphine alkaloid tablets liquid heroin and powdered cocaine hed prescribed and then hed realized they were trawling and had no decent idea of how to prove that the terminally ill whod been given bromptons mixture or the backache sufferers had left excess supplies for him to collect hed brazened it out the word of a professional man against the word of an addicted yob hed known he was on solid ground when the detective sergeant had snarled through her pasty little lips ill bloody get you bartholomew you are a fucking disgrace a doctor who is a mainstream supplier ill get you sent down see if i bloody dont theyd taken him down to the station hands on his arms like he was a criminal and hed dictated a statement of innocence and known they believed not a word of it by the time he was freed seven hours after the wakeup knock his partners had met and revealed to him their considered opinion that he should leave the practice not the next week and not the next day but within the next hour within a month the day after he had again been interviewed at the police station and the day before he was due to be grilled in london by lawyers of the british medical association ann and the children had moved out of the family home and into that of the guy who had the saab franchise up the road from torquay he was unemployable in the united kingdom friendless and soon divorced the house was sold and ninetenths of the proceeds had gone to the mortgage company but he had to have food in his stomach a shirt on his back and a glass in his hand and in the professions journal hed seen the advertisement if hed thought what had gone before was the steepest downhill tumble he had been so wrong if they had only known the truth of his life the patient and her husband might have felt sorry for him he counted out thirty daazepam tablets bottled them and wrote the dosage on the label he was more trapped incarcerated than they were he showed them out all their problems were money but barts were far beyond that level of simplicity he closed the door after them ai mazan village near jenin occupied west bank bart braked if he had not slammed his foot on the pedal crushed it against the floor had not swerved and come to a grinding halt as he emerged from the side turning he would have run straight into the armoured personnel carrier there were three more behind the one he had missed colliding with they rumbled down the street but the machinegunner on the last swivelled the mounting and kept the barrel aimed at him until they were gone he sat behind the wheel and the sweat poured off him outside the fourwheel drive it was cold enough to freeze the sweat he could no longer see them but he heard the racing whine of the carriers tracks and the street was pitted where they had been where had they gone he knew dozvn that street a patient a child was suffering from acute diarrhoea and in the patients home there was a back kitchen and a yard beyond it in the yard there was a shed jesus he heard gunfire he sat with his head in his hands and tried to blot out the sounds that crashed in his ears after the gunfire there were the explosions of grenades men and kids were running in the street in front of him more shots he was recognized more explosions his door was opened he was pulled out by a clutch of hands and his bag was snatched off the seat beside his he was propelled forward across the street in front of him an armoured personnel carrier was slewed and the same machinegun now traversed on to him that day he was wearing over his anorak a white sleeveless jerkin with a red crescent symbol at the front and a red cross on the back his bag was pushed into his hand from beside the carrier two shots were fired into the air the crowd stayed back but bart advanced the barrel of the machinegun was locked on him there was a shout first in hebrew then in english he was to stop or he would be shot he was alone in the street behind the armoured personnel carrier there was sudden movement soldiers burst from an alley dragging what might have been a sack of grain but the sack had legs and a lolling lifeless head bart saw the head only for an instant as it bounced on the streets mud the engines revved the troops jumped for the rear doors of the carriers and they were gone screaming filled the street he saw a brightening bruise on the mothers cheekbone and blood dribbling from a cut on the fathers forehead he wondered if they had tried to block the troops entry or whether they had attempted to hold on to the dead body of their son and been beaten back with rifle butts god might forgive bart no other bastard would he reached the door and the crowd had thickened behind him he did what was necessary bathed the bruise and staunched the cut and all around him was the wailing of misery he realized it he was a trusted as a friend three hours later he was at the checkpoint and while his vehicle was searched methodically and while the pretence was made that he was questioned in the hut he drank a mug of strong coffee joseph said quietly dont think you are a military man bart a s a man of medicine you are a man of healing and peace but i promise you what we do is for the preservation of peace terrorists are the parasites that feed off people we have to destroy those parasites or there can never be healing you saw a body the body was defenceless you saw but you did not comprehend he made the belts and the waistcoats that are used by suicide bombers you have seen the buses that are destroyed you have seen the markets where they kill themselves you have seen the cafes where they detonate the bombs he was good at his work what you have done bart is save lives sometimes a suicide bomber kills maybe ten but it has been as high as thirty and for every death there are five more innocents who lose their sight their limbs or their mobility because of you many innocents have been given the chance to live a whole life you should feel good you have removed a major player in what they call their armed struggle i salute you he did not want to be saluted or congratulated some time on the decision of others and it had been promised him his life would begin again but only when others permitted it bart swallowed hard he blurted i saw him i was in the house surely there will be a security investigation how was it known he would be back at his home that he was using his home i was there too many people know i was there what about me joseph smiled and his hand rested in reassurance on barts shoulder we take great care of you you are a jewel to us so precious have no fear he left his coffee half drunk he was pitched out of the hut and his feet slithered in the mud when he had his balance he swung and shouted at the troops by the hut door he was watched by the palestinians who waited for processing at the checkpoint and he heard the applause the fervent clapping some chanted his name he drove away they talked of the complicated and intricately webbed world they inhabited youre not bullshitting me here eddie you can count on it i was there i found the prime eyewitness he wouldnt have known how to lie the body of the paymaster i saw it on the slab its about as far from bullshit as you can get they were at the kitchen table juan gonsalves and eddie wroughton shared the table with his children their crayoncoloured drawings and pepperoni pizza fresh from the microwave the children ate and drew teresa tried to separate sheets of paper from the food wroughton talked and gonsalves scribbled notes separated from his work gonsalves could laugh but he never laughed when he worked wroughton understood the pressures now lying on the shoulders of every agency man in the field the disaster of failed intelligence analysis before dictated that every scrap should be written down passed on and evaluated the life of a langley man who ignored a warning was a cheap life the pressures on wroughton were lightweight he thought by comparison the caravan was a bedu his son and four strangers i dont have the exact number of camels but they carried enough water and food for a long trek into the empty quarter they are important enough to be using about as remote a piece of the border to cross as there is no omani or saudi border patrols and camels rather than trucks and pickups whod walk or get camel sores when they could ride in a vehicle people of exceptional value for the organization it would be a major setback if men of that value were intercepted on either side of the border theirs was a good friendship that was wroughtons belief most politicians in london deluded themselves they had a special relationship with the white house but here on the gonsalves kitchen table the relationship was indeed special wroughtons report of his journey upcountry in oman was now being studied in london in a week when desk warriors had rewritten it the revised report would go in the bag to washington in another week the report would be passed to the sister agency at langley a week later after further revisions and rewriting a version would be sent in cypher back to riyadh and would land in gonsalves office the real relationship between two dedicated professionals was across a clutter of crayons and paper and was dictated above a babble of excited kids voices he said quite specifically that the camels were loaded with six packing cases crates whatever they were painted olive green military dimensions are estimated but seemed to be the eyewitnesss arm span both arms machineguns wouldnt be in crates the weight of the crates is a handicap going into the empty quarter so we are looking at something that cannot be exposed to the elements also that requires cushioning what are we talking about id reckon were talking armourpiercing or groundtoair missiles if i had to bet id say were talking groundtoair try stinger gonsalves grimaced i did some work on it today you shipped with your typical generosity some nine hundred stingers into afghanistan the mujahidin downed an estimated two hundred and sixtynine soviet fixed wing and helicopters using them at the end of the war when the soviets quit two hundred were unaccounted for still out there your people tried to buy them back but went emptyhanded they can blow a military plane out of the skies or a civilian airliner what we dont know is shelf life eighteen years after their delivery are they still functioning have they degraded dont know my own view what its worth the crates arent the problem the problems bigger i think the men matter the four strangers are the priority their greatest difficulty as counterintelligence officers was to sift the relevant from the dross mostly their trade relied on the electronic intercepts of conversations sucked down from satellites gobbled by computers then spat out as raw verbiage wroughton and gonsalves called it chatter their bosses called it ellnt but this was the rarest commodity they dealt with the word of an eyewitness right four men are being taken across the empty quarter in conditions of the greatest secrecy they matter the eyewitness is definite there was an argument over the price of the camels then one of the men intervenes he assumes authority he is young he is tall he does not fit in physique and build the eyewitness notes that he is different in his features from the others wears their clothes but is different a young leader with authority thats what i have but thats all all of the best material high grade and rare was exchanged across the kitchen table the kids liked wroughton he drew the pencil outlines for them to colour in better than their own father and after the meal they would go out into the floodlit yard where he would pitch a ball at the eldest kid and do it better than gonsalves and later he would read to the kids in their beds and they liked his accent better than their mothers in london and washington there would have been coronaries and fury at the closeness of the two men juan they are regrouping down there pulling in new men new blood i can smell it kill her calebs head was down as he climbed the dune he saw the sand loose slide through his burned toes beside him the camel struggled he had hold of its rein and helped it steady itself they went up together the voice was tommys i say it kill her he looked up and the low sun bruised his eyes they were all at the top of the dune and were silhouetted in the dropping light their shadows and those of the camels fell down the dunes slope towards caleb he heard only the iraqis voice because she has seen us kill her they seemed not to hear him behind them they gazed ahead and below caleb reached them he pushed past hosni and fahd past the boy who turned and faced him wideeyed past the guide who was clawing at the baggage on his camel and had his hand on the rifle he was at the shoulder of tommy the executioner he looked down because she has seen us can identify us kill her she was standing the sun backlit the gold of her hair which was tangled and sweatstreaked she wore a dirtied blouse of soft colours faded jeans and heavy boots her hands face and clothing were stained with oil she looked up at them rocking as if she no longer had the strength to stand erect there was a calm about her like an indifference she did not flinch from tommy and caleb saw the land rover wedged in the drifts of sand he wondered what faint minuscule mathematical chance had thrown her into their path if you wont i will kill her the guide had the rifle with a fast clattering movement of his hands he armed it caleb looked into rashids face saw the hesitation furrows lined his weathered forehead caleb understood it was the way of the bedu to offer help aid whatever was in their power to a traveller in distress it would have been the way of any villager in afghanistan he had been offered help aid when he had crawled towards the village deep memories stirred they came from beyond the chasm he had fashioned to block them out the words croaked in his throat we would break the culture of the sands we would dishonour ourselves tommy laughed at him and spittle flew from his mouth it rested wet on calebs face culture that is fucking rubbish dishonour what is that you wont i will she has seen a caravan pass by she has seen nothing they would have known all of them that his words were empty in turn they sneered derision at him caleb ignored them rashid had the rifle he fixed rashid with his eye he held the eye he did not blink did not waver he stared at rashid he would listen only to rashid he himself was the chosen man he was the one for whom the rest struggled in the sands was he not worthy of trust rashid broke looked away then began to replace the rifle under the bags on his camels flank caleb said to rashid you are a fine man a man i love go till it is too dark to go further light a fire there i will find you they went after a splutter of argument on which caleb turned his back the guide led them in a deep halfcircle around the woman as if by her glance or her presence she might poison them caleb watched them go when the sun first touched the horizons dunes when he could no longer see them when his body ached with tiredness hunger and thirst he went heavily down the slope towards her she was reaching into her hip pocket are you going to try to rape me as she spoke in clear arabic her hand slipped to a position of defence against the dirt and the oil smears on her blouse caleb saw the clean shape of an open penknife blade are you going to kill me no caleb said i am going to dig you out chapter nine in the bonecrushing musclenumbing exhaustion he felt freedom caleb had dug through the last of the sunlight through the dusk through the time the desert was bathed in silver he had cleared the wheels from the time she had given him the shorthandled shovel he had not spoken a word as if talking would further waste his energy and she had seemed to realize the silences value he had used the roof boxes from the land rover to make a wall beside the wheels so that when he threw aside a shovels load the sanci did not slip back into the cavity he dug each wheel was harder to clear with each wheel his strength seeped and his tiredness grew she could not help him when each wheel was freed he let her ram down the next box into place for the next wall and she brought him the water that sustained him she had watched him through the dusk and the night only darting forward to drag the boxes into position and to bring him the water the boy had come back in the night had sat apart from them and had minded his own camel and calebs for those hours digging and gasping down the water given him caleb had known a new freedom links were broken burdens offloaded he was no longer a recruit in the training camp no more a member of the brigade was away from the trenches and the bombing was distanced from camps xray and delta did not live the lie was not travelling to rejoin his family the sense of freedom burgeoned she had had a torch and in its light caleb had stepped over that chasm of his memory he had raised the bonnet over the land rovers engine then fastened it upright with his fingers and then using his headcloth the ghutrah as a whisk he had cleared the surplus sand that covered the parts since the wedding and his recruitment he had never taken that step into his past never shown his knowledge of the working parts of a vehicles engine she had rummaged in a bag for a clean blouse ripped the soft cotton material into strips and passed them to him a strip for the filters two strips for the carburettor a strip for the pump strips for each part of the engine that sand grains had infiltrated when the torchlight had guttered the moon had fallen he had worked by touch from memory the freedom would not last with the coming morning he would resume his march to return to his family at the end he had used the shorthandled shovel and with what little remained of his strength he had battered the blade against the wood of one of the boxes until it had fallen apart then he had placed the wood lengths four of them hard against the revealed tyres for a valuable yard of traction he had sat in the drivers seat had turned the key and pumped the pedal the engine had caught then he had switched it off he had climbed up to the crest of a shallow dune had collapsed on to the sand and begun to erase the memories without the memories caleb was an arab he was returning to his family was a man who hated was a chosen man behind him he could hear the quiet sounds of the restless camels and the soothing voice of the boy she was beside him and he knew he must guard himself or the memories would swamp him and with them came weakness her questions were a torrent who are you where are you from where are you going the questions were asked in arabic he stared up at stars losing lustre at a moon losing brilliance he felt the cold of the night the pain in his legs arms and shoulders the emptiness in his mind she crouched over him it must have been the last strip from her ripped blouse and the last of the water that she used to damp his forehead and his mouth he could smell her not perfume from a spray but her sweat her fingers moved over his skin and his lips he had been frightened to talk for fear that his language would slip and betray him you are not a bedu too tall too strong where have you travelled from you knew the engine of the land rover where did you learn it he had the last of her blouse strips the last drops from the water container and the last of her sandwiches hot curled and dried out in the past days heat and he had thought he was going to vomit but he had swallowed hard instead she was closer to him lying back she lapsed into silence but her fingers played patterns with the hairs on his right arm old senses stirred in caleb pulses beat the fingers worked over his forearm then came to rest on the material that covered the plastic bracelet they stopped there as if it were a barrier the bracelet was exposed then the torch snapped on and its failing beam was on his wrist caleb writhed away from her but she had hold of his wrist and tried to work it into the beam she was strongmuscled not dainty they wrestled but he had his arm under his body she loosed him knelt beside him the beam moved on it caught the soles of his feet he heard the shocked gasp then it veered on again and shone full into his face he hit her arm suddenly surprised her and the torch fell away she sat back reached out and switched off the torch time to talk he looked away who are you you dont look into my face you dont read what is on my wrist you dont know me please and you forget me she was laughing he speaks has a voice the mystery grows a voice that is not saudi not bedu feet that are raw who are you i am beth jenkins teacher and geologist i work at the shaybah oilextraction plant i am twentyseven years old i was in the desert because i had been told of a meteorite site never studied before i have no satphone and i am out of range of any mobile link i have left no note of where i am it would be days before a search was started and then they would not know where to look there you know all about me now what about you you saved me from dehydration and death or from a rifle and death at shaybah there are arabs of all nationalities but you i cannot place your feet tell me that for the first time in your life you are walking without shoes or sandals why because of my debt to you i have the right to know who you are you never saw me the storm missed you in the morning you go on and you never remember me sitting close to him and crosslegged she said those men with you because i saw their faces wanted to kill me would have i heard you know that i thank you and you never remember me i am forgotten no reply her warmth was near to him he felt the pain loose its hold on his muscles a great calm came to him her breathing was slowed regular she slept had he moved clumsily he would have woken her she knew everything of him she knew that he wore a plastic bracelet on his wrist as if it were a convicts tag that he crossed the sands in secrecy that his identity was hidden that his business was worth killing to protect that his accent separated him from the region that the scars blisters and welts on his feet meant he was a stranger and an outsider he heard from the base of the dune the boys hacking cough the sounds of the camels stirring and their grunts as they spat if he moved he would break the spell of her sleep she shifted without waking and her head was on his chest her throat on his shoulder his hand moved his fingers touched her throat they rail on her throat from the windpipe to the back of her neck until they tangled with her hair she could drive back where she had come from and she could go to a police post or an army post she could betray him his fingers were on her throat she slept and was without defence he moved his fingers from her throat she slept because she trusted him the first shaft of the sun hit him he heard the boy whistle for him with great care with gentleness caleb lifted her head and drew his arm clear then lowered her head back to the sand her eyes did not open he edged back from her scratched at his face shivered then pushed himself up the boy expressionless watched him he left her and slid away down the dune caleb took the camels rein they walked briskly leaving behind him the woman and the land rover the boy led him he had gone fifty paces sixty and the slight warmth of the sun nestled on his back the shout was clear behind him burst over the sand thank you you saved my life and i thank you if it is ever possible i will repay you he did not turn but he cupped his hands and yelled at the plateau of sand around him you never met me i was never here you never saw my face they walked on the boy said the iraqi would have cut her throat my father would have shot her but he did not you made a softness in my father i think it is because you are different from us my father cannot explain it none of us knows you what have you been doing lifting too many ammunition boxes bart stepped back from the couch and peeled off the rubber gloves not ammunition boxes no the patient was midforties and overweight a former logistics corps man had risen to warrant officer and had looked for better remuneration than an army pension would offer they talked across each other what im thinking is a hernia barts face cracked with his general practitioners smile comforting you dont get those sang guys to lift anything not if they can wriggle away and get someone else some other idiot to do it its been csgas cartridges mostly and plastic bullets more than live stuff im going to pass you on to a consultant specialist but im pretty sure that the pain and the lump mean an inguinal hernia most of what were doing with sang these days is riot control and crowd control i expect you were worried about prostate cancer with the swelling and the symptoms that i can most definitely rule out so its not been a bad day for you at the basin gloves off and binned bart scrubbed his hands while the former warrant officer now on the training programme for the saudi arabian national guard spilled out the detail of his daily work only when hed finished saying anything useful when hed come off the couch zipped up and belted his trousers put his sneakers back on did bart start to hurry him convalescence isnt bad two weeks till you can drive after the operation no heavy lifting during that time actually its the anaesthetic if you have a full one that governs recovery time ill make all the arrangements fix an appointment and please leave my receptionist with the details of your cover policy its been a real pleasure to meet you when the patient had gone having grinned and pumped barts hand in gratitude he sat at his chair and made his notes nothing about an inguinal hernia everything about the national guards current training schedule yes all classified as top secret all closely guarded by the leaders of the kingdom good stuff the best hed had for at least two months he was a kept man wroughtons toyboy he had been a kept man since he had answered the advertisement had been accepted for employment on the basis of his severely edited curriculum vitae had flown to cyprus paying his own fare and had taken a taxi that had cost a small fortune to nicosia ann behind him and the kids all of them the responsibility of the bastard with the saab franchise and the divorce papers signed anew start and a new beginning in the sunshine he hadnt crawled into the water he had jumped in the last month before he flew out of the uk with no forwarding address for the sourfaced detective sergeant in torquay or the pompous creep of a solicitor from the british medical association he had begun a crash course in the russian language what hed read there were more russian banks on the island of cyprus than anywhere other than moscow there would be russians with heart problems liver problems kidney problems and there would be british tourists with sunstroke and alcohol poisoning piece of cake on his feet at last after a good dinner and an excellent sleep having shaved carefully then dressed in his best suit and a sombre tie he had walked from his hotel to the block where the practice he would join worked from kept waiting twentyfive minutes no coffee and no biscuits left to cool his heels before a harassed man with a face that said death was visiting had called him in i regret dr bartholomew that the offer made in writing to you no longer stands we have a considerable reputation on the island that my colleagues and i will not sacrifice a moment of leaden silence while the man looked at the floor and bart had gaped a letter was passed to him headed british medical association it gave close detail of a police investigation into the illegal sale of class a drugs as yet incomplete and a bma inquiry as yet not concluded the man shrugged then almost ran to the door to open it you understand dr bartholomew that no alternative is open to us he had gone out dazed into the sunshine his head had been bowed so he had seen the cigarette tossed down on the pavement then crushed under a polished shoe a voice had said in flawless pedigree english what i always say those days you wake up and the sun shines are those when you go out without an umbrella and the rain starts pissing down know what i mean raining now isnt it lets go and have a drink and see if we can roll the clouds back come on he had been led and he had followed as any kept man would when the notes were complete bart rang wroughton to fix a lunchtime meeting then buzzed for the next patient beth stood where no man or woman had stood before she should have felt a thrill of exhilaration should have wanted to jump and cheer and punch the air the memories of the night trapped her she stared around her then began to walk forward the crater was in front of her what she had been told to find was a high wall of sand the highest in that part of the desert and four hundred paces from the right side of the wall was the perfect circle of the crater it should have amazed her that her bedouin informant could be so exact in his description of the place and without a gps so certain of the route she should follow she had driven only eleven point three miles from where the storm had caught her and after four when doubt was settling she had seen the wall that towered higher than any others the crater was a dozen strides across its rim clear to see and there were other smaller circle shapes near to it and a scattering of dark grey stones the crater had a raised lip five hundred years before or five thousand or five million a mass of rock had hurtled down from the heavens having burst the atmosphere it had detonated on impact the entry heat would have melted the external parts of the rock leaving them as blackened slag fusing the iron ore that was its signature and creating intense heat sufficient to turn sand to glass there would have been in that part of the sands years before the equivalent of an explosion by five kilotonnes of tnt perhaps there had been people close by perhaps the desert had been as empty as now but anything living within hundreds of metres of the ejecta field would have been killed her mind mechanically made calculations and estimates of the size of the meteorite while her thoughts were on the young man who had saved her who had told her with steel authority you never met me i was never here you never saw my face beth had been eight times to the wabar site the ninth largest in the world with a principal crater four hundred metres across where an iron core mass of three thousand tonnes had impacted the largest known was in arizona fourteen hundred metres in diameter but to beth that was a tourist site boring and she had not visited it nor had she gone to the site at chicxulub on mexicos yucatan coast which dated back sixtyfive million years there a rock said to have been the size of everest had hit the earths surface at perhaps six thousand miles an hour and had caused such seismic shocks as to destroy the dinosaur population and shift fractionally the earths orbit coachloads went there utterly boring his fingers had been at her throat and she had felt no fear over the years men had tried to impress her had put on peacock feathers he had not the men she had known at university and in her social life in london and on the field trips had sought to create an indebtedness had bought her dinner taken her to the theatre carried her bags ostentatiously tried to insinuate themselves he had not there were men who had made her laugh and men who had demonstrated their cleverness with intense and earnest talk he had refused to answer her questions men told her their life stories she knew nothing of him there was not one person in the world no one she knew to whom she would have talked about the encounter in the dunes not even her mother he had wanted nothing of her there had been a serenity about him a strength and a gentleness when he had moved her arms to stand and slip away while she pretended to sleep what confused her most at shaybah she met arabs from every country in the middle east yemenis egyptians kuwaitis and jordanians and there were labourers from pakistan but she could not place or match his accent every aspect of her life was based on certainty except him no name no start point and no destination she cursed out loud her voice yelling the obscenity rolled back at her from the sand wall angry as if he watched her she flounced back to the land rover snatched up her camera her samples bag and clipboard she started to work where no other human had stood before but she could not escape him for the first time caleb rode he would not have done but ghaffur insisted ghaffur made him ride shouted at him in his highpitched voice and showed him ghaffur said that if they were to catch the caravan then caleb must learn and that if he fell off he should mount again he had to ride because they must rejoin the caravan by nightfall the boy called the camel the beautiful one caleb rolled rocked on the hump the beautiful one went her own way at her own speed caleb had no control over her he sat on a saddle of sacking and clung to the reins or to her neck and clamped his thighs to her flanks but he survived did not fall again he crossed the chasm the memory was from far back rain on his face darkness and bright lights around him and the quiet of the sands was replaced with raucous noise it was a fairground and he rode a rollercoaster boys screamed and girls shrieked but the desert was around him and the quiet it had been something from the past breaking into his memory and he rode the hump and obliterated it the beautiful one crossed the sand with long weary strides he had seen the way rashid treated his camels foultempered to the men he escorted but sweet with the animals almost love the boy turned often as if expecting to see that he had been pitched off but there was not the usual mischief on the young face they made time caleb realized that the boy had caught from his father a new suspicion of his resolve and had caught it too from hosni and fahd and tommy all of them without his intervention would have killed beth jenkins and would have left her body for the wind and sand to strip for the sun to rot twice they found the tracks of the caravan each time close to a gully between the dunes where the sand was sheltered from a brisk wind each time they had gone through the gully the tracks were lost the surface of the sand seemed to float and it filled the hoofprints caleb marvelled that the boy could go with certainty after the caravan when he himself saw no tracks they did not stop to rest eat or drink he perched on the hump bounced on it would not fall he had forgotten her she was no part of him the long night was behind him and the wind blew the smell of her from his robe ive got a target gonsalves was flushed with excitement at the ground controls door they needed the excitement he peddled the door hadnt been more than half open and hed only had a glimpse of the back of the pilots head and the profile of the sensor operators but the shoulders and back postures told him excitement was in short supply ive got a real target for you he had been strapped into the cessna for the flight down had never loosened his belt now he paced the tiny space behind their workbench he thought that the pilot desperately wanted to believe him that the sensor operator was suspicious of gifts that might be snatched away what im telling you is for real doesnt come often but this is humint it is eyewitness what i told you stands they are hunted they are regrouping they are trying so damned hard to get their shape again what we have is a camel caravan and it has crossed the omansaudi border and it has gone into the rub al khali by going the hard way they tell us they have with them at least one man of exceptional value but they are also carrying sophisticated weapons that we consider to be of lesser but still considerable importance he took from his briefcase a photocopied sheet he reached forward and slapped it on to the bench between the console the sensor operator used and the joystick that the pilots fingers were on that is a stinger box as its reported to me second hand it is at least similar to the ones the humint saw loaded on the camels stinger is a shoulderlaunched groundtoair missile it the woman said i think we know what a stinger is mr gonsalves deflated gonsalves said there are six of them loaded in pairs on three camels on the workbench covered for protection with cellophane sheeting was a largescale map of the rub al khali over the sheeting were the squares they had drawn and a pitiful few had crosses on them with dates and times the woman did the talking for herself and the pilot where did the caravan cross the border gonsalves checked his own map then stabbed with his pencil at theirs the point rested on the broken line of the international frontier very good she said quietly and when does the humlnt say the caravan crossed these people are vague they dont do days of the month like we do when her question was icy calm more than a week could be ten days up to two weeks we were lucky to get this much disappointment clouded the pilots face his eyes losing hope gonsalves could see them through the thick lenses of the spectacles she talked for him we would have to estimate mr gonsalves that a camel train can move at twentyfive land miles on a bad day thirtyfive miles on a good day something between there on an average day she used a black chinagraph and drew three halfcircles on the cellophane each covering more of the box squares than the last he understood a great segment of the desert was enclosed by the outer halfcircle and its radius from the pencil mark on the border was just short of five hundred land miles he said emptily its the best humint ive got what are you trying to tell me about needles and haystacks take a look mr gonsalves she pointed up to the bank of monitors he saw the sand miles of it sand that was without an horizon flat sand humped sand ridged sand and dune sand he saw true emptiness then her finger was on the map inside the widest of the halfcircles we are flying carnival girl today out behind you theres a pissbucket we dont leave here when a bird is flying marty and i were like a fist and glove we are together he wants to piss he stands over the bucket i want to piss i squat over the bucket why because if one of us went out to piss and the others head was rocking we would miss on the wide angle any sort of caravan let alone a few camels we get brought sandwiches and we get brought water we are here as long as the bird is up we should have at least one more relief shift but we dont we should have a standby sensor operator but we dont why am i telling you this mr gonsalves so you appreciate this is a big haystack and the needle youre giving us the best humlnt ive got is tiny dont take offence you are trying and we are trying you are giving it your best shot and so are we i hope you have a good flight back he stared at the sand on the screens stared till the picture distorted his vision he thought that the pilot and the sensor operator should have relief every two hours if their concentration was to hold and he thought they were prisoners in the ground control for twelve or fifteen hours at a time the nightmare gathering in his mind they would fly the uav carnival girl right over a camel caravan that carried six boxes of importance and at least one man of significance and they would not see either a trail of beasts or that man do what you can gonsalves said weakly for a moment on his arrival he had lifted them now their shoulders had flopped again he went out the heat hit him seemed to stifle his breath he walked towards the jeep that would drive him back to the cessna it was the life he knew a counterintelligence officer encountered rare highs and frequent troughs he fought in what was now dubbed in the smart currentaffairs magazines back home the war without end the customers expected goddamn miracles he remembered what had been said after the riyadh attacks last year theyre saying we can get you any time anywhere it had been good information but quietly trashed as they had shown him the desert pictures and the halfcircles on the map and all the time his enemy was regrouping savagely he kicked a stone from his path to the jeep his name was called he turned went back climbed the steps into the ground control she pointed to a screen he saw two tiny shapes a vehicle roof was at the screens side and a minuscule figure was in the centre she played her tricks the zoom started he identified the land rover then a woman the zoom lost the land rover as it closed on the woman she was bending he could see a clipboard on the sand beside her and bright stones reflected up then she crouched her hair was fair damn it he could see the colour of her hair and of her blouse i just wanted you to know mr gonsalves what the gear did if we can find a target who the hell do you think she is the sensor operator grinned as she took the picture fractionally closer shes two people shes a meteorite expert a scholar she is also my supplier of tampons and shes also the only living person thing weve seen all day wont she wave the pilot said she doesnt know were up above were on loiter at twentyfour thousand feet altitude thats four point five four five miles she cant hear us and if she looked up she couldnt see us why we wanted to show her to you mr gonsalves if theres camels with military crates we can identify them you got hellfire on she said they had not dont ever fly another day without hellfire on dont ever its riot control theyre doing mr wroughton five days a week of riotcontrol training and preparation to counter a breakdown of law and order thats the truth wroughton never took a note in the presence of an informer to have taken a shorthand precis would have made the informer believe his information was interesting important his face was a study of disinterest they were in the lobby of a small hotel that was rarely used by expatriates and the chairs they used and the table with their juice were shielded by potted plants from the swing door and the reception desk in any case his cufflink was a microphone and the recorder was under his jacket in the small of his back god the wretch came cheap every man and officer in the national guard who is not on essential priority duties is now being sent on riotcontrol training they are crapping in their pants if youll excuse me mr wroughton its gas and plastic bullets at the moment but sang units now have access to live ammunition i know its only a little detail but all the armoured personnel carriers in the national guard barracks must have full fuel tanks at all times its like they know the place is crumbling some handlers became fond of informants treated them like wayward children pretended they were almost a valued part of the intelligencegathering process eddie wroughton would never make that mistake samuel bartholomew was a creature he despised kind words encouragement unless laced with a tone of sarcasm had no place in the relationship i gather its coming out of the mosques not the big ones the party line rules there but the small ones whose customers are hard hit by the new austerity the americans are gone their troops have left but my patient says the poison out of the lesser mosques is now directed at the royals its the fall in the standard of living thats doing it my patient says oh yes the armoured personnel carriers are fulltime loaded up with gas and plastics but they also have heavy machineguns mounted theyre running scared i hope this is valuable to you mr wroughton ive been very dedicated for you mr wroughton havent i wroughtons lip curled he thought he knew what was coming and he pushed away his nearempty glass with fruit in the bottom he smiled limply then stood please please just hear me out then the blurt what im thinking mr wroughton your people can get access to buildings cant they and files cant they they did im not following you bart theres files on me i files on all of us bart wroughton teased my files at the devon and cornwall police and at the bma im wondering wroughton played the idiot what are you wondering after all ive done you know all the help well couldnt they just get lost lost wroughton mimicked lost are you suggesting that we might burgle police premises and the offices of the british medical association and remove files concerning criminal investigations is that what youre suggesting the wretch cringed i think ive done my time i want out i want a new start without those bloody files blocking me thats reasonable surely thats always dominate an informant keep him under a steelshod shoe wroughton said you leave when i say so files go walkabout when i decide it and thats not now you are going bart nowhere a little dribble of spittle appeared at barts mouth anger wroughton could have respected fight he could have warmed to the doctor caved in yes mr wroughton there was no spine in the man he waved him away watched him cross the lobby and go through the doors then he saw her if he hadnt watched bartholomew going out of the hotel he would not have seen the woman quite elegant a little plump well dressed silk blouse and skirt not young but well caredfor she turned the pages of a magazine but her attention was not on the pages he caught her eye eddie wroughton was expert at reading the boredom factor in middleaged women she had a wedding ring on her finger married women were always the better targets they were always more bored shed caught his eye and had held it he thought she matched his own interest he stood paused for a decent moment then eased across the lobby towards her a quarter of an hour later when he had learned she was belgian that her husband worked upcountry and her home telephone number he left her with her magazine jed staggered like a drunk he came off the ferry that linked the accommodation area with marine corps administration from the delta camp and thought he might fall he knew that the eyes of every civilian officer and enlisted man who had sailed on the ferry were locked on him a headcold had gone feverish and forced him to his bed two whole days two nights and part of a third day he had been tossing under the sweatdamp sheet dosed with pills twisting cursing then frustration had forced him up and into his work clothes he was unshaven unsure whether he could manage a razor with his shaking hand a lumbering shadow of himself jed made his way off the ferry and towards the shuttle bus the mission he had set out hooked him he had gulped down more pills dressed haphazardly the stubble on his face and the unbrushed hair gave him the appearance of a vagrant he heard titters of laughter he said nothing but hauled himself heavily up the bus steps then flopped on to the nearest seat he was dropped off at camp delta he showed his card at the gate you all right sir just fine thank you corporal he wasnt just fine he felt goddamn foul swaying he made his way to a store shed far in the wrong direction from the block where his office was it was the territory of a giantbuilt afroamerican sergeant a man to be treated with respect or steel shutters would block any chance of cooperation he gave the name of fawzi alateh whats the classification mr dietrich he said that the classification was not to be continued with and that the subject had been released youre asking a lot of me mr dietrich for me to find an ncw whos not even here he asked whether the ncw files had been pulped or shredded and his voice was deferential he was told where they were an annexe he thanked the sergeant he did not suggest the man put aside his magazine or his twolitre pepsi bottle or pull himself up and get himself into the annexe he said he would be happy to go look himself for what he wanted dont mind me telling you mr dietrich but youre not looking your best he went through the door behind the sergeants desk and closed it jed passed the racks that held the current files of transcripts floppy disks and audiotapes ahead of him was a wooden door that squealed as he opened it after more than two years of camp xray and camp delta the annexe was still underused he flicked the switch and a dull ceiling light came on the not to be continued with files and tapes were in sacks on the floor not separated in any alphabetical system he shared the annexe with a cockroach more spiders than he could count and travelling caravans of ants he had opened fifteen sacks before he found a date on a file that corresponded with that on which fawzi alateh had been bussed from camp delta to the airfield he had checked nine envelopes the thin brown pouches used for government service before he unearthed the transcripts and audiotapes of the taxidriver he shoved the envelope under his arm and left the annexe a little more of a mess than he had found it it was an effort to walk between the store shed and the office block and once he had to stop and lean against a fencing post he passed an fbi office through the open door a voice sang out hi jed thought you were supposed to be down sick he smiled at the face behind the shoes on the desk and thanked the agent for his concern he would shaft them in his room he loaded an audiotape from fawzi alateh into his cassetteplayer and slipped on the earphones he listened then snapped down on the button from his desk drawer he took the cassette that carried the voice of the brit prisoner who claimed to have been nothing more than a religious student in peshawar and who had read a translated text in pashto again and again jed played snatches of the two voices till they rang and merged in his mind his head was supported by his hands which were clamped over the earphones he was feeling weaker the weight of his head grew he sagged he opened his eyes he knew he had fainted because the tape was finished but he had what he wanted caleb and ghaffur had ridden hard through the heat and caught the caravan in the late afternoon when they reached it ghaffur left him urged his camel faster and went past the travellers to join his father at the head the atmosphere for the last hour of the day before they halted was heavy with suspicion and dispute caleb was the cause of it he saw ghaffur chatter to his father but rashid seemed to ignore the boy when the guide looked round raked his eyes over those riding behind him caleb saw that the malevolence of the glance was not directed at him but fell on the iraqi it had been hotter that day than on any other the heat caleb decided and the lost water were the reasons for rashids temper because his camel had gone fast caleb was stiff aching and the sore blisters were growing where his thighs joined his buttocks then the beautiful one speeded up lengthened her stride without command she passed fahd who looked away and would not catch calebs eye and two of the bulls who had the crates and came level with hosnis camel the egyptian seemed hardly to see caleb his eyes were watery without brightness and stared down only at the rein and the neck of the camel the clothes on him hung looser than when they had started out but even then they had flopped over the spare body without shade exposed to the ferocity of the sun without sufficient water caleb realized how quickly the strength of the elderly egyptian was waning his own pains were severe and the blister sores were growing but caleb hid them because hosnis pains and sores would be worse it must have been his breathing a little sucked intake as the beautiful one lurched and the rough saddle sacking expanded the biggest of the sores that raised the egyptians head a fraction thank you fahd for riding with me i will not fall i caleb looked into the dull wet eyes it is me hosni i am back with you ah the noble one the one with the conscience what did you achieve i dug out the wheels i cleaned the engine did she thank you she thanked me how did she thank you hosnis voice was mocking caleb said firmly quietly she told me she was grateful for what i had done the egyptian as if it were a great effort threw his head back and snorted derision she said she was grateful are we all now at risk because you dug out her wheels and cleaned her engine i did not put you at risk i promise it promise it is a fine word promise i would have killed her we all would from the exhausted weakness of his face his voice came clear and strong you will be asked to stand in a place where great crowds move a thousand men women and children will walk in front of you will jostle behind you will ignore you or will smile at you old men pretty women and sweet laughing children will pass by you and if you carry out your order all are doomed can we now trust you i am not sure fahd is uncertain tommy is certain we should not i will do what is asked of me i made a judgement live by it if it had been a man as gross as tommy as ugly as fahd as old and weak as me would you have stopped to dig him out and clean his engine or would he now be dead i live by my judgement caleb said but it was a pretty woman hosni spat into the sand and the hoofs erased his spittle the coughing racked his throat because you ride with me because you are from outside of us of great value but new to us i will tell you of the mistakes made by men of a qaeda listen well many mistakes and all made by men who had faith and commitment but were careless or stupid ramzi yousef will die in prison because a colleague left his laptop computer on a table in an apartment in manila and the whole of ramzis strategy was on the hard drive careless and stupid and a mistake arab fighters posed for celebration photographs on the armour of destroyed soviet tanks in afghanistan and ten years later one fighter has kept a copy of the photograph and is captured by the cia all his closest comrades are identified careless and a mistake in nairobi approaching the american embassy needing to get through a guarded barrier to be close to the building the one chosen to shoot the guard realizes as the lorry bomb brakes that he has forgotten his pistol has left it in the safehouse stupid and a mistake an organizer plans an attack to the last detail takes months to prepare for the strike and an hour before the bomb is moved he boards a plane home to pakistan by the time he lands the bomb has exploded security at karachi is alert the organizer shows his forged passport at the desk he is bearded the photograph in the passport shows a man who is cleanshaven a mistake a man carries sixty kilos of explosives in the trunk of his car to the canadian side of the border with america and it is the middle of winter and there is snow on the ground and ice on the road and he is sweating a mistake that is stupid and careless a van is driven under the world trade center in the first attack which did not bring down the towers in six thousand tonnes of debris the americans find the vin number of the vans engine and trace it to a hire company and the man who has hired it has given his own name for their records and his own address a mistake that is careless and stupid each mistake the use of the internet of a satellite phone of a mobile phone costs the freedom of many and the lives of many do you listen to me i am listening a week before you came to us i read in an omani newspaper that on the pakistan and afghan border the bodies of two men had been found both dead their throats had been cut and their mouths were filled with dollar notes they had lost the trust you demanded of us that the woman should live was that a mistake caleb said i did not make a mistake chapter ten it was not the time to break for water or for prayers rashid had halted the march had put up his hand as a signal to them had knelt his camel dismounted and walked forward alone the boy had run back on foot and had caught each of the camels reins they stood motionless the sun beat on them and caleb swayed on the beautiful one the blisters on his thighs below his buttocks had calmed in the night but had now reopened in the motion of riding why have we stopped caleb asked ghaffur the boy shrugged for how long will we stop the boy looked away would not meet calebs eye he gazed around him he sensed the camels were restless even the beautiful one the most placid among them some raised their heads high and seemed to sniff some bellowed some spat out cud they were aware caleb did not know of what around him was a wide plain of sand unlike any they had crossed before it seemed crusted under a film of loose sand and since they had come through a gully between dunes a harsher sand had caked round the camels hoofs caleb squinted sunlight reflected up from the sand seemed to burn the lids of his eyes how long was it he thought since he had seen a scorpion or a snakes trail the little furrowed track of a mouse a locust hopping or a fly a living bush or a grass blade it was as if nothing could survive here no creatures no insects no vegetation he did not know how far they had come how far they had yet to travel it seemed a place of death it was hard for him to see as far as rashid the shape of the guides body moved shimmered but he saw the post caleb blinked a pace in front of the guide and a little to the side of him a length of old wood without bark stuck up from the sand and its snappedoff tip was level with the guides knee it could not have been there by any accident of nature rashid had his palm to his forehead shading his eyes and stared out as if searching then they moved it was abrupt up to then on the march they had taken straight lines except where dune walls had blocked them and needed to be bypassed rashid veered to his right the boy behind him had them all bunched close and the pack camels the bulls carrying the crates when ghaffur came level with caleb he would not look into his face and would not speak but he slapped the beautiful ones haunches to make him close up and caleb realized the order they took was changed he was no longer at the back a new order was formed rashid ghaffur caleb behind caleb was hosni then fahd calebs place at the back of the caravan went to the iraqi tommy not since they had started out had crossed the border and moved down into the sands had tommy taken the rear position caleb saw rashids face when he turned to check behind him and saw the face of the boy felt a gathering tension but could not place it could not find a reason for it but it clawed at him the march now was different from any other of the days crossing the desert there was a second marker the piece of wood protruded less than half a foot from the sand and calebs burned eyes would have missed it but at this marker rashid set a new course to his left the heat dulled him too tired to shout a question at rashid or at the boy he clung to the saddle and the beautiful one followed the camels in front slow and lethargic each hoof sinking into the tracks of the ones she followed the heat was worse the blister sores were worse after what he thought was four hundred yards they went to the left and after what he thought was another two hundred yards to the right then they straightened and the camels sniffed the warmth of the air and the bulls bellowed but caleb thought the sand around them was no different from how it had been every day the angles that rashid took confused him but caleb could not escape the sense of increasing tension he had barely noticed it when rashid stopped ghaffur took the lead position caleb followed the boy he passed rashid he tried to focus on rashids face to read it could not his eyes wavered and could not lock no greeting no explanation no word the beautiful one lumbered on behind him were the pack animals then hosni and fahd and last the iraqi he did not understand the tension that now held him caleb turned twisted on the saddle of sacking the pain surged in his thighs from the movement the sores had opened wider rashid was now behind tommy his camels neck level with tommys camels haunches caleb looked ahead he took a point for his eyes in the centre of ghaffurs back now the boy swung his camel to the right and the zigzag pattern continued his eyes were closed he yearned for the next stop for the quartermug of water his eyes were tight against the strength of the sun his throat was parched sand pricked at his face he rolled thought he might fall forgot any concern for whatever happened behind him the embassy advised against driving alone bart drove alone and took the shortest route even with a chauffeur the embassy advised travel on a friday in riyadh should be made with extreme caution it was friday never on a friday advised the embassy should an expatriate go anywhere near the grand mosque and the wide pedestrian square between the mosque and the palace of justice the call had come it was an emergency and it being friday there was no chauffeur available to drive bart he discarded embassy advice and his mind mapped the most direct way from his compound to that from which the panic phone call had come he came down almalik faisal street his speedometer needle on the edge of the limit did not notice the drifting crowds of men young and old had no thought of what time prayers would have finished in the grand mosque and when the citys old restored walls were ahead of him he swung to the right into alimam torki ibn abdulla street and had to slow because the crowds thickened and filled the road then crawling bart realized where he was the pedestrian precinct bounded on the north by the mosque on the south by the justice building on the east by the souvenir shops and on the west by the souq deira shopping and commercial centre was known to expatriates it was an endless source of fascination gossip speculation and shivering horror the embassys security officer advised all expatriates in the strongest possible terms that they should never be near that part of the city on a friday after morning prayers to the expatriates the precinct was chop chop square without prior announcement in newspapers or on the televisionnews broadcasts after fridaymorning prayers the kingdoms executions were carried out in chop chop square dont ever want to gawp dont ever be tempted it is a place of extreme emotions at the time of a beheading stay clear give the place as wide a berth as possible take no chances there the security officer at the embassy advised expatriates but bart had been called out on an emergency and had not been concentrating on the embassys lectures now he had to slow and the crowds flowed around him he could see between the moving sea of robes past the side of the mosque and into the square it was an emergency and emergencies paid well friday no servants in the compound villa in the main lighting unit of a kitchen a bulb had failed the tenant an american lawyer with no servant to do it for him had put a chair under the unit had climbed on to it for the purpose of changing the bulb the chair had toppled the lawyer had fallen and with increasing hysteria his wife had phoned all of the listed american doctors friday and they were golfing or tennisplaying or visiting and barts number had been given her the way she told it in her panic her husbands arm was critically damaged could he come like now like half an hour ago bart didnt golf didnt play tennis didnt do social visiting he had scooped out a bowlful of food for the cat from a tin grabbed his bag and hurried out expatriates americans and europeans dreaded accidents and had mortal fear of going alone to a saudi hospital accident and emergency bart would be well rewarded for turning out on a friday in the middle of the day the crowds refused to edge out of his way he twisted among them why was he there samuel algernon laker bartholomews road led back directly to the day when he had stumbled from the surgery in nicosia and the man had been waiting for him on the pavement and had taken him for a drink the man who had so briefly entered his life was jimmy no second name no address no telephone number but a wallet and the minimal generosity of putting at ten twentyfive in the morning a double jameson no water on the table in the corner of the bar a mans down and the whole bloody world gets in a queue to kick him bloody unfair this islands dead for you look on the bright side i always say a glass is half full not half empty i happen to know where a highly qualified general practitioner brimming with experience can do really good work and be appreciated how id put it the sort of work that would enable a highly qualified and experienced doctor to stuff these unproven allegations down the necks of the bastards making them let me run this one by you unemployable back home his bank account drained marooned in cyprus bart had actually thanked the man for his kindness it extended to meeting his nicosia hotel bill providing petty cash for meals and an airline ticket for the shorthop flight to tel aviv two days later and never to see jimmy again bart had been in israel god so naive such an innocent he hooted impatiently he looked to the side where the bodies came closer to the vehicle doors he saw faces that were alive with emotion and the anger around him seemed to grow he might have been in an airconditioned cocoon but the anger the emotion seemed to swell shouldnt have bloody hooted before he had hooted the crowd had seemed barely to notice him now faces were pressed against the windows and the bodies made a wall in front of the bonnet against the noise of the airconditioning through the closed windows and locked doors he could detect a slow chant the interior seemed to darken as the weight of bodies came closer then bart recognized the one word it came endlessly repeated with growing force osama osama osama osama now hands were on his vehicle it shook they rocked it the voices matched the faces anger and emotion he bounced in his seat without the restraint of the belt his head would have hit the ceiling he felt lightheaded not afraid he was rolling and the chant reached a new pitch of intensity then came the siren the crowd melted as the street cleared a police wagon drove down it at speed extraordinary but the sun shone through the windows and light bathed bart another few seconds if the siren had not made the crowds run he would have felt the fear he was no hero he looked to the side no particular reason just checking it was clear for him to accelerate away he could see past the grand mosque a black wagon was pulling away from the squares centre a man scattered sawdust from a sack threw it on to the ground then moved on chucked more handfuls down and did it again he thought that the executioner would already have cleaned his sword would already have gone he drove away three mens heads had been severed from their bodies the bodies and the heads would now be in the black wagon the crowd had chanted an icons name the condemned would not have been rapists murderers or drugs traffickers the crowd had chanted the name of osama bart felt could not hide from it a creeping sense of excitement the proximity of death the name of osama bin laden the power of the crowd made that excitement course in him he hated the place the regime the country the life he led the blood now covered with sawdust the wagon the chant and the hands that had rocked his vehicle he was confused and the adrenaline pulsed gave him a wild message it thrilled him everything he hated he shared with that crowd he had no loyalties he identified bart gasped he drove fast but the voice echoed in his head you leave when i say so you are going bart nowhere he went to see a man who had fallen off a chair while changing a lightbulb to juan gonsalves a telephone call was the better medium for a problem than an electronic message electronics left a nonerasable trail and settled for eternity in a mans or a womans records he called wilbur schwarz on a secure line at six thirty in the morning washington dc time and his confidence that schwarz would be at his desk was justified schwarz oversaw the agencys counterterrorism operations in the kingdom from a windowless office at langley was close to retirement and his dedication would be missed gonsalves trusted him wilbur i am not making a complaint it is offtherecord and i dont want it to go formal you shipped in a team with predators to shaybah ok so far it seems accepted they are doing test flights to examine extreme heat over a desert yeah yeah it is some desert trouble is theyve been shorted one pilot and one sensor operator these kids are great but theyre low on fuel and they dont have backup theyre working round the clock and then some i was down yesterday and they were dead on their feet you have to understand that desert it didnt get to be called empty quarter for no reason it is empty you want sand you got it anything else you havent they spend hours just watching sand i suppose the first day the sand looks pretty not after that now get me right i am not saying they are already inefficient thats too big a word i am saying too much is being asked not for me to tell you what sort of help they need or what is possible in the budget what i am telling you is that they are liable in my opinion to make an error to miss something they are searching a hundred thousand square miles of fuckall i dont want to predict disaster here but in my view thats where we are heading wilbur can we do something here first thing i had to do when i was down yesterday was lift them get their morale up not easy you got me wilbur will you crunch some numbers and come up with something that eases the load try caleb knelt he could not have matched fahds cries or the simple devotion of hosni or the dignity and belief in god of rashid and his son but he tried sapped by exhaustion burned suffering the pain of his sores asking for strength caleb felt comfort in his prayers only the iraqi tommy sitting away from them crosslegged his back to them was not a part of them when the prayers were finished when the sun was directly above them and the only shade was between their feet the guide measured out their midday water ration it was poured with great care ghaffur holding the mug and rashid tipping the water bag over the mug there was no line drawn or scratched on the inside of the metal mug but caleb sensed the accuracy with which rashid doled it out not a mouthful more or less for any of them when they had all drunk the voice burst over the sand you here you come here rashid was beside tommys camel the voice had been a command rashids arm pointed at the iraqi who swore then spat into the sand beside him you obey me you come here caleb remembered the tension that the prayers and the water and his own tiredness had filtered from his mind the iraqi was now the target of the guides anger you are to obey me and you are to come to me tommy pushed himself up brushed the sand off the seat of his trousers and started a slow indifferent walk towards rashid and his camel fahd watched him and hosni and the boy caleb strained to hear the voice of rashid was quiet but with poison how many water bags do you carry the surly grudging response i carry four how many are on the camel four of course count them show me there are four caleb saw tommy shrug as if he dealt with an idiot he counted aloud as he moved round the camel there is one there is two here is three and here is the savage interruption where is four the shoulders crumpled i dont know where is four you are responsible for the water bags you carry i am responsible i do not know where it is all the bindings before we started were secure i show you where is the fourth water bag i tested all the bindings then defiance if you know where the water bag is then why ask me i dont know with his arm rashid gestured back where they had come caleb struggled to follow the line on their zigzag path of the arm the light from the sun bounced back from the sand he thought he saw a speck dark against the red of the sand but could not know at first whether his eyes tricked him he held his hands over them shaded them opened them wider peered and saw the speck again the wind moved the surface sand seemed to make a slight mist over the desert floor he saw it clearly held it for a few seconds but then the brightness in his eyes and the pain in them made him look away he did not understand how a water bag could have fallen from tommys camel four hundred yards back or more he blinked screwed his eyes together to cut out the pain there is your fourth water bag i see it go pick it up bring it to us the iraqi had no fight in him he could not shout or bluster or beg to have done so would have denied his dignity destroyed his pride caleb saw him reach up and snatch the hair at his camels neck lock his fingers in it then try to drag it down to the kneeling position caleb remembered how the order of march that morning had been changed he had no longer taken backmarker had been replaced at the tail of the march by the iraqi and he remembered how rashid had stopped let the rest of them pass him and dropped back until he rode alongside tommy then had come up fast to regain his position at the head of them you dont take the camel the iraqi spat his answer am i to walk you are not to waste the strength of the camel you walk the camel did not lose the water bag fuck you it is your responsibility you walk back and pick up the water bag i will not you pick it up and you bring it back to us and then we will go on the pitch of tommys voice rose i am a man of importance i have a role in this fucking idiotic journey you are paid to escort me rashids voice had quietened was hard for caleb to hear if you do not go back pick up the water bag and bring it to us then we leave you we ride the camels and go on you will run after us for a hundred strides then you will fall back we will be gone over a horizon and you will be alone which way do you choose spinning on his heel the sand scuffing at his feet tommy turned to each of them who backed him none did who spoke for him none did not hosni and not fahd caleb stared back at him with a brutal kick tommy heaved sand up on to rashids legs then started to walk he took a straight line not the zigzag path right and left that rashid had led them on after finding the first of the two marker posts caleb asked of the boy would your father leave a man here walk away from him the boy said if we had no love for him no trust for him then yes we would leave him the beat of the tension grew tommy walked upright and there was a roll in his stride hosni ducked his head down as if his eyes could no longer follow him the heat seared all of them fahd seemed to shiver the sand around tommy shimmered they had gone far to the right in the zigzag and when they had cut back to the left they had not been near the direct line that tommy took as he tramped never looking back towards the speck that was the dropped water bag rashid did not look over his shoulder but his face was close to tommys camels head and he murmured soft words in its ear and stroked the hair of its neck tommy was halfway to the water bag the speck caleb did not know what would happen only that the sands were a place of death a cruel place a place with as little mercy as a hangmans shed tommy walked the straight line he was the only one caleb realized it who did not know what would be the end of it he had been away from the camp for a whole night and away from the march for most hours of a day through that mornings march after the marker posts every turn that rashid had made had been planned and he would have gone back to the tail of the caravan and ridden beside the iraqi and the iraqi would have been dead to the world astride the camel with the sun beating on his head and the torpor of the endless vista of the sand sea would have dulled him the iraqi would not have known that the guides fingers released a water bag from the baggage and then tossed it aside left it to lie on the sand left it where it could just be seen when the halt was called for water and prayers the cry came back to them carried on the wind caleb thought tommy a smaller man shorter cut off stunted there was a little squeal from the boy for a moment as caleb saw it the iraqi stood and tried to walk but could not and fell all around him the sand was clean unmarked it was where the zigzag trail had not crossed the cry became a scream caleb remembered because he hit my father he is dead nothing else is possible the iraqi tried to stand but caleb could not see his shins or his knees the arms flailed and with each struggling movement the iraqi sank the first cry had been shock then anger the last cry the loudest was terror he went to ghaffur grabbed the boys arm held it so that the boy could not break loose you knew of the quicksand my father knew it is not by chance that we came past it since he struck my father we changed the route we came this way for a purpose to kill a man he struck my father how much time have we lost to kill a man perhaps a day half a day he freed the boy the cry came again louder and shriller there had been bogs in afghanistan once he had seen a goat sinking in mud had heard its bleating but then the grass carpet covering the bog had been of a deeper brighter more treacherous green then one of the arabs with caleb had fired a single shot from his assault rifle and the bullet had disintegrated the skull of the goat it had not been shot to end its misery but to stop the bleating caleb would not have thought of quicksands the same as a bog in the desert where it might not have rained for ten years fifteen to the noses of the camels there would have been a scent of the buried moisture under the surface of the sand and the guide had known the purpose of the marker posts it had been a killing as planned and prepared for as any execution he saw the chest of the iraqi and his head and his arms the man struggled caleb thought tommy struggled so that he would sink quicker finish it faster he looked around rashid had the camels kneeling and was waving to them to join him caleb now had his back to tommy he walked past fahd perched on the hump as his camel awkwardly stood and heard the saudis sneer do you want to help him as you helped the woman he understood more he too was tested his strength or his weakness was tested he climbed on to his saddle and gave gently the command he had heard the guide use and the beautiful one rocked him shook him and stood a scream came on the wind tommys upper shoulders his neck head and arms would still be above the sands level but caleb did not turn the cry was for mercy and for help the cry was to him they rode away the guide now ruled them they were in his hands dependent on his skills the iraqi their brother in arms had been condemned and none of them hosni fahd or caleb had fought the guide for his life he rode beside rashid caleb asked bleakly when you took the water bag from tommys camel was it full to kill him did you waste a bag of water rashid said it was filled with sand at that distance had it not been full it would not have been seen i did not waste water the last scream burst behind them called him then was stifled and died there was the sound of the wind against calebs robe the rustle of the loose sand it blew and the thud of the camels strides he never looked back camp delta guantanamo bay the guards swaggered behind the orderly ivho pushed the food trolley along the cellblock corridor he was at the back of the cell and he wore pathetic gratitude on his face earlier there had been the sounds of a military band playing and singing and cheering had been carried into the block by the wind off the sea it was the second fourth of july since he had been brought to the camps from the scale of the music singing and cheering he thought there had been a bigger parade than the previous year when he had been held in xray through his dropped eyes he saw the aggression of the guards and he thought the music and their love of their country had been primed by the day the pathetic gratitude was the act caleb had mastered he had absorbed the routine the days of his week were governed by his exercise session two days away and by his visit to the showers in three days he had not been interrogated for twentynine days and the only break in the routine would be if he was summoned again some men in the block were destroyed by the routine had their minds turned by it or whimpered because of it or screamed in the frustration that it brought he played the part of the model prisoner whose imprisonment was a mistake the plastic food tray was slipped through the hatch at the base of the barred door to the cell he ducked his head in submissive thanks the men with red necks and shaven heads huge in their uniforms towered in the corridor two of the four carried wooden truncheons and the hand of one who stood back from the trolley fidgeted restlessly over a pistol holster caleb smiled inanely and waited for them to move on then he would crawl over the floor to the tray a guard said loud we got independence day son to celebrate you got special food today you son enjoy the day as much as we do the voice dropped to conversational goddamn gook doesnt understand a single goddamn word goddamn pitiful arent they goddamn pieces of shit caleb treasured the few hours spent close to the bodyguard and still fed off the strength given him the guards and the food trolley moved on he was superior to them believed it despised them the success of the deceit gave him raw pleasure his head bobbed he showed his gratitude they were despised and they were hated the strength gave him attention to detail it might be a year away or two or five years his freedom but he prepared for it word had seeped through the wire mesh sides of the cages that four men the first had been released his life in the cage was consumed by the detail primary in the detail was the removal the scrubbing clean of all traces in his mind of an earlier life the final relegation of nationality culture upbringing work all gone second was the creating of two compartments for his life in the privacy of his soul he was abu khaleb fighter in the brigade and in the eyes of the guards who fed exercised and escorted him he was fawzi alateh taxidriver but the detail went deep into the heart of the deceit he prayed five times a day when he whispered to the prisoners in the next cells it was about a dead family and a bombed village and a childhood among orchards he assumed there would be plants informers among prisoners rotated round the cages he assumed also and the belief bred paranoia that microphones were buried in the cell back wall and that hidden cameras watched him he conformed utterly to the image he created the taxidrivers if there had been suspicion of him or if he had been denounced he would have been subjected to ferocious interrogation but he was not the detail protected him the guards moved on and the trolley squealed to the corridors end then they came back and one whistled cheerfully they could not see into his heart could not read the hatred he lived the lie did it well and the second fourth of july of his imprisonment faded as the dusk came and the bright lights shone down on the block somethingll turn up lizzyjo said gently you look all stressed out something always turns up he was crouched over the workbench and his fingers toyed with the joystick the muscles in his shoulders were stiff knotted and his neck was tight so that the veins and throat tubes stood tall his eyes behind the thick spectacle lenses had pricks of pain marty said flat lets just hope so he used his forearm wiped the sweat off his forehead on manual control first lady quartered a box whose nearest point to the ground control at shaybah was three hundred and twenty land miles at four and a half miles altitude she crossed the desert floor at eightyfour miles per hour but when she was up there silent secret and fragile the crosswinds were fierce the upperair turbulence dictated that marty should fly manual and the extra load of the two hellfire missiles two hundred and thirteen pounds weight one on each of the fragile wings made her sluggish to commands if the winds first lady encountered at that altitude had been across or down the runway she would still be under the awning shelter and grounded he had to fly her and each time the high winds tossed her and the picture rolled rocked and jerked marty heard the sharp intake of lizzyjos breath her irritation you know what bosnia and afghanistan were walks in the park compared to this place were they his hands were on the joystick his eyes were locked on the cascade of figures of wind speed wind direction wind force in front of him and the screen above that showed the sand the damn sand the sweat ran on his back and over his stomach that is a comfort but we are here here in this goddamned awful place we have to make it work you sound lizzyjo forgive me like youre full of shit from human resources or admin they send you that speech the hardest thing about arguing with or insulting lizzyjo was that she just laughed she laughed loudly he always wondered if her man back now and minding the kid had ever argued with her or insulted her about her determination to put agency work in front of rearing the kid and putting his dinner on the table when he came back from selling lifeanddeath policies he probably had and shed probably laughed at him when her laugh subsided she pulled a face her serious one that face made her downright pretty and the sweat that glistened on it made her prettier we were given a difficult assignment as difficult as it comes we are doing our best what more can we do what does not help our best is you sulking like a kid without a krispy kreme lighten up marty lighten up and spit it out spit what out he knew he was playing awkward he edged first lady on a gradual turn to port side and the picture of the sand under the realtime camera blurred each time he made an adjustment dictated by wind speed and deviated from the straight line of flight a handkerchief of sand below the lens was missed and maybe the handkerchief was big enough for camels with boxes for men for a target but if he did not fly into the wind when it had mean strength he risked damaging the bird like the guys back at bagram had lost one and it had been down on the ground broken and smashed a sight to make a mans eyes water an instructor at nellis had said that the predator mq with hellfires under the wings was like a butterfly out in the rain could fly but not fly happy what do you want from me give me the skinny whatevers pissing you off tell me he gave it to her well for one the head honcho comes down spiels crappy intelligence expands the search area we are in a nohoper thats my its what we got to work with next marty stumbled stuttered my picture i shelled out for that it got sand in it the storm it got sand between the glass and the print and its got condensation hot days and cold nights its the only picture i ever wanted and it might just be fucked up she said sweet and soft im sorry i never had a picture maybe when we get out of here it can get repaired im sorry next he rallied the airconditionings going down its half strength we are both dripping wet there was a bleep beside her and a green light blinked just think about it if the airconditioning fails were fucked were gonna bake she hit keys made alive a blank screen on which a message flickered the outside temperature is one hundred and twenty degrees were gonna cook weve got an intolerable lizzyjo said curtly what we have got marty is a visitor i am going to channel eight against the grinding purr of the failing airconditioning came a clear calm voice brought by satellite from across the world the voice was langleys hi marty and greetings to you lizzyjo my call sign is oscar golf thats how youll know me you may both feel out on the end of the line but that is going to change all the time that first lcidy and carnival girl are airborne and transmitting material from camera and infrared we will be monitoring the output you are not alone we are right behind you if you need comfort breaks meal stops rest and the predators are up we are here and ready to step in thats what i wanted to say over and out the sound feed was cut marty slumped his hands were off the joystick and held his head they dont think were capable he said his voice a murmur through his fingers like were not professional shit and its all i wanted to hit to win what we both want marty both of us her fingertips brushed against the back of his neck and slipped in the sweat to the tight knot of his shoulder muscles she was broad bronx like she was in a truckers bar fuck em there was an unused plate and one portion less of water was poured into the mug when they had halted the boy had searched for an hour but had found neither dead wood nor roots when the sun had sunk and the cold came they were without a fires warmth and the bread could not be baked the travellers ate the uncooked dough and dried dates drank the water in silence were subdued but rashid spoke quietly to his son from the far side of the circle they made and his voice was too indistinct for caleb to hear the cool nestled his body and he seemed to hear the scream of the man whom the quicksand had taken it pealed in his ears shrieked for his help caleb broke the quiet that was a game each move planned a game was played and tommy was killed why did it have to be a game he heard fahds cackle do you wish to be told is it important it is important to know why one of our family was killed in an entertainment the wind sang around them and hosnis words were frail against it he struck the guide that condemned him after he had hit the bedu tommy was dead i negotiated the death whatever tommys value to us to fahd and you and i he was dead if we had tried to protect tommy the guide with his son would have left us it is the duty of fahd and i and especially of you to achieve the end of our journey you in particular because of your value do you understand i do not understand why it was a game an entertainment again fahd chuckled again hosni answered he was your friend you talked to him you heard of the life of a hangman and you identified with him and you stayed with the woman who had seen us and who endangered us and you helped her it was not an entertainment it had a purpose we watched would you go to save him would you run across the sand to him would you lie on your stomach where the sand softened and reach with your hand for his very closely we watched you you did not look at him you turned your back on him he called for you he faced death and he called for the only one among us whom he thought would help him it was tommys judgement that you were not strong enough for what is asked of you he called you you turned your back on him and rode away you showed us your strength caleb whispered hoarsely if i had helped him if i had pulled tommy from the quicksand if i had brought him back what then would have happened hosnis voice was sharp the guide would have shot you both but you first we would have had our answer because you would have been of no use to us the guide would have shot you it was agreed caleb sat a long time in the darkness he saw the patterns of the stars and the moons mountains and he felt the freshness of the wind on his body he shivered sat hunched with his arms close round him rashid told a story to his son of a warrior in the history of the bedouin and the boy was against his knee and rapt in his listening he thought of a man whose cries he had ignored and the death of that man in the sinking sand the voices eddied round him and the wind snatched at his robe and the sores below his buttocks itched in pain he thought of his promise that he had not made a mistake in helping the woman and the test set for him hosni leaned across and jabbed his finger into calebs chest tomorrow is a new day it is the day we start to recall your past make the old life live caleb said i killed the old life forgot it the old body shook hosnis voice had the keenness of a knife you breathe on it reclaim it chapter eleven caleb could not escape the dream he was drawn towards the chasm recall the past reclaim it the voice was at his back the chasm was ahead of him each time he stared into the chasm he wavered each time he hesitated the voice behind him was more demanding the last time he approached the chasm his stride quickened he ran launched his feet kicking he hung in the air a chill seemed to grip him he would not reach the far side of the chasm it seemed to widen the moons light hovered on the far rim he heard his own cry for help his arms were outstretched his fingers splayed he was falling the chasm widened he snatched the dream played back to him each moment of his jump then each moment of his fall the fingers caught the rim the tips and nails of his fingers grabbed at grass and loose earth at rocks and the roots of trees his feet bare had no support grass came away in his hands and earth crumbled he slipped back however hard he struggled for a grip the weight of his body took him further down into the chasm the rocks that had broken free fell past his face bruised it and cannoned against his legs then dropped a single root held him he heard the rocks bounce on the chasms side he grasped the root and waited for the noise of the final strike of the rocks against the chasms floor nothing only the fainter noise of the rocks tumble the chasm had no floor he did not know if the root dry in his fists would snap if it snapped he would fall he hauled himself up the root held him he reached over the rim onehanded and the root made a support for his knee and his fingers grappled in the earth and the grass he crawled on to the rim he would never go back he lay on the grass and his breath sobbed in his throat he looked behind him across the chasm and he could not see hosni only a mist the wind seemed to lug at his clothes he saw the terrace of houses he walked through a door a hall a kitchen and he looked out across a yard over the low wall was the canal towpath he knew he would never go back over the chasm he wept caleb woke he did not know where he was did not know who he was the boy stood over him dark and silhouetted against the stars you screamed did i you made the camels restless and that woke me then i heard you scream i am sorry it was a dream what was the dream nothing something about the past was it so bad for you to scream it was only a dream it was not real how long is it before dawn enough time to sleep again co away i hope you sleep again and do not dream i hank you ghaffur i never dream the boy said and drifted away into the darkness caleb lay on his side and as if he were now vulnerable his knees were pulled up against his chest the images recalled from the past and reclaimed played in his mind but his eyes were open he was too frightened to sleep if he slept he might be pushed again towards the chasm might have to jump it again might feel again the grass and earth and rocks breaking away as he clung to them the emptiness below his feet he had crossed the chasm there was no going back his memory lived caleb lay in the sand and waited for the first light in the east murky pale the dawn came as beth finally regained her bungalow dead tired hungry and thirsty although her headlights had caught the car she did not register it until she had to swerve to miss it it was parked in the unmade road outside the gates that led up to the carport beside the villa she knew the mercedes top of the range and she swore she took her time outside her front door which was ajar she unloaded the land rover on the patio she dumped her cold box her water canisters which were empty her sleepingbag her clipboard and the filled sample sack she felt a wreck sand was stuck to her face held there by the sweat oil streaks were on her hands and her blouse and grime was caked under her fingernails she wanted to lie in a bath gorge herself from the refrigerator then sleep what she did not want was a visitor the exhaustion caught her as she pushed the door wider for a moment she leaned against the jamb then went inside to face him the deputy governor was sitting on the couch in her living room how long had be been there the answer was in the ashtray on the couchs arm filled with crushed filters god hello she said playing natural and failing what a surprise the response was bitter an attack that the politeness and softness of the voice did not hide where have you been i came yesterday in the morning yesterday in the evening in the morning the maid told me you had packed food and water as if for the desert and in the evening the bungalow was still empty in two hours time if you had not returned i was going to call out the trackers a search would have been mounted for you i was worried you left no note no indication of where you had gone while you were away there was a storm in the sands you can easily understand my anxiety i was on a field survey trip it took longer she said and knew the explanation was inadequate and hollow there was a storm and you were alone i am disappointed miss bethany that you declined to take the offer that i have always made to you that i provide an escort with reliable vehicles for you to go into the sands exceptionally disappointed a person such as yourself a distinguished scholar under my patronage and support has no need to travel by herself with all the attendant risks that creates he was indeed and beth understood it her patron and supporter without that patronage and support her visa was worthless she would be on the next nights flight out of riyadh im sorry truly sorry she said i just didnt think being selfish that anyone would worry she could still feel the touch of him she had thought of him no name all through the night as she had bumped sped and woven always searching for the hard salt flats ahead the lights beams arrowing over the sand and guiding her he had been with her he had left her he had roused feelings in her passionless loveless life yet she had not owned him she owned everything she wanted except him he had gone away from her gone away into the sands gone beyond reach the deputy governor prince of the kingdom owned her she was his chattel i sincerely apologize it was selfishness what else can i say i thought only of myself i very much respect and am grateful that you worried for me well short of getting down on her knees and ripping off her blouse and exposing her back for a bloody good flogging there was not much more she could do at the convent when in minor trouble she had learned that the contrite approach softened anger reduced punishment beth hung her head you better than any foreigner understand the dangers of the sands you know them as the bedu do you know them as i know them i do it is basic procedure that if you go into the sands for even half a day you leave a map of your route it is i was fearful for you the ashtray told her he had been on her couch for the whole night his robe was crumpled creased from sitting through the long hours in the quiet of her bungalow she wondered where the man without a name was where a little caravan of camels was had he already moved because the dawn had come along with the men who had wanted to kill her and him she owned nothing of him he was not of the bedu not of the arabs she did not know where he came from or what was his destination or the purpose of his journey he went in secrecy others to preserve the secret would have killed her her life was saved by his trust in her she smiled dreamed you take it lightly miss bethany my anxiety and your danger no no i can only apologize the silken voice hardened the storm miss bethany the airfield here was closed i could not come back from riyadh because of the storm nothing moved here because of the storm i was concerned for your welfare the lie came easily i missed it no problem i saw it coming hunkered down in shelter there was some drifting round the wheels but i dug them out when had she last lied beth could not remember it was not in her nature to lie everything she had learned at the convent and at home had told her that an untruth chased a liar the question slithered quietly from him did you see anybody miss bethany in the sands she blustered no who any travellers any traders why do you ask i merely ask because if we had had to search for you miss bethany i wonder if we would have met travellers or traders who had seen you and would have directed us towards where you were no it was the second lie i did not see anybody these are difficult times there are rumours it is said men travel in the sands who are illegal and dangerous only whispers i do not have evidence of it the lie tripped from her tongue i told you there was nobody promise me you will not go alone again into the sands i saw nobody but i want to tell you what i did see she told the deputy governor about the ejecta field where the ironore fragments had come down and she ran outside she tipped the sample bag on to the plastic patio table and the stones and glass pieces rattled and rolled on the tables surface his hands were cupped and she laid the largest pieces in them his fingers stroked them she told him that when she had written her paper when it was submitted with maps photographs and samples to the americanbased society that collated meteorite finds she would give the field his name she saw the pleasure in his face and the joy with which his fingers hesitant touched the pieces he had been frightened for her he did not own her she owned him there was one man whom she did not own as he handled the pieces with love beth heard the soft drone in the air and looked down from her patio into the brightness of the low sun she saw the small aircraft lift from the runway it did not have the grace she had seen before but seemed to yaw and struggle clumsily for height there were khaki tubes one under each wing the aircraft climbed she saw that her patron looked up watched the aircrafts slow pained climb then his eyes were back on the stones bright with fascination for them she had lied she had avoided the promise she let the deputy governor keep two pieces for his collection then saw him go beth ran her bath and stripped she did not recognize how greatly the lies she had spoken had changed her high in the control tower beside the runway the deputy governor was given binoculars he raised them and studied the tent camp by the far edge of the perimeter fence and a frown puckered on his forehead the beauty of the glass and the stones slipped from his mind his host passed the glass of saudi champagne it was done awkwardly and the mans heavily strapped wrist restricted any fluency of movement bart smiled took the glass he thought his host would have preferred a sling as if it were a purple heart ribbon but bart had decreed that a tightly wrapped bandage was appropriate it was only a sprain by way of reward for coming across riyadh at the speed appropriate for an emergency he had been invited to an allamerican picnic it was not permitted to barbecue in the park of the diplomatic quarter but the hosts wife had cooked the beefburgers in her villa kitchen had wrapped them well in tinfoil and they were still warm the talk bustled round him and bart thought he was expected to look and feel privileged to be present i dont know where this country is going except down i dont see a future here once they got it into their thick skulls that they could do without us without americans when theyd got that delusion into their heads they were going nowhere but down the pan what really sucks is the absence of gratitude i have spent ten whole years here eleven come thanksgiving and i have never heard a saudi say that he is grateful for what we have done in their country all right they have oil all right so we want the oil at every stage we have shown them how to exploit and market that asset up to last year we have posted the finest young men and women in our armed forces here let them live out there in the desert for the protection of the regime i ask you did you ever hear any thanks arabic for thank you im using it from morning to night is shukran and i dont hear it said to me much you know in ninetyone we fought a war to stop this place ending up as an outstation of baghdad and we get no gratitude bart seldom met americans they inhabited their own compounds they used their own chamber of commerce had their own fencedoff section of the grandstand at the races insularity was the name of their game these men bart accepted it were not fools bombastic yes arrogant yes stupid no they are living in denial their heads are in the sand theyre the source of al qaeda they bankrolled that gang of fanatics zealots psychopaths i read that thinktank report from back home quote for years individuals and charities based in saudi arabia have been the most important source of funds for al qaeda and for years saudi officials have turned a blind eye to the problem unquote you wait till that nineeleven law case gets up steam you remember what that pentagon briefer called this virtuous and godfollowing kingdom he called it a kernel of evil what i say who needs saudi arabia we got iraq we dont need these people were the power theyre nothing they sowed the field let them harvest it his mind drifted the condemnations and criticisms wafted around the linen tablecloth food filled the mouths the best that could be bought in the supermarkets of the riyadh shopping malls he thought they rolled out this talk each time they met yet still retained a fervour for it if the place was such shit why stay bart reckoned they stayed because the money was good and because they were one and all too proud to consider that the al qaeda crowd the fanatics zealots psychopaths could make them scuttle for the airport why did he stay bart half choked on the end of his burger maybe it took more courage to run bart could have torn up the airline ticket not caught the flight to tel aviv could have refused to get into the waiting car could not have checked into the dan hotel and settled himself into a room with a beach view to stand against the wind took more bottle than flowing with it an englishman had come first had thanked him on behalf of a medical charity whose name and background bart assumed had been cobbled together in the last week the englishman had eczema on his wrists and the signs of overhigh blood pressure bart was good on symptoms and a nasal voice what i heard you were looking for a route back to respectability old boy i can put you on that route but i promise that travelling on it might be bumpy in my sort of work i trade i do a friend a favour and i know ill get a favour back lets call you the favour you are the favour im doing for a friend bart could have walked out then but it would have taken more guts than he had an hour after the englishman had left him while hed been watching the swimmers on the beach there had been a knock on the door he had met ariel ariel was cheerful bouncy had the happy enthusiasm that made problems disappear it would have taken a better man than bart to refuse ariel after the burgers flushed down with the bogus champagne the wives sliced portions of apple pie crowned them with dollops of softscoop vanilla ice cream from the cold box and the venom gathered strength around him what i cant stand is the corruption nothings transparent the skimmers the payoffs backhanders and the middlemens cuts i can live with that the stone in my shoe is the waste the extravagance you know what it cost the last time the old king went for his summer vacation to spain three million dollars a day believe me if they dont learn and fast a truckload of humility one day theyll wake up and find were gone then youll hear some hollering the hosts wife smiled at him like it was outside church and everyone felt good you havent said much dr bartholomew there was much he could have said but bart chose the easy path been enjoying myself too much wonderful food fantastic hospitality couldnt have been bettered al mazan village near jenin occupied west bank he saw the blood drip down and felt the guilt the best house in the village on the central square was an older building it would have been constructed before the second world war perhaps by a merchant and it represented a longgone prosperity in the palestinian community before bart had arrived to work in the village the building had been a target for israeli tank shells during an armoured incursion now extraordinarily the family that had long ago scattered from the west bank and had made money in the united states of america had sent funds for the restoration of the building and had pledged it to the village as a centre for local administration adult education and for a communal meetingplace the first stage of spending the donated money was to erect scaffolding so that the building could be made safe around the shell holes over the weeks he had been in the village bart had watched the erection of the scaffolding but had seen precious little work carried out there and hed thought the benefactors had only a damn small return to show for their bucks the body hung from the scaffolding he was a doctor who was familiar with the southwest of england the torbay district of the county of devon the town of torquay where he came from could be summoned by cream teas rolling fields grazed by cattle families holidaying on beaches retirement homes for men and women in their twilight years the body of a lynch victim was suspended from the rusted scaffolding poles the vomit rose in his throat he understood knew how far he had fallen the legs no longer kicked but the rope between the poles and the neck twisted in the light wind and the heavy rain the body spiralled rhythmically the rain was dragged off the windscreen by the wipers bart had a clear view of the victim and of the mob below he could not have said whether the knife cuts that loosed the dripping blood had been inflicted before the victim was hanged or while he was hanging but still alive or after life had been jerked away the rain fell hard on the body and the mans tshirt was soaked against his chest and his back and the flow of water made the blood run easily in the dulled light he saw the brightness of knives and a butchers cleaver raised above the heads of the chanting crowd bart had been driving into the square had seen the milling mob had braked only when he had stopped had he seen the object of the crowds fury the body below the rope and the drip of the blood kids were at his window they tapped on it their faces were alive with excitement one wore a football shirt from a german team it was not a game that the kids had watched as spectators not a goal that had thrilled them it was a killing by lynching their voices jabbered broken english at him their faces were distorted by the rain running on the drivers window he did not need to be told he was an informer he was a traitor paid by the israelis he had his reward for taking their money his information killed a hero of the armed struggle it was necessary for samuel bartholomew to play out his part to stifle the vomit he took up his medical bag locked the vehicle and walked forward he was a pied piper kids ran and skipped after him joseph in the hut at the checkpoint had told him we take great care of you you are a jewel to us so precious have no fear to save him an informer of lesser importance had been sacrificed word would have been passed a channel of disinformation would have been opened he had killed an activist that he could justify bart had seen the photographs of the aftermath of the attacks by suicide bombers he could tell himself that the death of an activist by his hand was acceptable not the death of an informer that he might be protected the crowd thinned the knives and the butchers cleaver were lowered voices hushed he walked the middle line he would not condemn nor would he condone bart said a little stammer in his voice t think it would be better if he were taken down could you please cut him down a man his face masked climbed nimbly up the scaffolding unfastened the rope and the sodden body fell it crumpled on to the paving near to barts feet he felt weak he wondered if his knees would buckle he saw the woman who huddled all in black at the buildings doorway the crowd had thinned and the kids the woman watched bart her eyes flitting off the body to his in a croaking aged voice through the translation of a youth the woman said to bart am his mother i came his wife would not come his children did not come his wife said he had shamed her family his children said he their father had betrayed them when he was taken his wife hit him and his children spat on him only i came who will bury him bart bent felt the neck and wrist of the body and found no pulse what do do do i bury him alone what he did was for his family he took the money from the israelis but it was to feed his family who had no food the israelis killed him and i curse them they will not bury him who will you have not spoken hosnis voice was coaxing you are like a man who is tortured fahd said the egyptian had dropped back and the saudi had come forward they rode on either side of caleb it was the middle of the afternoon the sun high and he did not welcome them did you find your memory did you breathe life on it as hosni said you should he stared ahead watched the guides back as the man rolled with the movement of his camel each day they went more slowly and each hour less ground was covered he sensed they were either near to their destination or the march would fail he had not asked the guide how much further they had to travel but that morning and at the midday break there had been a smaller measure of water in the mug the snap was long gone from the camels stride they went heavily and the crates had had to be taken off them before they would attempt to climb a slope that a week before they would have managed without having to be unloaded if they failed they would die in the sand first to die would be the camels then hosni and fahd then caleb after he had died it would be the turn of ghaffur the boy and last to die would be the boys father the guide caleb had no fear of death in the desert the fear was of his recalled reclaimed memory if you have no memory you are worthless his memory had given him the terrace of redbrick homes and the front door with black paint the number askew because a screw had fallen from the base of the second plastic digit he had walked through a narrow hall where the wallpaper peeled where the pattern of the stair carpet was worn away with age he had gone through a kitchen that stank of old frying fat and through a yard littered with rubbish at the back of the yard against the low wall the dumped washingmachine lay on its side they were back the images that would have betrayed him to the interrogators he felt weakened you have to have the past and live with it you are not an arab we have an army of arabs caleb said where i come from no one not anyone i knew would have lasted a day in this place no one would have not more than a day i can survive because i have forgotten the past is nothing to me would they tell him what was wanted of him he could not ask fahd dropped back and hosni kicked his camels sides and went forward he realized that hosni had never looked into his face and he wondered how far the blindness affected the elderly egyptian then the sand swallowed his thoughts and the pains from the blister sores consumed him the caravan moved on this is oscar golf your last turn to starboard because of wind direction change to northnorthwest meant we missed out we didnt get picture on the base of that dune we lost vision of an area we estimate to be zero point nine miles by zero point three miles could you go back please could you repeat over that ground please oscar golf out it was the third time in the five hours first lady had been up that the voice always so reasonable had come seeping into their headphones lizzyjo responded wouldnt have trusted marty to roger that we will make that manoeuvre this is oscar golf much appreciated looks like flying conditions are not easy oscar golf out marty was on the joystick and lizzyjo called the coordinates to him of a new backtracking course that would bring first lady on a second run over a stretch of sand that was zero point nine miles in length by zero point three miles in width she sensed that marty burned everything they did and said was now watched and listened to the feeling hers and martys was that they were no longer trusted and each time the voice oozed politeness the feeling grew it was not unusual for pictures in real time to be going live to langley shed had that in bosnia and afghanistan but the pitch of the disembodied voice seemed to doubt their skill marty took it harder than her after the second call he had freed his right hand from the joystick and scribbled on his notepad this feels like three in a bed shed grimaced no humour had leaned across and written worse like his mothers in my kitchen everything overheard every move monitored they were spied on but lizzyjo would have had to admit that the starboard turn had clipped an area of desert the area was a quarter of a square mile of flat gold and redcoloured sand and they had missed it because of the upperair turbulence they went back over the camera surveyed empty sand lizzyjos eyes ached as she peered at the screen the voice of oscar golf when it came into the headphones and intruded into their world could always be justified to shut the goddamn voice up she strove for perfection the sandscape was infinite limitless and nothing moved down there there was a needle pain in her skull from concentration on the realtime images out in that wilderness a camel train was loaded with six crates escorted by perhaps six men she saw just the sand and the sloping dunes the high points and the flat expanses she looked for the camels the men for tracks there was nothing lizzyjo punched up the forecast she swore martys head rocked in exhaustion his eyes blinked shut then opened she mashed her fist into the small of his back she said doesnt let up does it the forecast is for stronger winds westerly tomorrow if the forecasts right theres no way were flying tomorrow lizzyjo was only a handful of years older than marty but she felt more often since they had come to shaybah as if she was his aunt and he was her kid nephew she was fonder of him a little more each day since they had shared the ground control just them together she hoped the wind speed up there four miles above the desert would strengthen and then the kid could sleep she cared for him wanted him to sleep and shed the exhaustion he smiled ruefully and her hand which had belted him rested on the skin of his forearm and the voice said this is oscar golf we fly tomorrow we fly every day if you didnt know it this is priority we ignore the manual instructions on what is possible until that target is found we fly to the limit oscar golf out are you sure are you telling me man you are sure sure and no argument its tied down his supervisor edgar had been off guantanamo for two days back at the pentagon for sessions on the preparations for retirement the pentagon had a good programme for readying longservice men in the defense intelligence agency for the coldshower shock of waking up on a monday morning and having no work to go to jed watched his superiors eyes twitch and his fingers fidget he might as well have rolled a hand grenade pin out across his supervisors desk maybe jed should have felt a tinge of sympathy for the man the physical reactions were clear enough signs that his supervisor had taken on board the seriousness of jeds message those two days while the supervisor had been lectured on pension income the tax implications of parttime employment in the civilian sector the psychology of switching allegiance from government service to a golf course had been well spent the audiotapes of the voices of the supposed taxidriver and the british unlawful combatant had been edited together and the nasal similarity could not be argued with you are saying the supervisors voice eddied away as if he could not stomach the enormity of a truth now striking him jed said i am saying we freed the wrong man i am saying that fawzi alateh taxidriver was a bogus identity we freed a man who was smart enough sufficiently intelligent to deceive us he was flown back to afghanistan so whats the problem round him up bring him back its a cakewalk jed pushed across the desk the signal from bagram from karen lebed the eyes scanned it and the fingers could not hold the paper steady there was a long sigh like it was personal pain god almighty did we deserve this cant say but its what weve got the supposition is that we released a britishorigin prisoner who most likely never drove an afghan taxi in his life i suggest you look on the bright side the supervisor was dulled id like to but where do i look all the times when the agency and the bureau guys had let him know they were the chosen people flashed in jeds mind every little insultt each putdown every sneer each patronizing quip floated by him he might have felt regret at his supervisors discomfort but not at any shit that landed on the agency and the bureau jed grinned i think other guys took that decision id say were clean the supervisors gloomy response i sat in only to rubber stamp i dont want to be offensive but you wouldnt have been in the loop the supervisor brightened it was just a list of names put down in front of me theyd already done the list jed are you aware of the ultimate potential endgame of this i know itll be a bad day for the bureau and the agency the supervisors fist tightened on the pencil he held there are bigger things in the world jed than turf wars look at it the implications of the release of a man who has gone to that deal of trouble to disguise his identity mean to me that he is a dedicated and committed activist we are not looking at some guy who is just anxious to get himself home we are talking dedication commitment that is a prime man a man capable of inflicting maximum danger there could be consequences jed real bad consequences but theyre not in our ballpark christ there is a bigger picture the supervisors shoulders dropped as if a burden weighed down on him and that picture is a verified homeland threat a britishborn and reared fighter with a shitty little heart filled with hate can go to places an arab cannot no name then we go find a name the supervisors pencil was stabbed close to jeds face i wouldnt want this plastered all over the walls jed threw his last card the ace card shouldnt i get on a plane give me time thought we dont have much time leave me to do this jed and my way i am not having a situation where my last days here are in a conflict zone with the bureau and the agency i am not jed scraped his chair back between grated teeth he bit back dont bury this if you are going to bury i am not i need twentyfour hours of time after twentyfour hours i should be on a plane dont think this can be buried and dont think i can be bounced off it its mine he left the file and the audiotapes on his supervisors desk he closed the door and left his man to work a strategy he walked back to his office and heard the noise of the camp around him the sun hit on him and he smelt the sea he did not know where the matched voices would take him if he was allowed to get on a plane he felt proud as if at last in his professional life he had achieved something of value he strode past the open doors of the agency team and past the doors of the bureau men he went into the interrogation block where a prisoner an escort and an interpreter waited for him and he thought of the chaos he had let loose he sat in front of the prisoner a yemeni but another face was there the yemenis features were gone had merged into those of a taller man with a strong nose and a powerful jaw that the cringing protestations of innocence could not hide and he thought of the skill of the man who had deceived them all the woman was forgotten as tommy was danger was forgotten only survival counted his mind was deadened and his memory gone the sun was in calebs eyes the dried air scraped his throat and the growing wind lifted sand from the hoofs of hosnis camel which pricked his face his eyes were squeezed shut against the grains if he opened his eyes blinked he saw hosnis back low across his saddle he rocked on the hump of the beautiful one and he thought lhat only her courage carried her forward she moved with leaden slow steps over the soft sand more often than on any other day he thought he would fall and he yearned for the evening and the smaller portion of water that his tongue would move round his mouth and the cold of the night the uncooked dough the handful of dates and then sleep he had heard fahd fall behind him and the shouts of the boy but he had not stopped had let the boy get fahd hack on to his camel at the last stop when the sun had been highest fiercest when they had remounted the kneeling camels rashid had put a rope round hosnis waist and had knotted it to the saddle hiss survival depended on himself the anger billowed in him caleb recognized it understood it the anger came in sharp surges it was the same anger as in the camps in xray and delta the target of the anger had been the guards the guards imprisoned him fahd and hosni were his gaolers they had the keys and the batons and they were around him his mind wandered loose he was their prisoner he had the hate for them as for the guards his throat without water was pricking with the pain his eyes hurt the blister sores ate at him he was the one supposedly with the strength and he was rocking sliding caleb toppled lost his hold he went down the beautiful ones flank was dumped in the sand he fell face first he heard the shrill laughter behind him the beautiful one had stopped and towered over him and the great brown eyes gazed down on him it was fahds laughter fahd reached down and caleb took his hand fahd heaved him up and caleb caught the reins that hung from the beautiful ones neck he climbed struggled pulled himself back into the saddle are you going to fail us we do not expect the mule to fail us caleb spat the sand is that what i am a mule a mule is noble a beast of burden he ran his tongue round his mouth let it gather the sand then scraped it with his finger off his tongue is that what i am to you a mule he repeated what else all the laughter had gone from fahds face it was grim closed a mule is important to us because it carries what we put on its back it goes where we want it to go carries what we want it to carry it is necessary for us to use the mule but if we thought it would fail us we would shoot it we would not waste food on it and we would find another mule you are a mule a pack animal you will carry what we put on your back caleb rode on towards his family instinctively he looked up around him ignored the sand blown into his face he scanned the dunes and the tips of the sand walls and he looked for danger and saw nothing once briefly he looked into the blue sky but then the low sun burned his eyes chapter twelve he thought of rain cooling healing and sweet spattering on to the panes of windows that last night he had slept had not dreamed woken as exhausted as when he had lain down on the sand in the morning they had set out again twice a bull camel loaded with two of the boxes had slopped had refused to go forward and each time rashid had come back from the front of them had taken the bulls head in his hands had put his own face close to it stroked and soothed its bellowing and whispered to it twice the bull camel had responded to the kindness of the guide had shown its loyalty to him had started again to walk into the strength of the wind it was late in the afternoon when they had halted not to pitch camp the guide said they would stop for a short time then go on caleb sat against the body of the kneeling beautiful one and felt the rhythmic panting of the beast against his back if he went where his memory took him he would have stood with his arms outstretched his head thrown back and his shirt unbuttoned and he would have let the rain cascade on to him when it had drenched him and his clothes had clung to him he would have danced and sung gloried in it he would not have huddled like the woman who pushed her baby in a buggy on the pavement or cringed from it like the man on the towpath who dragged his tiny ratting dog on a lead he yearned for the rain that would have cooled the heat burning him and soothed the blister sores that would have dribbled sweet on his lips the guide had poured water from the neck of a water bag into a metal mug that fahd had held fahd had carried the mug to hosni perhaps hosni did not see the mug clearly perhaps his eyesight failed him perhaps he was too confused by exhaustion by sunstroke hosni reached out snatched at the mug missed it and caught fahds wrist twisted it the mug toppled water fell from it like rain the water drops from the mug sparkled jerked caleb from his fantasy idiot fool fahd screamed hosni whimpered you wasted water imbecile hosni had the mug in his thin claw fingers and tugged for it more water slurped over the rim when fahd released his hold on the mug and hosni sagged back more water spilled i bring you water what do you do you throw it in the sand caleb watched said nothing the mug would have been a third full when fahd had offered it to hosnis stretchedout hands now there would only be a wetness at the mugs bottom you dont get any more you waste water you go without fahd yelled in his fury and his body quivered we should never have brought you he saw hosni tilt the mug so that the last drops would run into his mouth and then run his tongue round the sides and the base of it hosnis wet watery eyes seemed to plead with fahd as he prised the mug back from the fingers there is no more water for you i am not sharing my water with you fahd took away the mug caleb saw hosni his head bent scrape the film of sand off the place where the water had fallen to retrieve the sand that was darkened he cupped it into his hands gobbled it into his mouth then choked the guide poured out fahds measure and fahd drank it to the final drop you will learn it for the next time you do not throw away water fahd shouted without water they died the camels could go a maximum of eighteen days without water the boy had said then they would die caleb had long ago lost count of how many days they had been in the sands the men could not go eighteen hours without water the bags on the beautiful one were all empty caleb was not sure how many bags remained filled on the guides camel one or two he hoped water went again into the mug and fahd brought it to him caleb took the mug he looked down into the water it was greencoloured dead he felt the dryness of his throat the roughness inside his mouth he remembered the rain and the comfort of it he held the mug carefully as he stood and walked across to hosni he put his finger into hosnis mouth worked it round his tongue and the recesses of the mans throat took out the sand and smeared it on his robe then caleb held the mug at hosnis lips and tipped it when it was empty he carried the mug back to rashid we are carrying two fools fahd snarled at caleb his face contorted with anger the heat burning them and burning the sand and the sky that was clear blue and without pity the expanse of the desert destroyed them caleb knew it they mounted up rode away and the windblown sand covered any trace of their passing another lunchtime another lecture the crossword on the back page of michael lovejoys newspaper had not yet been started the folded page lay across his knee and the pencil was in his hand but he had read no more than the first question one across a woman who strives to he like a man lacks graffito ny eight letters lovejoy had his usual seat at the back of the room hed come down early when hed finished a midmorning meeting and had left the newspaper on the favoured chair just as well they were sitting on the aisle steps and standing inside the door the speaker had the appearance of an oldfashioned preparatoryschool teacher he was as mildlooking a man as could be imagined wispy grey hair that had not been combed a checked shirt with the collar curled up a woven tie that was not pulled tight a jacket with leather at the elbows trousers that hadnt been pressed and shoes that were scuffed the man who had filled the lecture room in thames house on the north embankment of the river came with a reputation officers from every branch of the security service had cut lunch to hear the scientist who was said to be betterinformed on his specialized subject than any other man or woman in the united kingdom the subject was dirty bombs i dont consider there to be a great risk from either microbiological or chemical sources an explosion that scatters anthrax or smallpox spores or that spreads a nerve gas in aerosol form would have little effect even in the confined space of an undergroundrailway system the evidence from the united states of america anthrax and from japan nerve gas such as sarin tells me the result is bigger in instant headlines than in the reality of damage caused no it is the real dirty bomb that concerns me the radioactive bomb let us consider first the availability of the necessary materials for that bomb there was a grated cough from the assistant director of c branch otherwise nervous silence lovejoy had read the assessments but the slightness and mildness of the speaker and the quietness of his voice gave his message a uniquely chilling quality he was known to many of his younger colleagues when they were polite about him as a veteran a veteran of the cold war counterintelligence work and the days of the marxists in the trade unions and a veteran of the twenty years of irish guerrilla warfare he had also learned the earlier history of the security service already he thought this the bleakest lecture of a nightmare future he had heard since he had enrolled from army service in fact and his mind roved the only comparable moment would have been when the service was told sixtyfour years earlier of the imminence of a german invasion we start with a suitcase any suitcase of a size that a man or woman uses for a weeks stay in a hotel stand at heathrow airport at the arrivals gates of any of the terminals and you will see passengers flooding through with suitcases of such a size the wires and timing devices are available at any hardware and electronics shops the terrorist will need ten pounds of semtex or military explosives or whats used in quarrying operations and hell need detonators everything so far is readily available sadly and i urge you to believe me the necessary radioactive material can be found without difficulty caesium chloride would be suitable vast quantities of it litter the countryside and farm buildings of the former soviet union it was used to blast seeds in powder form at high pressure therefore making them more productive once sown we do not have to go to the agricultural industries of belarus or the ukraine radioactive materials govern xrays medical instruments for the treatment of cervical cancer use caesium the radio isotope caesium which if spilled has a contamination life of thirty years is widely used in radiotherapy we are awash with it but i am going to stay with caesium chloride what you could hold in one hand no more bought in lethal quantities for next to nothing the caesium chloride is packed round the explosives and is covered with clothes books washingbags presents and only the most awake security man at an airport monitoring checkin and fresh off a meal break will see anything suspicious all of them in the room were supposed to be the last line of defence for the taxpayers who coughed up their salaries he did not know where that defence line could be drawn and the hushed quiet in the room told him that none of the others newcomers or oldtimers had a bloody clue and he remembered the young russian from last week and the psychologist from the week before and their messages he would go home that night to his wife mercy and not stop at the pub where they thought he worked for social security and hed talk it through with her because she was the only shoulder for crying on that he had a man walks with this suitcase not an onerous burden into londons trafalgar square or new yorks times square or he approaches a major intersection in central paris he puts down the suitcase and walks away and before the alarm is raised the suitcase explodes a big big bang on that nights television news we see burning cars damaged buildings all very obvious and we are told that three people have been killed and thirty injured we do not see or hear the cloud the particles of caesium chloride the cloud climbs in air heated by the detonation then it moves on the wind the speed is extraordinary half a mile in one minute five miles in thirty minutes the particles reach cooler air further from the bomb site and they drop they fall on grass into gardens on to buildings that are residential and that house thousands of office workers and they seep into drains and through the airintake ducts of the undergrounds ventilation system twentyfour hours later the terrorists use a middle east originating website to announce that the bomb is dirty the city is contaminated then ladies and gentlemen what do you do go and live in a cave in midwales go and rent a farmhouse in the yorkshire dales there were no names no faces on the files in library and lovejoy doubted that the files of the federal bureau of investigation held anything of value they groped in the dark he sensed in the room a pentup desire to be out and looking hunting and a matching frustration that there was no target to search for depending on the proximity to the explosion the particles could be harmful to human life for up to two hundred years which is to most of us for ever the risk of fastdeveloping cancer is small but in the longterm that risk increases in theory millions born and unborn face the nightmare of being cut down by hideous tumours in reality the greater problem for government is the spread of panic panic an ugly word for an ugly image the creation of panic is the terrorists principal aim and i guarantee to you that he will have succeeded consider the psychological impact so much worse than the recent sars outbreak then imagine panic on a scale never seen before by our western societies and a commercial shutdown that is unprecedented you see ladies and gentlemen civilians under the weight of the german blitz or the angloamerican bombing of hamburg berlin or dresden could see feel touch hear those attacks but this cloud moves invisibly at speed silently panic would be total what response can government make precious little it would come out of a clear blue sky the explosion the panic would tumble from that sky probably without warning and the lead to the identity of such a man who carried a suitcase that also would come out of the same cloudless sky the good old clear blue sky was both the hell and the heaven of counterintelligence officers the cleanup after the spill of one fistful of radioactive material in a brazilian city not scattered by explosives and not riding on the wind necessitated the removal of three and a half thousand cubic metres of earth and rubble my scenario is a bomb in the heart of a city and the impossibility of stripping out buildings tunnels gardens and parks it would take years not months and where then do you dump this himalayan heap of dirtied material the cost would be prohibitive i venture that the answer is mass evacuation then the abandonment of an inner city the panic caused would initiate a new dark age i can offer only one fractionally small area of comfort to you lovejoy decided on the answer to one across if the man who carried the suitcase into that crowded city centre never opened it never touched the caesium chloride and was well clear when it exploded he would survive i cannot say the same for the bombmaker i would estimate that the bombmakers unavoidable contact with the powder would limit his life to a few weeks after the completion of the device he would die a slow and most unpleasant death that is the only comfort i can offer you ladies and gentlemen thank you for your attention there was titter of relieved laughter at the fate of a bomb architect and no applause when the scientist stepped back from the lectern no chair moved lovejoy wrote ambition a woman who strives to be like a man lacks ambition it would give him a start for three five and six down for a moment the crossword was protection for michael lovejoy against the awfulness of the message when he reached his office and his sandwich there was a note on his desk from his branch director mikey arriving tomorrow american airlines from florida is jed dietrich defense intelligence agency his people coyshy about reason for his travel to uk but they request cooperation you please meet escort and wetnurse boris a clear blue sky not bloody likely he looked from his window out over the thames the cloud was low ashen and carried rain the voice was quiet calm and eased into martys headphones this is oscar golf we appreciate that conditions are adverse but we think we you sorry are doing well you have good control and we like what youre doing he acknowledged curtly unless there is a major deterioration in upperair wind strength we believe that we sorry again you should keep the bird up thats the bottom line we have complete confidence in you marty but if you get too tired need to rest then we will take over we are monitoring all output while lizzyjo sleeps everything is a number one this is quality flying in that wind strength and we go to the range limit oscar golf out lizzyjo had all the floor space behind him she had brought in her sleepingbag used it as a mattress her head was close to a wall and her feet were by the door george had been in during the afternoon and had driven them both insane with the banging of his hammer and the scrape of his spanner but he hadnt succeeded in getting the airconditioning motor going she wore short shorts and had her blouse unbuttoned right down his mother back in california would have turned up her lip and said it wasnt decent if he turned marty could see a deep brown birthmark on the white skin of her lower stomach lizzyjos breasts and the squasheddown nipples back in langley where oscar golf was they did lizzyjos work and monitored the realtime camera images he wasnt happy with her sleeping oscar golf and his crowd were not tuned to the desert not like she was ten more minutes hed give her he sat very still in his chair only his fingers moving with the joystick he wondered whether she dreamed of her daughter and of her husband who sold insurance in north carolina the few times he looked at her marty thought lizzyjo looked good but he didnt look often it was hard flying if it had not been for the order from langley carnival girl would not have been up he was pressured refusal was not an option in good weather conditions without upperair wind speeds that were at the limit or beyond oscar golf and his people could have had control in good weather with what the instrumentation told them carnival girl could have been flown from langley all commands transmitted from whatever it was six thousand miles distance but the weather was miserable and because the weather was miserable with the high winds marty had done that rare thing had imposed his will on george carnival girl would fly not first lady the clappedout raddled predator would be up not the better aircraft first lady was too valuable to go down hit by those winds a dragonfly with broken wings he thought that since theyd moved from bagram he had learned more about adverseweather flying in a week or ten days than he had known in years of piloting before his hands ached on the little joystick but he held her steady and she ate the ground and beamed the pictures soon the night would come then theyd go from the realtime camera to the infrared images no fucking way would he permit oscar golf to take over control of carnival girl she was his if she went down it would be his fault no other assholes he flew her over the emptiness of the sand she woke he heard the floor creak he felt her hands on his rigid shoulders on the tightness of the muscles she had the sleep still in her voice how is it up there like shit marty said wind still bad getting worse moved to southsouthwest forty knots whats acceptable gone beyond acceptable the manual says were grounded were on the edge she slipped back into her seat she told oscar golf that she was on station her blouse still hung open like that wasnt important there was a line of sweat dribbling from between her breasts and down to her navel he could feel through his fingers on the joystick the force of the gale winds that hit carnival girl then the predator bounced and fell the dial needles jerked in slashed movements lights winked there was a warning howl she plunged lizzyjo stayed quiet marty had to let her go she seemed to plummet and the realtime cameras image brought the desert sand leaping up at them it was what they trained for in the simulator at nellis the air pocket lowair density he felt through his fingers the strain on the wings already burdened by the hellfires she fell for a minute and twelve seconds and all the time marty kept the nose cone down and prayed she would not go to tail down and corkscrew she seemed to hit a floor of air then he had control for three land miles he took her on level flight and checked every piece of instrumentation for damage then climbed her back up and returned into the high thermal winds marty sighed lizzyjos hand was on his arm and she squeezed like that was the way to tell him hed done well he was calculating how much fuel had been used in the engine thrust to hold her as she was going down and how much more had gone with the climb to cruise altitude and how much flight time had been lost she said face set and jaw jutted well get them whoever they are and wherever i have the feeling that well get them lizzyjo had not done up her blouse and he didnt think she was going to the light was failing bart had no alternative a braver man would have walked away long ago he was not brave and accepted it never had been never would be had never stood up to his father or to his wife he sat that evening in the outer office of the realestate rental company and waited for the little prig inside to be so kind as to see him he had been punctual for the appointment the prig wasnt his business there was to seek an extension to his rental agreement for the villa in that past week he had failed again to stand up to eddie bloody wroughton you leave when i say so files go walkabout when i decide it and thats not now you are going bart nowhere and going nowhere necessitated an extension to the tenancy contract the only way that he would win his freedom from eddie bloody wroughton was when he produced information of such value that it trivialized all the gossip rumour and innuendo that was the stockintrade he peddled then he could quit run for the damned airport nor had he stood up to ariel at least ariel had made him feel wanted not threatened one evening in the dan hotel on the beachfront one day shared between a car and an office in jerusalem one morning walking in the central streets of tel aviv ariel had courted him had been assiduous for the evening ariel had talked of the threat to peace in the whole region that was the work of the three organizations hamas the alaqsa brigade and hizbollah they hate peace they make war on peace ariel had said he had been driven in jerusalem by ariel to a fruit and vegetable market and to a bus station and he had been told where the suicide bombers had detonated their waistcoats and he had tried to imagine the carnage at the locations now rebuilt the zealots kill many but hundreds more who have survived or have buried their loved ones will be scarred for the rest of their days by the fanaticism of these murderers ariel had told him in a bare office in a building that had no nameplate by the door he had been shown the books of photographs of the immediate aftermath of the explosions and he had seen men carrying from the smoke and fire the debris of severed arms legs torsos heads of men women and children the ones who plan and recruit then arm the kids with explosives and send them to their deaths are the men we target they do not sacrifice themselves they do not look to be martyrs they hide behind the delusions of the kids they are the murderers who destroy the chance of peace we target them to kill them ariel had murmured in his ear as he turned the pages of the books he had been walked in tel aviv down ben yehuda and along the seafront and had seen restaurants cafes and discotheques with guards outside them if we are lucky at the last moment as the bomber hesitates and steels himself or creates suspicion because he wears a coat to hide his bomb and it is hot the guard may intervene in time but we need great luck if we know the bomb planner and his movements and his factory if we strike him then we do not need luck more highly than luck we value intelligence if you help us dr bartholomew you would be a proud servant of peace and honoured ariel had whispered in his ear as they had threaded between the pavement crowds he was not a brave man not then and not now when he was called in forty minutes after the time of his appointment he did not meet his landlord the villa was owned by a prince of the blood and the tacky work of negotiation was done by a hireling the prig in the white robe and redchecked ghutrah who pared his nails with a chrome file and waved him casually to a chair that evening bart surprised himself not bravery but bloodymindedness ruled everything they preached at the embassy and the chamber of commerce about patience was abandoned he launched in with a blatant untruth i dont mind sitting in the waiting room for forty wasted minutes but my patients mind i am late for home calls to two patients who are unwell who need my attention you are dealing with a busy man now i seek an extension to my tenancy of six months i note that five of the villas in my compound are currently empty because of the security situation if a sixth villa is not to join them bringing in no rent then i require a discount of twenty per cent for that halfyear i believe that should be acceptable or i will go elsewhere he leaned forward his expression carefully nurtured and fraudulent was of concern and anxiety have you seen a doctor recently your neck looks a bit swollen to me had any pain in the glands in your neck pains or aches im not saying you should be worried but i really do advise that you book an appointment with your doctor and get him to give you a runover nasty things when they go wrong glands best caught early masterful and the little prig had blanched his fingers were under the hang of the ghutrah and were massaging a naturally plump neck right ive two appointments to cover so ill be on my way im looking at a sixmonth extension with a twenty per cent reduction in rent and of course my sincere best wishes to his royal highness i can see myself out he went out into the evening a harsh wind snatched at his trousers the chauffeur flashed the headlights as bart walked to the waiting vehicle he reflected that at long last he had stood his corner not on anything that mattered but he felt better for it there was a spring in his step the bloody wind caught his tie snaked it over his shoulder beth heard the wind beat on the windows outside the palm trees fronds shuddered she held up the book everyone got it sonnet eight ill start first two lines then each of you to a stop or a colon from the right shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate n e x t in front of her hanging on her words were her four most advanced pupils shakespeare for them not the technical language of petroleum extraction her finger wavered towards the chemist from pakistan it was risque for her to have chosen a sonnet of love it was at the limit of religious correctness one day when she had her flight out booked confirmed she might just get round to the merchant of venice give them shylocks lament for now love was challenge enough and taught by a woman she cued in the pipeline engineer the man read and stuttered to a halt miss bethany i do not understand it the men laughed she grinned she could have done lear with them or the speeches at agincourt or given them coriolanus she had chosen love a nun a permanent virgin at the convent school had made the class learn the sonnet by heart not a full hour of the day had gone by when she had not thought of him and the wind outside now whipped the sand and she wondered where he sheltered huddled and how hard it went for him you will when were through it ok on we go she pointed to the airfield manager he had not left her he had been with her in the shower in the morning no time for a bath and as shed gulped down her breakfast he was with her now she heard the beat of his breath as he had dug with the shovel she saw him stare out the men who would have killed her his voice was with her as he had gone away with the boy you never met me i was never here you never saw my face he was never away from her the warning of the deputy governor was wrong she decided she would not accept it he had said that illegal and dangerous men travelled in the sands she had lied she had said she met no one saw no one but the warning was a saws blade on a plank nail and she could not escape it right excellent questions the pipeline engineer asked it is very fine miss bethany but what is shakespeare writing of is it lust is it infatuation is it love how can we read shakespeares mind is it about love read it to your wife when you are next at home and ask her beth said for myself i think it is not infatuation or lust no it is about love the wind outside was worse fiercer where he was they were in darkness only a thin light washed down from the moon he thought was not certain of it that the route of the march was no longer straight but that it curved along the line of a crescent his eyes were slitted against the sand the wind pelted him with and sometimes against the strongest gusts he lifted the cloth that covered his mouth and protected his eyes when he went blind or when he peered ahead he could only make out the rump of ghaffurs camel in front of him he could not see rashid but he sensed that the guide took them on great lengths of quartercircles then corrected then took another curved course was the guide lost he thought fahd slept and hosni both men were tied to their saddles three times after they had restarted the march when the moon was highest caleb had lost sight of ghaffur and the boy had gone forward and must have talked with his father but each time he had dropped back and taken a place again in front of caleb and then each time the route had swung into another gentle long and arching turn what if they were lost the guide had no map no instruments and in the darkness he could not see the features of the greater dunes if there were any his mind had drifted back into his memory he had seen a room there was a bed unmade and a green coverlet was crumpled on the floor the carpet was thin and pale brown and magazines tossed down shared it with the coverlet motorcycles and cars were the photographs on the opened magazines girls big hips small swimsuit bottoms big breasts were on the walls the room was gone from calebs mind he tried to remember from what direction the sand hit him didnt know was too confused too tired too thirsty hungry and bruised by the days heat and now chilled by the night each of the beautiful ones strides dragged her closer to collapse he had set in his mind that they were lost that they had doubled back on sand covered the previous day or the day before he croaked the question does he know where hes going ghaffur does your father know the boy seemed to hiss for him to be quiet has your father been here before ever before the hiss was louder sharper it is madness to move in darkness the hiss whistled at him cut him he could see faintly that ghaffur was high on his saddle his head was raised the wind tore at the boys robe it was natural to ride into the wind with the body bent low and the target for the wind minimized it was as though ghaffur sniffed the wind or listened he strained to see the boy better could not ghaffur tell me are we lost my father knows where he is where we go he knows everything of the sands why do we not go straight in a straight line only god knows more about the sands my father is responsible for you he decides the route and you follow why do you go forward and talk to him and then each time we turn the boy called back to him a slight voice beaten by the wind because of what i hear i hear nothing my ears are the best my father says they are the ears of a leopard one that lives in the mountains it is an engines noise a long way off but i thought i heard it what sort of engine on the air or on the ground where was it i do not know each time you talk i cannot listen caleb heard only the footfall of the camels the snoring of fahd and hosni and the darkness closed round him and the wind speared against him in the night the wind swerved to come from the north and greater ferocity came with the change in the sands of the rub al khali men lay against their camels bodies to find shelter and only their guide knew the value of the wind above the sands rocked tossed and shaken a predator flew and hunted in secrecy and silence and under each wing was a hellfire missile the dawns light nestled on the wings of the predator and caught the sandcoated backs of the camels in words of one syllable or two stop fucking me about i am sorry mr wroughton sir but i do not have authority to admit you young man i am expected i dont think so mr wroughton sir i had a meeting fixed up yes sir but not here in the halflight as the city woke wroughton had left the bed of an agronomists wife belgian large and not entirely pretty but experienced and had driven to the gonsalves compound sometimes he went there when teresa was giving the kids their tea and waited for juans return sometimes it was for breakfast before juan drove to the embassy the agronomist was due back in riyadh from layla west of the big desert that evening if it had not been for his appointment with juan his friend wroughton would have enjoyed another three hours or four if he could last it in the agronomists bed inside the agronomists wife the man was down in layla to examine the possibilities of growing a strawberry crop on the edge of the big desert bloody fool teresa had said in her nightdress and with the kids howling round her that juan had already gone down to the embassy had been gone an hour just please get on the phone and tell him that im downstairs or is that too bloody difficult he knows you are here mr wroughton sir teresa at her front door had yawned then pulled a face and winked big flap eddie panic call he was dressing as he was driving the marine on the embassy desk had rung through and the young man had come down wroughton knew him as the number five out of five in the agencys riyadh pecking order the meeting over breakfast round the kitchen table was just routine and the chance to exchange snippets but it was important for wroughton that day of each month he started on his report regular as his bowels for vauxhall bridge cross much too much of his monthly report came from the crumbs off juan and teresas kitchen table a big flap a panic call he needed to know the detail of that he was blocked and his temper rose wroughton swung his fist towards the internal phone on the desk in front of the marine guard just get him on the phone ill speak to him he thought this young man had a future in fielding customer complaints in a telephone or electricity company so calm and his voice never betrayed anger he said youd be round he said when you came round i was to come down and tell you that he was too busy some other time hed ring thats what i was to tell you mr wroughton sir the young man shrugged then sidled away went through the inner gate with a punchnumber lock wroughton turned furious what price the special fucking relationship he stamped towards the swing doors where the marines watched him impassively a big flap a panic call and eddie wroughton was shut out he would not have believed it not of the special relationship not of his friend he could still smell the belgian woman on him and he went home to change his shirt and his whole damned world was upsidedown was tossed aside how much more time for gods sake do they need for five minutes more than an hour juan gonsalves had been watching the screen he wore a bar microphone and the headset was clamped in his uncombed hair he paced in the communications area his shirt hung out of his trousers and his vest had the handprints of last nights kids food but his eyes bloodshot and tired never left the screen not often did he show raw stress he was not permitted a direct link with the ground control at shaybah the raised hut on the trailer down at the end of the runway beside the perimeter fence was offlimits to gonsalves too fraught down there hed been told what it meant they didnt need a rubbernecker over their shoulder close to him leaning against the closed door was nathan the new guy out from langley and hed had the signal from the young man that the visitor in the lobby had been sent away there were things that gonsalves would share and things he would not a live image from four and a half miles over the rub al khali with a target was not to be shared the feed on the screen real time rolled and bucked went soft focus reclaimed the target lost it found it again nathan had moved to the coffee dispenser over the headset gonsalves heard the reassurance of langley and the increasing tension of the guys down at shaybah the talk was coded technical and gonsalves could understand only trifles why the hell did they not strike the picture on the screen beamed off the predator wavered off and on to a drawnout camel train the effort of the sensor operator was to get clear images of the cargo carried by three of the camels more times than he had counted the zoom had gone down on the camels blurred with magnification but then the picture had been lost he had seen the men five of them spread out over a length that might have been as much as two hundred metres they went slowly in long arcs the camera tried one more time to go closeup on a cargo box but the focus failed the angle changed gonsalves imagined high above the caravan kicked by the gale winds that the predator circled nathan gave him coffee he drank didnt notice the taste he flung the beaker towards the trash can missed and coffee dribbled on to the floor he picked up off the table the photocopied picture of a crate box olive green that could hold a stinger the manportable surfacetoair missile system he knew the wind had reached new levels at the altitude of the predator and at the level of the desert because the picture rocked more severely and there seemed to be a mist over the camels and the men which he thought to be from driven sand in his working life juan gonsalves had not known a stress level so high he depressed the speech button on his headset how much longer when can we go the voice was massaged quiet this is oscar golf interjections from what we regard as spectators interrupt and divert us briefly we do not take out a target until it has been identified with certainty identification is in process these are difficult conditions were right at the upper altitude where the uav currently flies and its near impossible to get a stable platform the weather is deteriorating and we are running low on fuel so please no further interruptions oscar golf out he had been put down felt like a scolded child he watched the screen saw the caravan moving steadily under the realtime camera he felt weak sick four more minutes on station marty said after four more minutes we cannot bring carnival girl back lizzyjo said the voice of oscar golf came back so calm reading you hearing you marty worked the joystick his decision and brought carnival girl down a full six thousand feet of height each foot of descent made the camera platform less stable he had backed her away gone to the west had lowered the lens angle lizzyjo followed him they were like dancers in step the camera raked along the straggling length of the caravan he didnt need to speak to her they moved together better that day than any other he ran carnival girl from the tail of the caravan and on towards the front of it the computers did the calculations george flitted at their backs and kept the bottles of water coming marty could not drink did not dare to release his fingers from the joystick it fascinated him that down below on the camels they did not know the eye of the lens watched them he was halfway along the caravan and lizzyjos finger stabbed at the digits playing at the base of the screen two minutes and forty seconds would they pull out on oscar golfs orders or would they sacrifice carnival girl and let her crash in the desert with her fuel tanks exhausted the momentary image was of a big camel loaded then the voice in the headphones we have a freeze wait out we are looking at a freeze frame no excitement in the voice without passion marty looked up took in the screen on the right side of the main image the freeze frame was like a still photograph the picture held two camels he saw the clear lines of the crate box he the voice betrayed nothing no thrill like it was a machine hit them right now he heard lizzyjos question one strike or two the answer give them both waste the fuckers he came round was head on towards the caravan it was what they trained for what they practised to achieve lizzyjo didnt have to tell him what she needed it would be without warning down there slow moving in the sand they would have no warning the crosswinds hammered carnival girl port side missile gone lizzyjo murmured on the screen racing from it and diminishing was the fireball twelve seconds or thirteen at that height from firing to impact again the camera shook at the weight loss starboard side missile gone two concentrated flame masses burning solid propellant careered down each powered a missile with a warhead of twentylive pounds weight of explosive fragmentation quality on impact fuses he watched lizzyjo guided them and he heard little yelps whistle through her teeth they were nearly down he was counting silently when the camels scattered a few paces the lens picked up the panic they were turning running and then the flames cut in among them he saw the camels break the line then the cloud burst over them and the fireflash a ceiling of dust sand filled the screen image marty said flat into his face microphone i am out of flight time do i bring her back or do i lose her bring her back and give her some good loving care nothing will live under that bring her home oscar golf out marty turned her and the lens lost the cloud he heard nothing the boy was on a dunes rim and his hands were cupped together across his mouth his shoulders heaving with the effort of shouting caleb could not hear him he did not know how long he had been alone in the sands with the beautiful one she had stampeded in terrified flight he had clung to her she had bolted had run in the few seconds of earsplitting noise before the first explosion she had been going at full stride at the moment of the second explosion he had hung on to her neck she had gone on until she could run no more then had stopped trembling he did what he had learned from the guide as he had seen rashid do it he snuggled his face against the beautiful ones mouth his nose against the foulness of her breath and he had whispered sweetness to her he had stilled the trembling they had meandered on alone and together he had not known where he went the camel had taken the course his ears were dead and his mind was numbed and the strength of the sun had grown in the distance high on the dune the wind made a canopy of the boys robe the ears of the beautiful one lifted pricked as if she heard him when caleb could not they were all his family the boy and the beautiful one and the men who waited for him at the end of his journey he had no other family the camels pace quickened closing on the boy who had searched for him and found him chapter thirteen they rode on many times caleb looked up and searched for the danger there was not a cloud in the brilliant blue of the sky he gazed up till his eyes ached saw nothing and heard nothing they made a straggling line their tracks covered by the winds shift of the sand rashid was out in front on a bull camel already laden with two crates was the body of fahd further back was hosni then caleb then another bull last in the line was the boy ghaffur caleb had not seen them but left beyond the horizon were the carcasses of fahds animal and one that had carried crates and one that had carried food he thought of fahd the zealot who had insisted that they stop each time for the necessary prayers thought of the man who had not had an encouraging word for him for any of them his eyes had watered but now had no more moisture to secrete and there was agony in them each time he lifted his head and tried to scan the sky to search into its blue depths the wind dragged at calebs robe and tore at the headcloth that covered his mouth his scalp and his ears he did not know whether fahd had been taken by the first explosion or the second whether he had had a moment to think on paradise had he for one second or two or for the halfminute that had separated the explosions considered the garden of paradise all of the arabs in the brigade swore on their faith that they believed in the garden where martyrs went where cool streams ran where baskets of fresh fruit lay where girls waited for them he could see fahds corpse its feet hanging on one side of the camels flanks and the head on the other the back of fahds head was gone but the blood from it and the brain tissue had fallen out long ago and had been trampled into the sand by the following camels caleb had looked into the skies into the clearness of the blue as the beautiful one had lumbered through the last of the blood and brain that had dropped from the opened skull had fahd in the last seconds of his life welcomed death had he believed in the garden of paradise caleb did not could not know caleb had crossed the chasm into his old world rejected before which muddied the certainty of the garden of paradise rolling on his saddle gazing up caleb felt a sadness that the last he would remember of fahd was the anger in the saudis face and the screams of his voice the man had been his family too he tightened the hold on his reins and he bent and his voice whispered soft words in the ear of the beautiful one he slowed her step and the sight of fahds head and feet drifted further away the sand disturbed by hosnis camel was no longer lifted into his face and the pack bull passed him caleb waited for the boy to reach him will you talk to me my father says that to talk is to waste strength does your father also say that to be alone is to be frightened we are never alone in the sands god is with us my father says were you frightened ghaffur no the boy shook his head he remembered himself at ghaffurs age and the kids hed messed with caleb would have been they would have been terrified when the flames had come down fireballs from the sky which was clear blue and empty he believed the boy tell me my father says it is an aircraft without a pilot it is flown by commands i do not understand how that are given it by men who sit far away they could be a weeks camel ride from it or more my father heard about it from the bedouin of the yemen there was a man from the town of marib he was qaed sunian alharthi and he was hunted by the americans but he was in the desert and he thought himself safe and he rode in a vehicle towards an oil well where americans worked he had made a bomb he was betrayed they knew when he would move and in what vehicle there was no warning he was hit from the sky my father says there are cameras in the aircraft and the americans would have watched the vehicle he rode in he was killed from the sky and all the men with him the bedouin would have believed that the bomb he carried had exploded but the police told the bedouin that the americans had boasted about their aircraft in the sky you were frightened caleb bit at his lip and the sand stuck at his teeth i hope i am not a coward admit i was frightened does your father say how we can run from it only with gods help and he gives us the wind if the wind is too strong if that is what he wishes the boy said solemnly god spared you he has a great purpose for you it came in against the gale from her window beth had seen it make the first attempt to land but that was failure she had thought it extraordinary that the aircraft should have flown in those conditions it had been fifty feet or so above the extreme end of the runway and had seemed to be lifted up as if by an unseen hand then thrown sideways the regular flight from riyadh had not come in that morning and that would have been a hoeing heavy and stable this aircraft was tiny in comparison lightweight toy it had climbed shaking as if it was punched and while it had come round for the second attempt beth had gone out on to the patio it made no sense to her that they should be flying for evaluation and mapping in such weather it had lined up again over the landing guide lights that were in the sand beyond the perimeter fence everything in beth jenkinss life before these last several days had been based on certainty she clung to the trunk of the palm and she saw what was different there were no tubes under the wings there had been tubes under the wings the last time she had seen the aircraft lift off she was confused knew no answers heard only the questions it rolled with the wind it was over the runway seemed to stop like the hovering shahin her patron flew it lurched clumsily she remembered the grace of its takeoff a wing went down its balance was lost in bad weather her patron would not have risked the lives of his prized shahin or his hurr he had paid and had told her the money was well spent a hundred and ten thousand dollars for the trained peregrine and eighty thousand dollars for the saker falcon and she thought this bird must have been valued at many millions of dollars why would they risk it it made no sense beth thought it was past the point of return had to come down the right wing came up it levelled was a crippled bird and fragile the left wing dipped no pilot the only life in danger was that of the bird itself the left wingtip scraped on the tarmac it ran on stopped then turned it taxied down the runway and as if its engine was cut came to a slow and hesitant halt a jeep came from the little camp and sped towards it she went back into the bungalow and started to work again on her report on the ejecta field but she could not concentrate nothing was certain doubt ruled he was with her you never met me i was never here you never saw my face she hit the laptops keys but demons danced and she could not lose them beth could not make the link between the aircraft and him but sensed it existed she wanted to cry out to yell a warning could not and the silence dripped around her he saw a man who was tall athletically built tanned and not dressed for that mornings english weather michael lovejoy strode forward not with a springing step because the legacy of the winter was increasing pain in his hip joints the man had lovejoys name in big letters on a sheet of paper and held it up the flight was in early and lovejoy was late the man wore heavy shoes suede and faded jeans with a brightly checked cotton shirt there was a grip bag at his feet as he gazed around him a frown of impatience writ large on a sunburned forehead lovejoy played at charm mr dietrich mr jed dietrich im lovejoy i was asked to meet you sincere apologies for keeping you hanging round the traffic was awful pleased to meet you i was just beginning to wonder his handshake crunched lovejoys fingers im sure you were anyway alls well that ends well dont you know god this place is a nightmare cars outside bit of a walk im afraid lovejoy rarely met americans those he did were from the embassys legal department they were federal bureau of investigation men with cropped scalps polished shoes and bowties or women with flat chests trouser suits and bobbed hair as a breed he was innately suspicious of them when they came on to his territory it always seemed they expected his immediate and undivided attention and when he went on to their ground it always seemed they were busy and uninterested he was not late because of awful traffic but because mercy and he had lingered over breakfast he had brought his own car a sixyearold volvo estate that was good for ferrying the grandchildren in the multistorey car park after walking as fast as his hip joints permitted him he unlocked the vehicle he expected the american to comment on the child seats in the back the cousins from across the water both sexes usually liked to talk kids and produce photographs from their wallets there was no remark on the seats or on the kids clutter in the front from the school run mercy had done the previous week they pulled out i see youve been in the sunshine mr dietrich you wont find much of that here so youve come in from florida is that your workplace or the end of a vacation there had been no holiday that year for michael and mercy lovejoy the new conservatory at the back of their home had gulped the spare cash lack of funds had denied them the usual two weeks in a rented cornish cottage and his summer leave had been spent decorating the dining room and the sitting room when lovejoy referred to other peoples holidays there was often a barb in his tone the reply was crisp i work at guantanamo bay last thing before leaving home for the drive to the airport as mercy had kissed his cheek lovejoy had told her god knows what their defense intelligence agency want from us what ive always understood theyre the eternal flames you know never go out spend their days stuck in bunkers trying to make sense of radio traffic and i suppose looking over aerial pix with a magnifyingglass and searching for an oil drum of anthrax in suburban baghdad feel for me darling its going to be grim he was a safe pair of hands more important as the trail of al qaeda funding grew colder was iced over in the city of london his absence from his desk would matter little mercy had grimaced had kissed him again i am an interrogator at camp delta oh are you well thats a rather interesting place he hoped the little intake of breath sharp went unnoticed at thames house there was a desk on the third floor that dealt with guantanamo bay and the eight britons detained there five visits had been made to camps xray and delta but he had never seen anything remotely relevant coming back or not at least across his desk he knew that high court judges refused to denounce the detention without charge and trial of the britons as illegal under international law he knew also that the relevant government ministers obdurately declined to make a noise or waves the britons were as lovejoy understood it in a black hole the whole working life of michael lovejoy twentyeight years an intelligence officer with the security service and before that his fifteen years as an army officer with the green jackets had been governed by the bible of need to know since marriage only mercy had needed to know not the people he met in the pub or other guests at dinner parties and often enough not colleagues himself if he had just come off a flight in new york or washington lovejoy would have guarded his secrets closely said what was necessary and not a damned word more he listened the only thing fascinating about camp delta is that it is bogged down in a rut that is one hell of a rut like a tractor wheel makes in mud were just going through the motions not even a dozen times in two years after the first splash of intelligence have we learned anything new or important we go to work we talk to people we read back the transcripts and we fall asleep we dont learn anything then it happens and were shaking it happens out of a clear blue sky is i believe the cliche out of that clear blue sky comes a thunderbolt got me we released a man were under heavy pressure to find a few innocents and ship them back with a fanfare the full shebang we released a man whom we believed to be a taxidriver from afghanistan lovejoy waited he was rarely impatient i was on holiday up in wisconsin with my wife and kid and getting in some fishing before the winter came down the taxidriver he made my list i wasnt there when they decided to shift him we have the joint task force which is bureau agency and us but the bureau the agency run it were country cousins they made that decision he was flown out he was being driven into kabul asked for a comfort stop and did a runner if he was just a taxidriver who cares you care a further talent of lovejoy was his ability with apparent sincerity to flatter sandwiched among the lorries and vans he drove at a steady pace anxious always to relax his informant god what would he do when he retired what sort of man would he be he dreaded the day so you came back from leave and found the taxidriver gone i had a brit in with me some creep a nobody i asked the questions i was supposed to ask last week you know how it is that gut feeling you get a match it was his accent i was a cold war specialist when i started then i went to the balkan desks now i do guantanamo ive heard every goddamn accent there is russian polish north korean serb bosnian and croat yemeni egyptian saudi and kuwaiti i got accents coming out of my ass the brit i had in he spoke with the same accent as the taxidriver did he now to me it was the same accent then i got sort of scared at what i was looking at with good cause lovejoys hands had tightened on the wheel little parts of three lunchtime lectures seeped into his mind a psychologist had said i urge you to look elsewhere where for quality for ability for the best because it is those young men that the lieutenants of bin laden search for a russian counterintelligence officer had said somewhere in his psyche or his experience there will be a source of hatred he hates you and me and the society that we serve a scientist had said we start with a suitcase any suitcase of a size that a man or woman uses for a weeks stay in a hotel scared with good cause he remembered the stunned quiet in that room at thames house the day before a man who had the skill to defeat the interrogation process was a man who was owed respect funny thing respect it was often churned out for an old enemy respect for a rommel or for a vo nguyen giap or for the argentine pilots in the south atlantic but he had never heard respect given to the new enemy on any floor of thames house he would not have expected to hear of respect for a suicide bomber or for a fighter in the new orders army if an enemy was not shown respect given only the status of a pest that enemy presented increasing danger do you have the tapes of the interrogations the brit and the taxidriver he saw the head nod how long have you got mr dietrich i got till yesterday and please call me jed the rain on the windscreen had come on heavier you travelled light have you brought winter clothes i got authorization and i went out of gitrno like a bat out of hell i know if the bureau and the agency had gotten their act together id have been called back this could bring down empires could wreck big careers but for the moment its mine and im keeping it im going to the end of the road mr lovejoy and michael please and if im wrong i will be fed to the crows and if im right probably the same i will not win a popularity contest i dont give a fuck lovejoy took his mobile from his suit jacket and rang mercy she would have been upstairs making the beds for the kids coming that night he told her he would be away apologized then asked her to dig out the sweater his daughterinlaw had given him two christmases back a size too large and never worn and the old green waxed waterproof coat he hadnt used for five years he said hed be by for them in an hour but would not be stopping then steering with one hand and locking the wheel with his knees when he changed gear he thumbed through the contacts book that was filled with names and numbers he tapped out the digits on the phone and made the appointment he needed after two hearings the professor of phonetics at kings college london university said well youre wrong im sorry to disabuse you its not a matter of argument but a fact the accents are not from the same place what you have called tape alpha the briton reading pashto is quite different to a trained ear from tape bravo i regret any disappointment that may cause you but facts are facts tape alpha is birmingham with only marginal similarities to tape bravo tape bravo is the black country now youll have to excuse me i have a tutorial they were out on the street hurrying through the sluicing rain across the car park and the american was struggling into the old waxed waterproof coat lovejoy said dont look so bloody miserable the black country is not at kandahar or peshawar or in the yemen forget that pedantic buffoon the black country is on the immediate northwest boundary of the city of birmingham you did well fifteen miles from birmingham maximum you did very well he stood in the doorway had pressed the bell and waited for it to be answered the maid a filipina faced him eddie wroughton walked past her went into the sitting room the belgian woman was watching a video in her housecoat and painting her nails in a cerise that matched the lipstick he went into the kitchen and poured himself a juice from the fridge for a man who was rated clever intelligent and cunning he had taken a giant risk in returning to the villa in daylight when spying neighbours and gossiping servants would see him three times he had tried to ring juan gonsalves and three times he had been told that mr gonsalves was in a meeting and would get back to him wroughtons mobile had not rung from the kitchen he heard the shopping instructions being given to the maid there was an officer serving in riga penny who had his photograph beside her bed she had told him of the photograph in one of her many unanswered letters he had no thoughts of riga or of the risk only of the agronomists wife he heard the front door close if his friend gonsalves had returned his calls wroughton would not have been in the agronomists kitchen would not have been frustrated into taking the risk he wondered whether the paint on her nails was dry whether the lipstick on her mouth would smudge and run his name was called not from the living room but from the bedroom he craved to erase the humiliation of the lobby below the agencys floor his shoes and clothes were scattered over the tiled floors of the kitchen and the living room and he was naked when he reached the bedroom except for his tinted glasses he hated his eyes to be seen they might betray his humiliation between patients the receptionist brought bart a printout of the extension contract offered him by the realestate company he had won the offer was for an eighteen per cent reduction in monthly payments that was victory when shed gone out as he waited for the next patient bart surprised himself clumsily he danced a little jig he hopped from foot to foot in tune to the whistle from his lips he had won the victory by his boldness christ he thought as he skipped of the many who had walked over him in particular eddie bloody wroughton not that he would gain his freedom from wroughton but the victory was a moment of success to be savoured the german patient spoke shamefacedly of snoring problems bart spoke of lymphnode complications the patients wife spoke of the disturbance in her nights sleep bart spoke of a consultant who was a very decent greek at the ear nose and throat section of the king fahd medical city they were relieved and grateful ill make the appointment mr seitz ill take care of everything leave it to me you didnt tell me your business in the kingdom i took early retirement from the luftwaffe now i train airtraffic controllers for the saudi air force bart wrote up his notes do you now that must be fascinating complete chaos it blows my mind never looking up from the notes with studied casualness bart asked what in particular do you find stressful about your work he was a worm at the core of an apple victory on his rent or not he was still eddie bloody wroughtons man caleb rode with hosni he sensed the wind slackened but the smell was worse fahds body was bloated by the suns heat and the wind carried to him the stench sweet and sickly he remembered the smell of the bodies in the trenches after the big bombers had gone over the sand grains were plastered round the old egyptians eyes they were dulled as if the life was going from them and hosnis head never turned to him he rode with him for kindness he thought of how it must have been when the missiles had come down and how it would have been in a halflight when the camels had scattered when hosnis own had stampeded its passenger strapped on shaken jolted deafened and not knowing from a past life a memory surfaced there had been an old man who walked beside the canal sunshine or rain with a stick and the kids had shouted at him and he had flailed the stick around him but had not seen them caleb had been one of the kids he had thought of the old man beside the canal his stick and the jeers and he rode with hosni hosni was so frail so weak and caleb thought his courage was an inspiration what hosni can you see i see what i need to see i see the sand i see the sun is there something a doctor can do a year ago perhaps there was something two years ago for certain a doctor could do something we were hunted first in the tor a bora then in caves on the border i could not go to quetta or to kandahar to find a doctor i was with the emir general if i had gone to find a doctor and been taken i knew too much to go to quetta or kandahar in oman i saw a doctor was there nothing he could do the head came up and the smile cracked the face the caked sand spilled down from it he could do something he could tell me i have from the doctor a diagnosis it cannot be treated it is not reversible it deteriorates what maybe i washed in dirty water maybe i waded a stream that was polluted it could have been long ago right back in the days when we fought the soviets and i was beside the emir general the doctor had a fine name for the condition onchocerciasis and a finer name for the parasite onchocerca volvulus the doctor in oman was a very educated and wellread man the parasite is a worm that can live for fourteen years in the body the female enters the body through any lesion a scraped knee or cut foot as you go through dirty and polluted water and it breeds larvae soon your body is the home of many millions of worms and they roam through you some it does not need to be many make the long journey to the backs of your eyes they live there the little worms eat there and breed there the diagnosis is eventual blindness how much time do you have i have enough time to do what i wish to do do not be frightened for me tell me i will not live to go blind explain there is a suitcase or a bag that a brother prepares in the bag are materials i handle them i work with them i have said i will do it to touch the materials is to walk away from life when the bag or case is sealed it can be carried in safety i dream of it the dream sustains me in this hell and i dream of the young man who will carry the case or the bag and he is my friend i am your friend hosni do you hate enough the smell of fahds body played in his nose the noise of the thunder was in calebs ears and he saw the fire exhaust from the missile streaming down from the sky i hate enough i will carry a case or a bag camp delta guantanamo bay exercise day another week gone by exercise then his shower he was escorted into the dirt yard it was the second time that he had been led into the exercise yard and had seen the new goalposts his hands were manacled a chain led from the manacles to his waist circled by another chain more chain link hung down from his waist and reached the shackles on his ankles the guards let go of his arms off you go kid go get your circuits in the football pitch was in the centre of the yard with white lines marked out across the dried mud around the pitch a line of men shuffled the circuit each twenty paces apart their steps restricted by the length of chain between the shackled ankles and listened to the shouts from the pitch where twenty or twentyfive prisoners chased a football the most recent edict at delta had invited prisoners to apply for extra exercise caleb had been confused by it he had not known whether he should volunteer whether it would help the deceit or whether it would compromise him if he had taken up the invitation would he then be expected to inform on fellow prisoners he had not put his name forward he had fifteen minutes of exercise ahead of him but the footballplayers had an hour of chasing the ball a big american tracksuited ruled the pitch with a whistle he loathed them all of them loathed them whether they wore a tracksuit and praised whether they wore the bright sun shirts and interrogated whether they had the camouflage uniform and the key bars to the manacles and shackles he did his circuits when a goal was scored the american blasted his whistle and applauded he looked at the players dancing because the ball was in the back netting and tried to remember the faces if any were moved to the cell next to his he would be more careful would guard against the smallest mistake at the end of his last circuit his escort gestured for him his arms were held as he was led out of the yard he would not exercise for another week you could be doing that kid playing soccer youve only got to ask he did not understand he smiled nervously at the guard he had learned his part he was taken to the shower block with the loathing was contempt he felt superior to the men who escorted him unmanacled and unshackled him who watched him undress who saw him into the cubicle where the water sluiced down on him he did not come cheap they would not turn him with the offer of a game of football he deceived them the certainty of his superiority gave him strength a towel was thrown to him marty lay on his back on the camp bed beside it propped against the chair on which his clothes hung was the picture his only valued possession behind the glass spattered with sand grains and misted with condensation was martys hero the hero at gundamuck who had wrapped round his chest the colours of the th regiment lieutenant souter a hundred and sixtytwo years before had survived the last stand of his troops and gone home feted marty aspired to heroism and did not know how he would achieve it if he had still been at bagram marty would now have been in the officers club he would have been a centre of attention the beers would have kept coming the agency people would have been round him pilots sensor operators interrogators and analysts and the cans would have kept coming for free he had done a launch seen the hellfires go watched the cloud mushroom up it would have been his party time his moment of heroics if he had been at bagram but he was not he was in this shithole at bagram marty would have had an audience with supervisors and ranking agents doing cheerleading his praises would have been sung and the talk would have moved on to him bringing carnival girl home with the tanks showing empty and the wind plucking at her as she touched down he was a goddamn hero but no one was around to tell him the wind battered at the tents sides the sand came in between the flaps and the ground sheet and the roof billowed a solitary beer given him by george was half hidden on the chair by his clothes which were hitched on the back marty hadnt pulled the cans ring the last thing hed heard from oscar golf was a demand for soonest information on potential damage to the portside wingtip of carnival girl in the touchdown there had been no herogram out of langley no congratulation from goddamn gonsalves nothing he had staggered out of the ground control had been close to spilling himself on to the sand at the foot of the trailer steps and george had given him the beer which hadnt come from an icebox george had gone off in the jeep to tow the bird off the runway lizzyjo had been slumped dead to the world over her end of the workbench he should have slept but he could not again and again searing in his mind he saw the lurch of the platform when the first hellfire went away from carnival girl the ball of fire going down and the camels breaking their line of march then the cloud and the second missile going into that cloud could not sleep the tents entrance flap was lifted back the wind came in behind her the sand spewed round her spraying on to his legs and body and over his face she dropped the flap she sat on the bed her hips in the tight short trousers were against his knees he could have covered himself could have reached for the boxers or his singlet but he did not too tired too dead too cheated to care the bed bent under her weight thats a fine sight lizzyjo said and winked might frighten a girl in the carolinas but not a new yorker she had not buttoned up her blouse her hand rested on the hairs of his chest did you sleep no tried to didnt you want the news her fingers pulled at the hairs teased them whats the news you look like you need a liftup for months marty had worked with lizzyjo had shared a workbench with her shed been good he was raw the guys said at bagram that she was assigned to mind him half the pilots at bagram would have given a months pay to work alongside lizzyjo hed wondered often enough whether shed complained about being put with him because he was new and given the dirty work hadnt been an air force flier had acne and fatlensed glasses he didnt know her knew about rick who sold insurance and about clara who was watched over by ricks parents during the working day knew about a marriage that had died knew about her dedication and nothing of her langley says that flight out of shaybah was of the highest quality technical achievement that it was pressed home in the most adverse conditions that the video record of the flight and the missile firing will be used for training programmes in the future its what langley said he felt the blood pound in his cheeks she was bent over him her breasts hanging close to his chest where her fingers played in the hairs and gonsalves came through from riyadh he said he was proud of us if youd stayed around in the trailer youd have heard what he said he blushed felt like a kid it was like when his highschool grades had come through and hed thought hed flunked when he hadnt id say its party time she leaned over him reaching for the can he did not know her did not know what she felt for him and her finger was into the ring and tugging it the beers foam sprayed over him ran on his belly she tilted the can for him to drink and the beer spilled from his mouth as he swallowed he thought hed drunk half the can then she put it down she licked the warm beer off his chest took the hairs in her mouth then her tongue was on his stomach you good to party marty nodded closed his eyes she kicked off her flipflops and wriggled out of the tight short trousers her face was serious set like the business was important as she stood and pulled down her panties then her weight was on him the condom had been in her pocket and she ripped the wrapping off with her teeth and peeled it over him he turned his head away so that he could not see her face and he did not know why what she needed from him whether she had done it like this with the insurance salesman the sweat ran in rivulets between her breasts and on to him oiled them and fastened them together the last time had been with a girl at nellis from the management of the base canteen and shed had thicker spectacles than him and had weighed more than a hundred and fifty pounds shed hoped hed marry her then hed gone to bagram and shed never written he had killed the reward for him for killing was to get laid twice in a halfhour maybe she had done it many times at bagram in her own prefabricated quarters or in a pilots but it did not matter to him he gloried in the feel of her and squeezed deeper inside her the second time he heard her shallow cries and the pace of her breathing and he hung on to her as if in fear that it would finish he did not see into her eyes did not know her he pushed his hips against hers at the last moment he yelled out gasped and sobbed his thanks to her she squealed he wondered how many of the technical guys or maintenance heard her if george did he could go no deeper his nails gouged her back and the sweat came off her and was in his mouth and he tasted the salt of it with the beer lizzyjo took the second one off him knotted it dropped it beside the bed she kissed his cheek like she was his aunt she knelt on the bed over him and her head was cocked up you know whats different marty panted you and me us that was fantastic it was you dumb ass she said sharp she showed no passion her face was the same serious and set as it had been when shed zoomed the camera for the freezeframe and when shed launched its the wind i dont hear any wind you fool thats whats different he looked at the sides of the tent then at its roof the tent shook in the wind but not like it might collapse he heard the sing of the wind but no longer its scream she had her panties back on was dragging up her short tight trousers and slipping on her blouse the wind was down now it was not carrying sand under the flaps and on to the groundsheet she bent over him and he tried to kiss her but her face turned away and she only reached down to pick up the two knotted condoms which went into her pocket he did not understand anything of her why did you come here to me i thought we deserved a party didnt we she went out through the flap and it dropped back marty kicked himself off the bed he dressed slowly a clean shirt boxers and tshirt from his bag and the old jeans his mother and father up in the cabin overlooking santa barbara had never asked him whether he had a girlfriend seemed to expect that one day hed turn up with one he didnt know how theyd feel about a woman like lizzyjo he wrote to them once a month was due to but he would not tell them about his party he drank the rest of the beer stale and flat and s plashed water on his face he did not go for a shower did not want to take the smell of her off him outside the tent the sun hit him a small windsock flew from a pole on the far side of the satellitedish trailer it was out but not rigid a little knot of men worked around the portside wing of carnival girl and george and lizzyjo blocked his view of the forward fuselage he walked towards them george faced him stepped aside and made a mock bow of respect it was black on the white of the fuselage marty gazed at the skull and the crossbones under it clenched his fist and raised it above his head it was a confirmed kill marty felt on top of the world she said impassively like shed shared nothing with him were going back up tomorrow you look like you need some sleep takeoff an hour before dawn get over the strike site get a damage assessment then go after any of the bastards we missed got it alive the body had been thin dead it was swollen and grotesque when they stopped in the dusk as the sun sank they did the burying before taking the share of water there were no stones for them to make a cairn to cover fahds corpse rashid ghaffur and caleb scooped away sand with their fists used their nails to dig and made the hole hosni said the prayers with their feet they pushed the sand back over him covered what remained of his head after the sand had taken him the stench of the body stayed with them caleb thought it clung to his robe then they drank their water a quarter of a mug each and moved on the wind only flapped their clothes did not rip them he knew the growing danger they were hunted the boy sat rigid and upright on his camel rode and listened the darkness settled on them and the cool came hosni said i asked you do you hate enough caleb whispered his answer i told you it has not changed hate enough without hate you will fail i have the hate first there was excitement then there was pride after the pride came the hate explain to me when i went to landi khotal with my friends everything was strange was colour was new i was tested then i was chosen i had never known where i came from that excitement i passed through the training camps i was accepted into the brigade i was made a squad leader of course there was pride i had never been trained or accepted had never led before in the camps xray and delta there were two choices two roads i could have surrendered as many have done and submitted or i could have fought them and hated them where you come from is there no love of that place none all my love is for the family that i go back to at the end of this journey the chuckle was low choking beside him bravely said what would be your future if you had not gone to the wedding at landi khotal i would never have known excitement pride and hate caleb said simply and quietly i would be dead and without love i would have nothing i would be choked to death by boredom that i am alive is because i believe in the love of the family you and fahd even tommy and the love of the people who helped me to reach you and the love of those who wait for us great trust is put in you and what you can achieve caleb said i hope not to fail that trust tell me those who were your friends back at your old home if you have achieved what we ask of you what will they say of you they would not understand they live without living without love if they were to spit on your name they are forgotten they are dead i would not care he felt the thin bony hand touch his thigh it seemed to crawl up it then found his fist on the reins it was held tight as in a vice this was his friend not the boys from school or the kids on the canal towpath or the men in the garage this was his family not his mother he lifted his fist he kissed hosnis hand chapter fourteen it is wrong caleb said we have to change he challenged the guide through the dawn the thought had formed in his mind as they had started out again and in the mornings first hours when the sun was high convinced that rashid was wrong he had pushed the exhausted beautiful one forward faster they had been in a long line the guide far in front and the boy far to the back he had come to the guides shoulder the beautiful one stumbled from the effort it is wrong because we make too big a target we have to change he spoke in the language he had learned from the arabs in the brigade what he had learned when they laughed and when they shouted in anger and when they cried in fear he had been with them in good times and in the hell when the bombers had been over them we have to believe that it fired then was recalled because of the wind the wind has gone we have to believe it will return to search for us he could not have counted how many days it was since the great storm and the girl and since tommy had gone down into the sand in all of those days it was the first time he had ridden at the head of the caravan been beside the guide if we are so spread out we make it easier for them for the camera to see one man or one camel than to see us all the desert had changed the formations were now small hills of reddened sand some were twice his height as he rode the beautiful one here the wind had made perfect circles of the hills and between them were the flat areas where sand had been scraped away but the formation of the caravan had concerned him in all the days uncounted he had not thought to challenge the guide we have to close up be tight together we have to make the smallest target possible we have to make it hard for them now the guide turned he had not spoken had not used his rein to slow his camel his face was a loose uncut beard thin lips that were dried and cracked a strong jutted nose narrowed eyes that gleamed and the deep cuts of the lines at his forehead he was a man to fear at his waist was the curved sheath and the dulled worn handle of his knife close to his hands which held the camel reins fastened to his saddle was the rifle the brightness shone in his eyes if they go over us they have five chances of seeing us or six we should make it one chance only caleb had spoken quietly with patience but his mind was made up the decision was taken he had led a section of the brigade the decision was as clear to him as when he had squatted in the cages of xray and delta and had promised himself that he would fight the chechen with the dead eye behind the patch had seen the quality of a leader the interrogators guards and escorts had not if he had needed it the proof of his ability to think on his feet was on his wrist the plastic bracelet with the reference number usafdr he did not discuss did not talk it through with the guide did not ask the guides opinion he spoke it as if he were giving an older but did so with politeness he would not argue he would lead you will say that if we are close and they find us that one missile lulls us all i say if we are close the chance of them finding us is mailer i respect you as my brother but please do it caleb showed his patience he dropped back and for half an hour he rode alongside the leading bull camel he could read the batch number of the manufacturer the stencilled name of the factory from which it had come and the designation of the weapon in the language he had thought he had lost on the wooden crate it carried in half an hour the guide rose on his saddle and waved for hosni to come forward for his son too for them to bring the camels close they were together the heat burned them the suns light reflected up from the sands was cruel in their eyes the shadows were tiny beneath the lumbering hoofs caleb did not look up to search the skies would have brought a weakening of his determination each could touch the other he was strong bart spoke and wroughton listened the pilots are all right thats what hes saying the pilots are fine very professional but theyre not trusted they know it and resent it of course they know it and it hurts morale is poor throughout the air force he says but especially so among the pilots he was told one of them spilled it all out for him that the lack of trust stems from their training they go to california or arizona theyre off to the land of the free where they get their introduction to what i think is called fast jets they live among americans and that marks them down in the regimes eyes as potential for contamination they are beyond the reach of the great theocratic state during the training are exposed to influences good pilots yes but how reliable is this useful wroughton nodded but bart thought his attention was far away they were on familiar territory on the low seats behind the palms in the corner of the hotel lobby normally wroughton varied their meetingplace did not create a pattern and it had puzzled bart when this location was named it was the first time bart had ever reported on the air force and hed expected a keener reaction it was the first time that bart had seen wroughton appear haggard tired drawn his tie not over his collar button and his shoes not immaculately polished useful but i think weve heard all this before have you now well what about this armaments i suppose it follows on from what i told you id had from the national guard man you remember the chap training them in riot control yes if they do practice bomb runs then they fly up north up north they load the bombs but they have fuel restrictions they dont carry enough fuel to fly back down to riyadh with a bomb only to get to the range and let it go then they have to land again but up north i expect our air attache would have known that would he i can only offer mr wroughton what im told when they are flying within range of the palaces they are not armed sorry if you already knew that the fear of course is that a pilot may have been poisoned psychologically while training in america two sorts of poison my patient says could be that exposure to america its culture mcdonalds cocacola and pornography has driven him into the fundamentalists arms could be that he realizes the kingdom is backward living in an aged mindset and that a bomb down the chimney of the kings palace would get the place going forward whichever no armaments as i said nothing there thats new wroughton had eased up from his seat bart wondered what had happened in the bastards life he was pleased hed come delayed two appointments and had seen his tormentor fazed wroughton dropped a banknote on the bill i just try to help mr wroughton keep in touch left alone bart finished his juice gulped down what wroughton had left then sauntered across the lobby at the swing doors he realized that the banknote left to cover the price of their two juices would have paid for five and a handsome tip extraordinary through the doors he stood on the step and looked for his driver a red toyota saloon was parked in front of him its engine idling and a european at the wheel wroughton drove out fast in his discovery with the cd plates and bart would have sworn to it the red saloon accelerated followed him out then nestled into a lane two vehicles behind wroughton it could have overtaken and did not bloody hell a tail on eddie bloody wroughton bart was certain of it in barts past there had been briefings on how to recognize surveillance and a tail al mazan village near jenin occupied west bank god if only there were more people like you bart if only he walked at the end of the little column into the central square she was austrian she would only be in al mazan for twenty minutes en route between jenin and nablus the column was peopled by these representatives of a munichbased medical charity and their palestinian escorts when bart had heard that they were to come to jenin for a mornings study then drive on to nablus he had suggested to the organizing committee that a visit to the village however brief would be welcome i do what i can sadly i can do very little tell me again what are the principal complaints of your patients well their overwhelming complaint is the savagery of the military occupation all the hardship stems from it obstruction at every turn by the israeli defence force refusal to allow the entry of medical supplies harassment of doctors and nurses and ambulance crews even me but that is not what you meant she was pretty earnest and her face was a study of concern two palestinian doctors were behind them within earshot an official of the palestine authority was in front her colleagues in the delegation were further ahead fanning out into the square i have here rampant bacterial diseases e coli salmonella typhoid the constant threat of a cholera outbreak you name it i treat amoebic dysentery and toxoplasmosis there is hepatitis a and b then i have the insectvectored illnesses that you will have been told about in jenin dengue fever filariasis and a particularly powerful strain of schistosomiasis where the parasites settle in the bowels rectum and liver here in the occupied west bank miss hardenberger were looking at what your ancestors would have encountered in fifteenthcentury vienna it is so unnecessary without the brutality of the occupation all of them woidd be eradicated every word he said was heard was meant to be the scaffolding was still up in the seven weeks that had passed he had not seen again the woman whose son had been hanged from that upper cross pole in the seven weeks he had been three times to the hut at the checkpoint and had played out his charade of abusing the troops who searched his car he had had nothing to report to joseph and had sensed the last time a frisson of impatience i dont think i know dr bartholomew about schistosomiasis i specialize in midwifery you understand of course of course all i am trying to say to you miss hardenberger is that when you get back to vienna please stand on a rooftop and let the whole of that city know what you have seen please do that i will gods truth i will it happened quickly he was looking into her face a little taken by the scrubbed cleanliness of her skin no cosmetics when the car came by it was driven fast and the two men behind them the doctors quite roughly with urgency pushed bart and the austrian woman from the middle of the street at that moment as the car a rusted limegreen fiat passed them the backseat passenger looked their way a face from a photograph tell me dr bartholomew because your commitment and dedication humble me what did you give up back in england to come here his mind wandered all of the photographs were good they were not standard police photographs front and profile but unguarded surveillance pictures they had a naturalness were recognizable in josephs hut the photographs were ranked in order of sensitivity and the most sensitive were shown to him most often he knew the face of the man in the back seat of the fiat the car sped across the square a normal practice bart grinned you know hernias and hips pregnancy and prostates you gave up so much i tell you miss hardenberger if you are here and you are tempted to drift into selfpity you have only to look around you here selfpity is not an option i hope god watches over you she said softly he smiled at her more importantly he thought did the rapidreaction unit stationed up on the hill at the checkpoint watch over him everything he said was listened to they went past the scaffolding where children waited in line to give flowers to the delegation and there was a shout from the front that they must hurry if they were to visit the medical centre a portakabin shed he let her go ahead said something about not wanting to hog her she walked with the man from the palestine authority alone without the distraction of her chatter he could look better for another sighting of the fiat he saw it down a side alley barely wide enough for it to have parked and for another vehicle to pass the alley was on the righthand side of the wider street that led to the medical centre in the yard of the village school opposite the alley he spotted a good marker a collapsed telephone pole felled by a manoeuvring tank months earlier and not raised again back at their vehicles as the delegation loaded up the austrian woman came to bart stretched up on her toes and kissed his cheek he coidd smell the soft scent of the flowers she held two hours later in the hut at the checkpoint over a mug of coffee and a sweet seed cake he told joseph of the limegreen fiat and the photograph was on the second page at the top among the most sensitive fugitives and he described the flattened telephone pole at the top of the alley you are sure certain there is no possibility of an error none joseph said t think to utilize this we have little time not time enough to make a complicated separation of you from the target dont wish to frighten you be very careful be exceptionally careful bart drove home he fed the cat he sat in his favourite chair the sun beat on the windoivs and he shivered the class finished shuismak what is your name min wayn inta where are you from that morning of the week the last before the lunchbreak beth had her biggest class no history no literature and not the detailed language of the petroleumextraction manuals it was for basics ana afham i understand ureed mutarjem i want an interpreter the class catered for workers from every section of the shaybah complex was always full each time she read out the arabic phrase there followed a choir of voices struggling with the english translation mish mushkila no problem wayn alfunduq where is the hotel in any other week she would have enjoyed the class for its enthusiasm she did not think that any of them as she spoke the arabic and they replied in english had realized that her heart was not with them her concentration was gone the class drifted towards the door with a cacophony of conversation and scraped chairs one of the last to leave gathering up the photocopied sheets she gave them for private study was the head of security she was wiping clean her blackboard she called his name she asked please if he could stay a moment the room cleared yes miss bethany she hesitated then blurted there is something i do not understand if i can be of help she felt stupid she should have backed off but she never did it was not her way she tried to master a fraudulent casualness in her question someone told me that the rub al khali around us is a place of danger is that true he glanced down at his watch as if unwilling to be delayed true and you know that extreme heat dehydration remoteness it is very harsh sorry i dont explain myself danger because of the people who move in the sands false again his eye slipped to his watch and a puzzled frown settled over his eyes in your language you call it the empty quarter that is what it is only the bedouin are there an old culture of trading has given them the knowledge of the sands they can survive there nobody else the bedouin are not thieves they have a tradition of kindness and generosity i know you go into the sands miss bethany when you search for the meteorites and you should be fearful of the conditions of nature but not of criminals only the bedouin are there no other man can survive such a place a stranger who tries to walk in the sands he condemns himself he is dead thank you she dropped her head he lightened now i understand you have heard miss bethany the rumours what they would gossip about in a camel market of terrorists in the sands no no those people are in riyadh jedda and ad dammam not in the desert they would die there excuse me please she was left in the emptied room she wiped out the last lines on her blackboard min wayn intal and shuismak she smeared out the chalked words where are you from who are you in the boxes are the stinger missiles do you know about the stinger missiles hosni was laid across the neck of his camel and his voice was a reedy frail whisper caleb crouched in his saddle to hear him once i saw one but not close they are old we do not know whether they are affected by the age but they are important they moved in a tightened knot man close to man camel brushing against camel and he smelt the sweat on the guide and the boy on the egyptian and himself the foul breath panted by the camels his knee bumped against a boxs edge on the flank of a pack bull i saw one when we tried to hold a line beyond kabul but the bombers were too high caleb said it was not fired the stinger turned the war for us against the soviets the soviets had a great fear of them hosni coughed tried to spit as if the old memory of an enemy required it i was never taught to fire one we bring them across the desert deliver them then they will be moved on taken to where there is a target but we do not know whether they will operate tommy opened the boxes and there were manuals inside they were written for americans and tommy could not read american should we leave them behind caleb had changed the order of the march he expected to be listened to will the weight of them kill the camels you are the outsider to us i am told to escort you i am told to bring you to the heart of the family i do not know where you have come from who you were i do not ask two are already lost but four remain if i ask whether you can read the american manual of the stinger then you tell me something of yourself my ignorance is your protection i am asking you is their weight worth the life of the camels do they slow us what is more important you and me or the stingers he knew the answer expected to be told what he knew tell me he did not know what the pale watering eyes saw but they speared at him and the voice grew in its pitch i think you show ignorance perhaps it is only the stingers if they work that will get us you and me through to those who wait for us the next time we stop i will open a box take the manual and read it and read it i will because of my importance caleb said for a moment hosni struggled to rise in his saddle but the pinions held him caleb saw the man who had fought the soviets who had given his life to the struggle of the emir general saw the controlled anger i warn you ignorance you will learn from vanity will destroy you with vanity comes arrogance with arrogance comes failure imagine caravans move columns of men move mule trains move men struggle not only through this desert but through mountains through passes through streets and through the alleyways of souks they come from the doorways of mosques and from the entrances to caves you are only one man do you believe the organization of the emir general depends on one man whose past gives him importance we are many a hundred men move some will be slopped some captured some will be killed and they will be replaced by another thousand in an engine you are one tooth in one cog i ask of you never again show me your vanity caleb flinched the boy close behind him would have heard the attack and the guide in front it was as if he had been struck he felt small a pygmy dwarfed by this needlethin old man whose hand he had kissed in love the next time we stop i will read the manual a dozen men and women sat in two lines divided by computers two lines of six facing each other separated by the screens and keyboards the raindrops from their run between the car park and the libtary entrance were on the shoulders of lovejoys coat and the waxed waterproof loaned to the american the skies outside were ashen and the forecast was for rain all day then an unsettled week no clear blue skies on the horizon he spoke quietly to the chief librarian hed telephoned her in the morning and been told at what time the internet class was scheduled to finish he didnt do tourist trips theyd stayed in a hotel just outside the centre of wolverhampton gone early to bed because the american seemed exhausted from his overnight flight over breakfast lovejoy had made his calls which had culminated in a less than frank conversation with the chief librarian this was the first step he had not taken the american for a drive round the sights of wolverhampton but had killed time in the hotel lobby the first step always made michael lovejoy nervous and his justification for going to the library had been brief and terse the library was three miles southwest of wolverhampton nine miles northeast of the birmingham city plazas after eight phone calls lovejoy had spoken to the chief librarian and had heard what he wanted she was a middleaged woman who introduced herself as aggie who was careful in her appearance and had the brightness of enthusiasm to her lovejoy was a lecturer from the university of birmingham the american a complication to the cover story was not introduced had been told not to speak just smile right well done everybody the hours up aggies voice boomed in the librarys quiet it reflected her endeavour the interior was bright cheerful and clean it had a section at the far end for magazine reading and the newspapers there was an annexe for children surrounded by shelved picture books and boxes of toys away against the end wall was the double bank of computers she might have been speaking to juveniles but those she addressed were in their twilight years if you could please switch off close down youre making great progress im very pleased lovejoy held the audiocassette player and the american had the tape in his pocket im going to ask you to meet michael hes from birmingham university and hes needing some guineapigs for a socialawareness project she spoke slowly as if she might not be understood and loudly because the majority of them wore hearingaids shed explained on the phone earlier that her internet familiarization class for senior citizens starting at eleven offered him a chance to meet older community members in a group that day and hed checked it out there was no specified gathering of the elderly at either the workingmens club or at the british legion it was in his opinion the best chance of meeting men and women whose lives were embedded in the area born and reared there worked and retired there they looked up at him tired eyes magnified by spectacles and he thought he saw an expectation of interest after the struggle to master the computers intricacies and the internet that was now forced on them i ask you to listen very thoroughly to what michael says and then help him hes relying on you she waved for them to leave their blank screens and follow her to the chairs in the magazine reading section they straggled after her live men and seven women all ethnic white all with pale aged faces two used wooden walkingsticks and one had a metal hospital slick she arranged the chairs so they made a halfcircle behind a table and they sat lovejoy put the cassette player on the table and reached out for the american to pass him the tape he slotted it into the player he sensed the scepticism of the american behind him they hadnt spoken much so far it was a long journey from the caribbean sunshine of guantanamo bay to a public library three miles southwest of wolverhampton he lifted his voice ladies and gentlemen im very grateful for your time you are the experts and you can help me aggie tells me that all of you have lived here all your lives youll know accents youll be able to place one for my socialawareness project i need to test your knowledge of where an accent comes from which community it originates from im going to play you a tape you wont understand the language used on the tape and that must not bother you but i want to see if you recognize from what area that voice comes please dont guess i need you to be certain he used his winning smile mercy lovejoy liked to say that that smile cultivated over more than two decades as a counterintelligence officer would calm an enraged bull in a china shop would allow him access into the secrets of any life the smile deprecating and almost shy always charmed you will hear a voice in american ignore it then a voice a womans in a language you wont understand ignore that as well then you will hear a male voice and thats the one my project is interested in his finger hovered over the play button only very rarely did michael lovejoy officer of the security service charged with defence of the the realm the safety of these elderly men and women and their children and their grandchildren meet ordinary people his work days were spent roving in the electronic and cyber world of national health service records national insurance contribution numbers and the statistics of personal bank accounts to confront ordinary people who knew nothing of his world challenged his mettle he felt a small shiver of excitement he pressed the play button the americans voice was muffled as if distant from the microphone the people in your village fawzi what do they think about americans the voice of the man behind him drawled bored lovejoy had been told the tape was from one of the last interrogations when hope of live intelligence was dead fulfilling a schedule that said prisoners must be questioned once a month can you tell me how the people in your village regard americans in a pretty poor light lovejoy thought he had read the file in his room last night and the file said that the family of fawzi alateh taxidriver had supposedly been pulverized by the bombs from a b aircraft except that the taxidriver was bogus and came not from a godforsaken village in afghanistan but from here the womans translation was similarly distorted the voice played in the hushed area of the library they strained to hear it they leaned forward and one reached inside his jacket to tweak the control of his hearingaid he thought them all humble decent generous people their new clothes would have come from charity shops and their old clothes would have been repaired with needle and thread he depended on them the voice was the target of the microphone was sharp one woman deep in fierce concentration reached out over the table and made a twisting gesture and lovejoy turned up the volume dial camp delta swamped the section of the library the voice died away the question came before the accident fawzi and we very much regret accidents accidents are inevitable in modern hightechnology warfare did your village people welcome the intervention of the united states against the repression of the taliban and against the terrorism of al qaeda did t h e y he switched off the machine had been concentrating on the faces and had not intended the tape should run into the second question ladies and gentlemen thats a first playing and i can play it as many times as you want wheres he from wheres that young man from some were certain of where he was not from hes not from moxley tisnt ocker id swear on that not from dudley and ill tell you something else hes speaking asian but he isnt may speak asian but hes not right alf asians cant do the v cant get their tongues round it asians say wehicles they say wery cant do v and it isnt tipton or upper gornal not lower gornal neither youre right about what asians cant say alf but its south from wolverhampton lovejoy so quietly that it was barely noticed intervened hed reckoned taken the gamble that he was not wasting his morning that the elderly whose lives were lived southwest of wolverhampton stuck in the concrete of their streets immured in their communities would have a knifesharp recognition of strangers they would know where the stranger came from he interrupted let me play it again to you can you tell me where you think he comes from they listened transfixed to the voice and he sensed the start of recognition its more like deepfield dont you mean woodcross i think its sort of ettingshall what about lanesfield what you reckon alf there was always a leader in any group in the internet familarization group the leader was alf a heavy man bald his trousers held under his gut by a broad leather belt its not ettingshall and not lanesfield but thats close im reckoning its up spin road from coseley but not as far as ettingshall its where your cousin is edna the one with the pigeons wonderful birds champions ever so many rosettes he doesnt want to know about pigeons edna he wants to know where that young chappies from im saying hes from between coseley and ettingshall i think youre right alf between coseley and ettingshall youve got it alf funny him speaking asian but not being thats it between coseley and ettingshall definite lovejoy picked up the cassette player took out the tape and passed it to the american he smiled his thanks then told them how much they had helped his project he shook aggies hand and left them chattering happily about ednas cousins racing pigeons the american trailed after him and out into the car park they ran in the rain dived into the volvo and lovejoy snatched the newly purchased map from the glovebox and began to spill through the pages was that scientific no lovejoy said it was better than science could give you if they say it i believe it white and not asian which is going to blow the roof off delta jesus christ lovejoys finger found the page then pointed to and rapped down on the names ettingshall and coseley about a mile and a half apart thats where your mans from bet your pension on it i can only tell you eddie what he told me teresa leaned against the door and two of her kids the youngest hung from her skirt the other two were shouting inside he wasnt proud of it you getting the turnaround in the lobby but there were things what he told me that were too grand to cut you in on i see for gods sake eddie surely there are things you wouldnt share with the agency even with juan maybe hes sleeping down there nathan his sidekick came round for his spares when juan rings shall i tell him you called by wroughton said evenly i wouldnt want to bother him wouldnt want to disturb him she couldnt see behind his tinted glasses but she fancied his eyes would have blazed come on eddie you know what its like he seemed not to hear her had already turned his back she watched him walk briskly away across the lawn and past the pakistani garden boy she was not prepared to incubate a feud so she stayed in the doorway and waved to him to a friend as he drove off aggressively fast she was still in the doorway when he went through the guarded entrance gates and pulled out into the traffic she saw a red toyota car come up behind him brake then follow him away she watched and waved until eddie was gone inside the kids shouting had become screaming she closed the front door and went into the kitchen to play peacemaker it upset her that there was not peace between her husband and his best friend and she did not know what was too critical for sharing between them he heard the voice in his headphones like it caressed him no better time than the present at your own pace guys oscar golf out it was fourteen minutes since the camera slung to the belly of first lady had found them inside the ground control the heat baked them the desultory conversations between marty and lizzyjo had died george was behind them with the water the screens were in front of them and their focus was on the central picture beamed down to them the tactic of the target had changed from an altitude of twentythree thousand feet and a ground speed of seventyone knots the picture was transmitted to the middle screen the largest marty held her steady optimum weather conditions on figureeight passes over the target and she went through the programmes that changed surveillance to target acquisition the water george had poured on to his head which ran down his back and stomach had cooled him he felt good had the right to marly could stand alongside the former air force pilots who flew for the agency out of bagram because he had killed he thought himself a veteran she had not spoken about the sex hadnt touched him hadnt brushed against him like shed distanced herself from him her mouse was undone again to her waist and hed seen the water run down to the flesh folds of her stomach she had the target on camera followed it and never let it go while he made the figureeight passes and thought she seemed older than before more clinical than hed known her when you going to go next pass she said i dont have a problem his fingers were softer on the joystick than the last time then he had had the wind to fight she had it on the wide angle the camera caught the target as it moved a little wriggling beetle over the expanse of sand what had changed the target was closed up it was now the ninth hour since he had taken first lady up two hours into the flight they had circled over the first missile strike and he had seen the twin blackened craters and the carcass of the camel and then they had started to hunt he had taken first lady on a crisscross of patterns over the desert floor a pursuit that was relentless after fugitives who could have no hope that was what hed thought inevitable he had not doubted that lizzyjos camera would find them nothing shrill in her voice when she had no blurt of excitement only the gesture of her hand then the finger pointing to the right upper quarter of the screen shed worked the camera and the target had gone to the screens centre fourteen minutes later he brought first lady back on the figureeight curves and lizzyjo was going through the procedures for firing the beetle moved so slowly they were tight together he wondered whether they searched the skies gazed up at the sun and burned out their eyes they would fail the heat haze came up off the sand round them distorted the picture but it remained clear enough for him to see them to watch their crawling progress he saw four men he did not know them they had no identity for him he remembered what gonsalves had said it echoed in his mind the hardest man the strongest the man they need the man that can hurt us most a man without fear he saw four men saw no threat no danger no chance of risk four men on camels in the desert she said when you turn behind them im launching marty wished he knew them wished he saw the threat the danger they made what are they thinking she darted a glance at him god i dont know doesnt that matter what theyre thinking thinking about water about chow thinking about a shower i dont know thinking about us what are they thinking about us whether weve found them i suppose how the hell should i know whether were over them he saw them on the screen worked the joystick and banked first lady so that she would line up behind them for the strike thats not an answer what do they think about us about hating us about having contempt for us you want to be their shrink marty forget it think of your duty to our country and do your job forget that shit i dont know what theyre thinking and i dont care marty said softly we are flying westnorthwest wind speed eight knots our air speed is i got all that going in five he did not know about them and that hurt in his mind the whisper port side gone his fingers tightened on the joystick and he compensated for the luch of first lady she was thrown up at an angle starboard side dipping he heard the little gasp of annoyance from beside him hed been slow in making the commands that held her steady on the central screen the fireball seemed to loiter before it started to race away on its guided descent he had her steady and he waited for the next leap of first lady which didnt come you shooting im holding look at them marty look at them run tn the big screen the central one the beetle below the fireball broke up bastards marty saw the panic scattering of the camels they went in crazy lines like theyd broken the knot that held them at that height and with the oblique firing angle the hellfire would fly for seventeen seconds halfway down he saw from the fireball the little adjustments she made as she guided it and he watched the camels career together and apart he watched their panic lie was the voyeur he was the hardbreathing youth in the shadows of the car park above the ocean where the university students brought their girls he rubbernecked the stampede of the camels the missile went into the sand the hellfire was for a tank firing a hellfire at nellis the sensor operator should get an armourpiercing warhead up against a tank turret from twentyfour thousand feet should get a hit on the range within one yard of the aimed point instructors liked to reckon they could hit within half a foot on a stationary tank turret nobody at nellis had ever thought of a target of running camels for an impact of a fragmentation warhead the dustcloud rose the cloud came up towards the camera lens marty lost the camels did not know whether they were under it or had escaped it there was a darkness at the core of the cloud then a fire flash in its heart red flame blossomed from the cloud they had hit ordnance the new fire burst through the cloud and climbed then guttered smoke dark and poisonous black replaced the fire the voice came in his ear massaged him like her fingers had good work guys secondary explosions would prove youve hit gold please look at your screens extreme left i see empty camels on the right side ten oclock but you should be looking extreme left four oclock centre on that target and take it oscar golf out alone in the desert a single camel ran marty had been to ten oclock four camels together like they were tied no riders then lizzyjo was raking the picture across going to four oclock and zooming the picture was tugged to closeup and she tweaked the lost focus a single camel ran in the sand wove between the hills marty came over it the camel stumbled like it had no more running left in it tried again then stopped the screen was filled with the camel it stopped like its spirit was broken it sank the knees went from under it the technology that marty watched that lizzyjo worked showed a camel run to exhaustion and crumpling he saw the weight that the camel could no longer run with the vomit was in his throat he was the representative of a master race four point five four recurring miles below the camera an old man was laid out on the back of the camel beside him lizzyjo trilled amazement this is just wonderful gear incredible like hes just down under us eight million dollars of predator at factorygate prices circled an old man on a camel and lining up against him was a hundred thousand dollars of hellfire with a fragmentation warhead he could see the old mans face and a blur of greying hair and the old man seemed to twist his head and look up and he would have seen nothing and would have heard nothing marty did not know why the old man had not jumped clear of the knelt camel why he had not gone away from it he was stretched across the camel from the hump to the neck did he know must have his arm came up first marty thought it was like a salute wrong the arm was outstretched pointed upwards towards first lady fuck you he thought the arm raised said fuck you to him lizzyjo let the second hellfire go for a dozen of the sixteen seconds of its fireball flight marty watched the screen then turned away his eyes closed he did not watch its hit he spun his chair and ripped off his headset he pushed away georges hand and went to the door he heard lizzyjo murmur to her mouth microphone that her pilot had gone off station he stood in the door above the steps the vomit cascaded from his bowed head when he was conscious he could feel the warm wetness of the blood but caleb drifted when he came back to consciousness he could feel the pain it was deep waves conscious he did not know how they had made the litter and how they clung to the undersides of the camels bellies hanging from the hidden saddle straps the litter three sacks was suspended low down between the beautiful one and rashids camel he was belted by the animals legs and rocked from the motion of their walk on the far side of him was the boy father and son gasping held themselves against the stomachs of the camels and behind them was the last of the bulls when the pain came and the scent of the blood he could remember the boy had howled the warning the fire had come down on them the blow with the hot wind and the clap of the thunder had felled him they had snatched him up father and son he was hidden as were rashid and ghaffur the last sight he had seen was the one camel hosni strapped across it fleeing from them he prayed to sleep to lose the pain chapter fifteen the cloth against his head was wet and cold it stank with stale odour the voice said do not try to speak with great gentleness the cloth was wiped on his forehead round his eyes and on his cheeks a little of the dribble from it rested on his lips it stung his eyes he tried to move to shift the weight on his back but the effort brought the pain he gasped and for a moment the cloth was across his mouth you must not cry out how long he had been unconscious asleep dead he did not know the pain was in his leg and at the side of his head when he tried to shift the pain was agony in his leg and his head throbbed if you are seen heard it will have been for nothing you must not be found the cloth over his face calmed him his eyes moved not his head the night was around them rashid crouched over him laid the cloth in a bucket lifted it squeezed the water from it then spread it cool and bringing life back across his throat and his upper chest he lay on the same sacks that had made the litter and in his nose was the smell of shit and urine his flies buzzed him close to him were the hoofs of the camels as if she were alerted by his faint movements or the guides murmured voice the beautiful one arched her neck down and her nostrils nudged against him beyond the camels fires burned he heard roaming voices laughter and the scrape of harnesses he smelt cooking meat carried on the wind and spices mixed with boiling rice could recognize them through the stench of the camels and his own excreta he squinted to see better and shadows passed across the fires when a shadow approached closer to them rashid reached for his rifle and was alert but the shadow ignored them and went on they were separated by thornbushes from a great gathering of men and animals when it reached his lips and he sucked at it the water was foul old he retched could not bring anything up and the choking in his throat and gut brought back the agony in his leg and the hammer in his head rashid cradled him i thought you were dead i praise god the voice guttered in his ear for three days and three nights i thought you were the scrape of a fingernail from death only god could have saved you i sent chaffur for help i asked him to go alone into the sands and his life is with god all the water we had was for you and one day back and one night it was finished now we are at a wellhead it is bad water it has not rained here for many years but it is the water that god has given us if you are found here there will be people who will see your wounds and will know you are an outsider to the sands and they will seek to sell you to the government or they will kill you and lake your head to the government and ask money for it we came in the night and we will leave in the night with gods protection you should rest death is still close to you if god forgets you then you are dead the words croaked in calebs throat you sent your son i sent my son into the sands that you might live we are just two men that we are alive is because of the egyptian he rode away from us he took the eye in the sky from us the eye went after him i heard the explosion as we fled he gave his life for us for you you have to live it is owed to him and to your son his eyes closed his hold on what was around him slackened so tired so weak he did not have the strength to think of the wound in his leg or the wound in the side of his head he drifted he was by the canal on the pavement close to the blackpainted door was kicking the ball in the yard and aiming at the glass in the hatch of the overturned washingmachine he was nothing nobody he lost the pain lost the cool healing touch of the wet cloth he lost the image of the boy his bright mischief eyes sent by his father and alone in the sands in the hummer they played willie nelson loud will drove and pete did the satellite navigation help me make it through the night came out of the cd system two more hummers with the arabs followed them will never trusted an arab to drive him and pete never reckoned anyone else but himself could do better on navigation both rated the hummer the civilian version of the armys humvee as the best there was on wheels and capable of taking them where a helicopter screwed up with the density altitude barrier from the heat could not they were the same age had been through the same galveston education line lived on adjacent plots in the houston suburbs and did the same work they were two gasextraction field surveyors blood brothers the trip never a snide word between them had already taken them across in excess of six hundred miles of sand but the mapping now was complete that night if the hummer with three tonnes loaded on her held up and the hummers with the arabs behind them they would be on a late plane back to riyadh they were on the exxonmobil books earned good money and the world because of where they were owed them it time had slipped away two and a half weeks of it for eighteen days they had driven camped worked in the empty quarter without sight of human company other than the arabs who travelled behind them top temperature out there was a confirmed fahrenheit the hummer took them anywhere they fancied going up dunes and down them through loose sand well well lookeyhere will was imagining the juicy burger hed have on their return to the riyadh hotel hey no foolin take a look will said well ill be you got some hawk eyes on you id have driven right on by i dont reckon we should look it hes just a kid a hundred yards a little more to the right of where they came down off the dune were a child and a camel the camel stood and the boy sat in its shade at that distance through the sealed sandsprayed windows they could see each of them the gaunt resignation on the boys face the camel dead on its feet didnt even turn towards them as they edged closer like theyre jus waitin to die this is one evil fucking place i reckon the camels just stopped wont go another step youre gonna go and git yourself a rosette pete thats one good deed for the day fifteen minutes later they moved on the kid was stowed on top of the luggage mountain on the second hummer the camel was dead shot with a bullet to the head by their camp manager they were two hard men away from home in houston for eight months of every year played hard and drove themselves hard neither spoke pete had a wet eye and will would have choked on any words the kid had held the camel soft hands round its neck as the rifle barrel had gone against its head and the big dopey brown eyes had been on the kid blood had spattered when the bullet had been fired new blood on old across the kids robe old caked blood covered the kids robe he wouldnt talk of it the camp manager had tried hadnt gotten an answer it wasnt the kids blood what the kid said translated by the camp manager he had to get to miss bethany at shaybah and nothin else will thought of the fruit machines he played when he could find them thought he had a better chance of a onceayear jackpot than the kid had had of being spotted out there in the sand pete reckoned that someone up there in the clear blue sky must have cared for the kid must have watched out for him because if hed come down the dunes heading left theyd never have seen him the hummer powered towards shaybah the latenight flight out and burgers in riyadh the deputy governor was ushered out by gennifer before the outer door had closed the ambassador had the internal phone against his face gonsalves that you the ambassador here get yourself down to me please with a degree of urgency he reflected power had shifted from his desk the evacuation of military personnel from the big airbase south of the capital had grievously wounded his status the war in iraq had further damaged it the pending lawsuits where legal men back in new york talked billions of dollars in prohibitive damages on behalf of the victims of the twin towers against members of the ruling elite the royal family had caused a breakdown in precious trust the compound attacks in riyadh had been a coffin nail before the evacuation the war the filed suit and the suicide bombers assault he would have told with exquisite politeness the deputy governor to go stuff himself the world marched on and the kingdom was no longer his fiefdom another year and he would be teaching at yale the door opened after a knock and gennifer showed the agency man inside he launched gonsalves this is not a criticism i have no complaint about the liaison you have had with me you told me and i acknowledge it that you were bringing a predator team into the shaybah field base for as i remember it surveillance of the rub al khali under a pretence of mapping and also the testing of performance in extreme heat well we have a problem the ambassador was a man for whom personal appearances mattered he changed his shirt twice in a day and three times if he had an important evening function he always wore a tie never dragged the knot down or loosened his collar button opposite him lounging and appearing at the edge of sleep gonsalves wore jeans a grubby vest and an open shirt his face was stubbled his hair uncombed like some damned fed in deep cover in little italy the right gear for lamppost leaning the local authorities here are increasingly suspicious of us there is growing obstruction it comes down to a desire to derail us just out of my office is the deputy governor the province that includes that big block of sand and shaybah we are not welcome no longer are predator aircraft welcome at shaybah we have little prying eyes watching us youd know that better than me seeking to flex longunused muscles i suppose theres other places you can go djibouti or dohar but the door at shaybah is closed two alternatives ship out and smile cut them in and tell them what youre doing i know which i would go for personally i would not trust the last live rat in the kingdom with detail of any antial qaeda operation of sensitivity i think you should talk to your people i bought you some time probably about three days but no more not too many clouds passed over the riyadh sun a cloud flitted across gonsalves face he was up and heading for the door like hed a bayonet under his backside it was surveillance wasnt it gonsalves just surveillance from the door a childs smile spread across the agency mans face yes we were watching them right down to the time the hellfires hit we watched them when the secondary explosions ordnance blew if you ever get tired of tv movies just call me and ill send you down a video three days the smile was gone its a prime route to where they are it was like they were wary of each other there were areas that were offlimits the light had gone out for him lizzyjo thought three days and three nights back george had thrown a bucket of water on to the ground control steps but there were still scrapes on the treads of his driedout vomit hed brought her in had made a good landing for first lady then had gone to his tent he had not studied the video the morning after not like the first time had not seen a second time the zoomed lens image of the old man bent across the camels neck he had not gone out to see the handiwork of george on the fuselage of first lady the new skullandcrossbones stencil had not eaten with her had not talked with her what did he think it was all for a teen game in an arcade staying in for computer warfare because it was raining outside there hadnt been fun between them or laughter three days and three nights that was enough she looked away from her screen flipped off the switch that gave voice contact to oscar golf ok so he looked like your damn granpa so what you think al qaeda pensions them out dont do granpas dont be a wuss youre a kid who wants to play with the big boys toys grow up next time you want to go soft im making certain the whole worlds going to hear and youll be dead in a junkyard she slipped the switch back regained voice contact with langley the sand slipped across her screen as it had done for most of the hours of three days and three nights all the time that first lady had flown when they landed her seven more hours and into the night she would be grounded for maintenance the next day they would take up carnival girl the old lady she was beginning to hate the fucking sand on the screen it was empty had been in all their flying hours spread over three days and three nights and the realtime camera in the day and the electroopticinfrared in the darkness had shown up nothing the teleprinter started up they were on new boxes theyd circled where the old man had been lying across the kneeling camel before the hellfire pulverized him and theyd stayed up there on station till the smoke dust had cleared when the cloud had gone after theyd seen the small crater hed brought her back over the first hit and the larger crater then theyd gone searching four camels no riders in the screen four camels tied together no men followed for a halfhour then allowed to go on if theyd searched again hard enough she thought theyd have found one camel down and the rest standing and unable to drag themselves clear or two camels down dying in the sand under the sun best that theyd been given a new set of boxes to work over lizzyjo tore the sheet off the teleprinter she felt bad at the verbal abuse shed given him but did not know an alternative listen she said just less than seventy hours and were out of here the saudis have closed us down if thats what bagram is were going home hey you shoot you score we wiped out bad people and their granpa wasted them he came out of the supermarket he loathed the place a little corner of london or new york but it was fast and quick faster and quicker because so many of the expatriates it was designed to serve had checked out from the kingdom gone back where theyd come from he would have liked to browse in a street market buy what was local but the security situation forbade it in two plastic bags eddie wroughton carried a sliced loaf of bread two litres of milk and three chilled mealsforone that would go into his microwave a kilo of new zealandgrown apples and two containers of water allegedly bottled in scotland that evening had it been normal but it was not he should have eaten at the gonsalves kitchen table then chucked a softball in their backyard he crossed the car park there were high lights sufficient to show him his own vehicle but they threw down shadows he did not see the red toyota or the man who loitered close to it the lights fell for a moment on his linen suit and his laundered white shirt the silk of his tie glistened and made stars on the darkness of his glasses his mind unravelled an old memory the family sunday lunch and the next day he was going to century house for the start of his recruits induction course his father there his grandfather and his greatuncle old warriors of intelligence and the talk had gone on from how he should conduct himself with his examiners and had eddied to comfortable nostalgia old campaigns refought and port passed cigars lit and the bone had been the favourite one for chewing the americans never trust them eddie never ever the greatest sin for an american is to lose dont forget that eddie dont make certain youre on a different planet if theyre losing dont be up close a chap once said america is a big happy dog in a small room and each time it wags its tail it breaks something they dont even notice eddie the damage they do be your own man not their poodle he had thought juan gonsalves was his friend he reached his vehicle zapped his lock then the shadow was across him he opened the back door to dump the bags is that mr wroughton mr eddie wroughton the voice english language and foreign accent whined he turned the man came from the shadows tall and wiry middle aged with a sharpness in his eyes he said curtly yes thats me is that the bastard who fucks my wife nowhere to back off to his vehicle was behind him the man was in front of him from the high lights he saw the clenched fists and the stonebruised sandscraped boots and the loathing at the mouth wroughton stiffened felt the deadness in his legs and arms couldnt have run could have shouted out could have yelled for security at the main doors but his throat had tightened nothing would have come from it he saw the right boot swing back the kick came into his shin against the bone and the pain ran rivers he crumpled his head went down and the clenched fist hit him on the side of the jaw the edge of his cheek more kicks some on the thigh and the target was his groin more fist blows and his head was a punchball he was down men from the royal military police came to the fort on the south coast outside portsmouth and taught selfdefence last time hed been on the course was seven years back before the posting to riga he tried to protect his head could not protect head and testicles one or the other it was done cold iced venom not frantic or flailing it was the attack of a streetfighter where had a bloody belgian agronomist learned the tactics of a streetfighter nothing said not a word the man did not even pant wroughton felt the blood in his mouth he was not going to die he knew that the man was too calm to kill him intended only to humiliate the tinted spectacles had gone and he heard the crunch of the boot on them then a hand snatched at his tie grasped the silk and pulled up his head with it twice as he choked on the tightened knot the fist hit his face once the lower lip once the bridge of his nose the man spat in his face the tie was let go wroughton fell back the shadow moved away from him the blood was on his chin and in his mouth it washed round his teeth and ran in his throat as the clatter of the boots left him he managed in a supreme effort to lift himself on one elbow through a spew of blood wroughton shouted pity you couldnt satisfy her she said you were a lousy screw the boots went away the stride never breaking he pulled himself up using the doorhandle and sagged into the seat then drove out of the car park wroughton knew enough of personal medicine to realize that if any of his ribs had been broken or his wrist or his jaw the pain would have been too great for him to drive what was hurt was his pride he went through deserted streets what was kicked and punched blown away was his prized selfesteem he reached the compound and held up his id for the guard to see his face turned away inside he stripped off his clothes moaning at the struggle to loosen the belt the zip and the buttons his linen suit was torn at the knees and elbows and smeared with the car parks dirt his shirt was bloodstained when he had binned the suit shirt socks shoes and underclothes he crawled across the floor dragged out the telephone plug then switched off his mobile eddie wroughton could not face the world naked he sat in his chair and let the darkened room close around him she lay on the stone patio she thought of love far in the distance below the bungalow she heard the highpitched roar of a powered engine for bethany jenkins love was alive infatuation no lust no love yes damnit it consumed her love was the skin could be pinched scratched scraped but could not be shed the hard skin on her legs and arms the soft skin below the hair on her thighs the tanned skin on her face she could not forget him her mother had said to her once on a third gin and italian that shed seen her father across a crowded box at newbury races before theyd met before theyd spoken and known when their eyes had met through the shoulders and between the heads that he was the man with whom she would live her life love was not as beth reckoned it the product of introductions made by grandmothers aunts and best friends wasnt about bloody suitability love was not sensible love happened and fuck the consequences love was the chance meeting on the upper deck of a latenight london bus in a carriage on a train out of kings cross going north love was not about earning prospects in the city nor about decent families and fat inheritances it was beyond control did not have an agenda a rifle was raised a knife was grasped and a man held her life in his hand she didnt know him he didnt know her he had put aside the rifle had shielded her from the knife had protected her she had not believed him shed said are you going to try to rape me are you going to kill me shed held the little opened penknife with the twoinch blade hed said no i am going to dig you out he had and she had loved him well i cant bloody help it she said to the moths its not my fault blame the bloody hormones the beams came up the track towards her bungalow beth would have said that she remembered him with more clarity now on the patio than an hour after he had disappeared over the crest of the dune would her mother understand it would take more than three gin and italians if beth ever met him again for her mother to take her daughter into her arms and gush oh thats wonderful darling im so happy for you love came out of a sky that was clear blue the big vehicle stopped on the track in front of her small green watered garden and more moths danced in its headlights a window lowered a voice called to her is this the residence of miss bethany are you miss bethany maam it is i am the door nearest her opened she saw the bundle lifted with big hands over the passengers body like it had been over the gear lever then it was dropped down she saw the boy blood was caked on his robe youll forgive the intrusion maam we found him out in the sands his camel was finished and he was damned near gone we filled him up with water he gave us your name where hes come from i dont know i dont have time to play with maam weve a plane to catch hes not hurt nothing wrong with him cept his tongue all i know is he gave your name so i can take him back to security at the gate and dump him or i can leave him here and were running late for our plane maam its your decision leave him here she said the boy was part of him she remembered the boys whistle sharp through the fingers at the small mouth telling him it was time to leave her she saw the dark bloodstain on his robe and the lighter spatter that surrounded it she felt so bloody weak the boy came from him she knew it and she knew the dark bloodstain was his dont you ever listen mum dont you ever care

strangely calmed she had the telephone in her hand had dialled and she heard it ring out an age before it was answered yes she heard a stifled yawn samuel bartholomew whos that she swallowed hard you may remember me beth jenkins i remember you fit as a flea sorry about the time not a problem what can i do for you a line was drawn in front of her the boy was behind her gorged with food and water from her fridge she had questioned him a mix of brusque interrogation and of gentle probing she knew what had happened and that he was wounded the boy had described a gash to the head and a slashed leg and the blood of proof was on the boys robe with simplicity the boy had described the injuries the weakness the loss of consciousness he might already be dead lost and gone dead and the boy had described a track and she had taken the bigscale map down from a shelf above her desk spread it on the tiled floor and knelt beside it with the telephone the line was drawn in front of her it was like the deep indentation made by the tyres of an earthmoving caterpillar tractor it could not be missed or avoided it stretched either way in front of her the line blocked her she recognized the moment did not delude herself the moment would define her life she could step over it she could turn her back on it are you still there i asked what i can do for you miss jenkins she did not know who else she could have turned to only this slugfat man at the end of a longdistance phone line not the doctor at the shaybah clinic from the emirates she took the step crossed the line i need you down here in the desert excuse me but im in riyadh dont you have medical staff where you are i need you im afraid i think it reasonable of me miss jenkins to request an explanation he was the only doctor she could have called its a friend yes who is hurt out in the sands then get a helicopter miss jenkins get a helicopter to lift him out that is not possible she said and the calm had not deserted her im not following you whats he done turned his vehicle over she sensed the boy standing motionless behind her eyes on her not understanding her the boy had been in the desert for three days and three nights he had hazarded his life to come to her beth said crisply i cant send for a helicopter i cannot use a local doctor my friend has been wounded in military action god military action am i really hearing this from a missile attack dr bartholomew my friend has a head wound and a leg wound i think he has very little time do you have any comprehension of what youre asking of me i do because im asking it of myself an enemy of the regime is that your friend he is just my friend i lead an easy life miss jenkins what you request is she heard only the wheeze of his breathing she thought of him in turmoil and the sweat running on his neck she was across the line she waited did not help him she let the silence hang god help me why am i doing this where did you say you were where do i come to when shed told him when shed ended the call beth took the boy out on to her patio she pointed she showed him the distant lights in the compound under one awning brightly lit were the fuselage and the extended wings of an aircraft but the space under the nearer awning was empty the boy called it the eye in the sky he told her of the predator which carried two missiles could not be heard could not be seen and had found them twice she had her hand on the boys shoulder and it rested on the darker bloodstain mapping evaluation of performance under conditions of extreme heat the bitch the lying bitch she went inside the boy following her and she emptied cupboards of what she would need to take i dont think im going to be able to help you the headteacher leaned back in his swivel chair jed watched him dont get me wrong mr lovejoy im not being obstructive here of course i will do everything i can to help everything within my ability and i quite understand that on a matter of national security you are vague to the point of opacity on the reasons for your visit but and i dont wish to obstruct i am just not able to help beside jeds feet was a bucket into which leaking rainwater dripped with monotony every fifteen seconds the walls were damp too and posters peeled off them he did not think that the headteacher his face pale from the drudgery of work lied the photograph he had brought from guantanamo lay on the cluttered desk youll deserve an explanation for my negative response you believe the man whose photograph you have shown me is approximately twentyfour years old and therefore left the adelaide a minimum of six years ago i have been here two years and i doubt youll find a single member of my staff who has taught here for more than four years put brutally we dont last adelaide comprehensive is a sink school believe me its hard work it sucks the enthusiasm from you im not ashamed to say it we burn out here and quickly if were lucky we move on somewhere else where the stress is jess acute if were unlucky we sign on with a doctor and accept our failure we try to prepare our students for adult life to give them a smattering of education occasionally we even hit the heights of an exam pass but the future of the majority is car theft petty burglary drugdealing underage pregnancy vandalism the truth is youthful ambition other than for criminality is rare indeed jed saw a sudden smile crease the headteachers face i have to say that the vision of a past pupil of adelaide comprehensive rising to be a serious player against the security of the state appears to me to be almost ludicrous ambition is rare boredom is endemic fatalism is contagious they see no hope what do they look for the ultimate good benefits a hottedup car with antisocial speakers at full blast not the destruction of the united kingdom look this area from which my school feeds is listed in the dozen most deprived parts of britain jed took the cue lovejoy had stood and picked up the photograph the headteacher shrugged there was nothing more to be said they saw themselves out left the beaten man behind them the rain still fell not a cleansing rain jed thought but a dirtied contaminating rain he had taken michael lovejoy on trust all of the elation he had felt at unravelling a god almightysized error at guantanamo was being scrubbed out of him in the english rain behind them was an avenue of closed classrooms now darkened where nothing had been learned that day or would be learned the next they were at the volvo in the black evening when he heard the piped shout water ran on the shirtsleeved shoulders of the headteacher and on the sheet of paper he held i was wrong we might just be able to help you try eric parsons hes retired but a bit of an icon at the adelaide he went two years before i arrived but dont ask me how he lasted sixteen years here taught maths but did the football team and drama he might just be your man ive his address and his number for you erics worth a try the paper was given to lovejoy in the volvo lovejoy used his mobile it rang until the answermachine responded a tinny voice eric and violet cannot take your call please leave a message after the tone he didnt he cut it jed slumped probably on vacation god just what i needed damn damn lovejoy said grimly my wife always tells me that shouting at a kettle never made it boil faster they drove out through heavy gates that were set in a high barricade of closeset steel posts with mesh slung between them and coils of barbed wire over the top it didnt add up to jed they went away down streets lit by dull lights where windows had plywood hammered over them where the sodden grass was knee high in front gardens where there were old industrial chimneys silhouetted against the night with no smoke and factories whose roofs had collapsed it didnt add up in the conventional thinking of the defense intelligence agency at the pentagon that this was where a fighter had come from who was clever enough to have fucked the system at camps xray and delta jed dietrich didnt know if he was capable of eccentric thinking but reckoned it was time to start trying what are you thinking lovejoy said eyes never off the road and face in shadow im thinking that our target fits a pattern and the pattern makes him a headache unobtainable on the landline and a voice message on the mobile bart swore he had never known wroughtons twin phones home and mobile to be unobtainable and switched off but he prepared himself to travel a bag of intravenous drips two multipacks of lint field dressings his suture kit the plastic box that held the debridement gear of scalpels scissors clips forceps and swabs the woundcleaning agents the antibiotics and the local anaesthetics went into a neat pile on the floor he checked each one off against his list last was the morphine the painkiller when they were all laid out he tried the numbers again no answer for fucks sake it was his freedom but the damn phones were unobtainable and on the answermachine he left no message it was the damned big one it was the chance to wipe all of the indifference off eddie bloody wroughtons face to shove the sneer down his throat it was the reason he had told the daft cow that he would drive through the night into the damn emptiness of the desert bart went to the lockup room off the utility room where his maid washed and ironed his clothes and kept her buckets for the big water bottles and the plastic petrol containers all expatriates had such a supply had done since the attacks in the city water and fuel would be needed if civil disturbance broke out and the airport was closed for an escape north to tabuk or sakakah or arar and then on to the jordanian frontier eight hundred kilometres from riyadh he ferried the medical bags packets and boxes to the mitsubishi outside then the water and the fuel inside again he studied the map the journey would take him down the main highway to al kharj and on to the metalled road route to harad then he was directed to use the dirt surface track south into the rub al khali it was the only way into the desert and he would be on it for a minimum of three hundred and fifty kilometres bloody hell madness but perhaps out of madness came freedom he tried a last time to call wroughton he yearned to tell his tormentor of a man wounded in the desert close to death by military action he picked up his cat kissed it put it into its quilted basket he closed his front door behind him he thought he should be there by dawn where shed said shed meet him they came up off the sand and crossed the raised track because rashid made the camels go fast and the sack litter jolted him caleb saw the distant lights between the animals legs half a dozen small lights as far away as he could see as far as the horizon was then they were gone he rolled on the sack litter the flies droned in his ears made their circuits came back to his head and his leg nothing to keep the flies off had no strength and could not swat them they were over the raised track and headed away from the lights caleb knew he was slipping the heat the flies and the dirt in the wounds doomed him he knew it he was back across the chasm where he had come from and where he had not known of a god to pray to the camels stank around him but he had a new smell in his nose meat that was decayed flesh that rotted where the flies laid the eggs himself thanks to the water and the fodder at the wellhead the camels stride was faster now and each jolt made caleb slip further it was charity for him when he drifted unconscious chapter sixteen still talking a murmur in the old language but weaker he no longer saw the guide he did not know that rashid sat apart from him that he was alone under an awning spread between two kneeling camels i was nothing before i met the chechen nobody a man looks at you strips you reads right through you you know hes judging you are you shit or are you useful to anybody else whod ever looked at me i was shit not looking at me like i was a piece of meat and hung up but like i was a person i went up that hill it was all live rounds they fired it was his test if i had failed it id have been on that plane home the next day and id be back in that shitheap and id be nobody he had not the strength to swipe away the flies at his leg wound or to push himself up and see the darker flesh ringing the wound the chechens a fighter he didnt tell me but i heard it he was one of those who lay in trenches and let the tanks come over the trench then came out was behind them where they were soft and broke the tracks with grenades or put grenades down the hatches he did that bloody tanks he was under tanks fifty tons of them and he wasnt scared he was my hero and he cared about me like he was my father on his back the flies buzzing about him he did not know that the guide had sent his son his only son out into the desert to bring help he was beyond that corner of his memory the chechen made me someone back in that crapheap you want to come down the canal you got enough for the chipper heh you met that bird out of princes road wholl do you a suck for a fiver get your arse moving cos theres a beemer in the station park and the radios a blaupunkt you want it there they never knew a man like the chechen he made me feel important no one else ever had wanted he did not know that in the heat and with his blood oozing away he was on the road to death among those kids none of themd ever met anyone like the chechen because they live in a crapheap i owe everything to him i make you a promise chechen you wont ever regret picking me but youre dead arent you out in all that fucking dirt youre buried can you hear me chechen can you im your man god it bloody hurts chechen still talking but fading in the slack dawn light the spread cloud of dust reached the settlement he approached bart thought the back end of nowhere the only stop for food or fuel on the only track running south into the desert on his map nowhere was given the name of bir faysal back up north at al kharj and again at harad where there was still a metalled road he had pulled into the side and had used his mobile in both towns high in the darkness of the night there were antennae on towers to relay his signal but there had still been no answer from either of wroughtons phones both switched off three times in seven hours of driving on the track after harad he had had to swerve on to the bedded stones at the verge to avoid collision with lorries bastards coming straight at him not giving way to him using the centre of the track and once he had gone right off the track and the stones nodding off to sleep and had manoeuvred his way back on to the track by crossing packed sand to keep himself awake he had found a station on the radio but it had static across it no phone signal no radio only his thoughts to keep him company excited thoughts thoughts of liberation freedom to go to the airport with his cat box in the knowledge that he had paid his debt and that the files were shredded thoughts of what he would tell eddie bloody wroughton the tyres of the mitsubishi threw up a dustcloud behind him scattered grey concrete buildings were in front of him he slowed he had not thought alone in his vehicle and struggling with tiredness of what he had by his own volition edged himself into now he did the thought clamoured in his mind as he drove carefully past the building over which a flag hung limply against its post in front of the police station one man in khaki drill lounged on a chair and watched him go by it would have taken some wriggling if the policeman had been alert had jumped up from his chair had waved him down would have taken a bloody good story after the police station he came to a fuel forecourt then a cluster of low buildings surrounded by thorn hedges the policeman might not have been but bart was alert he had his window down the airconditioner switched off and he heard clearly the bleat of goats behind the hedges the desert was ahead where was she he went past the last of the buildings a woman in scalptotoe black ducked away and a child waved enthusiastically and the flashed headlights caught the side of his mitsubishi it was madness the lights speared into his face from a gully beyond the last building it would not have been madness if he had been able to speak to the landline phone or to the mobile he had not spoken to eddie bloody wroughton perhaps he should never have started out from his compound he saw the land rover come up from the gully straining for traction she drove there was a boy beside her she came past him spewing sand then he saw the wave of her hand the instruction that he follow like a damned hired hand wasnt he he followed her for a mile until the settlement was lost behind them then she braked the land rover and pulled on to the stones he stopped behind her her door snapped open and she walked towards him what to tell her he remembered the brightness in her face at the party its lustre in his surgery and it was all gone she was drawn pale and she seemed to rock as though exhaustion was near to beating her the sand coated her was in her hair on her face and round her eyes it lay on her blouse and across her trousers he framed in his mind what he would say she leaned on his door thank you for coming thank you very much he had intended a response of cutting sarcasm then he saw the genuineness of the gratitude on her face and in her eyes reddened by tiredness strain and sand grit oh god that sort of genuineness came from one source one alone bloody hell that was love the world threw up enough problems in barts life without the intrusion of love a lucky man hed be the subject of her love he said matteroffact good morning miss jenkins it looks like youre about to spill a load of trouble on to my shoes probably i have it was another of the moments fleeting when he could have should have turned back did you bring your gear yes if its not presumptuous who is my mystery patient who has suffered injuries in military action i dont know honestly i dont know his name or where hes come from or where hes going to thats the truth he believed her it was the last time he could have turned back at the end of the day he would have been in riyadh and in his compound and he would not have forgiven himself he looked into her face it was all madness barts life was a story of being trapped and never turning right then wed better get moving she told him to follow her she said the bedouin boy with her would guide them she walked away lurched back to her land rover he kept close to her she led him another mile down the track then swung right and went west he went down off the track and the wheels ground on the chip stones then sagged on to sand he used the low gears for crosscountry he had never driven on sand before he sensed that the boy who had stared back at him from the land rover his face riddled with suspicion guided her many times they stopped and the sand in front of the land rover and barts mitsubishi seemed without features endless ochre hillocks that had no bushes no trees no cliffs nothing to bart that was recognizable or could be caught by memory they would halt for a few seconds then veer to the right or the left he found his steering was sluggish and unresponsive no one that bart knew back in riyadh went into the desert even with their vast fourbyfours the wildlife park a few kilometres beyond the city limits was enough a trip by tarmacadam road cutting into a desert on the way to jedda or ad dammam was sufficient for anyone he knew to believe they had experienced a survival ordeal other than the straining engines of the land rover and the mitsubishi there was silence around them he saw nothing that lived by the end of the second hour off the track and twentyeight miles covered he felt a crawling fear he could not turn back he had lost his sense of direction wouldnt have known whether he drove towards the safety of the track went parallel to it or away from i t worse than fear and he sweated his mind played games with him mocked him he remembered a school play his father and mother in the audience its setting was a first world war dugout he was the coward among the officers waiting for the big push the hero asked musing whether a worm knew when it tunnelled in the earth whether it was going up or down and speculated on the worms bad luck if it went down when it thought it was coming up his father had said that he should not have allowed himself to be cast as a coward he clung to the tyremarks left by the land rover and he saw that behind him from the mirror the brisk wind lifted the sand and covered the tyres ruts the fear made him shiver it looked at first through the haze thrown up by the land rover like a stunted needle at the start of the third hour bart realized their larget was a column of stone weathered and sculpted by the wind with a sharpened tip beth watched hes pretty far down the road behind beth the boy squatted beside his father whose hands loosely held a rifle across his lap i think im just in time but i cant promise anything by rights he should have died yesterday extraordinary resilience the doctor spoke as if a commentary were needed from him the needle was in a forearm vein and he was hooking the bag connected by a tube to the needle on to the crossrope that supported the awning then he crouched over the leg wound first things first do the dehydration get as much from an intravenous drip into him as quickly as possible saline you see theres a big blood loss its all about liquids in the body first to counter dehydration loss the body steals from the blood supply then from extracellular space and the last reserve is from intracellular space when thats exhausted its death by dehydration im surprised hes still with us she wanted to throw up the doctor took the other arm without the drip in it and firmly pinched the skin just above a bandage of dirty cloth on the wrist when his fingers let go the pinched flesh still stood erect it would have gone down where i pinched if there was enough liquid in the body it hasnt fallen back because theres no liquid there its an old trick beth thought the doctor talked because of his fear he reached for the cloth on the wrist and started to unravel it were hardly going to make a sterile area but at least we can try lets get shot of this filth for starters beth saw the plastic bracelet in the sand in the night she had found it had tried to examine it his strength had prevented her she saw the doctor peer down at it she leaned closer and made out the printed reference number the photograph was clear to her alongside it under the number and the filledin spaces for height and weight below sex was issued by delta she gagged the doctor turned to her did you know about this no i didnt no do you know what delta is i think so think miss jenkins cant you do better than think let me help you delta is the name of the camp at guantanamo bay the camp for terrorists good god what have i got into i didnt know the doctor seemed to gasp to drag in a great gulp of air for helping this man i and you miss jenkins could go to chop chop square may i assume your ignorance stops short of not knowing what chop chop square is she seemed to shudder could not help herself i know what chop chop square is the doctor went on as if he had cut the square and the ritual of public execution after friday prayers from his mind in a flat monotone you see his tongue and his mouth theyll be dried out its not a worry because the drip will fix that he will have had an extreme shock from the effect of the missile detonation and that will have surged his adrenaline further aggravating the dehydration process first appearances the head wound will have caused severe concussion but not much else the leg is the greater problem and the resulting blood loss there are ten pints of blood in the body and it is my estimate that are you going to save him my estimate is that hes lost at least two pints i make no promises there is blood loss and there are signs of advancing gangrene do you want him saved she looked down he lay on old sacks his eyes were closed and his breathing was a slow shallow struggle the head wound was a long slice below his forehead and above his right ear and the hair had been cut back from it by the guide as soon as they had arrived the doctor had barked questions to her for translation what had been done for him what if anything had he been given what had been the patients reaction the guide had used a knife to cut away hair from the head wound then had anointed it he had wiped the gum from murr on to the wounds edges beth translated this as myrrh and the doctor had muttered commiphora molmol and had not criticized the bedouins use of the ancient healing resin she saw the first drip bag draining steadily into his arm a cloth lay across his groin the leg wound was on the left side there were flies around it it was shorter in length than that on the skull but wider deeper and the flesh around it had already blackened he did not look to beth like a threat he seemed to her to rest in exhausted peace she crawled closer to him and took his hand both fists covering his fingers the doctor made room for her then stood and changed the drip hag i cant do anything about the leg until he has more strength its the leg that worries me maybe in an hour i can start on it what did she want of him everything how far would she go to help him to the end of the road to the square what did she know of him nothing she sat and held his hand the father and son stared at her eyes never off her a camel pushed its head against her arm competed with her to touch him the doctor now knelt at his bags and packages and checked an inventory she did not look into his leg wound but at his face never before had beth held a mans hand with such caring softness the drip worked she thought of a driedout flower that was watered and straightened she felt his fingers stir in her grip the breathing quickened the doctor broke off came closer lips moved the doctor crouched to listen the eyes opened she saw the eyes fastening on the doctors as he strained to listen the voice came weak but clear dont look into my face dont the fingers tightened in her fists dont see my face dont ever he seemed to sink back dont she reeled clung to his fingers but shook thats all i bloody need the doctor wheezed beside her hes english as english as you or me he spoke english like i do like you well done miss jenkins this just keeps getting better and better you can stand there as long as you like but until i see identification youre not coming in eric perkins had said hed been behind his door opened to the extent that the security chain would permit and his wife had been behind him you can stay on my step all the hours that god gives but youre not coming in till i see who you are the retired maths teacher was wizened small and his cheek was cut from shaving but he seemed to have the obstinacy that came with age and bloodymindedness and he had been behind his front door as if it was the portcullis of his castle the door had been closed on them and for ten minutes the rain had dripped on them it went against lovejoys grain to show his card hed rung the bell again hed shown the identification card that gained entry through the electronic barriers at thames house and the american had shown what was good enough for camp delta far away on cuba eh wasnt so difficult was it eric perkins had said then had turned violet love we have visitors from the security service in london and whats called the defense intelligence agency in america and theyre half drowned not that its my fault theyd like a cup of tea love and i think some cake might see them right the chain had come off the lock their coats had been hung in the ball and yesterdays newspaper was under them to protect the carpet they sat in the front room maybe lovejoy thought they should have taken off their shoes the room was pristine perkins held up the photograph in front of his face hed demanded to hold it handle it and dietrich bad shown illconcealed reluctance to pass it to him dietrich had covered the top of the head and the whole of the body with his hands but the retired teacher had insisted perkins chuckled the photograph was close to his eyes the prisoners camp reference number was stamped at the bottom he chuckled till he coughed the light of his eyes danced i used to do mathematics the basis of mathematics is solving problems im wondering if your problem gentlemen that needs solving is that you dont know who he is i dont think you need explanations sir dietrich said sourly we are merely investigating background to the wife violet was in the doorway holding the tray her husbands arm was up like an oldtime traffic policemans sorry love waste of your time and effort they wont be staying they dont trust me love lovejoy playing his winning smile and said just so we have no misunderstandings and i remind you mr perkins of the strictures of the official secrets act this man was a prisoner designated as an unlawful combatant in afghanistan at guantanamo bay he was released because the authorities there thought him a taxidriver from herat in that country while he was being transferred from the airbase to kabul he ran away we dont know who he is but believe him to be from this area if he is from here he would most likely have gone to adelaide comprehensive mr perkins we are looking for your help his face had lit as each morsel of trust was given him and hed laughed till his cheeks flushed i was wrong again violet theyre staying a late run for the post getting by on the rails tell violet whether youd like sugar gentlemen yes i know him tea was poured and cakes were passed not that he was any good at mathematics if i was judging him solely by the ability to multiply and divide add and subtract id have little to say i digress most of the boys going through my finalyear classes would have competency to add up profits from drugpushing or to subtract the days of a sentence remaining to be served in a young offenders institution thats about it adelaide comprehensive isnt a school known for its shining successes but over my time i did have a couple of them for this lad well i was able to provide something call it motivation yes there are little victories to be won even at adelaide comprehensive he broke off he called to the kitchen to thank his wife for the tea lovejoy saw the impatience building in the american the shaking hands rattled the cup and saucer and the cake on the plate on his knees had gone untouched he caught him with a glance bide your time man there was a boy who was being bullied an asian child there were two problems with the boy a stutter and a wealthy father cash in the childs hip pocket youll have learned a little of the area from which the school draws pupils the money and the speech impediment made this pupil a predictable target thats the real world i induced your man here to become the pupils friend he did and no doubt was paid for it and the bullying was a thing of the past the motivation was more complex he sided naturally with the minority he went against the majority not i fancy for any altruistic reason not for any defence of the handicapped in a cruel world but because it gave him pleasure to run against the tide are you with me are you beginning to see him just getting a glimpse lovejoy said drily second time around was more interesting our then esteemed headteacher before he fled to the quieter world of localeducationauthority inspections wanted a competition launched for public recitation pupils standing on a stage and declaiming to their peers such was the headteachers plan most of the males could barely communicate other than to demand their rights in a police station on a friday night the headteacher was very keen i was given the job of organizing it was it a fiasco it was not why not because this boy agreed to participate what did i choose for him id been to a funeral that week in west bromwich there had been a reading from the first epistle of paul to the corinthians chapter fifteen starting at verse fiftyfour do you know it gentlemen lovejoy did not but he saw beside him the americans lips move they kept time with the recitation he stood on the stage in front of the school and he silenced the chatter stilled the movement so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory he did it did it well you see by doing it he showed he could stand alone it was nothing to do with the spirituality of the words their uniqueness again he just needed to run against the tide would you like more tea or another cake lovejoy shook his head patiently and the american followed suit i liked him enough to make a small effort to find him work when he left us a garage harrisons auto repair unit on the industrial estate behind the high street i dont know whether he lasted there sometimes i see pupils i taught on the street and hanging about sometimes i read their names in the paper remanded in custody or remanded on bail i havent seen him since the day he left school what was different about him was a desperate unsatisfied restlessness and nothing here that could satisfy it and the response to my trivial efforts was a minimal answer to the symptoms i have to believe because you have come to see me that he is now considered a danger to society i suppose trained men will seek to kill him before he can kill others and id not argue with that where would he have learned the hate probably from your camp at guantanamo bay mr american no i wont argue with you nor will i cheer you on i rather liked the boy youll have to excuse me because violet has a dentists appointment he stood he looked a last time at the photograph oh yes what you came for his name i presume that with his name it will be easier to find and kill him the american said it will be easier to find him and stop him in his tracks before he can murder innocents of course of course hes from that estate near the school by the canal perhaps i sell him short perhaps hes more than ive painted him his jaw jutted and his fists clenched always interesting to hear how former pupils have progressed he is caleb hunt caleb did not know that a third bag dripped saline solution through the tube and the needle into his arm theyll hear my name wont they the bastardsll hear it hear it loud theyre walking dead got nothing all they got is radios out of beemers and sucks and smokes got nothing theyre not really living i live everyone will hear my name caleb did not know that beth stared bleakfaced at him guys where are you what you doing i did something else youll live fucking die no one will know youre nothing what you got you got fuckall caleb did not know as he rambled as the drip gave him strength that bart prepared a scalpel scissors clips forceps and sterile swabs and listened or that beth bit her lip its the biggest desert in the world its got worse heat than anywhere in the world im walking in it im barefoot in it you wouldnt have lasted in it a day not half a day im going through it because my familys waiting for me thats a proper family i belong to my family bart loaded a syringe with lignocaine the local anaesthetic when you hear my name all of you bastards itll be because ive done what my family wants of me anything caleb exposed his mind made his mind as bare as the wound on his leg camp delta guantanamo bay this is him this is alateh the taxidriver have we done him no the agency havent interrogated him the bureau have hut not for eight months the dia done him since eight months back these are their transcripts he stood with his head bowed in docility in front of him were two men he had not seen before he had learned well to give no sign that he understood what they said who did him last from the dia which of those creeps dietrich you know dietrich jed dietrich t know him what does he say harry he doesnt say anything hes on vacation and wont say anything not back till after the due date if this jerk goes the chain manacles bit at his wrist and the shackles at his ankles he stared at the floor made a target of his feet and did not watch them as they shuffled paper between them the interpreter stood beside them an arab and his respect for them told caleb of their importance its the quota thats what matters two old guys a middleaged guy and a young guy to make up a quota minimum of four if theyre clean too many of them are clean i hear you wallace try not to think about i t you going to the club tonight that concert marine brass band woiddnt miss ok lets go process this guy the interpreter translated the one called harry told him that the united states of america had no grievance against the innocent the united states of america valued the freedom of the individual the united states of america was committed only to rooting out the guilty the one called wallace told him that he was going home back to afghanistan to his family then had checked as if a paragraph in the file about the iviping out of the family by b bomber had been for a moment forgotten he was going back to the chance of making a new life with his taxi through the interpreter harry asked t hope young man back in afghanistan you wont come out with any lies about torture the meek answer no sir i am grateful sir through the interpreter wallace queried you have no complaints about your treatment here no sir i have been treated well sir through the interpreter both of them you take good care young man of the opportunity given you you help to build a new afghanistan good luck yes good luck the guards hands were on his arms and the waist chain was tugged back he heard harry say pathetic arent they these jerks hes lucky to be out i reckon the lids going to come off this place he was being led out through the door wallace said too right disciplines cracking more suicide tries and more defiance when the tribunals start up and when that execution chamber comes on line the lid could come off bigtime what time is the concert he was shuffled away the chains clanking on his ankles he had contempt of them had beaten them he would hear them scream wherever he was when he had returned to his family he would hear them scream in shrill terror i think im going to ask you to help me of course and its best if i educate you to my equipment yes she followed bart out from under the low awning stretched and stood tall what should i know he hissed not what you should know what about me knowing something when did you realize this man was a fully fledged terrorist and british may we begin there what do you want a confessional the truth would help what he is and what i knew does that determine what treatment you give him my decision miss jenkins not yours she told him haltingly what had brought her to this unmapped corner of the greatest desert in the world and what she owed this man he thought himself he owed nothing thats it are you going to walk away whatever he was bart was not an idiot if he walked away went back to the awning collected up his boxes and packages carted them to the mitsubishi and loaded them the rifle on the older bedouins lap would be up to the shoulder and would be aimed the eye behind the sight would be brilliant with hatred and hed hear the clatter of it arming he would die in the sand he pondered on all those who had wrecked his life had walked over him in about half an hour bart said ill start to work on the leg wound i trust you from the sky the heat cascaded on him and the sweat ran on his body and collected in the folds of his stomach thats good because you have to gonsalves rang the bell wroughton checked him in the spyhole then opened the door he held his hands across his privates gonsalves walked inside had half skirted the black binbag then stopped at it put down his briefcase and tipped the bloodstained clothes on to the floor your people when i called them they said you had a flu dose when i asked if a remedy for flu was taking a phone off the hook your people didnt know wroughton said it seemed easier to say flu than that id walked into a door he hadnt washed the bruises on his body thickest at his groin were a technicolour parade of black mauve and yellow the blood had dried around his nose and at the split in his lower lip he dropped his hands away from his privates away from where he was shrivelled up because modesty didnt seem to matter you could help me eddie you could tell me where to look on your face for an imprint of a door handle because i dont see it did the door handle have a wife im not expecting flowers or an apology my father used to tell me never explain and never apologize but i expect to be cut in wheres your maid when she came to the door i told her to get lost ill make some tea gonsalves went to the kitchen and wroughton slumped into his chair the voice boomed through the rattle of the mugs and the opening and closing of cupboard doors i think i heard you right cut in you hear me you are a junior partner in our endeavour we use you when we need you we ignore you when we dont did you get big ideas because teresa does pizza for you and youre uncle eddie to the kids shouldnt have done its a tough world out there youre a taker eddie but you dont have much to give its why i cut you out we were running a secure operation down in the rub al khali i think you told me you had big boys toys there in the rub al khali we had something special going and and i told you not much to give im sure about a caravan going out of oman and a direction route and we had predator uavs up with hellfires loaded and wed done a conjob on the saudis which is why it was secure and why you werent cut in and fuck you that what the door handle said we did two hits and we couldnt keep it secure and now the saudis have chucked us out we got a day and a half left in there then fatter cats than me have to decide whether to fly uavs out of yemen djibouti or dohar and take the risk of violating saudi air space were out in a day and a half gonsalves carried in the tray put it down poured tea gave a mug to wroughton when hed sipped his tea gonsalves reached into his briefcase want to see the tricks the big boys toys can do i dont beg not a damn poodle and dribbling why i love you eddie gonsalves had a file of photographs in his hand and spread them over the coffee table around wroughtons mug he couldnt help himself felt his excitement quicken three pictures colour eightbysix showed blackcircled craters in the ochre sand they were the raw only dreamedof currency of an intelligence officer centred on one was a dead keeledover camel not electronic intercepts not analysis of radio traffic pulled down by the dishes he snatched up the crucial picture peered at it and lingered over it dont get a hardon eddie do me a favour ok its before the first strike three men travelling two guides leading them three pack camels carrying crates and stingers is as good a guess as any now look at the closeups on the three is this not as sexy as it gets wroughton held the three photographs felt in awe of the technology that had magnified them to a point of recognition from four miles of altitude that one gonsalves finger stabbed at a photograph we identify him as gibran alwafa aged twentyseven involved in the riyadh compound bombs saudi citizen the finger moved on him he is muhammad sherif aged fiftynine was in afghanistan in the soviet war with bin laden in the sudan exile with him back in kabul but disappeared before enduring freedom now a strategist egyptian national and sentenced to death in his absence the finger loitered this one we dont have him the computers cant chuck anything up wroughton gazed at the photograph he saw the body of the young man upright on the camel the head high he strained to make out the features but the pixels confused him he thought he saw a strong chin but so what isnt he dead gonsalves said that the sensor operator had aimed twice for specific and individual targets as the camels had scattered the two targets in the two strikes had been the saudi and the egyptian so you may have missed him for all your damn technology and i get cut in because you dont know who he is right succinctly put eddie ill see you after gonsalves had gone eddie wroughton sat in his chair held the photograph in front of him and tried to read the face lizzyjo cursed georges message was pithy without embellishment the needs of maintenance ruled his life maintenance was obligatory not optional the predator first lady was now beyond all limits set for maintenance flying hours in optimum conditions had been exceeded but she had also been up in worststatus conditions she was grounded no argument confirmation of what hed said the afternoon before she needed a sanitized hangar for the necessary maintenance and the only sanitized hangar she would see was back at bagram he went out of the ground control went heavily down the steps as if unsettled by lizzyjos curse beside her marty flew carnival girl did the new boxes when theyd brought her back in the small hours while she and marty had stolen sleep the birds tanks had been filled so that fuel had spilled out carnival girl the old warhorse the fighter from bosnia and kosovo from afghanistan with a first skullandcrossbones stencilled on her fuselage had gone up twenty minutes after midday for her final run out of shaybah not her prettiest chase down the runway with the fuel load and the burden of the hellfires under the wings the boxes on the map were on the east side of a track they had tasked themselves and oscar golf had not argued it over the link to have her up for the full twentyfour hours of her endurance at four miles altitude and at loiter speed late on in the flight tomorrow they would do a small section of the map boxes on the west side of the track they had not yet reached the track but it would be good when they did would make a diversion from watching goddamn sand he was hunched over the joystick she had tried to jolt him but he spoke when he had to not otherwise she had wanted to bring the life back to him he flew carnival girl without error but as if he sleepwalked she lied lizzyjo said last time i was in new york i was in a bar been to see my mom and was going down to north carolina for the last spat but had time to kill the bar was behind fifth avenue i was alone this guy was alone what did i do wasnt much of a chatup line i was in afghanistan was i hurting those bastards real venom in his question i was trying he told me why he hoped i was she had gone straight from her moms apartment in a taxi out to the airport for the flight she had never been in a bar behind fifth avenue his partner worked up high in the north tower it was a day like any other nothing different about the eleventh of september himself he didnt go to work because of an opticians appointment he was in the waiting room was next in line to be called the tv was on where his partner worked was above the hit point of the american airlines plane it was all on the tv in front of him and he could see the window nearest to his partners desk i listened she talked without emotion didnt play to a gallery watched her screens twenty minutes later as he sees it on tv the united plane goes into the south tower what hes telling me hes not watching the south tower only the north tower and the window nearest his partners desk you know what he sees theres smoke and fire you want to know what he sees from the window nearest his partners desk they jump people start to jump they got the fire coming up under them and they got nowhere to go and some of them jump they are ninety floors up and they jump he sees people jump from that floor from those windows he sees tiny ant figures falling its all on the tv did his partner jump theres a lot of people jumped now sudden but late he starts to get active goes to the desk rings his partners phone its not picked up he wants to think his partner jumped that falling ninety floors arms and legs out was a quicker death than waiting for the fire to get up there or the collapse he said his partner was the only love of his life and he thinks he saw his partner jump from ninety floors up thats a horrible way to die thats bad people that make you die like that i bought him a drink and i told him we went hard as we could after the people that made his partner jump to hurt them then i headed out to catch my flight she saw from the side of her eye the tears stream from under martys spectacles and run on his cheeks she had no shame for the saccharine emotion of the lie daytime talkshow stuff she went brusque hows she doing shes doing well he choked carnival girls flying great shes the bomb caleb felt the strength back in him but the pain was agony and it rolled down in waves to his foot and came up through his hips and stomach lifting his right arm brought the pain in a torrent he gestured for rashid to come to him when the guide was close to him ear bent to mouth caleb whispered what he wanted brought to him he heard other voices indistinct a mans and a womans but could not make out what they said the camels chewed cud on either side of him and slung between them was the awning that made shade for him a blow hammered down on metal wood screamed as it was broken and hinges whined he was brought the manual the pages were grey dry and crackled in his hand and the large print on the cover had faded there was a needle attached to a tube that dangled over him in his left arm inserted immediately above the plastic bracelet which was no longer covered he tried to push himself up to look around but that was beyond his strength the voice was in the old language dont do that please dont now lets set down the ground rules i am a britishborn doctor sir i am here at the request of your friend miss jenkins i do not speak arabic nor do i need to when you were in sir a confused state natural following the traumatic experience of your wounds you talked english you were incoherent and rambling and i understood nothing of it got me but as far as i am concerned you are as british as i am i call you sir not as a mark of respect but because neither miss jenkins nor i knows your identity and we have no interest in it on the cover page of the manual was printed raytheon electronic systems fim stinger loivaltitude surfacetoair system family the man materialized above him a pudgy fatfilled face a shirt stuck with sweat to a vest trousers held up by a narrow belt he saw the man the woman was behind the man you should not have come caleb said faintly i said remember it if it is ever possible i will repay you it was possible i brought a doctor who is going who saw my face who is going to help you dont be so damn stupid hes a doctor not a bloody policeman why did you come caleb grated the boy was sent to find me why i had forgotten you you should have forgotten me he saw her head shake as if in personal crisis it doesnt matter why im here and hes here thatll have to be good enough the doctor said all very charming but hardly relevant i think we should get on with it or i wont be cleaning your leg sir ill be taking it off now do you want me here or do you want me to bugger off caleb felt the smile wreathe his face and he heard his own softspoken voice im very grateful to you dont look at my face i thank you for coming lose my face from your mind i appreciate what you do for me im going to talk you through it each stage of it your head wound is clean a direct shrapnel strike but below your headcloth not so the leg wound it is dirty infected with the early stages of gangrene in the wound is sand grit probably small stones maybe missile fragments certainly pieces from your robe will be buried deep in it it has to be cleaned and all of the detritus has to come out i intend to use cetrimide as a cleaning agent and i will inject a local anaesthetic lignocaine into the muscle around the wound its location is good too low for nerve damage and the wrong side of your leg for the principal arteries and the muscle has protected the bones from splintering later when ive worked on the wound i will inject you with antibiotics ampicillin is what i carry i see you have reading material i advise you to use it in spite of the lignocaine this is going to hurt like hell are you ready the question must have been in calebs eyes whats worrying me most not who or what you are sir is that bloody item up in the sky hunting and searching weve her vehicle and mine and no cover for them which is a good enough reason for getting on with it do i make a start caleb nodded he lifted the manual the words on the page dancing in his eyes and he felt the first needle plunge into his flesh chapter seventeen the face above caleb was impassive he saw it above the manual held tight in his hands he tried to read to read he thought was to escape from the pain and what was worse than the pain his dependence on the doctor he read of the launcher assembly with a missile the grip stock the iff interrogator and the argon gas battery coolant unit words played across his eyes which blurred target adaptive guidance circuit azimuth coverage it was their world their technology their skill their power he was a man who had fought from ditches and trenches from caves and scraped holes in the dirt from the cages of a cell block their technology their skill dwarfed him and their power could crush him the face hovered over him and the pain sought out each nerve in his body he could only fight nothing more was left to him fight or die fight or be forgotten his eyes watering fastened on the caption line engagement procedure the moisture in his eyes blinded him and he looked away from the page the last thing he had read before the mist closed on his vision was training requires hours of instruction before weapon qualification is given he did not have the hours did not have the instructor did not have the knowledge he looked up what is your name samuel bartholomew i would not claim to have friends but acquaintances call me bart wont be long the lignocaine works quickly have you looked long enough at my face to remember it he saw the doctor flinch i never remember a face whatever that bloody book is just read it behind the doctor squatting at the edge of the awnings shade the woman bit her lip he understood so little not why the doctor had come not why she had cared enough to bring him they were no part of him either of them can you wipe my eyes she did caleb read again first the system was shouldered then the battery coolant unit was slotted into the grip stock then the iff antenna was unfolded the target if visible was interrogated by the anppx system the iff switch is depressed and locks on the target depress the impulsegenerator switch and psi pressurized argon gas flows to the ir detector did it bloody matter did it matter to him how their technology worked what mattered was whether the bloody thing fired again he stared into the doctors face what am i to you he saw a slow smile settle at the doctors mouth a third time the needle was raised the manual was all he had if the aircraft came back hunted for them and found them and the boy heard it he must use the weapon and know the manuals procedures he started again to read the close print below the caption shoulder the system insert the battery coolant unit unfold the iff antenna depress the impulsegenerator switch listen for the audio signal telling of target acquisition he felt the growing deadness in his leg and the dulling of the pain chubby white fingers gripped the syringe held it poised he could see beyond the doctor beyond her and behind the guide that the boy sat alone his head cocked he thought the boy listened he was crosslegged with his back straight and his chin raised if the aircraft hunted for them and found them the boy was the first line of defence if caleb was to reach his family he needed the boy as much as he depended on the doctor caleb did not know if the weapon would fire if it had passed its shelf life his family waited for him in a singlestorey building of concrete blocks or in a cave they waited he seemed to see men rise up and their arms were outstretched and they held him and hugged him they gave him the welcome that was the heart of a family he tried to cry out as if to tell his family that he came but had no voice he walked away from the family that he cared for that he was a part of he wore a suit and a clean shirt with a tie and his shoes were polished and he came through a great concourse of people none of them saw him as they flowed around him and he carried a suitcase or a grip or had a travellers rucksack hitched on his shoulder and he yearned for the praise of his family and he prayed to hear the screamed terror of those his family hated he read the pages memorized them the needle came down the woman tried to hold his hand but it would not free itself from the manuals pages he felt the pain of the needle the total dose of local anaesthetic split between three injections was and bart had carefully measured it twenty millilitres of one per cent of lignocaine he could so easily have killed him as a rabid dog was shot so bart could have ended the life of the man whose face he had looked into whose name he did not know he could have said that the brute was a violent fanatic raging with a desire to murder he eased the needle into the left side flesh of the wound where the blackened gangrene had taken deepest hold a total dose of forty millilitres of two per cent lignocaine would have put down the rabid brute the dog would have gone into spasm then been on the irreversible process towards death instead bart had measured out what was necessary to spare the dog pain too many had walked over bart he was not their servant he thought the young man handsome there was a quality about him bart thought that the stubble on his face the tangle of hair above his eyes their brightness and the dirt encrusted round his mouth did not mask flitting into his mind was his own boy the boy who loved his mother loved ann the boy who had taken the owner of the saab franchise to be a proxy father the boy who had never looked into his face after the dawn visit of the police he could justify himself he used the cleaning agent cetrimide slopped it into the wound and began to dab with the lint this is going to hurt going to hurt worse as i go on ive used all the painkiller thats possible he sensed that the head nodded behind the manual he did not think that the man would cry out perhaps an intake of hissed breath maybe a gasp stifled he cut deeper into the wound pit poured more of the cetrimide into it swabbed then manoeuvred the forceps over the first pieces of grit and stone and took them out the womans hand was over the mans fist but his eyes never left the printed page bart went deeper he cut swabbed retrieved he knelt beside his patient and the sweat slaked off him he thought it extraordinary that the man did not cry out but had known he would not she held the hand tight bart could have told her she served no purpose that the man did not need her as comforter he found the pieces of cotton embedded and lifted each of them out had to cut again to find their root any other man that bart had known would have fainted himself probably his heart would have stopped debridement was from the battlefield surgery of the napoleonic wars with patients either insensible from shock or dosed with brandy or biting on a peg of wood or leather no gasp no hiss for breath he searched for more cotton fibre stone grit a fragment of i he missile and heard the rustle of a page turned no man that bart had ever met could have endured it without protest bart had reckoned he might have to kneel on his patients ankles and have the woman hold down one arm and the older bedouin the other arm grip him so that he could not struggle as the scalpel went in and the lorceps probed not necessary youre doing well he murmured were getting there he was sodden with sweat he went to work on the gangrene it was neither pretty nor delicate work not at medical school certainly not in the practice at torquay not even in the villages around jenin had he performed such primitive surgery before he was guided by old memories of books read long ago and his instincts bart sliced at the flesh cut slivers from it then flicked the scalpel blade to the side ditched it behind him the woman flushed a section of flesh poorly discarded had fallen on to her ankle her eyes were screwed up at the sight of it she would have felt its diseased wetness on her skin he cut again still there was no cry and no hiss of breath closest to the wound the flesh was black away from the wound it was darkened layer upon layer of it he sliced away he reached out took the piece from her ankle and threw it further the flesh scattered behind him brought flies in a feeding frenzy he cut to pink rosy flesh and to clean skin he was weak when he finished well done the whispered response through clenched teeth i didnt do anything well done for not thrashing around would have made it slower more pain for me and more difficult for you bart did what was forbidden looked into the face it was ravaged the eyes stared out great lines furrowed the forehead and the muscles bulged on the neck he thought that whatever this man terrorist rabid dog or freedomfighter set out to achieve he would succeed in it i cant give you any more lignocaine because that would kill you im going to close it up not totally superficial sutures to hold the skins edges but it has to be open so that any further pus can get clear later well do an antibiotic injection and if the pain is unmanageable by this evening ill try a morphine jab why am i still alive bart grimaced why indeed al mazan village near jenin occupied west bank the helicopter belched the rocket it had made one pass a slow circle above the village then steadied and fired the flame creased behind the rocket was vivid against the cloud he had been locking his vehicle when he heard and saw it he had watched its circle and known what would folloiv the flame speared towards the village roofs bart could not see its target but knew it the rocket then another then a third dived exploded devastated and threw up a mushroom cloud of dirt dust and rubble he ran it was expected of him that he should run his cover demanded of him that he run he ran across the square and into a wide street went towards the medical centre in the yard of the villages school he knew what he would find in the alley opposite the collapsed telephone pole he did not look up did not see the helicopter turn away he would find a hole that smoked and burned and around it would be collapsed rubble the hole would be like the black gap when a tooth fell out the rockets from the helicopter were always fired with precision the crowd spilled from the alley a wasp storm a fist where the crowd was densest held up a mobile telephone the scream of the crowd reached him he saw her tens of arms held her and snatched at her she was supine and did not struggle he thought of her as thirtyish no more than forty the hands had dislodged the scarf from her head he did not know whether she was an agent of lesser importance than himself or whether she was merely an innocent who had used her mobile telephone while the helicopter had made its first circling pass an agent or an innocent she was doomed hysteria would kill her he did not know whether she was a wife a mother she went with the crowd and bart was pushed aside half crushed into a doorway she was taken towards the square bart saw her eyes she was condemned but her eyes had peace he thanked his god for it he thought the shock of her capture had destroyed the fear the moment that their eyes met was a split second then she was gone at the core of the baying crowd he went on at the collapsed telephone pole bart turned into the alley the missing tooth had been a home was now a crater and the two floors of the homes on either side of it were exposed sleeping rooms were opened up beds hung angled over the crater and more rubble had fallen in the alley dust had coated the limegreen fiat men dug and crawled in the crater he heard the low keening moan and knew there was no work for a doctor here first two children were carried out a womans corpse followed them with reverence a mans body was lifted clear he saw the frozen face of the man who had sat in the rear seat of the fiat it had been on the second page at the top rank of the most sensitive fugitives now the face was like a circus clowns coated with the white dust of the plaster of the interior walls the dust made a mask for the face and death had distorted none of the features no wound disturbed it strength was written on it and he fancied there was honesty bart turned away and pressed his hand against his throat to suppress vomit he did not dare to walk back through the square he had not the courage to go past the scaffolding erected in front of the squares principal building an hour later bart sagged from the chair he went down on to the hut floor and the coffee hed held spilled on to the boards he wept only joseph saw him on his knees and on his elbows his body quivering from the tears he heard the beat of josephs words you did well for us you are a jewel a man who was a murderer was liquidated because of your bravery you are responsible for the saving of many lives listen bart we regret the deaths of two children and a woman in the house we regret also that a lynch mob has killed a woman they believe guilty of treachery to their society two children and two women are set on the scales against the lives of many you are a hero to us i tell you bart beside jerusalems mount herzl is the yad vashem memorial where we remember our own and their suffering and also remembered there are the honoured foreigners who have helped our survival and your name i dont want that fucking crap bart sobbed am gone im finished t thank you for what you have done back at his home he packed one suitcase for his clothes a medical bag a cardboard box for the cat and a plastic bag of tinned food for it he wrote the note and pinned it to the door mother seriously ill in england returning there god watch over you your friend samuel bartholomew he had arrived on an untruth had lived on an untruth and left on an untruth he was gone before dusk fell on the village driving with wet eyes and two patrol vehicles discreetly escorted him down tracks and along roads and he was only clear of them when he had gone through the checkpoint all the way to tel aviv blazoned in his mind was the image of the dustcoated face at peace of the fighter he had killed the book dropped from his hands beth saw the pain break over him she looked around if he had cried out it would have helped her yet he did not he lay on his back and gasped at a distance beside the knelt camels the guide watched and close to him was the brokenopen crate from which the manual had been retrieved the face was in shadow and she could not see the eyes or the mouth and did not know what he thought if a spotlight had been shone on his face she doubted she would know what he thought further back erect and statue still was the boy did it matter what anyone thought beth as teenager and adult had never cared for advice counsel guidance she knew her mind it did not tax her if a road or a street flowed past her and mouthed disapproval if the crowds of a town a city condemned her judgement she was her own person and the innate stubbornness of character brooked no criticism she was beside a killer whose eyes had closed she slipped away from him out from under the awning and went towards the drone of the snoring at his vehicle where the doctor lay on the seat depressed to its full extent she snapped open the door his mouth was open gaped wide and the snoring brought spittle to his mouth the shirt clung to his body and on his lap was a chocolatebar wrapping not shared with the rest of them she punched his arm he snorted convulsed and then was awake god what did you do that for hes in pain beth said the arm smeared the sweat off his face of course hes in pain a bloody great hole like that the flesh i took out of it and its depth what do you expect if not pain you talked about morphine talked about morphine this evening my experience miss jenkins pain seldom kills morphine does often he doesnt cry out she said a trill of bewilderment and further experience tells me miss jenkins that the reaction to pain explains more about the patient than about the injury i dont understand what youre saying she was unsure her voice was small her guard was down he attacked thats rich like my favourite christmas present i am introduced by you to a war casualty who talks in delirium and confusion about mass murder by you i am nagged to save this creatures life and you dont know who he is dont know what mayhem he plans to inflict dont know anything except youve an itch you want to scratch what do you think hes going to do when icve got him up on his feet and hobbling forward is he going to give you a loving kiss get you to wrap your thighs round his neck or walk away from you like you never existed she trembled how much morphine would you give him he clutched her hand and she felt the slithering wet of his palm none if i can get away with it if i decide that he must sleep cannot because of the pain then i will inject between ten and twenty milligrams not more if the pains bad its an equation miss jenkins its about getting the sums right too little and the pain continues too much and respiration is fatally slowed and the myocardium thats the heart muscle is depressed ceases to operate and death follows yes it is not my intention to overdose him on morphine no if its not a problem to you i would like to resume my rest his eyes had closed and his head was averted his chin sagged and his mouth opened she left him she went past the boy who did not look at her stayed intent on his concentration she looked up and saw only the clearness of the sky blue and she raked it till her eyes burned on the sun the boys father ducked out from under the awning but did not meet her gaze she realized it she was alone she skirted the camels and bent to go under the awning he was propped up and had the pieces on his lap and the manual when he saw her he waved her away like she was flotsam he had the manual and the pieces across his lap was the launch tube with a missile inserted and the battery coolant unit he looked for the slot into which it would be inserted beside him on the sacking was the beltpack that housed the iff interrogator unit and next he would find the plug in the grip stock where its cable went he beat the pain the wound oozed but did not bleed he had seen the disappointment cloud her face he had no interest in her he did not see where she went where she sat he had no need of her when caleb had found the slot and the plug socket he rehearsed the firing procedure his eyes flitted between the grip stock and the manual his finger rested on the impulsegenerator switch then the button controlling the seeker uncage bar then it rested gently on the trigger he read of the lessthantwosecond response time between the trigger pull and the missiles launch he imagined the fire flash and the lurched first stage of the missiles ejection from the tube then the blast of the second stage then the climbing hunt for the target again and again his pain controlled and his finger steady caleb rehearsed the preparations for firing without the missile he would not reach his family but he did not know whether its time wrapped in an oiled covering had decayed it getting to his family was his goal his reason for survival the courier had been and had gone the sentry low down in the rocks in front of the caves entrance scanned the deserts expanse the courier had reached the cave after the first prayers at dawn and had left before the prayers at midday he had brought with him a sealed leadencased container the size of a water bucket and had taken away with him finely rolled cigarette papers on which coded messages were written in minute script the heat shimmered the sands in front of the sentry but he squinted looked ahead and watched for them for midday prayers men had emerged blinking from the cave and one had held up the compass so that the direction of makkah would be exact and not an estimation they had prayed then returned to the dark recesses the sentry had watched the courier in had watched him out and away over the emptiness of the sands and had not prayed he had stayed hidden among the rocks with the rifle always in his hand and with the machinegun loaded with belt ammunition close against his knee during prayers an eagle had wheeled high over the escarpment where the cave was the sentrys eyes ached as he looked for a sign of their coming if they came in daylight he would have long warning of them he would see a speck of movement then the shape of a small caravan would materialize if they came in darkness he would see them from three or four kilometres away on the night vision glasses russian military that hung from his neck they were late they were late by four days but four days mattered little to the sentry and to the men inside the cave whom he guarded the war was without end he did not doubt that they would come but he hoped fervently that they would come during his long watch not after he was relieved his eyes scraped over the sands and little images danced in his mind small hallucinations but he did not see the caravan their importance was to be measured by the ordeal they endured crossing the empty quarter for secrecy and the preservation of their security he wanted to be the first to greet and welcome them he watched for them as he had watched for each of the four days since they had been due he searched the sands that were without limit for the caravan but he saw only the desert and the dunes heard only the silence they would come he was sure of it their importance in the war without end was too great for them to fail the journey and the one of greatest importance he had heard it whispered while he rested in the caves depths was the one who would carry the suitcase when it was loaded with the content of the container the courier had brought that morning that was a man to be greeted and welcomed billy boy said he was all right when the boss brought him in he was ok then but he changed then he was shit when he changed he hadnt the time of day for us dont expect me to care not if caleb hunts got trouble on his doorstep half a pace behind lovejoy jed stood and absorbed lovejoys way as lectured in the volvo was to begin at the bottom and work up it was the explanation as to why they were not knocking at a front door and interviewing a family but instead were in the workshop of a grimy carrepair business he had seen a derelict gasworks to the right side of the complex built in a passedover factory and a oncefine church on the left side with graffiti sprayed over the plywood covering the windows jed thought the place reeked of failure but flesh now stretched on the skeleton that was caleb hunt and on the taxidriver fawzi alateh who had sat across a table from him at delta in his interrogation room and who had screwed him vinnie said we helped him when he started when he didnt know a carburettor from a clutch we covered for him and treated him like he was one of us he was learning he was good then it all went sour one day he was fine then it was like we werent good enough for him they came forward in turn called out from under a bodywork chassis and from the examination pit and they talked with what he believed to be utter honesty and confusion and almost a trace of sadness it was as if they had been rejected and still wore the marks of it each his name called came and shuffled awkwardly and spoke of the man who had duped camp deltas finest and him it made hard listening for jed wayne said he told us at the end the day he left that the work bored him and that the boss bored him and that we bored him you know id shared sandwiches with him and my towel shared bloody everything with him but we were crap we were beneath him he let us know not laughing at us but arrogantlike we were secondrate and he wasnt they moved into the inner office files and worksheets were dumped off chairs for them he remembered the docile humble young man light skinned but so were many afghans who had been a taxidriver and he thought it remarkable that the lie had been sustained against all the pressure that camp delta had thrown at him jed had never before been on a field investigation his life had been spent behind a desk a suspect in front of him or a computer screen he admired the quietly spoken expertise of lovejoy who started men talking and never interrupted them a kettle whistled instant coffee was doled into mugs the water was poured and milk added from a bottle jed knew flesh on the skeleton would now become features the boss said i gave him the chance because perkins asked it of me perkins taught me and my wife and taught our girl perkins got him the chance its not the top of the tree but its a start if a lad wants to work and to learn then ill give him a damn good apprenticeship wont pay him much but a starts a start and a trained engine mechanic is in work for life for two and a half years he was good as gold and it had got to the stage where id give him my best customers my regulars for services and mots and hed do all gods hours dont quote me but i was going to put him in charge of that lot he had what it takes the leadership thing he could take responsibility seemed to enjoy it good with customers they liked him because he told them it straight you know your motors a wreck sir and us fixing it is just chucking good money after bad or no we can do that sir do it over the weekend ill come in saturday and sunday and do it people had started to ask for him whether it was an engine strip or knocking out a frontwing dent from a shunt people used to say id like caleb to do it then it all went pearshaped there was two lads started to hang around for him first theyd be outside then they used to drift in and sit around talk to him while he was working i should have told them to piss off but i didnt suppose i thought caleb would walk out on me shouldnt have bothered he did they were pakistani boys dont go getting me wrong im not a racial nut plenty round here that are but im not one of them they had a hold on him at the end theyd show up and hed just down tools whatever he was doing and hed be gone no more weekends and no more sundays either and half the fridays he was gone there was this tuesday and they came in for him i was going to fire him that evening anyway would have done it a month earlier if it hadnt been for old perkins they came in late morning and he went off and wiped his hands and we were busy as sin and he told me like my problems didnt matter to him that hed be gone for a couple of weeks i told him he could be gone for a couple of months or a couple of years because there wouldnt be a job here when he came back both the pakistanis were laughing at me but not caleb i turned my back on him and i went in the office he followed me nobody else saw it hed this spanner in his hand and his fingers were all white round it gods my witness i thought he was going to belt me i reckoned hed lost it then he put the spanner down you know what it was id said he was sacked he was not in control and he couldnt take it what i saw in his eyes when he had that spanner hed have killed me and just walked like nothing had happened i dont know why youre interested in caleb hunt and dont suppose youd tell me if i asked no of course oh the lads who used to come round for him ones called farooq and his dads got a restaurant down on their estate amin is the name of the other one dont know what he does you see theres very few white boys are close to asians but they all come from the same street sorry gents but ive got a business to run they went outside where the sky seemed to merge with the grime of the old brickwork it was the capital of the countrys old engineering industry lovejoy said what have we got jed asked and its all gone the engineering industry you know just down the road from here they made the titanic s anchor chains what have we got id say weve got enough to lose sleep over much sleep persuasive leadership and pride violence and vanity commitment and courage doesnt that stack up to a sleepless night come on im hungry they walked briskly towards the car but jed wasnt done i can see him clear as yesterday in my room but hes not there is he hes lost and he needs killing hes not in your room do you eat curry marty flew the map boxes the chart on the worksurface lay between his joystick and her console keyboard each time theyd covered a box shed reach across with her chinagraph pen and make a black cross on it there were guys at bagram who did mine clearance and they used map boxes not of a mile square but of ten yards square and they crossed out the sections of the map they believed theyd cleared the guys said that the sections wouldnt be a place to take a picnic because they could never be certain theyd not missed one it was like that with the boxes on the chart they could have missed a target and flown on below the new line of black crosses were the red exclamation marks shed made four in two boxes one mark for each firing of a hellfire he thought that when he brought carnival girl back for the last time the late morning of tomorrow hed route her over the exclaimers and give himself a last look at the craters freshen his memory of them before he climbed up into the big transport aircraft the wind made for good flying conditions the one problem was the thermals coming up off the sand which made carnival girl sluggish to commands what hed learned and what hed tell them at the bagram debrief the heat from the ground killed the infrared but the realtime camera showed acceptable pictures for her to look at they were alone for once they did not have langley with them two hours before oscar golf had signed off telling them he was going for a shower and food could they manage on their own hed seen lizzyjo smile and heard the clear rasp of her voice yes they could manage on their own maybe martys hand slipped sweat on the joystick maybe his fingers were numbed from holding the stick carnival girls picture jolted and she swore and the picture dived you ok im fine what i mean is are you really ok im really fine no kidding im good and fine and im grateful cant say more she stretched touched his hand on the joystick and her nails indented on the veins at the back of his hand which shook a moment and carnival girl plunged another two hundred feet she was giggling like a girl and marty felt the smile fill his face he was grateful because he had blipped grateful because she had kicked the blip hard he owed her his thanks it was between them he had certainty that the collapse of his morale after he had flown in pursuit of the old man was a story she would never tell and he would never tell that she had come to his tent and had bedded him on his cot he would go back to bagram and the coffins off the transporter would be unpacked and technicians and ground crew would stand around and admire the skullandcrossbones symbols adorning first lady and carnival girl and his own crew and his own technicians would recite stories of the killing wasting of al qaeda men in the desert of the rub al khali he might even let them know at bagram it had not been easy flying languidly that was how she flew carnival girl climbed in response to the joysticks command without enthusiasm alongside him like she recognized he had come through the depression she had the blouse unbuttoned and she hung loose but he didnt look at her a lot more at the screen above the stick if he had found something in the sands she would have alerted him and zoomed on it and he would have done a figure eight over it but she didnt and there was only the pure windblown shapes of the dunes on the screen and the emptiness utter emptiness a couple of hours back when oscar golf had gone for his shower and food shed asked him if hed need a pill to keep him going till he brought carnival girl back the next midday he hadnt wanted a pill he could last he thought they might because she was old and ancient put carnival girl in a museum useful life gone stripped of what was valuable but put on show schoolkids might come round her with teachers and hold maps of kosovo afghanistan and saudi arabia the kids would gather at the forward fuselage where the skullandcrossbones was stencilled on it and the teacher would talk about the men and women who defended the united states of america and about the hunting down of the countrys enemies he dreamed so are we flying or not on the screen he saw the dive and arrested it then grimaced sorry stop playing deadhead im telling you were flying until the last hour the last minute of fuel were keeping her up all night and through tomorrow morning were going till the tanks are dry its the way it is always theres one more map box its murphys law always the next box where the action is were with this until the end got you he thought of the man she had drunk with in the bar behind fifth avenue and of the phone ringing out unanswered on the high floor of the north tower and of the bodies of the jumpers that seemed to float but came on down then he wiped his mind clear and flew carnival girl on towards the next map box when the day died they would reach the boxes alongside the track marked on the chart do the east side of it in the night and by dawn they would be over the track then time for the west side of it and one last line of boxes over desert before he turned her for home far from him but under his command the predators lens ate the sands he ad waited an hour in the car park but the bastard hadnt shown it was the first time that the weasel bartholomew had stood him up for an hour he had sat in his car in the far corner of the car park and the wait had been fruitless he had driven to the surgery had stamped through an empty wailing room and confronted the receptionist where was he there had been a message on the answerphone the previous morning telling her to cancel all existing appointments for three days but she had not known where he was and staring at the scars on his face she had told him that he could either go in the book for three days time when there was a window or she could give him the name of another doctor if his complaints were urgent he had stormed out never before had bartholomew left town without warning his finger on the doorbell eddie wroughton stood on the step at the villas front door beside the empty carport the maid came he pushed past her a cat obviously a stray stood its ground in the hallway arched its back and hissed defiance he kicked at it missed where was he the maid scowled hostile as the cat then shrugged she did not know he was trained to check over a room a villa the maid followed him but did not watch what he did only stared at his face something wrong with me is there wroughton snarled she broke away fled for the kitchen in his mind was an inventory not of what he found but of what was not there bartholomews medical bag gone he forced open the drugs cabinet in the bedroom the lower shelf was half emptied he broke into the cupboard beside the cabinet no operating kit there and the packets of lint and bandages had been rifled through as if some had been taken hurriedly from the kitchen stepping over the treacherously wet floor that the maid had mopped he went into the utility room he remembered from the one time he had been to the villa that bartholomew kept water and fuel there no water canister and no fuel can back in the living room alongside the chair where the cat had taken refuge wroughton lifted the phone and dialled the call back the answer came in arabic digits for the last number that had called he was about to write it on the pad beside the phone when he checked himself and scrawled it on the back of his hand around an abrasion that was now scabbed he tore off the top sheet and slipped it carefully into the breast pocket of his last linen suit he rang his office in the embassy gave his instructions to his assistant told her the telephone number where had that call originated from wroughton looked around him saw the bareness of bartholomews life nothing there that was personal rented furniture hired fittings as if his soul had been eradicated how could it have been different it came to him like a jolting blow as violent as any of the agronomists kicks and punches he himself had pulled his telephone plug from the wall socket he had switched off his mobile while he had sat naked in his own room among his own rented furniture and hired fittings on his way out of the living room going past the settee beside the door he lifted a cushion and threw it at the chair where the cat was but when it landed the cat had gone wroughton slammed the front door shut after him he asked in the new language of his life how long the dark had settled under the awning he could barely see the doctors face the voice from the shadowed mouth was crisp lets not fuck about you speak the queens english as well as i do i havent the faintest idea what youre asking me in your condition and if you want my further help i would suggest you end the charade youre english if you want answers you will speak in english so lets start again caleb shook he thought the doctor knelt on the manual and that his thigh pressed the launcher against calebs good leg as he remembered he had last spoken english in the taxi on his way to the wedding through the dusty streets of landi khotal bumping in the back of the taxi squashed between his friends and nervous he had spoken english but not since as if he walked a new road he spoke with soft hesitation how long before i can move thats better wasnt so difficult eh you spoke english when you were in extreme pain how long depends what you want to achieve if you want to get off these stinking unhygienic sacks and go have a piss because youve drained out four saline drip bags you could probably manage that now im sure miss jenkins will support your arm while you do it how long before i can move away if youre going in miss jenkinss vehicle i suppose you could move straight after youve had your piss by camel still the adventurer i believe i could have you hobbling around in the morning if it was imperative and youve slept you could mount up and head for where the sunset will be yes in the morning is the pain bad i accept the pain i can give you morphine for it no when i spoke what did i say if youre intent on riding a camel tomorrow i suggest i inject you now intravenously with ampicillin an antibiotic then another dose at midnight another at dawn and one more when you head off in addition i will give you what syringes i have because you should take four a day for three days what did i say after that because your arm will be a pincushion you can take it orally again its five hundred milligrams a dose four times a day you saw my face difficult not to have young man when im bent over you and scraping that crap out of your leg difficult not to have seen your face and difficult not to have heard what you said right lets get it into you his arm was lifted and the fingers held his wrist just below the plastic bracelet he felt the cool damp of the swab then saw the movement felt the prick of the needle the needle was withdrawn he heard the grunting as the man pushed himself heavily up you have to sleep ill jab you again at midnight but you must sleep through it sweet dreams my nameless friend caleb heard his shoes scuff away in the sand he would not sleep and would not dream he did not know what he had said knew only that the doctor had seen his face he tossed and the pain in his leg surged he remembered the men who had seen his face and all were gone to see his face was to die and he remembered the old man who had ridden the donkey who had brought him to the opium smugglers who was blind and had not seen his face and he thought the lifeless eyes might have saved the old man to have seen his face was to be condemned the doctor had caleb shuddered and the pain racked him so had the woman chapter eighteen it was the start of the last day caleb was jolted from his sleep a hand lifted his arm it had been a fitful sleep without calm the swab wetted the skin from instinct because he was touched he flinched and tried to break the grip easy young man easy dont fight me the doctors voice was soft in his ear then the needle went in he gazed up and saw the outline of the mans face and above it the dark ceiling of the awning had you slept long caleb nodded thats good funny but sleep is a better healer than any drug its good that you slept and you must sleep again the needle was withdrawn his arm was lowered gently he remembered what he had thought before the sleep had caught him why do you help me the shape towered above him the question young man is becoming repetitive you care not to tell me your name and i care not to burden you with reasoning for my actions you get your next injection at dawn go back to sleep caleb started up tried to push himself higher on his elbows to raise his back thats not good enough it isnt good enough that i dont know your name dont know where you come from dont know where youre going and what your intentions are when you get there dont tell me young man whats good enough and whats not he was gone caleb sagged the body of the launcher was against his leg when he had slept he had forgotten it and the pain in his leg and he had forgotten that to see his face was to be condemned the kindness of the doctor and the devotion of the woman who had brought help to him did not compete with the demand of and his obligation to the family it would be weakness if he did not destroy them he lay on his back under the awning and felt the throb in his leg and the hammer of the pulse from the antibiotic injection the doctor and the woman were trifles when set against the importance of the family they had seen his face they were condemned they stood between him and his duty he let his hand fall beside him and beyond the edge of the sacking bed his fingers lifted a pinch of sand grains and he held his hand above his chest and the sand ran from it fell on him not one grain of sand but a thousand a great crowd not one person but a thousand passed him and among them were the doctor who was kind and the woman who was devoted he could not cherrypick among the crowd he walked through with a suitcase or a grip bag or a rucksack could not say that some were his enemy and some were not could not extricate the doctor and the woman from the crowd to do so would be a betrayal of the family would show weakness in the morning when the doctor had given him the strength to stand and when the woman had supported his first hobbling steps as hesitant as when the chain shackles had been on his ankles at camp delta he would go to the guide take the rifle from him arm it and do what was necessary to prove to the dead to hosni fahd and tommy that he was not weak he drifted back towards sleep he was at peace because the strength had not deserted him he felt no shame because he would not have recognized the man he had been before he was his familys man tell me about him it was not a request from lovejoy but an instruction they were at the table alongside the one at which lovejoy and the american had eaten farooqs father had taken their order and parooq had served them they had eaten slowly then lingered over i heir coffee as around them the restaurant had cleared and father son and other waiters had wiped down the tables and tilted the chairs the shadows had closed on them and only their tablecloth cups and empty glasses were lit lovejoy could play polite and could play domination when the last customers had paid up and gone out into the wet night when only they were there lovejoy had raised his hand and snapped his fingers imperiously for attention the father had hurried to them lovejoy had said we can do this here or we can do it down the road at the police station under antiterrorist legislation we can do it comfortably here or we can do it after they have spent a night in the cells i want to talk to your son and to your sons friend amin if you try to bluster me with lawyers sitting in it will be straight down to the police station you do it the straightforward way or you do it the difficult way and my colleague and i would like more coffee thank you the friend had been sent for looked as though he had been roused from his bed the young men farooq and amin had shivered as they sat at the table beside them and farooqs father had hovered at the edge of the light before lovejoy had waved him away he played domination he was brusque to the point of rudeness because that was the lactic he had decided on he could hear very faintly the slight squealing howl of the turning tape that was on the americans knee hidden by the tablecloth his companions arm was stretched out lying apparently casually on the cloth but close to where the young men sat the microphone would be inside his cuff lovejoy said i want only the truth if you lie youll be going straight to the cells if you are honest with me you will sleep in your own beds after ive finished with you i start with you amin tell me about caleb hunt tell me about him before you went to pakistan everything about him the response was hesitant and frightened he learned about the jubilee estate of houses built to commemorate the first fifty years of queen victorias reign and how asian families lived in all the homes of ten streets but there was one street of terraced houses where four white families lived he heard about a white schoolkid who had first walked to school with asian schoolkids and moved on with them to the adelaide comprehensive caleb was our friend we didnt have other white friends just him but then he didnt have white friends we were his friends he stood by farooq when he was bullied didnt make any difference skin colour most of the kids at the adelaide didnt have asian friends we kept to ourselves but caleb was with us lovejoy felt that he peeled away layers of skin we had scrapes nothing much amin said we had trouble graffiti and sometimes a car radio and thered be fights but he was with us not the skinhead bastards we did everything together yes we messed about we had fun but not bad trouble we didnt go into his house he wasnt happy with that or his ma wasnt but he came to our house we left school and it was different then lovejoy probed how was it different i went to college to get the a levels for a law course farooq came here to work for his dad and caleb went to the garage it started about a year later after id got the a levels and i was waiting to go on and do the law bit we started up again but we were older more aware i mean you go to the mosque and sometimes there are guest imams and they tell you about afghanistan and about chechnya about all the places where islam is and where its fighting against oppression and he used to take fridays off he wasnt a muslim no if we went to a mosque in birmingham where he wasnt known then all he had to do was follow us do what we did and listen you see wed changed i suppose when we were kids farooq and me wed rebelled against the faith we smoked and drank alcohol thieved a bit but we finished that he came on board with us did what we did we were the only friends he had and it was like we were his family not his ma we did the evenings together and if there was a big imam speaking in birmingham wed collect him from work and wed drive down in farooqs car we heard about the war in afghanistan and saw videos of it and there were more videos of chechnya and what the russians were doing to muslims please you have to believe me farooq and me just listened and tried to be better muslims and have more faith but hed come out of the mosque caleb would and hed be all tensed up he was most tensed when hed seen a video of fighting as each layer of skin came away lovejoy thought he came nearer to the hidden reddened mass that held the poison he used to say he was so bored used to say that was real excitement doing fighting yes wed talk about it but didnt take it serious he hated it here thats what he told us he was coming from nowhere and going to nowhere it all happened quick wed heard this imam speak about afghanistan and the need for fighters there and a couple of guys had gone up gone forward at the end of the talk they werent boys we knew and afterwards caleb said they were the lucky ones because they were going to get real excitement i didnt think anything of it what hed said a couple of days later my father had the invitation to this wedding i suppose we talked about it we must have told him that farooq and me were going and he was all crestfallen like he was shut out of something he wanted i suppose we talked about where we were going the mountains and a wild place farooq said that he could come with us why not farooq said he could carry our bags joked it it was just two weeks he really wanted to come lovejoy said thank you amin take it up farooq and only the truth i never saw him so happy one day hed wear his own clothes next day hed borrow ours my top and amins pants he liked to walk with us round the streetmarkets in landi khotal its chaos there its noisy dirty and smelly and caleb said it was fantastic people knew who he was family people knew he wasnt muslim and knew he was white didnt seem to make a difference because he wasnt white not strong white he merged he blended best thing about him was that he was humble he said we were lucky luckier than we knew to have family like we had hed sit down with our family at meals and eat what was put in front of him and he struggled to learn words to say how grateful he was id never seen him smile so much be so happy but it was coming to an end the wedding and then the flight home then back here the day after the wedding we were due to get the bus to islamabad then the evening flight out that last day the wedding he was all subdued he wore a suit a clean shirt and a tie it was like he was making a statement that he was going home and we talked a bit in the taxi going to the wedding but he hadnt much to say i remember that at the wedding inside our family there all the men knew that caleb was a stranger that he didnt belong to our family however much hed been welcomed he was outside our family i didnt see it at first the interest in him it was only when he was called over he was spotted he was picked out lovejoy nudged a part of the family is from across the border from jalalabad in afghanistan we think now amin and me that word of caleb in landi khotal had reached jalalabad before the wedding day a man was watching him i have never forgotten that man late in the wedding party the man had caleb called to him we believe he was already chosen but a test was given him it is a wild place on that frontier a place of guns and fighters i tell you sir i am prepared to go to a mosque in birmingham and to listen to the fire of an imam but i would not be prepared to go into those mountains and to fight the test was that he should shoot a rifle and then that he should climb a hill and use the cover of the bushes and rocks on it while men fired live ammunition at him he shot well and he reached the top of the hill but he had already been chosen the test confirmed the choice it was the decision of the man who had called him forward we were told what we should say what were you told we were to go home come back here to the jubilee estate and we were to say that caleb had decided to travel on thailand was mentioned then a final destination of australia that is what we were told to say he had passed the test set for him had been chosen he was with the man his suit was taken from him and his shoes and shirt i saw him being given the clothes of a tribesman then his clothes and shoes went on to the fire i saw them burn and i saw calebs face in the firelight it had a happiness that i had not seen before he left soon after that he went away in the back of a pickup and he never turned to look for us to wave goodbye to us we left the next morning by bus for the flight home i have nothing more to tell you who was the man who chose him a brute a man who made fear how did he create fear amin took up lovejoys question what he did and his appearance they made fear four years less a month before and lovejoy saw that the fear still ruled as sharp as on that day tell me when caleb went up that hill using the cover of the scrub and the rocks he did not only fire in the air he aimed when he fired he tried to shoot caleb he tried to kill caleb he was from chechnya he had an eyepatch and a claw he was a brute he took our friend away from us across the table from him lovejoy had seen the american stiffen the american spoke thank you gentlemen i think weve heard all we need to hear lovejoy paid the bill gave a decent but not generous tip and pocketed the receipt they left the darkened restaurant and went out into the raindrenched night they walked not quickly up the street to where the volvo was parked dietrich told lovejoy of the link now made many of those questioned at camps xray and delta had spoken of the chechen who was recognizable by his eyepatch and the artificial hand he had been killed in an ambush set by american troops of the th mountain division had died in a commandeered taxicab the taxi had been driven by fawzi alateh recently freed from guantanamo bay we reckon anyone associated with the chechen certainly anyone who was chosen by the chechen to be of elite quality dietrich said jesus man are you following me that is the scale of the disaster it was past one in the morning of a new day on his mobile with the scrambler attached lovejoy rang thames house spoke to the operations room he was an old warhorse a veteran of the service but it was hard for him as he made his report to stifle the tremor in his voice he felt exhilaration briefly then a burdening nagging apprehension he thought he walked with the fugitive but did not know on what road or where he was led will you get a citation for this dietrich asked i wouldnt have thought so more likely get kicked in my experience few of our masters regard a messenger bearing bad lidings favourably about as bad as it can get wouldnt you agree as i say with confidence jed youll find out at first hand in the small hours of the night a signal passed electronically from thames house on the north side of the river to the sister services headquarters at vauxhall bridge cross on the south side the night duty officer chewed his sandwich sipped his coffee and rang the home number of an assistant director woke him smiled grimly at the stuttered response and thought you may not be awake now you old fart but in fifteen seconds youll be active as a tenyearold with a tantrum he knew all assistant directors had a loathing for the bombshell careering down from a clear blue sky except that the night skies over london were cloudladen and spewed rain he spoke the name the history and pedigree of caleb hunt the dream soaked him in sweat but he could not wake could not lose it sprawled across the front seats of his mitsubishi bart rolled in his sleep and pleaded pleaded for escape not even the thudding blow of his chin against the steeringwheel jarring him was enough to break the sleep and the dream abandoned by his embassy forgotten by eddie wroughton the doctor of medicine samuel algernon laker bartholomew was lifted down through the back doors of the black van his bladder was going his sphincter was loosening his hands were tied behind his back and just before the back doors had opened they had blindfolded him but the cloth across his face had slipped and he was aware of fierce sunlight replacing the gloom of the vans interior he stumbled but the hands held him and he did not fall like the waves on the pebbles of torquay beaches came the murmur of a host of voices he wore a prison robe not the austin reed slacks that were his usual dress in the consulting room or the shirt from the same brand that his maid starched and ironed and the robe was pressed against his body by the breeze that carried the voices no man spoke for him he had no friend the heat blistered his face above and below the headcloth he walked sandalled feet scraping the ground but held up a dozen paces then was stopped in his tracks he felt the weight of the hands pressing him down not so that he should lie prostrate but so that he should kneel his weight pressed down on the skin of his knees the voices were stilled and he heard the silence the dream slipped back in time but bart did not wake departures at the airport of riyadh he stood in the queue around him there were families adults grumbling and complaining children sulking and whining he edged towards the desk and used his toe to push forward his bag the flight nonstop home was fully booked and bart queued for the klm aircraft to amsterdam he thought only of escape and the slow progress of the line towards the desk fuelled his fear and impatience a woman behind him bowed down by a lifestyle of bags tried to tell him how her servants had wept before shed left for the airport but he ignored her the desk came imperceptibly closer and beyond the desk was the departure gate then the lounge the walkway the aircraft cabins door he was sweating could not hide the mounting fear it was almost a relief men came behind him nasally in accented english he was asked his name and hands lifted up his bag other hands were at his arms he was out of the queue he was gone the escape had failed the dream was without mercy he cringed there was the slither of feet on the concrete of the corridor floor beyond the steelfaced door low sun threw from the barred window dark shadows the length of the cell they always came for him in the early evening when the sun went down the beatings began they were late for him already he could hear screams that pierced his head he had seen a man two days before through an open door as he was led to his own interrogation suspended from a pole by his wrists and ankles like a pig on a spit and had heard the man shriek as he was hustled further down the corridor the door opened bart was taken down the corridor but not to an interrogation room a brightly lit room with easy chairs and a polished desk and eddie bloody wroughton you confessed nothing we can do you told them everything you went down into the desert you made your own bed bart and now theres nothing we can do to stop you lying on it theyll try you closed court condemn you and then theyll execute you youre beyond our help when it comes to the end try to put up a good show try to walk tall try to have a bit of dignity itll be quick what i dont understand bart is why you were so incredibly stupid taken back to his cell and listening to the screams and shrieks of others the dream was a circle that was routed from the square to the airport concourse to the cell block and back to the square he knelt in the silence he imagined that a thousand throats gasped in anticipation he smelt the fresh sawdust he seemed to see the machine that shredded wood and made the sawdust that spilled from the machine into a sacks mouth he could not see the sack but the scent of the sawdust was in his nose he hunched the sun and a gentle breeze were on the skin at the back of his neck he tried to make the space the skin between the back of his head and the top of his shoulders so small that the executioner would find no place that his sword could strike he buried his neck in his shoulders he had not slept in the night the dawn had come after an endless wait before he had been walked to the black van he had been stripped of his prison uniform and dressed in a robe that was stiff from many washings and in spite of them was stained the back of his head nestled against the top of his shoulders and he made no target for the executioner he felt the pinprick at the base of his spine where it merged with his buttocks the prick was sharp pain the executioners trick with the sword point bart could not help himself he jerked forward his neck extended the dream ended he was not on the seats of the mitsubishi but on the floor his face squashed against the accelerator and brake pedals above him the chrome lit by the moon the keys were in the ignition bart could have pushed himself up could have sat in his seat wiped the sweat off his face and from his eyes could in one movement have turned the ignition key and driven away into the sand in the hope of finding the track might have been back in riyadh by the late afternoon possibly he would have lifted a telephone have said mr wroughton its bart here ive something really rather extraordinary to tell you when and where can we meet should have saved himself fuck you bart murmured fuck you all i hope he whoever he is and whatever he does hurts you bart looked at his watch three more hours of night before the next injection he had purged the dream he slept it was a risk but necessary first caleb slotted the battery coolant unit into the grip stock then he depressed the impulsegenerator switch as the manual told him to he was in darkness could not see could only feel and hear the manual said he had read it and memorized it that psi pressurized argon gas coolant he did not have to remember a scientists jargon but had to listen and watch the whine grew but the red light winked at him the manual said that a red lights sporadic winking indicated low battery power when it was exhausted the red light would be continuous the manual recommended that the battery coolant unit be recharged or replaced when the red light winked only in circumstances of exceptional combat conditions should an attempt be made to fire a stinger at a hostile target when the red light was winking he killed the switch the whine faded and the red light died caleb might have used the last of the batterys power when he made the test the final chance of firing might have gone he fell back the launcher resting on his body it all depended on the boy on the freshness and youth of ghaffurs ears without his hearing if the predators eye was above him he would not succeed in the last leg of his journey back to his family he had had to know that the missile would fire would eject from the launch tube would seek out a target caleb lay on his spine the exertion of lifting the stingers tube had brought back the throbbing pain to his leg he rested was relaxed what had disturbed him was not what he would do in the morning after the light came when he would stand and hobble to the guide rashid and take his rifle what had churned in his mind was that the battery powering the stinger had lost its life they had carnival girl up over the track that ran north to south on the map boxes she would fly from al ubayiah at the northern point and down above bir faysal and at turayqa to qalamat khawr al luhaysh in the south because they tracked a lorry they were both awake marty brought carnival girl down to the low limits of loiter speed and they kept pace with the lorry and its trailer the infrared realtime picture had the lorry as a clean dark shape on the screen they might have been ready to doze might have needed more caffeine to keep them upright but the lorry diverted them from drooping it wasnt the first lorry on the track but all of the others had been going south to north which was pretty much a straight line running through the centre of the map boxes what was a lorry with a trailer carrying marty said its refrigerated and its got a load of iced root beer i wish or its got big macs and ketchup and chillies and fries dumbass marty said my last go its got fans and airconditioning units i tell you what its got lizzyjo chuckled its got sand theres not enough sand here so theyre hauling it down from the north what you think in the dulled light inside the ground control easier to see the screens georges entry was not noticed they were both laughing lizzyjo thought they needed laughter as a distraction to stay awake keep working george said what you got is a visitor he told them the laughter went cold she snapped upright listened to all of it then she called up langley oscar golf was on the headsets george hadnt the authority to challenge a visitor marty was flying carnival girl lizzyjo said shed do it the challenge and oscar golf would take over the sensor operators controls via the satellite link effortless transition oscar golf told her to take the guy on the perimetergate bar with her lizzyjo go careful dont start a war and dont give a yard hearing you oscar golf out she took a swig from the water bottle did up a couple of the lower buttons of her blouse and followed george down the steps into the night hed been working on first lady the wings were off and the engine was being stripped the camera units already taken out by the time it was daylight first lady would be ready for her coffin the transport plane was due in at ten hundred and was scheduled for liftoff at twelve ten hours and for carnival girl to be stashed and loaded in time for liftoff then her sister craft had to be packed and crated in the coffin georges people swarmed round first lady george left her when they reached the armourer who had a stubby rifle hanging across his spine from a strap but his hand was hooked back and had hold of it the armourer pointed up past the gate in the razor wire then handed lizzyjo his nightsights the binoculars were heavy in her hand and she took a moment to get the focus right a mercedes was parked two hundred yards up from the gate bar with a chair by the front passenger door on it sat an arab he was middleaged had an austere thin face and trimmed moustache wore a dark outer robe an underrobe of white brilliant enough to flood her glasses and a headcloth held in place with woven rope around his neck hanging from straps were his own binoculars behind his chair the mercedes rear doors were open and three men stood close to the body of it she gave the nightsight glasses back to the armourer you reckon theyve got hardware in the back yes miss an arms reach away what you got an ma we call it a closequarters battle weapon miss it uses ball ammunition and it has an attached m grenade launcher and i got jesus is this going to be fucking dodge city its their call miss what it gets to be where are you going to stand ill be miss right behind you dont mind me saying it but id prefer you a yard to the right or lo the left wouldnt want to be in the way of a closequarters battle weapon lizzyjo said dry the armourer lifted the bar for her she walked forward lizzyjo was a sensor operator not a diplomat a negotiator or a soldier she felt the cool of the night air a little wafting wind on her bared thighs and shins on her arms and face the man stood as she approached and the guys with him seemed to inch closer to the open doors she heard against the tread of her footsteps very soft the click of oiled metal behind her and knew the armourers weapon was armed the man moved a little aside from his chair and motioned that she should sit no thank you sir would you like water sir no thank you what i would like to know is why at seventeen minutes past three in the morning you have binoculars on us you should button your blouse in the night cold it is possible to contract influenza or a headeold if one is insufficiently covered i am a prince of the kingdom i am the deputy governor of this province each time i am in shaybah since you came i watch you but before from a distance i have a question for you too why are you flying at seventeen minutes past three in the morning she said parrotlike were doing mapping and evaluation of flying performance over desert lands as we stated when permission was granted us she heard the mockery in his voice with a military aircraft lizzyjo might have been a corporate recorded message the general atomics mq predator has dual purpose military or civilian use for mapping and for evaluation of performance do you need to carry without the kingdoms authorization airtoground missiles in the darkness he would not have seen her rock i think you must have mistaken the additional fuel tanks carried under the wings for missiles when you came the fuselages of your two aircraft were without markings yet the one being dismantled now carries a skullandcrossbones once the symbol of a pirate now a warning of death or danger on the forward fuselage i ask why would such a symbol be on an aircraft preparing maps and evaluations sir i can only refer you to our embassy in riyadh of course and i am sure that inside office hours any query you have will be answered actually sir we will be gone in less than nine hours with your mapping finished your performance evaluation completed no sir lizzyjo flared should not have done but did not completed because some jerk shoved his nose in and screwed things for us he stared at her she heard the hiss of his breath between his lips in the darkness his body seemed to shake the words were chill maybe you are from the air force maybe from defense intelligence maybe from the central intelligence maybe you were never taught to dress with correctness and decency were never drilled in the virtues of truthfulness and the values of humility but you are american and how could it be different you lie to us because you do not trust us you have no humility because you believe in your superiority over us when you have been expelled in less than nine hours take this message back we fight terrorism al qaeda is our enemy we are not the wetnurse to the fanaticism of bin laden together and with trust you would have been able to fulfil your mission your arrogance destroys that possibility it is why you are hated and why you are despised and why your money cannot buy affection or respect take that message home with you she bit her lip anyone who knew lizzyjo knew her in new york or at bagram base would not have believed that she could resist a response she turned on her heel she walked back to the armourer and kept going she went past george and his team who were struggling to crate the engine of first lady and past her tent which was now folded with her possessions stacked and past martys tent and past the boxes of the hellfires that would not now be needed alone untouched because carnival girl still flew were the ground control and the trailer attached to it that carried the satellite dish she climbed the steps flopped beside marty she called oscar golf lizzyjo here it was just some local rubbernecker it was nothing im taking over but thanks for helping out marty said smiling i got bored watching that lorry wasnt sand it was carrying i reckon it was pretzels she snapped just watch your fucking screen watch it till we finish it was as if he was building a wall of information eddie wroughtons way when trying to make sense of intelligence was always to pretend that he was building a wall of coloured bricks he sat crosslegged on the floor had pushed aside the rug to give himself a firm surface and spread out sheets of paper he had used his highlighter pens to ring each of the sheets red and green white and blue and yellow he had started to build the wall in the red brick was the telephone number that had called bartholomews home the numbers code identified it as coming from the extreme southeast of the kingdom and his assistants unpraised work had found that it was listed in the name of bethany jenkins he remembered her from a party tall a picture of healthy endeavour well muscled tanned and from a casual meeting at the embassy something about meteorites and something about the oilextraction plant at shaybah she had called bartholomew late in the evening and hed gone disappeared he had run the fine dark sand granules across the indented sheet that he had taken from bartholomews notepad beside the phone pretty basic what they taught on the recruits induction courses about as sophisticated as invisible ink pens and they still lectured on the use of them scribbled words came to life after the granules were tipped from the indent marks military action missile attack head wound and a leg wound highway route harad south to bir faysal petrol station that was the green brick the white brick was shaybah from where gonsalves people flew predator unmanned aerial vehicles that were armed with twin pods for hellfire missiles the blue brick built the wall higher wroughton reached behind him for the photographs taken by the predators realtime camera with a magnifyingglass could have done it on the computer with the zoom but preferred old ways and trusted practices he studied those who were identified as dead and the one who was not accounted for a young man head up and erect and the magnifyingglass at the blurred edge of its power seemed to show a strong chin he laid the photographs on the blue sheet two and two did not make five the worst sin of an intelligence officer was to leap to untested conclusions conclusions must always have foundations his father used to say as any wall must what he knew bethany jenkins had rung samuel bartholomew from shaybah at shaybah there was an agency searchanddestroy operation which had searched and destroyed but there was a target still not accounted for bartholomew had driven away in the night with fuel and medical supplies after being told of a patient injured in military action the stupidity of the woman jenkins astonished him the involvement of bartholomew bewildered him and then his own guilt swelled around him it came back to him as the scabs on his face and body itched a phone plug pulled out a mobile switched off but bartholomew could still have left a message on the voice mail his head sank why had no message been left there was a knock wroughton called sullenly come his assistant always had a nervous twitch in his presence as if expecting a rebuke he had not known she was still there thirtyfive minutes past four in the morning what was she staring at she was staring at nothing hadnt she ever seen the scrapes from walking into a door she hadnt noticed any scrapes what did she want had thought mr wroughton might need coffee and a hot beef sandwich and she put the mug and the plate on the table in front of him as wroughton growled an acknowledgement without grace she said cautiously oh and this just came through its a general notification to all stations its probably not worth you looking at right now but i am trying if you didnt know it to work papers and photographs were laid on the table alongside the mug and the plate and she fled on his hands and knees wroughton went to the table lifted down the mug and slurped from it then the plate and took a coarse bite of the sandwich in putting back the plate he dislodged the papers and the photographs they fell at his knees he started to read caleb hunt years description ethnic caucasian but sallowskinned and no distinguishing marks and his height and weight the address albert parade and the name of a town sandwiched between the conurbations of birmingham and wolverhampton the address of his place of work as a trainee garage mechanic the recruitment landi khotal north west frontier of pakistan april by known al qaeda talentspotter the arrest captured by us military persooel in ambush south of kabul december the deception assumed the name and identity of fawzi alateh with profession of taxidriver the detention held at camps xray and delta guantanamo bay under category of unlawful combatant until release back to afghanistan in programme for freeing those believed innocent of terrorist involvement the escape during comfort stop en route from bagram to kabul city for lodgement and processing with afghan intelligence ran and was not subsequently recaptured status extremely dangerous exceptionally professional and highly motivated his success at duping interrogators at guantanamo marks him out as his laughter split across the room and broke the nights quiet more detail to follow he pushed the papers away across the floor looked again at the bricks and the upper photograph caught his eye wroughton breathed hard the upper photograph was a school group a leavers picture with a circle drawn round one face the lower photograph was a compilation of a prisoner full face left profile and right profile he laid the papers from vauxhall bridge cross on the yellowbordered sheet then the photographs the image of the lost fugitive taken before the predators strike did not match guantanamo humble and cowed he gazed down at the school photograph the boy was taller than the others straightbacked and head held high the face wroughton thought showed a mind that was detached and restless and the eyes looked through him and beyond it was where caleb hunt would be in the wilderness of the rub al khali he was injured and samuel bartholomew had been idiot enough to be persuaded to minister to him he went to the door leaned through it id like to say thank you for the coffee and the sandwich i much appreciate that youve worked through the night it was the first decent thing he had said to his assistant in months and he saw her gape back on the floor peering down at the papers and photographs he realized there was one area of doubt among the many certainties why was she involved why was bethany jenkins quality with class wealth and education in the desert and helping the man why the doubt was erased because miss jenkins you are naive selfcentred and you have let the world pass you by the photographs and printouts the imagined bricks were wroughtons witnesses as he spoke you cut yourself off from the real world and scrabbled in the sand after meteorites and did not listen to the radio didnt watch the satellite tv and didnt read newspapers you did not concern yourself with the twin towers or with bali or nairobi or a hundred bombs around the world you did not care about rows of coffins and about the weeping of victims loved ones you did not know about the hatred because youd closed your mind to everything other than your own demands itll take some getting out of miss jenkins where youve put yourself unless youre very smart smarter than youve ever been you are destined to end up as a casualty and youll call for people to help you but theyll not come running through a pane of glass she saw them she dreamed they were together and she rode beside him rocking on the camel hump and the emptiness of the desert stretched away in front of her she did not feel the heat or the dryness in her throat or exhaustion and she was aware only of her happiness to be with him in a place of beauty and free and it was her future and his a shot was fired she heard the rifles crack then the breaking of the glass she no longer saw herself clearly and did not see him the voice was in her ear replaced the ring of the shot beth woke blinked in the darkness the boy was above her his face was silhouetted against the sunken moon please miss bethany do not make any sound what what she lay on the sand a single blanket wrapped round her beside the land rovers wheel what my father says what does your father say my father says you should go go beth stammered go where to my father says you should go and leave drive away yes in the morning more injections when he can stand ride when he leaves go my father says go now i made a promise beth said bleakly i gave my word i cannot break my word my father says you should go the boy slipped away she heard the rustle of the camels harnesses their endless grinding chewing and barts snores she felt small frightened and she knew by how far she had overreached herself she had given her word had made her promise she would not sleep again would not dream again there would be no happiness no place of beauty and she thought the simplicity of love was snatched beth rolled in her blanket swore lay on her stomach swore again and beat her fists down against the sand he slept he heard nothing saw no movements the great body of the beautiful one beside him and close to him soothed his sleep caleb slept because the pain had been beaten back slept as the first light of dawn broke chapter nineteen do you want morphine no he had taken the injection in his arm caleb had lain on his back while the doctor had examined the leg wound then replaced the lint dressing you can have morphine either intravenously or by ampoule for the pain i dont want morphine its a free world the doctor smiled grimly you take it or leave it he did not want morphine because he thought the drug would cloud his mind back at home in the old world that he sought to forget there had been heroin addicts the world came back more often to him nestled with him disturbed him and in the summer they went down the canal towpath to the bridge that carried the rail link between birmingham and wolverhampton and they huddled in the gloom below the bridges arches and injected themselves to feed it they stole mugged and burgled going to school going to the garage going in the car to birmingham for the mosque he had seen them shambling pale their minds lost he needed control that day above all others the doctor hovered over him rubbing his eyes as if tiredness overwhelmed him caleb had slept the sweat ran from the doctors forehead and down into the stubble on his cheeks the doctor had saved him but had seen his face actually im rather pleased with it the low light seeped under the awning that swung and jerked from the growing restlessness of the hobbled camels in an hour he and rashid and ghaffur would be gone the ropes would be unfastened and the animals would be loaded and they would move morphine would derange his mind when he needed clarity its clean there are no indications of infection oozing thats expected but no pus its whats going to happen next that you have to think about only the highflying eye could find the vehicles and then by chance they might not be found for weeks months a year if a storm came at any time in the weeks or months the contours of the dunes would shift and the vehicles would be buried and the bodies what youve got now is temporary with clean dressings itll last three or four days but then if youve kept the infection out youll have to have it stitched tight ill be frank with you the speed of your recovery from trauma and dehydration astonishes me youve done well or been lucky but you will need a professional for the stitches he would not bury the bodies he would abandon them to rot in the sun and decay and the clothes would degrade and the flesh would be burned off the bones but the first storm would bury them his strength would be safeguarded im going to do you some extra dressings and ill leave eight ampicillin syringes enough for two days and then the same in tablets just swallow them twenty pills will keep you going for another five days youll need proper care in a week ill put out some morphine as well and two syringes of lignocaine anaesthetic if you have to take a penknife to the wound i dont think you will theres not much more i can do for you but youve had my best effort why caleb asked the doctor giggled at him then wiped the smile i dont think we need to talk about that ill get it all ready and packaged up no sudden movements no exertions no walking unaided and when you ride one of those bloody creatures you should keep the pace steady and slow you my friend are a fragile petal he watched the doctor walk away there was for a brief moment a shiver of anger in him that his question had not been answered a brief moment it did not matter he bent his body levered his back up and looked out from under the awning he saw the doctor head towards his vehicle the woman was sitting against the wheel of the land rover her knees drawn up to her chest and her head down on them sitting against the wheel where he had laboured to dig out the sand beyond the guide who was hunched down with his rifle laid across his lap the boy stood with his head still and listened he brushed his hand against the furred skin above the nose and the beautiful one nuzzled his arm he caught her harness and dragged himself up the pain shimmered through his body he stood his head against the awnings ceiling used the launcher as a crutch his hand tight on the grip stock he went slow step by slow step out from under the awning and towards the guide camp delta guantanamo bay they sat on the bus they were all blindfolded and the chains were on their wrists and ankles and round their waists he heard guards voices from outside the bus windows and the hammering of construction workers and the churning of cement mixers the sun beat on the bus roof minutes passed maybe there was shade from a tree or a building but the guards outside the bus came nearer and caleb could listen it was drawled slow talk me i wouldnt have let any of them out me id have kept them all here here for the shed three weeks so i heard ready for when the tribunals start up are we going to hang them inject them or fry them in the shed each of thems too good for these bastards do that and theres no chance for regrets kind of final i mean who says those jerks are innocent and should be sent home t reckon the high and mighty said it and as usual their talk is probable shit the engine started up ami he no longer heard the voices birds sang and there was the waft of salted air through the open door of the bus and he heard gates open in front of them then scrape shut after them on his knee was a little plastic bag compliments of the joint task force guantanamo it contained a change of underpants fresh socks a bar of soap a toothbrush and a small tube of paste he did not know that beside the gate now closed behind them was the big board that said honor bound to defend freedom they drove for the ferry and the airfield on the far side of the bay he wanted nothing of them would carry with him only the bracelet on his wrist that gave his name fawzi alateh as the bus bumped through more checkpoints past more guards he put the plastic bag on the bus floor and kicked it back under the seat he wanted nothing of them but that they should be hurt by his hand the fly came back settled on her lip beth swiped at it again with savagery she saw him with short stumbled strides his weight on the weapon he came clear of the shelter and headed out over the sand his robe was hooked into his waist the sun caught the whiteness of the new dressing and his shadow stretched away in front of him the guides boy had come to her told her she should leave in the night and she had spoken of her bloody promise she should have gone in the night to the snoring tossing bartholomew and told him ordered him to load up the big dose to burn away the dream she had not had the courage he reached the guide at that distance beth could not have heard words spoken between them she screwed her eyes to see better and did not think words were spoken he let his weight settle on the weapon that supported him reached down to the guides lap and lifted the rifle there was no protest from the guide no struggle for the rifle he stood over the guide the weapon as his crutch and both his hands held it she heard as an echoed sound across the sand the scrape of metal on metal as he cocked it he held the rifle in one hand and turned with his weight on the weapon and the length of its tube so that he faced vaguely towards her he moved she leaned her weight against the tyre and watched him his face was contorted the veins stood out on his neck and the lines cut his forehead and his eyes were near closed as if that might hold back the pain she saw the first blood trickle from his lip where he bit it he came nearer to her and the sand scuffed out from under his bare feet the guide still sat and she could not read his thought and further back and higher the boy was on the shallow dune she wriggled back against the tyre but it was ungiving then she realized he was not coming towards her his target was at a shallow angle from her beth swung her head the tail of the mitsubishi was past the land rovers front fender bart had his back to him had not seen him was stuffing packeted syringes rolled dressings and tablet bottles into a plastic bag he did not know that he was stalked the rifle was held out but beth saw the way the barrel wavered wobbled as if caught by the wind bart had a small refrigerated box and unzipped it he put the plastic bag into it he reached into the tail of the mitsubishi and lifted out a water bottle first he mopped a handkerchief across his face then he swigged from the bottle the rifle was raised its barrel seemed to shake she thought he struggled to hold it steady and to aim he was a dozen yards behind bart beth screamed no words of warning only an anguished cry that pierced the quiet she saw bart start up saw his shock saw him stare at her then follow her line of sight he fixed his gaze on the rifle barrel then seemed to shrivel she heard barts voice you dont have to do that my friend no cause for you to be worried by me snitch on you no no turn in a fighter been there ive seen your face it doesnt matter sort of made the decision last night id go to my grave rather than turn in another fighter done that long ago im grateful to you coming down here and getting you on your feet has been kind of important to me like the chains are off my friend what im saying is she saw that the barrel of the rifle was steady she pulled herself up against the tyre she saw the finger slide from the guard to the trigger she gulped in a breath and ran beth saw his head lift from the sight her boots ground and kicked in the sand as she slithered nearer to bart for the slightest moment there was irresolution on his face the rifle dropped beth reached bart she stood in front of him panted felt the heave of his chest against her back she was a shield for him you dont have to barts voice quavered in her ear i do images cascaded in beths mind his control over the men who would have killed her his sweat dripping as he dug out the sandlocked wheels his smile of gratitude as she passed him water his frown of concern and patience as he cleaned the engine his peace as he slept in the sand beside her the stars and moon above h i m the barrel was up aimed she looked into his face and searched for passion loathing madness and saw only a strange calm she thought his eyes had the emptiness of death as if the light had gone from them ive seen your face i remember it be a hero be a killer isnt that what you want do you know what you said before the drip worked ill tell you theyll hear my name theyll know it everyone will hear my name when you hear my name all of you bastards itll be because ive done what my family wants of me your family big deal have made an animal of you common brit scum is what you are always will be and vain as a fucking peacock ive seen your face and i will not forget it she stared back at the barrel of the rifle and she knew through the sights he must look into her eyes she held her gaze steady never lost his eyes the finger was on the trigger she hadnt seen him come one moment she faced the barrel the next the boy was in front of her the boy protected her she felt the trembling of his slight sinewy body against her stomach and against her back was bart could he shoot to save him the boy had been near to death in the desert to save him the boy had trekked to her over the boys head she saw now the pain in his face and it was not the pain from the wound the sun caught the bracelet on his wrist and she thought that when it had been put on him he had not weakened now he did more movement from the corner of her eye the boys father walked past the longflung shadow and past him never looked at him and past the raised barrel the boys father spat into the sand then turned and stood in front of his son beth knew he would not shoot they made their untidy line body to body and faced him she did not taunt him again did not need to at that moment as beth saw it there was a vulnerability about him and loneliness and in snapped movements those of a trained man the rifle barrel was raised towards the brightened skies there was the clatter of the mechanism as it was wrenched back and the bullet ejected the bullet its case gleaming arched from the rifle and fell and his finger was off the trigger there was the click of the safety lever the rifle was held out and the guide went a dozen paces and took it she wondered if he was broken if she had isolated him had killed him he walked away from them using the weapon to lean on struggling to walk bart said softly behind her hows he going to get his name up in lights murder half a city if he cant blow us away the guide was at the trumpeting camels knelt to loosen their hobble ropes and the boy trudged to the high ground to resume his watch beth clung to bart held the gross sweaty man in her arms felt him quiver against her im not taking blame not any way im not i done everything for him he never wanted one quick shag excuse me and its with you the rest of your life might as well have hung a rock round my neck want to hear about it jed dietrich thought himself privileged to be at a masterclass as taught by michael lovejoy he knew the woman to be aged fortythree but appearance gave her fifteen years more minimum well youre going to me and lucy winthrop and di mackie were all eighteen all in work at a packager and its friday night twentyfive years ago and its like yesterday would be because it screwed my life we were in the crown and anchor thats wolverhampton but its a car park now hot night summer night too much booze three guys they were italians all the soft talk italians in wolverhampton to put in a new printing press or something closing time chucking out christ theyd hands like bloody octopuses the lot of them were down an alley and its a kneetrembler job im in the middle and were all going at it and were pissed mines called himself pierluigi and hes from sicily what else do i know about him not much oh yes he was big and it hurt they did their zips and we pulled our knickers up we went home they went wherever dis ok and lucys ok but im in the club trouble is i dont know it till its too late to dump it my dad tried to trace him but it was a brick wall we called him caleb dont ask me why it was dads choice five years later dad and mum moved down south bought a bungalow truth was they wanted to be shot of us so i was left behind with the little bastard they hated him said hed ruined their lives theyre dead now both of them we didnt go to the funerals they wouldnt have wanted us there neither of them as a baby and a child he was dark he was different theyd been at the door early in her housecoat shed answered lovejoys knock he had been so charming so gentle inside the hall hed remarked on the wallpaper what a pretty pattern miss hunt what a nice choice and hed edged into the kitchen and not seemed to notice the filled sink and last nights plate and hed fixed on a dying plant in a pot always did like that one miss hunt in fact id say its my favourite and hed put the kettle on i was lucky to get this place dad had a friend in the town hall housing it was his price to me for moving south dad got my file moved up then he could go and wash his hands of me were here like an island all asians around us im not complaining some people would not me theyre good people and good neighbours so all his friends were asians had to be he got to blaming me that i wasnt asian and hadnt a family like his friends had but im not taking any blame nothings my fault said so quietly and with a smile that won miss hunt you seem like a woman who looks after herself im hesitating will you have sugar if i do lovejoy had poured the tea into cups hed taken from the cupboard and shed almost purred dietrich reflected that the woman had no idea of the devastation about to hit her shabby damp little home and lovejoy wasnt about to tell her effortlessly it was established that the room upstairs was untouched uncleared from the day the little bastard had left the room would be the centre of the storm but only when lovejoy was finished i tell you who i blame most that perkins at the school made too much of a fuss of caleb made him do things that werent natural to him speaking in front of the class being special marking him out caleb got so that nothing satisfied him i was dirt no respect for me his mother no respect for the people in the job he had always dreaming of something he couldnt have why couldnt he have a family like farooq like amin why couldnt he belong he only wanted the asians didnt even have a nice white girlfriend could have had tracey moore or debbi binns truth to be told girls scared him and he ran a bloody mile from them then the offer came nag nag nag money money money he never came back nor did my money looking out through the kitchen window and dietrich didnt think it had been cleaned that year he saw a rubbishfilled yard a washingmachine tipped on its side against a low wall and above it the walkway that he knew from the map was beside the canal a group of loafing kids wandered along it and he saw an old man with a bent back who had a terrier straining on a leash move aside to give them passage he seemed to understand it was a place to escape from lovejoy had driven him through the estate on their way to the earlymorning knock little streets little terraced homes little food shops and everywhere the little brightpainted boxes of security systems the only buildings of stature on the estate were the new mosque and the new muslim community centre it was a ghetto not a place where caleb hunt could have belonged and jed understood why it had failed to provide the man with what he needed all so different from the scrubbeddown interrogation rooms of camp delta where he met the enemy but he learned more here than there they came round to see me farooq did and amin and they werent straight up with me but they stuck to it caleb had gone travelling id hear from him they said but hed gone travelling hes a grownup and i got on with my life two postcards came one after two months and one after five the opera house in sydney and that big rock in the middle its more than three and a half years since the last one came nothing at my birthday nothing at christmas i suppose hes forgotten me tears ran down her lined prematurely aged cheeks she looked up past dietrich towards lovejoy who did you say you were from i didnt lovejoy stood thank you for the tea miss hunt they went out of the front door on to the pavement two big vans smokedglass windows were parked one at each end of the short street they walked past the van at the top and lovejoy rapped on its window with the palm of his hand they went on round the corner to where the volvo was parked lovejoy wasnt a man to linger for the uglier side of his work they would be well gone speeding on the road south when the detectives spilled from the vans elbowed inside tore apart the terraced house for evidence of the life times and motivations of caleb hunt not that dietrich thought there was anything left to know they reached the car lovejoy asked brusquely you happy ready to call it a day dietrich said ready to wrap yes happy no the postcards the postcards say that right from the start they marked him down as high potential for infiltration created a cover they reckoned theyd their hands on highgrade material we did well but i dont feel like cheering or breaking out a bottle i suppose its because i think i know him ill get you on the afternoon flight my granddaughters birthday today and ill catch the end of the party whichll please mercy i find theres not often cause in our work for cheering never seems quite appropriate they drove away out of the estate over the canal and left behind the place that had fashioned the past present and future of caleb hunt the file was under his arm on it was written the name i want mr gonsalves on the phone and i want him now please the marine guard and the receptionist stared at the scars on eddie wroughtons face you should tell him i am in possession of information hed give his right ball for and if you obstruct me i guarantee to flay the skin off your backs you want to sit comfortably again then do it a call was made the receptionist murmured into the phone and fixed wroughton with a glance of sincere hostility somebody would be with him soon would he like to sit down he paced and held tight to the file the young man came down the stairs went through the security barrier and tracked towards him im sorry mr wroughton but mr gonsalves is in conference and i am deputed to take whatever message you have for him wroughton saw his curled lip the sneer get me up to gonsalves if he wants to see this theatrically wroughton held the file in front of the young mans spectacles wait here he waved the file again taunting with it as the desk telephone was lifted excuse me guys bottom right of screen wasnt that we lost it the serene voice of oscar golf broke into their headsets the intervention from langley no its not there now weve gone past did you see anything bottom right of screen for four or five seconds it was a little short of two hours since they had last heard from oscar golf marty had stiffened it was like they were watched tested spied on he saw lizzyjos mouth move as she swore under her breath our calculations give you fourteen minutes more time over your current box lets use the time guys by going back how does that sound he looked at lizzyjo shed her tongue stuck out like she was a kid in contempt of an adult then her forefinger waved across her lips not a time to fight ill bring her back well work back oscar golf lounging in a swivel chair in the darkened room at langley was not a target to pick for a scrap maybe oscar golf had six pairs of eyes alongside to help him marty grimaced at lizzyjo and she shrugged hed seen nothing bottom right of the screen neither had she and he heard a thundering roar piercing into his headset billowing through the open door where he sat he couldnt see the window of ground control and the door was at the wrong angle she leaned close slipped his headset up off his ear and whispered that it was the transporter landing their freedom bird oscar golf i am going into a figure eight and lets hope we find what you think you saw appreciate that oscar golf out there was just sand on the screen from top left to bottom right red sand and yellow sand ochre sand and gold sand and there were sand hills sand mountains and flat sand the track was out of sight too far to the east of the last map boxes they flew tiredness ached in marty the previous day at the start of the last flight and before the weariness had settled on him he would have resented any request to go back and look again with the joystick he banked carnival girl and swung her to starboard before the correction to port dust came in a storm through the ground control open door and he did not need lizzyjo to tell him that the transporter had taxied off the runway and come on to the compacted dirt beside the compound gate the dust filled the ground control centre settled on his head and his shoulders and spread over the chart of map boxes she choked he heard her gulp and then she had hold of his hand heh marty see that what are we looking at wroughton was led into gonsalves empire all the desks were deserted all the screens in the openplan flickered but were not watched he went past a conference annexe and through the door saw briefcases dumped and files left open wroughton was brought to a technology and electronic control centre he went in over shoulders backs and heads there was a bank of screens he saw gonsalves in a godawful floral shirt he said ive hit a jackpot juan and im sharing it with you it should have been a moment of triumph for eddie wroughton in the throne room of the empire he held up the file and was ready to boast of what he had achieved he won no reaction except that gonsalves waved a hand at him without turning gestured for him to shut his mouth he looked at the screen they all watched and he heard the voice metallic and distant from the high speakers thats good marty and well done for bringing us back you have eleven minutes more flying time on station lizzyjo please could you give me a zoom right in close i reckon its a target good flying guys oscar golf out bart carried the coolbox from the tail of his mitsubishi walked well and steadily the vehicle was fuelled up and hed discarded the empty cans by the tail he felt almost a slight disappointment in the young man hows he going to get his name up in lights murder half a city if he cant blow us away not that he wanted to be dead his thorax blasted his spinal cord broken lungs and heart punctured by bullets fired on semiautomatic not that he wanted his blood coagulating in the sand and the flies clustering he recognized the scale of the failure and it left him with a trace of sadness the two men in the village fingered by bart they would have shot him would not have failed he saw to his right that the guide and the boy had their animals loaded he was not sure whose life had tipped the balance had won his survival he walked over to the young man who had the launcher on his shoulder and seemed to wait irresolutely by his camel as if expecting help to mount it he reached him put down the coolbox that held the drugs syringes and dressings and looked into the face can i pay you bart shook his head there was because of the traced smile a charm about the face he had not registered before the pain that had twisted it was gone the shake of barts head was expansive as if mere mention of remuneration cheapened him he saw the cut of the chin the delicate shape of the nose and the brightness seemed back in the eyes to bart there was in that short moment an image of wildness of freedom of magnificence rambling old boy he thought rambling and getting bloody stupid the bugger should have ended you and it was what she had seen little miss bethany jenkins he turned away he saw fleetingly that the guides boy had moved a few paces from his father and a frown laced the young skin of his forehead she intercepted him came towards him and the sand kicked from her boots with the urgency of her stride nothing sweet about her and her mouth was puckered in a suppressed anger she stood in front of him blocked him you could have put him down a sheepish smile a shrug he wouldnt have known you could have squirted half a gallon of morphine into him but he hadnt he had patched him up had brought him to his feet and had faced his rifle why didnt you he snapped at her miss jenkins dont ever presume to look into a mans mind search it and strip it the exercise might cause you to put your delicate head between your knees and vomit that is pathetic its what youre going to get and the shout came shrill keened across the sand rooted him he saw the boy one hand cupping an ear and the other pointed up barts head jolted up to the sky clear blue and he saw nothing he heard nothing the boy howled the warning bart stammered what does he say saying what what the aircraft up there scatter get clear the guides arms flailed right and left in front of him and behind now the boy ran and the guide and she had ducked her head and charged for open sand and the camels caught the panic except one the man his patient knelt beside his camel and held tight to its strained harness had the launcher at his shoulder bart was alone he looked a last time into the sky and then the sun was in his eyes and he was blinking blinded he was alone and stumbling towards his vehicle groping towards it he had no cover he seemed to see himself grotesquely magnified trapped by a hovering eye he blundered towards the vehicles cab reached it threw open the door fumbling grasping for the keys twisting them stamping on the clutch then the accelerator crying out in fear he felt the power under him the wheels spun whined then caught he did not know whether he faced the track and headed for it or went away from it he did not consider whether he could lumbering across the desert escape the aircrafts eye he did not look at the speedometer which would have told him that his pace over shifting sand was not more than twentyfive miles in an hour bart went in little surges on caked sand then slowed in loose drifts his eyes were misted from the sweat and the suns power bounced at him from the mitsubishis bonnet he could not see where he went what was in front of him clinging to the wheel he drove away jerking the gear lever and never looked back never glanced in his mirror at the sandcloud behind him never thought of the trail he left for the high eye he had no idea of distance might have gone a mile he was in the drift not a wall not a barrier but a steady sinking movement the engine raced whined and the needle on the speedometer dial sagged from twenty to ten to five going slower he stamped harder on the accelerator swung the wheel went to the clutch and changed down stamped again and the loose sand of the drift settled round the tyres what to do bart did not know he did not know whether to claw his way out of the vehicle and try in the scorched heat to run did not know whether to go into reverse he did not know whether to get out go to the back take the shovel and dig hes got in a drift line him up guys in your own time take him oscar golf out it was like driftwood washed up on a beach marty had flown the figure eights tighter as he had gone after the vehicle didnt know not with carnival girl at altitude and on loiter thrust how down there on the sand they had suddenly been aware of the predator presence two vehicles camels and people had been on the screen then theyd broken his concentration had been on the flying not the detail of the screen beside him lizzyjo hadnt had the zoom in focus and close until the smoke had started spilling from the back end of the vehicle of course that was the target at first the vehicle had done well had gone clear of the group and the screen had shown only the roof of its cabin and the tail of dust spat out behind it it was the sort of target they did at nellis for training recruits slow and easily visible then it had gotten easy too easy it had stopped he wondered if the guy would get out and run he half hoped the guy would run what he had was a vehicle marooned and going nowhere how long we got she said they had a clear four minutes on station how do you want me to come in she wanted him on the drivers side and said shed take the hellfire in through the drivers door marty had no thoughts of grandfathers not his own with whom hed gone out duckshooting and not the old man strapped down on the back of a camel and laid out over the hump he had not seen the man on the screen as the man had run for the vehicle he did not see a face and did not care to look for a mind but he had the target the end of his figure eight brought him on to the passenger side of the vehicle and he banked her dipped the wing for the halfcircle to take him to a firing point against the drivers door he did not understand why the guy did not run he heard lizzyjo recite the check questions to herself and give herself the check answers for readiness to launch marty held carnival girl steady and the camera image was flush on the drivers door it was as if she hovered a hawk in the moment before the dive on the prey beside him lizzyjo whispered the command then her finger hit the lit button the screen shook as if carnival girl had been punched by turbulence marty clenched his fist on the joystick and watched the flame veer away the ball of fire dived like a hawk falling in the seconds before the hellfire hit marty said well go take a look at whats left behind the rest of them then well bring her back yes take her home she done us proud shes a great girl then its turn for home the hit was on the drivers door a flash of flame then the first smoke the climbing cloud of debris that obscured the target around him there was to wroughton an ejaculation of excitement he could have told them that the chosen target was not caleb hunt terrorist or adventurer or fighter could have told them that the vehicle belonged to a pathetic doctor of medicine that the driver was pitiful and harmless gonsalves people whooped and screamed and stamped applause they hung on each other clung to each other he thought the death of samuel bartholomew gossip and spy made a mardi gras day for them he knew that if his telephone had not been unplugged and if he had not tapped in the code on his mobile that prevented messages being recorded bart his puppet would have called him he held the file and the noise of celebration hit the low ceiling of the control centre and wroughton knew he would not be heard ignored he said softly idiots you killed a nobody you took out the wrong target the fire flash the hellfires launch gave caleb his aim point he stood he was alone the beautiful one had gone and the other camels in the distance clear to see against the sands and the sky was the cloud of smoke he did not know where the guide and the boy ghaffur were where she was and he did not look for them his memory held the point in the blue stretched sky where the flash had come from he did it as he had learned it from the manual the guidance antenna at the muzzle end of the tube was unfolded the covering cap of the tube was discarded lay by his bare and sandworn feet the open sight was raised and the belt pack hung on his waist the impulsegenerator switch was depressed by his finger caleb did it as the manual told him without the one hundred and thirtysix hours of instruction that the manual demanded he heard the whine of the audio signal struggled to hold up the weight of the launcher and stood solid and square with his two legs taking equally the strain of it no support no crutch the pain throbbed in the wound which was raw and not closed by stitches he pulled the trigger in the grip stock the manual said it was one point seven seconds from trigger depression to motor ignition the missile lurched from the tube and fire scorched the sand behind him he saw it so sharply the clumsy flight from the tube mouth and for a moment he thought it would fall back and roll in front of him on the sand the tail fins opened out and as the manual had said the ejector motor dropped away a flash as the secondstage engine bit and she was away he sank to his knees the sand behind him burned from the exhaust fire and the ignition fumes stank acrid in his nose he would have fallen had he not had the tube to support him it was gone fast above the low horizon line he watched the fire that powered it ebb from him diminish from him against the skys blue he depended on their technology their electronics their magic and wizardry it flew free beyond his control twice it meandered as if it had lost sight of the target and it hunted to find it again and twice it locked back he peered up to where its path took it close to the sun but he saw nothing he did not know where the men would be who flew it but he imagined the everincreasing chaos around them as they dived the craft or climbed it or threw it to the side tried to lose the closing spurt of fire the hit was so sudden it darted bent its course sharp as if its last command was late high near to the sun where his eyes burned a little flash of brightness but small against the suns light it was not a clean strike there was no explosion the little flash and then the fire moved on soared higher and burst for a long time caleb looked up he looked until his eyes had watered until he blinked until he could no longer stare up close to the sun and the heat burdened him and the flies clustered on the dressing on his leg and the pain washed in him and he was alone it was a speck falling and he thought he heard the voice of a child singing it was a swans song the far edge of the left wing had been hit a great destabilizing hole punched in it the predator brilliant white from nose tip to tail from port wing to left wing was spinning down control was gone death inevitable falling with the wind streaming against its wings until the debris scattered in the sand until the fire became a pyre if he had spoken someone would have hit him they had all watched the predator go down if he had spoken had pointed out that he had warned of the crates the camels carried he would have been hit the silence was like life arrested the picture on the screen untouched was a whiteout snowstorm they had still been in noisy celebration without shame and not a thought of the incinerated corpse in the vehicle as the camera had tracked back over the sand and there had been the flash from far below at first a little winnow of confusion whats that what we got the one called oscar golf on the loudspeakers had never lost his calm there had been a womans voice merged with oscar golfs a flat monotone as if it were merely a training exercise and instructors had thrown up a problem the aircraft had swerved made violent manoeuvres but the fireball shown by the lens had closed shed gone down spinning and spiralling and the lens had shown a mad image of yellow reddened sand racing to meet her the voice of oscar golf was gone cut off in midsentence a switch thrown who wanted an inquest on failure hell it was only a piece of metal junk off a factory floor not the death of a friend as the audience slouched out as gonsalves in that hideous shirt came to him and punched him on the upper chest wroughton opened the file and held up the photographs of caleb hunt schoolboy camp delta prisoner and rub al khali fugitive thats who you didnt get thats your target wroughton chuckled what is it with you people so goddamn patronizing you keep a notebook on points scored they were both laughing hugging and hanging on to each other and laughing like they didnt care it was the waiting room of a funeral parlour laughing till it hurt and it did hurt because a target of importance had been missed he did not look back at her the last he saw of her she was sitting on the sand on a dune and her head was down if he had gone to her confused and tonguetied and deafened by the launchers blast he did not know what he would have said to her neither the guide rashid nor the boy ghaffur had helped him mount the saddle on the hump of the beautiful one he was beyond feeling the pain of the wound he had struggled to drag himself up then to swing the leg across the saddle they were ahead of him and she was behind him and far beyond her were the last wisps of two columns of smoke caleb did not look back did not wave did not at the last moment when his voice would have carried to her shout his farewell he rode away followed the guide and the boy into the sand that stretched to a far horizon all that mattered to him he thought was that he was close now to his family to their love chapter twenty she stood she shaded her eyes riding away from her were three antsized dots almost swallowed by the desert she watched them as they diminished disappeared into the far haze the smoke had gone from the downed aircraft and the destroyed vehicle her dream of him was downed too she was glad that he had not spoken to her there had been no contact between them when he had gone she had not wanted to hear his voice see his face she had feared they would break her resolve he had not looked back it was as if he did not acknowledge that he had come into her life had passed her in the night she walked to her land rover the quiet of the place its beauty and emptiness washed over her she took from the land rover the two towels she had packed a spare blouse she had brought and a bright red blanket she had thought she might need in the nights cold but which she had not used she carried them back to the dune she had watched him from the haze had thickened round them she made the arrowhead so that it pointed to him and the tiny specks on either side of him there was no wind the sand was still she bent the blanket for the point blood scarlet on the sand at each end to lengthen the arrowhead she laid the towels he had gone into the haze was swallowed in it but she marked the route he had taken beyond the point as if to sharpen it she rolled her blouse put it on the sand she marked him beth would never again hear his voice see him feel the touch of him she would not have justified her betrayal of him as having been for the greater good of humanity she marked him as a piece of personal vengeance planes would come or helicopters and they would see the arrow she had fashioned they would hunt him till they killed him love was dead as an afterthought she stripped off her blouse exposed the whiteness of her skin to the suns beat and that too she rolled tightly and used it to make the point of the arrowhead more distinct more exact she walked down off the high ground left the arrow behind her she passed the abandoned tube the emptied box and the dropped manual she saw the insect column that carried away the slivers ol flesh from his wound at the land rover she threw a scarf over her shoulders and gunned the engine the sun hammered at him and the pain surged sometimes his eyes were closed and sometimes they could see nothing more than the reins in his hand and the fur of the beautiful ones neck the heat was without mercy and caleb did not know for how long he had ridden alone he stopped dragged on the rein and whispered to the beautiful one what he had heard the boy say they had been in front of him but were no longer there he looked to his right and left and saw only the expanse of the sand and the gentle rise of the dunes he gasped forced himself to turn further to look behind their camels knelt they stood in front of them and the fathers arm was round his sons shoulders caleb did not know whether it was for protection or if it was to comfort the boy he could not see them clearly was not able to read them because the tiredness and pain played tricks with his sight he realized their intention he would have gone on reeling in his dreams and his fantasies burned by the sun half dead and half alive and would not have known that they had fallen back had left him now they were a hundred yards less from him in an hour he would not have been able to see them he realized they wanted no more part of him t need you caleb shouted they would head for their village the guide would spin a story the boy would go to a desert grave rather than gainsay his fathers lie back in their village they would tell of the deaths from the eye in the sky and of the demand of the wounded traveller without a name and without a home that he go on alone they would return to their village and no man would be able to contradict their story his shout burst over the sand i need you to take me to my family for answer the guide pointed far ahead far beyond caleb towards the haze and the horizon do you want money i can give you money his fingers scrabbled at the belt at his waist he loosened the fastening and held up the pouch i will pay you to lead me they gave no sign that they had heard him he saw them straddle the saddles then the camels rose the guide pulled at his camels head and moved away at a right angle to the route they had led caleb on the boy followed him the money in the pouch would buy a well for the village pickup trucks for the villagers was wealth to a degree they could not have dreamed of as they went away they did not look at him caleb threw the pouch towards them he threw it high it arched in flight and the neck fell open the coins glittered as they dropped i will get there without you gold coins lay on the sand were scattered round the pouch they walked under the raised bar through the gap in the coiled razor wire the bags were hooked on their shoulders and marty carried his picture from the tail ramp of the aircraft george called come on guys youre busting the takeoff schedule but they did not hurry the place was a part of them where they had lived and where they had killed behind them was the emptiness of the compound dumped boxes of cardboard and plastic bags bulged with rubbish tornup paper scraps hung from the barbs of the wire she reached out and took his free hand they went together marty felt a shyness but did not pull away his hand they went at their own pace as if the schedule for takeoff was not important to them at the bottom of the ramp watched by george and his people lizzyjo grinned then tilted up her head and kissed his cheek there were catcalls and whistles through fingers and feet stamped applause marty blushed they went on up the ramp and into the gloom of the stowage area two coffins were being brought back to bagram one loaded and one empty except for boxed spares and maintenance toolkits marty blushed because he thought he had failed first lady was in her coffin but carnival girl was out in the desert broken and lost while the camp was torn apart and he had packed his bag lizzyjo had lectured him on the success of the mission one more chance to hurt the man who had brought down carnival girl was all he could have asked for but it was denied him marty edged up the side of the fuselage over the legs and knees of georges people past the coffins and satellite kit the stowed tents and cookhouse gear and they found little canvas seats where their feet would be against the wheels of the ground control trailer they were near to the bulkhead close to the hatch door to the cockpit he settled fastened the restraining harness he was not thinking of lizzyjo and a future but of carnival girl who was down and mourned and alone the texan drawl cut through his thoughts good to see you folks he was far away where carnival girl was in the sand he looked up and scratched in his clouded memory you dont remember me i brought you in here you look rough you not slept how did it go it went ok marty said lizzyjo cut in he flew well way beyond the limits we lost one but we got good kills we got al qaeda kills the pilot said smile beaming right on you should be glad were flying out today forecast is nasty tomorrow storms and winds thatll gust to seventy knots good that we got the window today ill come and talk after weve lifted off the request welled in martys throat as he unfastened the harness clasp the pilot was half gone through the hatch door and the ramp was already up the second pilot had started up the heavy engines marty had to yell excuse me sir but could i ask you a favour means a lot to me he explained shouted it in the pilots ear above the growing howl as the power gathered the transporter laden to the maximum used the length of the runway and even then the undercarriage seemed to skim the airfields perimeter the pilot should have done an immediate starboard turn for a plotted flight path to the omani border then the crossing of the jabal akhdar mountains but instead banked to port on liftoff marty gave him the map coordinates which were passed on to the navigator lines were pencildrawn on the map and the diversion course was set he clung to the back of the pilots seat and the transporter shook and bumped as it gained height lizzyjo was crouched beside him her hand over his fingers clamped on the seat he thought that she understood his need they crossed plateau sand and dunes and the mountains of the desert they went over the track a trafficcontrol tower queried them and the pilot said dry that navigation equipment had gone faulty was being worked on would be rectified in the near future left it behind them the navigator did well she lay two miles below them spread out fractured dead the pilot took them on a tilting circuit marty had his nose pressed against the glass of the cockpit side window he saw the twentyfoot length of one white wing and the broken pieces of the fuselage he did not know how to say a prayer but words of respect choked at the back of his mouth lizzyjo held his shoulder tight but it was his moment he grieved her fingernails cut down through his tshirt and then she rapped the pilots arm and gestured beyond the wreckage they saw the arrow it was on raised ground and pointed across open sand it seemed to marty as if the arrowhead of bright colours was laid out to be seen from the air the navigator made calculations then scribbled on his pad the exact compass bearing in which the arrowhead faced lizzyjo said someone left a marker someone wants them fucked over thanks for the diversion sir lets get on home now as they climbed headed for the omani border for the mountain range of jabal akhdar and for the wide sea of the gulf of oman lizzyjo u s e d the communications and broadcast the coordinate reference points and the compass bearing and they went back to their canvas seats marty slept his head on her shoulder the winds rose and they went into the teeth the mouth of the storm his eyes were closed against the spat pricks of the sand had his eyes been open he would have been blinded waves came across him beat on him threatened to drag him down off the saddle to pitch him on to the deserts floor the beautiful one led him caleb could not have directed her he let the reins hang loose and clung to the saddle and when the fiercest gusts hit him he dropped his arms on to her neck and held the long hair he knew that if they stopped found a dune that protected them and huddled for shelter behind it they would never regain the direction of their path and if the beautiful one flinched from the storm turned away from it they were dead the force of the storm brought the hot scalding air against him flattened his robe against his body the sand was in his closed eyes his pinched nostrils and his mouth and it beat into the wound lifted the lint dressing and lay in the cavity that was not stitched closed he could not drink could not eat his throat was raw dry his stomach was aching empty stubborn as he had always been caleb clung to life again and again his mouth closed because to open it would let in the storms sand he shouted in his mind that he had not lived lo fail now obstinacy gave him strength if he went down on to the sand and against the beautiful ones body his life was wasted before it had begun he did not see skeletons in the sand the whitened b o n e s of a man and a camel rotted clothing and the frayed sacking leatheer of a saddle he did not know how fast the beautiful one carried him or how far she could take him against the lash of the wind he was alone with his god with his purpose a day had passed the shuttle bus waited at the end of the ferry pier it took jed to camp delta he showed his card and the guard let him through the turnstile gate hed had a good flight to miami then a feeder to puerto rico then a military ride to guantanamo he had left his bag at the reception of officers quarters had not checked back in but had gone for the ferry taking with him only the filled file jed thought the guard looked at him strangely as he presented himself at the gate for administration but his id swiped took him through maybe the guard was new hauled out of the reserve taken off a civilian street and didnt know him and he did not see as he walked towards administration with the sunshine the light and the perfect breeze off the sea on him the guard pick up the telephone in his box the sun and the feel of the wind made him feel good if he had not had the file under his arm jed might have forgotten fast where he had been might have forgotten the rain of that place and its darkness the grime on the streets and the sort of despair of it he went up the steps into the block and the guys on the desk looked away from him like they hadnt seen him he went down the corridor and headed for his office wanted to get the file secure in his safe he went past closed doors did not look at them at the end of the corridor as he walked along it he saw the big plastic bag filled it was by his door he reached the door his name wasnt on it it had been typed on a sticky paper strip but the strip had been scraped off as if with a penknife blade he had his key out of his pocket and into the lock but the key did not fit the changed lock he unknotted the top of the plastic bag and saw the photograph in its frame of brigitte arnie junior and himself on a lake boat in wisconsin he turned stamped back up the corridor towards his supervisors room two doors now were open one to a room the bureau used and one to an agency room it was done as if it were synchronized the agency man was in front of him and the bureau man was behind their voices rattled round him you looking for edgar your supervisor you wont find him edgar went sick yesterday got flown off guantanamo jed thought he understood thought he knew what their business would be in blocking him the agency man in front of him said and he wasnt alone on the flight wallace went with him except wallace wasnt sick the man behind him from the bureau door said and harry was on the same plane and harry too wasnt sick jed remembered lovejoy the droll and laidback quip in my experience few of our masters regard a messenger bearing bad tidings favourably about as bad as it can get wouldnt you agree lovejoy had told him he would find it at first hand in front of him and behind him suppose you think youre clever and a hero not an utter asshole you fucked wallace and wallace was a good man what i think you motherfucker youre not fit to wipe harrys boots you destroyed his lifes service disgraced him he thought of lovejoy and his kindness and of the back roads hed taken thought of old people in a library and a headteacher and a man whod seen the potential of a kid the guys in a repair workshop who werent good enough to satisfy the kids ambition to be somebody thought of two asian youths whod walked away when the kid hadnt thought of a woman a mother on whom the kid had turned his back thought of what it added up to and the danger that was the kid caleb hunt wallace most likely because of you will face a disciplinary board might lose his pension those gatherings of senior men gone off the payroll but honoured harry wont ever be there you disgraced him snapped him like a fucking twig for what for your ego asshole to trample on good mens reputations and belittle them so a mistake was made big deal should have been kept close you fish dietrich dont you good youve got yourself all the months of the year for fishing the bureau man behind him sidled back to his door the agency man eased to the corridors side you broke two fine men well break you jed turned went back and picked up the black plastic bag he dumped the file in the top of it covered the picture of brigitte arnie junior and himself he carried the bag down the corridor past the closed doors he thought of the panic that caught a city and the screams welled in his ears through tears he saw bloodstains on pavements and he wondered where was caleb hunt who could make the panic a week had gone the pilot of the big chinook doublerotor helicopter had told them in their headsets that it was unusual not exceptional for the rub al khali desert to be hit by a storm of that intensity and duration but flight was now possible though uncomfortable he had added that ground temperature was currently at fahrenheit centigrade and hed wished them well all the time they had been up wroughton had felt sick and gonsalves had twice used the paper bags offered them the chinook carried a platoon of the national guard the deputy governor of the province gonsalves and wroughton the weather had cleared sufficiently for two f bombers saudi piloted to strike the cave complex the previous afternoon the chinook flew to confirm the success or failure of the strike wroughton knew he was lucky to be on board gonsalves the ally had the right to be there wroughton was on sufferance on the manifest because he had the file and the name on the file gonsalves had supplied the map coordinates where the marker had been left and the compassbearing of the arrow in a direct line from the compassbearing fortyeight land miles from the map coordinates the bombers had found a steep rock escarpment and among stones they had seen a flash of light sun upon chrome metal and on their third pass the cave entrance had been seen it had been hit six laserguided fivehundredpound highexplosive bombs had been dropped on the cave entrance wroughton had said it gonsalves had believed him that the cave would have been the destination of caleb hunt they went feeling sick and being sick in search of the body and the bodies of the commanders that he had crossed the desert to rejoin at the map coordinates the chinook had gone low they had sensed both of them that the pilot struggled to keep the helicopter up they had seen faces pressed against porthole windows clothes a blanket and towels scattered over a halfmile the scorch mark where a vehicle had been burned out were covered by a sand carpel and only the roof protruded of the downed predator all they saw was the section of the tail wings and the pushpropellor the rest of it submerged by sand on the compassbearing they looked for bodies and the carcasses of camels but the desert below them was clean windscoured sand they landed at the base of the escarpment ears ringing his step unsteady from the chinooks turbulent flight wroughton walked towards the pile of rock rubble gonsalves sweating and complaining followed him he could smell the death the sweet sickly scent of the dead came on the gusted wind he heard gonsalves throw up again didnt know how the man had anything left to vomit he had felt at ease with himself the previous night using the full weight of his embassy authority he had escorted bethany jenkins to the airport to the checkin counter to the departure gate and had got her out safely gratitude for services rendered before questions had closed around her hadnt even asked for her london phone number she could have gone to gaol or to chop chop square he had felt comfortable until the smell soaked him wroughton stepped among the stones at the base of the escarpment and held his handkerchief to his nose a little of the caves entrance was clear but it was high above him no way that wroughton would scramble up over the fractured rocks when he wore his last linen suit the light caught it he bent and picked up the tin box what the sunlight had struck what the bombers pilots had seen and opened it gingerly ash and cigarette butts spilled out his handkerchief was insufficient wroughton gagged buried by the rocks only the head arm and rifle barrel visible the sentry stank wroughton said quietly bad luck sir you did it all carefully kept a tin for your fag ends you were nice and tidy and professional except that a flier at ten thousand feet four hundred miles an hour cant see fag ends but can see a metal tin when the sun hits it it wasnt me who ever said life was fair sir the national guard troops had crawled like ferrets wroughton thought into the cave entrance the bodies were lowered down the escarpment or dropped they had not yet swollen but he reckoned the stench worse than anything hed encountered in bosnia at the mass graves he knew the stench of death the troops lined the bodies up six of them duty beckoned it could not be avoided he worked the collar of his suit jacket over the handkerchief at his nose gonsalves had a camera up to his eye worked along the line and photographed the dead unmarked all of the corpses were without wound scratch or abrasion he imagined them all cowering at the back of the cave and the blast funnelling in finding and killing them wroughton had the picture from guantanamo and the one of the school group he looked down on them all at peace ragdoll men kind of look harmless dont they like everybodys neighbour would you not say id say juan that you should change your street fuck you your mans not here likely the storm took him and the sand buried him you saw that stuff we flew over now the troops brought down from the cave boxes of blankets books saucepans and plates files a typewriter and filled sacks wroughton said quietly what are you standing in juan what we flew over was just impossible he was hurt bad had been through all kind of shit whod last out there who wasnt a bedouin no one that place is evil no one from outside could live in it he would have to be incredible to survive good riddance im betting he didnt you saw the place a box was carried past wroughton and maybe his body made a point round which the wind blew and a slip of bright laminated cardboard blew out of it and guttered down by wroughtons polished shoes juan you are standing in camel dung not old dung fresh dung have you seen a camels corpse have you seen bits of camel i have not he picked up the cardboard slip he went to the platoon officer broke his deep conversation with the deputy governor showed him the slip and asked his question it was denied was he sure it was certain he went back to gonsalves look at it its a sales tag its for a samsonite case the case is called an executive traveller and thatll be a hardsided case its not been brought out the slip is new not old rubbish the case is nol there im telling you juan that a man came by camel and the camel crapped and the camels gone and a suitcase is gone and caleb hunt is not here gonsalves was using a chip stone to scrape the dung out of his trainers treads as i see it juan the situations gone beyond our reach already a suitcase is a weapon whats inside a suitcase is what we fight against a suitcase its contents frightens us half to death but when a suitcase is missing its beyond our reach already the future is out of our hands the future is with the alertness of a customs official at the end of a tenhour shift or an immigration girl with a queue stretching fifty paces in front of her or the suspicion of a probationer police officer we depend on them they are our future its in their hands whether the suitcase goes past them whether they stop it whether they wave it through or whether they ask for it to be opened if not that case then another and another thats the damn future and it sort of crushes you when you see it up close they stared at each other each burdened by the enormity of it each searching the future for comfort and not finding it youre leaping making too many conclusions going too fast for me i know i am but i feel them in my gut the bodies in bags were going into the belly of the chinook with the boxes and sacks the deputy governor waved for them as if he was a tour guide and an outing was running late wroughton thought gonsalves was thinking of his kids and whether theyd ever walk past a suitcase set down in the street with an activated fuse running or that he was thinking of everyones kids in bosnia he had met young men handsome and full of friendship who had cleansed by atrocity in latvia he had met old men who had dignity and charm and who leaned on sticks and it was rumoured they had worked in concentration camps in wroughtons expectation caleb hunt would be handsome and dignified friendly and charming he felt as never before a desperate sense of shame because he had once allowed himself in a perversion of jealousy to cheer on the young man who would carry a suitcase he was wearied and thought himself dirtied inadequate do you want to come by tonight eddie have some pizza then throw some softball thank you the desert of the rub al khali seldom offered up its secrets for a millennium only the stupid the brave or the fanatical outsiders and strangers have gone into the wilderness of sand dunes and shallow mountains that cover a quarter of a million square miles of emptiness they walked through the fire of the suns heat unwelcomed and unwanted around them were the bones of lost men and lost beasts and the wreckage of vehicles and aircraft used by those who believed technology offered safety and were wrong only the lucky survived the deserts enmity it was said by the few outsiders and strangers who had known luck and who had come through the fire that the rub al khali had scarred them for the rest of their lives they were changed men they had no need of possessions or of any ideology no need of friends or of money no need of love or of belonging like the deserts winds the scars stripped everything from them except the determination to exist to take another step forward and another to reach a distant hidden goal but the outsider or the stranger who had the luck to emerge from the sands had proven his
