weight of blood david dalglish the two brothers were almost to the wall when the skulls flew overhead make them stop cried harruq tun hands pressed against his ears beside him qurrah tun stood mesmerized by the sight hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of veldaren like dark comets they shrieked mindless wails from gaping mouths voices cold and resonant a few soldiers fired arrows but most hid behind their shields why do you cower qurrah asked striking his brother on the shoulder the skulls are nuisances nothing more sorry said harruq he shivered as a skull dipped down above them its shriek turning to chaotic laughter the sound ran up and down his spine triggering fear no matter how irrational qurrah watched as if immune to their sound he was so much smaller than harruq his slender body wrapped in rags flesh thin meat clinging to bone yet he was unafraid shame and embarrassment burned in harruqs cheeks he towered over his brother his hands beefy and arms muscular nothing should scare him he was supposed to be qurrahs protector not the other way around where can we climb up harruq asked hoping to get his mind off the skulls there qurrah pointed a narrow set of stairs climbed to the parapet and harruq led the way the city gates were lost in the distance city guards clustered about them look harruq said orcs he spoke the word with an odd reverence but they both understood unlike the humans the two brothers skin was dark and tinged with gray their ears long and curled to a point they were halforcs tainted blood and condemned for it the people of veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before now well finally see qurrah said what we are what we are meant to be thousands of orcs spilled into the west needing no light to see in the darkness they howled and cheered drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls harruq felt his temples throb a wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about spotting the two and eying them like prey try as he might he couldnt stop from shaking can you stop them harruq asked squinting at the sky perhaps said qurrah eyes distant and unfocused but orcs dont use necromancy not if the stories ive heard are true someone else travels with them someone who could be strong when it comes to this mind stuff no ones stronger than you qurrah chuckled well see he closed his eyes letting his mind sink into the ether like scent to a bloodhound qurrah could sense the magic flowing all about him the flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver when qurrah looked up he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army taking in a deep breath qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it there was a pull on his chest the taste of copper on his tongue when he opened his eyes the skull fell to the battlements the jaw snapped and rotting teeth clattered to the streets below you did it harruq picked up the skull frowning at its ordinariness with a shrug he flung it toward the distant army of orcs not done yet said qurrah sweat lining his face his breathing soft and ragged therere so many somany he closed his eyes this time he didnt grab just one thread he grabbed them all they screeched and twisted in his grip his head pounded and the pull on his chest was so great he felt he might pitch over the wall to his death qurrahs well of magic drained at frightening speed he almost let go but he thought of his brother shaking under the spell of the skulls no he thought enough cease your chatter he clutched tighter the threads braiding into a giant rope in his mind high above the skulls quieted their fires dimmed and then the necromancer noticed qurrahs meddling the rope pulled taut and pulsed with incredible energy colors swarmed through his mind dark purples and reds across a canvas of black he felt his chest tightening his neck constricting a scrying eye was upon him now and he was losing it felt like an arrow pierced his mind and through it words seeped into his head run die collapse fear failure an apparition swirled before him blacker than the shadows red eyes smoldering it touched his face with rank claws turning the sweat of his brow to ice the arrow squirmed deeper qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it desperately seeking to repulse it his well of energy which hed thought empty burgeoned and overflowed the arrow snapped banishing the necromancers presence but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of qurrahs mind curiosity qurrah opened his eyes he lay on his back in his brothers arms yet he didnt remember falling youre alright harruq hugged him qurrah laughed he lost he said pointing to the night sky and he doesnt know how badly one by one the skulls fire went out and they fell like morbid hia upon the city limitless qurrah said his smile trembling blood ran from his nose and his skin was so pale harruq could see his veins the well is limitless his eyes rolled into his head without another word he collapsed he dreamt of fire poured into flesh and a man whose eyes were glass q urrah harruq shouted when his brother finally opened his eyes how long qurrah asked as he pushed himself to a stand not long harruq said holding qurrahs shoulder to steady him the orcs are almost here as if on cue they heard a collective roar from the south harruq glanced at the stairs back up the wall but qurrah saw this and shook his head we need to get closer to the fight qurrah said his words slurred i need to see him sure thing harruq said come on i have an idea he grabbed qurrahs arm and hooked his elbow around it qurrah was too weak to complain so together they ran down the streets they passed closed homes filled with people praying for safety and victory looming ahead of them was the southern gate hundreds of soldiers stacked against it their shields braced and ready all along the walls archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness how are we to get closer qurrah asked ignore them harruq said i know what im doing he led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone he stopped just before the next set of homes for he heard talking holding qurrah back with his arm he peered around the corner a soldier dressed in finely polished armor stood with his sword raised in salute at first harruq did not see whom he saluted and then the elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier an elf harruq whispered which managed to grab qurrahs attention now both peered around the corner curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war greetings dieredon the soldier said pulling off his helmet he was a middleaged man with long blond hair and numerous scars on his face greetings to you as well guard captain antonil dieredon said taking a step back and kneeling though i fear greetings is all i may offer you antonil pointed to the wall and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar the ekreissar will not aid you dieredon said when the noise died he shook his head and a bit of sadness crossed his face we have been forbidden ceredon insists this is a minor skirmish nothing more we are not the keepers of man minor skirmish antonil shouted what about the necromancer traveling with them youre the one that said he was dangerous that he might be another communal roar even closer i know dieredon said forgive me antonil i will watch and i will pray whoever started this war will not go unpunished the elf whistled and to the brothers surprise a winged horse landed on the rooftop of a nearby home its skin and mane were sparkling white dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air using the ledge of a window to swing himself up to the roof he mounted his horse patted her side and then took off into the night damn it all antonil shouted striking the wall with his mailed fist still shaking his head he stormed back to the gate muttering curses what was that all about harruq asked king vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined qurrah said chuckling the kings pride will not take too kindly to that he and his pride can suck a rotten egg harruq said hurry or well miss the battle he pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall crumbled house leaned near the wall onto my shoulders harruq said grabbing qurrahs knees and hoisting him high qurrah latched onto the roof paused and then stepped onto harruqs shoulders the extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof and flailing momentarily he climbed all the way up harruq clapped for him and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs it was a goofy smile and qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it hurry qurrah said as harruq climbed his way up using a windowsill as a foothold together they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall mesmerized by the sight they saw hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged mere seconds away none carried torches their race could see as well in night as in day that same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the orcs approach their bodies bulged with lean muscle and their pale gray skin glistened with sweat some wore mismatched armor though most had only skulls straps of leather and war paint covering their bodies wave after wave of arrows rained upon them and those that fell were trampled by the rest they were not even slowed harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance carrying no light or torch what are they doing he asked qurrah searched the line and he saw what he suspected the necromancer he said pointing to the black shape covered in robes and a hood with its cowl pulled low those with him are dead harruq they serve only him huh harruq said lot of good hes doing how are the orcs going to get through the wall they have nothing but the man in black robes lifted his hand qurrah saw pale and bony fingers hooked in strange formations then came the fire erupting as if those fingers were a crack releasing the melted rock of the abyss the sudden light blinded them both the fire burned through the orcs as a solid beam melting their bodies and scattering their remains when it struck the wooden gate it exploded wood shattered guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them piercing through their shields and armor the orcs roared at the sight not at all upset at their own losses the way into the city was clear axes and swords held high they rushed the opening a minor skirmish qurrah said echoing the elfs words how amusingly wrong harruq had anticipated watching the fight over the wall from the roof but instead they turned and watched the orcs slam into the human forces that surrounded the opening the first push was brutal screams of pain and shrieks of metal on metal flowed into the city harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier and as the blood from the limb splattered across his face he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks the orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back will they make it through harruq asked in awe of the display qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat archers continued eviscerating the orc forces if they could push into the city their arrows would be a nuisance at best but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers they are running out of time qurrah said but they might he glanced back to the necromancer and then he saw his eyes just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes qurrah shivered as whispers traveled up his spine you silenced my pets it said i do as i wish qurrah whispered back he felt a touch of cold on his fingers like the fleeting kiss of a corpse lover you ally with the city of men again i do as i wish qurrah whispered who are you talking to harruq asked qurrah whats going on nothing qurrah said he tore his gaze back to the fight more orcs had pushed inward so that they bunched in a wide circle they flung themselves against the surrounding guards again he felt a cold chill this time creeping across his arms like frost spiders the sensation of being watched was unbearable we need to move he said if the guards falter we might suffer were already high up harruq said were perfectly safe i said now qurrah shouted he doubled over hacking and coughing his breath was raspy and weak please he insisted take me from the wall alright then harruq said grabbing his brothers arm just hold tight he leapt off the roof pulling qurrah with him as his feet smacked the hard ground he buckled his knees and fell back catching his brother as he did without a word of thanks qurrah stepped off him and leaned against the wall his whole body shuddered he had often looked into the darkness for the first time the darkness had looked back and was amused whoever this necromancer was qurrah knew he had been an idiot to challenge him lead the way qurrah said and forgive my outburst i understand harruq said ignoring the pain in his knees and the bit of blood running from his elbow to his wrist we need to hurry though he looped his arm through qurrahs and then hurried down the alley as a soldiers body collapsed at the end the two stopped and harruq swore the orcs made it through he said to which qurrah nodded this could be bad an orc stepped into the alley blood splashed across his gray skin he held a sword in each hand both coated with gore shouting something in a guttural language neither understood the orc charged get back harruq said as he shoved qurrah to one side he slammed himself against a house barely dodging a downward chop of the blades the orc curled the swords around all his strength behind the swing harruq ducked narrowly avoiding decapitation qurrah lunged before the orc could strike again latching onto his wrist and letting dark magic flow the orc howled feeling as if a hundred scorpions stung his flesh flooded with adrenaline he hurled qurrah aside desperate to break the contact between them qurrahs thin body crumpled in the dirt at the sight of it harruq felt his rage break loose he slammed his fist into the orcs stomach followed by a brutal kick to the groin harruq rammed his elbows into the orcs face baring his teeth in a feral grin as he felt cartilage crunch staggering back the orc dropped one of his swords and clutched his face his sword qurrah shouted loud as he could take it brother harruq obeyed without thought he dropped to his knees grabbed the sword and rolled forward steel smacked where he had been now on his back harruq flung the sword up before him clutching the hilt with both hands the orc smashed his own blade downward and as they connected harruq did not feel fear or the strain of his muscles he felt exhilarated even though the orc pressed with all his strength he could not force the kill at last harruq pushed him back and in the brief opening he spun his sword around and buried half the blade into the orcs gut the orc gasped something unintelligible dropped his other sword and fell limp harruq stared at the body his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears a hand touched his shoulder he recoiled as if struck well done qurrah said his eyes locked on the corpse harruq recognized that look his brother had seen something he wanted and he would have it a strong life and a fresh death the battle harruq asked even as they stood there he watched several orcs go running past howling murder we will partake in our own way qurrah said kneeling beside the orc the savage clutched his stomach his hands the only thing holding in his innards qurrahs thin ashen face curled into a sneer harruq turned away perhaps his brother would think him weak but he would not watch he heard a sudden shriek of pain that morphed into a long drawn out moan as the last of the air left the orcs lungs harruq turned around startled by the sight beauty in all things qurrah said purple light dancing across his face especially those things that are controlled an orb floated above his open palm seemingly made of thick violet smoke within its center a face shifted glaring out with sunken eyes when it opened its mouth no sound came forth just a soft puff of ash a soul seeking release qurrah said how destructive i wonder get rid of it harruq said as he picked up the other sword the orc had dropped you disagree qurrah asked his delight ruined by a sudden frown no harruq said he thought to explain and then just shrugged it makes me uneasy he said instead but do as you wish the frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest his steps faltered only once when harruq moved to catch him qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house when a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit qurrah hurled the orb it exploded in shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples the orc collapsed white smoke rising softly from his tongue in the sudden blinding light qurrah laughed never he said could i have imagined it so beautiful a n hour before dawn the last of the orcs died cornered by the citys soldiers the tun brothers were not there to see for they had snuck back to the outer wall at qurrahs insistence i know his plans qurrah whispered as they stared across the open grass covered with trampled orc bodies pierced with arrows he is familiar to me though i know him not he isnt your former master is he harruq asked as he fiddled with his newly acquired swords he had taken a belt and some sheathes from one of the dead bodies but he was having a devil of a time getting them to fit correctly no qurrah said he is dead i killed him whoever this is he is someone else someone stronger he pointed into the darkness there he said he returns robed in black the figure approached unseen by the guards he lifted his hands which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight so very slowly their color faded from white to gray to nothing a darkness surrounding and hiding them whats going on harruq asked he pulled one of his swords out from its sheath pleased by the feeling of confidence it gave him qurrah said not a word his eyes were far away his lips moved but produced no sound qurrah harruq asked again qurrah he struck his brother on the arm qurrah jolted as if suddenly awaking the dead qurrah said they rise sure enough the arrowridden bodies stirred as if of one mind they stood at once ignoring any injuries upon them some hobbled on broken legs others shambled with twisted and mangled arms the brothers watched as hundreds more lumbered through the stillbroken southern gate a few belated alarms cried out from the exhausted guards but they were too few and too late unencumbered the horde of dead marched out to where the necromancer waited with outstretched arms harruq and qurrah watched until the sun rose in the east and all trace of the necromancer was gone what is it he wanted harruq asked breaking their long silence more dead for his army qurrah said no harruq said with you qurrah nodded knowing he disrespected his brother to think he might not have noticed he wanted my name qurrah said i did not give it i have served a master once i will not do so again harruq frowned but said no more together they climbed down from the wall and returned home h ome to the two halforcs was in the older mostly abandoned southern district of veldaren those with wealth had drifted northeast closer to the castle and away from the busy streets and markets when king vaelor had ordered all trade to come in through the western gate and not the south it had been the final nail in the districts coffin the homeless hungry and destitute flooded the rows of abandoned buildings clawing them away from their legal owners with their very presence and sometimes their murders harruq and qurrah played that game well they had grown up on the streets of veldaren and fought for every scrap of food they had eaten they had punched and kicked for every soft dry bed then one day they finally killed a fine home is any home thats yours harruq said as he forced back a couple planks sealing a window aint that right qurrah whatever you say the window unblocked the two climbed in they lived in what had once been a large shed the door was still boarded shut but the window well for two such as they windows worked as well as doors they sat diagonally of each other so they had room to stretch their legs harruq unhooked his belt and placed his swords in a corner brushing their hilts with his fingertips i want to learn how to use them he said think anyone will teach me qurrah laughed youll find plenty that will teach you how to die to one he said im not sure about the other way around harruq shrugged his mind kept replaying the fight with the orc untrained and unprepared he had still won what could he accomplish with training how many might fear him if he had skill to match his strength and steel to match his anger i know of a way qurrah said pulling at one of many loose strands of his robes a way for you to practice you saw what i did with that dead body harruq nodded disturbed by the hungry look in qurrahs eyes i did he said and it scared the abyss out of me qurrah dismissed this with a wave of his hand with exposure comes understanding fear not what i do i am always in control however i have no way to learn harruq i have no school no teacher nothing but scattered memories of my wretched master when i was nine nevertheless death death has a way of teaching us things i can sense its power so clearly in its presence i need it you must give it to me harruq crossed his arms and stared into the corner people die every day here he said shall i find their bodies and bring them to you for now qurrah said yes if the death is fresh the power should still linger harruq reached out grabbed his brothers wrist and clasped his hands in his i wont like it he said but ill do it for you we are better than them qurrah said standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door stronger life is for those who take it i need you to understand this brother together we can become something great like what harruq asked what can we become qurrahs eyes twinkled but he said not a word g uard captain antonil marched through the street fifty of his men in perfect union behind him his face was a portrait of stoic calm but it was all a lie his heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why he held a proclamation of king vaelor to the entire nation of neldar he had argued as best he could but his words meant little when he asked that someone else deliver the proclamation a frown had crossed the kings smooth face and he had slammed a lotioned hand against a table it will mean more coming from you the king had shouted they will know the seriousness of my order i will not be flooded with spies treated like a mere peasant and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid let them know i am king my dear antonil make sure they know antonil halted at the center of veldaren where the four main roads of the city interconnected and a large marble fountain towered over all not bothering to call for silence or attention he unrolled the scroll and shouted its edict because of his rank the troops in attendance and the overall respect given to the man who had engineered the citys successful defense only days before he was quickly given a respectful silence by order of the king all elves are to be removed from neldar lands they shall not travel within our cities live in our settlements or trade with our people they are banned in all possible sense of the word they have abandoned us so let us abandon them these are the words of your king edwin vaelor and may they never be forgotten antonil closed the scroll and then nodded for his soldiers to return to their post holding in a curse he headed to the royal stables he needed to speak with dieredon and personally break the terrible news q urrah watched with a smirk on his face as the guard captain hurried away elves banned he said to his brother amusing though unnecessary only handfuls live within these walls and they are just diplomats and messengers our king is a spiteful paranoid one not my king harruq muttered loud as he dared he meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain he was large well muscled and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt in a massive voice he shouted to the many that passed by the royal guard is in need of ablebodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city he shouted the work will be hard but we offer a threepence of copper a day come to the castle and ask for alvrik he repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north a threepence harruq said we could eat well for weeks the king must be desperate for workers qurrah said he raised an eyebrow at his brother i take it youre interested im strong enough for whatever they want from me harruq insisted we have no need for money qurrah said we take what we need we always have my day is spent in boredom and you know it harruq said how long will they offer that much coin qurrah popped his neck wincing as he did so be it he said take the workif theyll take you this put a bit of a damper on harruqs enthusiasm course they will he muttered his frown refuting the confidence in his voice why wouldnt they a lvrik harruq muttered as he approached the giant double doors leading into the castle flanked on each side by two soldiers avrik alrik avlerik how the bloody abyss did he say his name he stopped when he realized the soldiers were staring at him with nonetoohappy looks on their faces oh hello he said doing his best to smile i was looking for er alvrik he was just in the center of town and does the orcie want some money one of the guards asked he jabbed the soldier next to him with his elbow and both laughed in harruqs face just want some work he said his deep voice muttering and almost impossible to understand head on around back one told him alvrik will be waiting if hell take you thatd be west said the same rude guard you know which way west is right harruqs hands opened and closed as he imagined his swords held within them ready to butcher for blood while the soldier proceeded to say the word west as long and drawn out as possible thanks he mumbled and hurried off alvrik sat at a small table with a single sheet of parchment beside him sat a young man with an inkwell and a quill several people stood in line before him so harruq slipped into the back and tried to calm down he had never done anything like this before he had stolen food fled from guards lived in poverty and kept to himself he and his brother that was his life what the abyss was he doing asking for work he almost left several men in front of him turned away dejected or angry he didnt hear the reasons why and didnt want to know the idea of so much money more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink kept him there at last it was his turn and he approached the table where alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat you he said before harruq could mutter a word you dont look like all the others im not like the others harruq said that so alvrik face hadnt changed in the slightest tell me why stronger he said tougher whatever work you got two men doing i can do alone whatever hours you got them working i can do double a large boast alvrik said he took the bone out of his mouth and pointed at harruqs ears you got orc blood in you i do will that be a problem alvrik asked up to all the others you hire harruq said but ill be fine i dont start much but i always finish alvrik laughed he nudged the man next to him who grabbed the quill give me your name he asked dabbing the tip into the ink harruq he said harruq tun well harruq alvrik said slowly nodding his head ill see you right here at sunrise tomorrow got that harruq grinned ear to ear even his nervousness unable to lessen his excitement ill be here before the rooster knows it is dawn a sharp pain in his gut dragged harruq from his dreams he lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother the sun is almost up qurrah said kicking him again you need to be as well what are youawww damn it he sat up straight and shook his head trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears qurrah helped by offering a third kick this one right to the kidney harruq gasped and staggered to his feet he was outside their little home in seconds urinating on the grass hadnt pissed yet harruq shouted to his brother you could be a bit kinder you know at least youre awake qurrah said back now get to the castle i may not approve and i still do not trust them but for once we might have something worthwhile to eat i wont let a simple thing like sleep keep us from it months later harruq awoke at the dawn with a jerk upward and a sharp gasp a constant cry of danger rang in his ears a quick survey showed he slept alone in their small shed his brother missing qurrah he dared ask outside came qurrahs muffled reply harruq stretched pushed away a plank of wood from the window and climbed out the sun was only halfway visible the standard noises of the city only beginning leaning against the shed his eyes staring off toward the sunrise waited qurrah what are you doing out here harruq asked did you sense it qurrah asked sense what the smaller halforc shook his head if you must ask then you did not at least not directly though i did hear you startle awake perhaps a fleeting glimpse of it qurrah harruq said crossing his arms and frowning at him what is this about tell me remember the necromancer we witnessed at the siege qurrah asked it is him he has haunted my dreams lately and today he whispered the name of a place i have already researched for my own purposes i think we are being guided though why i dare not pretend to know harruq shifted uncomfortable from both his full bladder and the dark expression on his brothers face whats the place he asked it is where our mother came from qurrah said a town called woodhaven well two towns really celed and singhelm they have since grown together and merged it is an interesting place harruq elves and men live together each in their respective parts of the city their tolerance of other races is obviously a necessity i have thought to take us there why harruq asked hold up first i need to take care of something he vanished around the corner of the shed and then qurrah heard the sound of his brother urinating when harruq returned he had a big grin on his face much better he said so why do we need to leave your work is almost done qurrah said the walls are repaired and half the men who worked with you have already been cut loose i however have much to learn but cannot in this large city with prying eyes and attentive ears i need privacy i need silence what for harruq asked no qurrah said i will not answer a question you already know at this harruq nodded yes he did know over the past few months he had killed seven men and carried their bodies to his brother i still have at least a week harruq said give me until then alright we could use the money i have saved much of what you earned qurrah said we will be able to eat not well but enough to live if you say so harruq said good luck with your uh studies i have a wall to finish building stay safe qurrah said offering a small wave as his brother trudged north when he was gone the smaller halforc slipped back into the shed pulled up a false board and took out a small pouch filled with various herbs bones and knives reaching back in again he took out an object wrapped in sackcloth and soaked in blood a knife in hand he opened the pouch and closed his eyes with his mind attuned he carved into the remains of a mans heart o n his way back home the threepence jingling in his hand harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching he glanced to the right where the small alley led around back to their shed if he hurried he might be able to make it before any noticed he was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out hey harruq kept going he was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards once out of sight though he was usually out of mind he relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed qurrah who had been resting on the shallow grass hurried to his feet at harruqs approach what is the matter he asked nothing but you might want to hide in there quick i will do no such thing qurrah said i said hey shouted the same man harruq stepped in front of qurrah and then turned staring down a group of five heavily armored guards swords and clubs hung from their belts though a fifth carried a weapon neither of them had ever seen before it was a wooden stick with a bulbous gem on one end you stop when asked or we get mean said one of the guards if he can even understand us said another we understand perfectly qurrah said stepping to one side what has my brother done to warrant your attention were on a quest said the man with the strange weapon he had a stubbly beard and a hooked nose with a thick scar along the top a great quest from the king you could say were to rid scum from the city elven scum you know what i think i think elves can look like anything theyre devious little pricks like that you two seem rather ugly and devious dont you all agree the other guards laughed and shouted in agreement they had spread out flanking them on all sides the leader stepped forward and gestured with his weapon you know what this is this detects elves and every elf i find i get to politely escort out of the city oh and their possessions well obviously they were stolen that coin you got there you might as well hand it over before i take it qurrah glared while harruq clutched the coins tighter and fought down his anger he glanced back to the shed cursing his idiocy for not retrieving his weapons while he had the chance the coin said a guard to their right hand it over no harruq said the leader rammed his fist into the halforcs face harruq staggered but held his ground blood ran down his face and he spat some away from his mouth he waited for another punch but one was not coming the man was staring at the weapon he held with a look of total disbelief as he had stepped closer to punch the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green of all the dumb luck he said a grin spreading across his face we got some real elves here they drew their swords harruq held an arm defensively in front of qurrah his eyes darting in all directions slowly the leader extended the stick poking it against harruqs chest the soft glow turned into a brilliant flare of emerald elves the man said no doubt about it he laughed to the others and then punched harruq in the gut as the halforc doubled over the guard grabbed his hair and tugged got to be a disguise he said another guard struck harruqs back with the hilt of his sword the blow blasted the air out of his lungs the leader of the guards tugged all along harruqs face pulling hair and scratching skin ill be he said it is real no illusion and no disguise you two cretins have goddamned elf blood in you you jest qurrah said hanging back and showing no sign of aggression the soldiers clearly thought harruq the more dangerous of the two and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that no jest the guard said you two are leaving this city now my things harruq said his voice coming out as a weak croak i dont see anything said the guard scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins harruq had dropped in the shed qurrah said that where you two live yes fine the leader said go and get whatever the abyss you can carry harruq climbed into the shed throwing qurrah a worried look before he did when he came out holding his sheathed swords to his chest the guards tensed readying their weapons drop those right now they ordered him harruq clutched them tight and the look on his face was clear he would fight and die before he gave them up the lead guard already having their coin as well as the bonus of having found elves in hiding was willing to let it slide you draw them even fiddle with them in their sheaths you die that clear he told the halforc harruq nodded again saying nothing calm yourself qurrah whispered as the two marched in front of the guards back toward the main streets trying harruq whispered back at sword point they marched onlookers cackled as they passed figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling their orcish features lent them no kindness and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away the whole while harruq burned with shame and rage they reached the western gate which remained open during the day without ceremony they were kicked through both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees get going one said see if somewhere else will take your mutt ass it was not just adrenaline that caused harruqs hands to shake but qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm never forget this shame he said let it burn in you let it be a reminder of what i have always said we are better superior never feel guilt at what we do to them for you see what they would do to us harruq stood brushed some dirt from his pants and then offered qurrah a hand together they trudged west without food water or blankets the guards watched them go smirking all the while t hat night harruq collected a bunch of sticks and twigs qurrah lit them with a clap of his hands the two huddled over the fire each lost in their thoughts harruq first broke the silence so where will we go he asked where else is there qurrah said we go to woodhaven perhaps this was meant to be the journey will not be long perhaps a week or two at most there are enough animals about for me to kill so do not worry about food as for water there are many small streams and we can beg from the occasional farms we pass we were to leave anyway now we do so sooner sooner harruq said we paraded through the city like criminals and tossed out with swords at our backs if we were to leave so be it but i want to leave on our own terms not like that he swore a few times getting progressively more colorful as he went two minutes alone with that guard he muttered id have him drinking through a brand new hole in his neck how skilled are you with those qurrah asked gesturing to the swords that lay in the grass next to harruq even though they lived in such cramped quarters qurrah still knew very little of harruqs life other than what he did at his request ive watched the guards training new men harruq said drawing a blade and holding it with one hand and ive been practicing every night after youre in bed and no one is around to watch and get curious near the castle they have these stumps for smacking with your sword not sure what for but it helps them and it seemed to help me i snuck over there plenty of times no one guards a big beaten log but you are yet to face men in combat qurrah said do not be overzealous about your skills confidant perhaps but not foolish dont die on me brother for i need you more than ever yeah i know harruq said growing quiet the subject of qurrahs experiments always made him uneasy this time there will be a slight difference qurrah said whats that the halforc shook his head not now another time i will explain the two grew quiet and they stared at the fire as the time passed at last when harruq was sure qurrah would not bring up the subject he spoke up about the guards he said you think theyre telling the truth qurrah glanced up about the elven blood in us yeah qurrah chuckled but it was mirthless i do and it does not surprise me as much as it should im not sure who would mate with our mother but some elf man did we are smarter than most realize you know that our features are sharper and we only resemble the orcs that attacked veldaren it is a part of us unwanted perhaps but i shall not cower and hide a part of who i am just strange is all harruq said life is strange they both lay down to rest and two weeks later they arrived at woodhaven and took up residence there in silence harruq tun stared at the body seven he guessed no older than seven he didnt know the boys name he didnt know why he had wandered into the forest the bloodied body lay sprawled across the knotted roots of a tree its innards spilled out a massive gash from shoulder to waist the eyes remained open their young innocence spoiled by a lingering look of horror youre an orc arent you harruq snarled and shook his head he shouldnt have spoken to him shouldnt have let him ask questions the last of his adrenaline faded as images of the childs quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision half harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass only half the kill had been quick just a single cut through the shoulder blade the heart and then lung no suffering little pain it was all he could offer hes dead qurrah the halforc shouted his deep voice like a bears growl seemed right at home in the forest come on over qurrah approached through the trees clutching a worn bag in his long fingers his brown eyes glanced over the dead boy he nodded in approval well done qurrah said killing kids is hardly worth a well done qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother who sat against a tree arms on his knees take pride in all you do qurrah said only then will you improve harruq shrugged you need me the smaller halforc opened the bag he carried inside were ashes roots herbs and a sharpened knife all qurrah needed to work his art no you may go harruq stood glanced at the body and then left w hat are they looking at harruq asked as the two brothers walked down the winding streets of woodhaven let us see said qurrah harruq muscled his way past two men his brother following in his wake they found a proclamation nailed to a post whats it say harruq asked all children are to be kept outside the boundary of the forest qurrah said his eyes narrowing six have been killed by the qurrah laughed a hideous sound by the what harruq asked the forest butcher said an aged woman next to him her voice creaking as if she had tiny pebbles lodged in her throat she glanced back to the worn brown paper hope they find him been a long time since we had an execution but whoever that sick bastard is deserves a lengthy one such hatred in a meager body qurrah said and his smile earned him a sneer come on qurrah im getting hungry harruq said as he trudged off his hands at his sides grabbing the air where his swords no longer were t he two brothers lived in the poorest part of town sheltered in an old building long abandoned when they had first arrived several homeless men claimed it as their own harruq had slit their throats when they slept and then qurrah worked his art the few vagabonds left in the city quickly learned to avoid the worn building with holes in its roof and long shadows that lingered no matter where the sun shone harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air nothing like home eh he said move before the meat spoils qurrah said the big halforc stepped out of the way qurrah came through a slab of meat in his hands he weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape since when has meat being spoiled stopped me from eating it harruq asked qurrah laughed which explains so much really he said murmuring a few words he smashed his hands together fire burst to life in the center of the stones harruq grabbed a small pot and took it to the fire but qurrah stopped him there is no need he said how come harruq asked qurrah narrowed his eyes and stared at the meat in his hands i have something i wish to try the bigger halforc stepped back willing to watch his brother work while harruq was skilled in swords and had all the muscle qurrah possessed far more interesting talents qurrah mumbled words sick and spidery the bones in the slab of meat snapped erect as if pulled by invisible strings he kept whispering his eyes wide the meat floated from his hands and then lowered into the fire qurrah twirled his finger and as if on a spit the slab turned were eating fancy tonight harruq said tossing the pot back to its corner his stomach growled as the aroma of cooked meat filled his nostrils glad you approve qurrah said they ate in silence they stripped their meal to bone which qurrah then tucked away in a pouch harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire things are more dangerous now arent they harruq asked after a pause qurrah nodded his thoughts distant theyre ready for us many elves will be lurking inside the woods hunting for the forest butcher again qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned will we stop for awhile harruq asked the smaller halforc shook his head of course not i must continue learning i must grow stronger we will resume just this time amid the darkness harruq nodded obviously uneasy hey brother yes harruq are you sure what were doing isnt wrong he twiddled his fingers suddenly embarrassed i mean theyre children qurrah sighed he had sensed apprehension in his brother before especially when it came to the children such nuisances needed to be eradicated if given a choice qurrah asked would you split a seed or burn a flower let the children end before they learn the torment and anguish of their parents besides kill a child and the mother has one less mouth to feed kill the mother or father and all the children suffer and starve the larger halforc shrugged he was not convinced but that mattered little he would trust his wiser brother he always had qurrah let his eyes drift back to the fire tomorrow night bring me a body dont let yourself be caught a lengthy execution does not suit my immediate plans sure harruq said whatever you want they slept in their pile of hay and cloth harruq did not wake until late morning but qurrah slept far less the dream had come again w oodhaven burned behind him billowing smoke the sun was gone and no stars penetrated the blanket of rainless clouds that loomed above far away a wolf howled come to me said a voice qurrah looked to the distance he could see a man cloaked in black standing upon a hill red eyes burned in the middle of his hood the feeling of absolute power then was greater than qurrah had ever felt greater than even the master of his youth why should i follow qurrah heard himself ask with hands stretched to the heavens the cloaked man laughed his power rolled with the laughter obliterating qurrahs ability to stand because i am eternal said the figure i sire war i sow bloodshed i create my dead and the dead follow what must i do qurrah asked you know the words as the dream began to shatter the words did indeed come to his mind he could have everything he desired and to obtain it he must give all he had my life for you those were the words t he following night harruq slipped out into the street lamps were lit here and there casting shadows across the road harruq stayed far from celed the elven side of town they never cared for their children instead sending all their young to nellassar deep in the heart of the erze forest it was the human children especially the poor and the destitute that harruq sought of course none would be out playing not with so many dead and missing he would need to take different measures not far from their home a ratty building operated throughout the night it was maggies place half tavern and half orphanage maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars the tavern filled the first floor the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent taking up the second harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up a window perfect as he searched for a way to climb up he saw a drunken man watching him get lost harruq growled the man obliged taking his bottle of ale and running that taken care of the halforc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates he lifted one testing its strength it appeared solid enough satisfied he went back around and placed it against the wall he was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley move and youll find an arrow in your throat said a voice pincushion him anyway said another harruq held a hand before his eyes cursing his awful luck he saw two figures night patrolmen and both human one had a readied bow aimed at his neck i havent done anything wrong harruq said sure you havent one of the patrolmen said then whats with the crate the halforcs mind flailed for a reason um well i needed to piss so i came out here so you needed that to go behind asked the other harruq nodded bullshit put your hands up i see those sword hilts harruq mumbled another curse his pulse racing it wouldnt take long to down the closer soldier provided the archer wasnt too good a shot even then that risked at least two arrows sticking in his flesh unsure of what to do he played dumb and let the first soldier approach careful hes a biggie the bowman said nothing i cant handle said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into harruqs face rage surged through the halforcs veins his orcish side screaming for blood he fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine harruq fell to his knees choking down a furious roar goes down easy i say the guard said to the bowman how much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids how much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isnt the other asked both guards laughed and the sickness in harruqs gut grew a boot kicked his stomach and he knew his patience was near its end visions of ripping out entrails filled his mind and all his willpower kept him crouched there another foot smashed his face so he covered it with his hands a sword hilt quickly found his exposed chest rolling over only shifted the next few blows to his back when the heel of a boot crushed down on his kidney harruq felt ready to slaughter no longer caring if he was caught or killed he would make them both pay the tip of a sword pressed against the side of his neck drawing blood from the tiniest of pressure he looks mad said the guard died fighting us dont that sound right every muscle in harruqs body tensed knowing his moment to act would need to be perfect before he could a feminine voice shouted down the alley startling all three both of you stop that this instant through blurred vision harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley the patrolmen also turned to look their weapons still in hand who the abyss oh go on back to your forest aurelia nothing here to see the woman pointed to the bleeding halforc i see plenty just cleaning up some filth the bowman shifted his bow onto his shoulder now move along i dont see any filth some blood and dirt maybe but no filth harruq closed his eyes and listened as he tried to slow his pulse he had no clue who this aurelia was but if she wanted to intervene he was glad to let her this does not concern you elf said one of the guards harruq coughed at this the woman saving him was an elf had the world turned upside down oh really aurelia said how sad we said go now go or else or else what the sword point left harruqs neck and he assumed the guard made a threatening gesture the next few seconds were a confusing lot sounds of surprised yells and sizzling fire filled the alleyway the halforc brought his head back up gasping at what he saw one of the night patrol stood knee deep in dried mud the other was hanging upside down from a flaming whip that failed to burn him get on up orc aurelia said or halforc whatever you are i can only keep them like this for a little while both men glared at harruq as he stood but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound the halforc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen i said move along she said i need to give these men a talking to im going harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley he did not attempt either stealth or silence seething he limped back to qurrah and their home neither said a word as he discarded his armor tossed his swords into a corner and crashed down onto their bed of straw for a long moment only the sound of harruqs heavy breathing filled the room i assume things didnt go well qurrah finally asked harruq didnt bother to answer t he swarming sensation of power enveloped him beneath angry clouds the man with red eyes beckoned i am waiting he said all the power of dezrel is waiting what must i do qurrah asked as he crept up the hill toward the dark man as if approaching a god you know the words can i trust you the red eyes flared in laughter can you trust anyone qurrah crawled faster knowing the dream was ending but it couldnt end he had to know he had to decide say them say them and live my life for you qurrah shouted as the world crystallized a red line slashed across his mind and as the dream shattered into shards the words of the dark man ripped through him then come reap the rewards q urrah lurched awake gasping for air his throat ached and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea the night was still deep and the town quiet beside him harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men far away a wolf howl beckoned sleep well qurrah said he vanished into the night not long after his departure harruq stirred he saw the empty bed where his brother should have been for a long while he stared at the door contemplating when he lay back down his sleep was fitful q urrahs doubt faded with each step all was as his dreams a mile from town he saw the hill a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way waiting there was the dark man his red eyes shining down on him as he approached say the words the man in the black robe ordered his voice was quiet but deep a mixture of hate and malice compressed into audible form how can i make such a promise to one whose name i dont know qurrah asked in answer the man in black stood his eyes flared his arms spread wide all his power rolled forth and on trembling knees the halforc looked upon a man more ancient than the forests more powerful than the fury of nature and more death than life my life for you he gasped as a fresh wave of terror crawled over him i would have it no other way the man in black said now tell me your name i am qurrah tun and i am velixar rise qurrah and join me by the fire ever since i felt your presence back at veldaren i have yearned to speak with you the halforc took his seat opposite the man he stared at velixar hardly believing what he saw his face was smooth his lips small and his sunken eyes glowing a deep crimson his features however kept changing every time qurrah blinked the mans face reassembled in some minutely different way no matter how much the high or low his nose or how wide or narrow his forehead those burning eyes remained what are you qurrah asked velixar laughed how much do you know of the gods of this world qurrah tun qurrah shrugged i know their names and little else karak is death ashhur is life and celestia everything else if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed velixar nodded the fire in his eyes growing this world is young qurrah and karak and ashhur are young gods only five hundred years ago they came and gave life to man those eyes twinkled i was one of the first they made the halforc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire how is that possible he asked a soft wind blew making the fire dance and in the flickering flames velixar smiled i was the favorite of karak my dear orcish friend he gave me life when other men would have long turned to dust when he was defeated and his servants cast into the abyss i alone escaped punishment i am not orcish qurrah said harsher than he meant velixar raised his hand in a small gesture of apology orcish blood is in your veins but perhaps i am mistaken what are you then i am a halforc qurrah said his shoulders hunched and his head lowered as a reluctant bit of shame stung his words the blood of both elves and orcs fills my veins he expected to be scoffed mocked or banished instead velixar laughed such blasphemy against the elven goddess he said appropriate so appropriate you have sworn your life to me halforc you should learn what you stand to gain the cloaked man reached across the fire his fingers brushed qurrahs pale face sudden awful pain pierced his skull visions flowed through those fingers dominant and brutal qurrah marched through a burning city commanding a legion of walking dead screams of men and women sang a constant chorus and in the distance a castle crumbled to stone and dust a demonic chant filled his ears two words repeated again and again it was a warcry against all life for qurrah for qurrah as the vision faded one last sight burned into qurrahs mind it was he dressed in deep robes of black his eyes glowing a bloody crimson t hat was veldaren qurrah said as velixars fingers pulled back he felt awe and fear at the sight of the magnificent city ablaze i want all of neldar to burn velixar said his deep voice rumbling will you aid me i was banished for my blood qurrah said king vaelor cowers at the very thought of an elf i will punish his ignorance tomorrow night come to me velixar said i have much to discuss and you have much to learn qurrah stood and bowed before his new master i will be here he said and i will be ready go velixar waved his hand and qurrah obeyed harruq was still snoring when qurrah returned to bed if he had not been so preoccupied he would have noticed the slight irregularity of the snoring and the exaggerated movements of his brothers chest h arruq slipped outside while qurrah slept deep into the morning most of his bruises had already faded hidden beneath the gray hue of his skin he drew many glances however and he did his best to ignore them the people of woodhaven accepted him but they still viewed his blood in bad regard elves and humans held little love for the orcish kind and had ever since their creation that distaste suited harruq just fine deep down harruq felt he deserved their ire he stopped by maggies place not bothering to go inside it was early morning and any already drinking would hardly be useful instead he stopped the first random passerby that in his estimation appeared to be a kindly person do you know of a woman named aurelia he asked butchering the pronunciation the passerby an elderly woman sneered at him have fun finding that forest slut she said before walking on harruq shrugged deciding his ability to pick kindly people wasnt very impressive he tried again this time with a tired man trudging down the street never heard of her the man said a few more unsuccessful tries sent harruq away from singhelm and further into celed there the reception toward him took a significant turn for the worse many refused to meet his eye or acknowledge his question the halforcs frustration grew thats it he muttered to himself just one more and im going home to the abyss with all this an elf approached he had long brown hair walnut eyes and a wicked bow slung on his back the hardened look on his face gave harruq little hope do you know of a woman named aurelia he asked anyway aurelia the elf asked why in all of dezrel would you be looking for her she um i kind of the halforc faltered i owe her a favor the elf smiled as if trying to appear amused but it seemed a false smile you are looking in the wrong place he said search the woods just outside town call her name a couple times shell hear you thank you harruq said grateful even though his insides churned he had faced many men in battle yet here he was his heart skipping beats at the thought of meeting this mysterious aurelia what was wrong with him you are welcome halforc the elf said before moving on the bow still hung comfortably on his back harruq watched him go staring longer than he felt he should he couldnt shake the feeling that he was being led into a trap so be it he said he would not be afraid he could beat any elf in battle grumbling he stormed off into the forest a urelia no answer aurelia its me from last night can you hear me only the calm scattered sounds of the forest returned his call damn elf harruq grumbled crossing his arms and looking all about shes probably not here he just sent me out here to look stupid yelling at trees and what elf would that be asked a familiar voice from behind harruq whirled his heart jumping as aurelia stepped out from behind a tree to his eyes she was even more beautiful in the streaming daylight long auburn hair fell down past her shoulders curled and tied with several thin braids her face and eyes were small the curve of her bones soft and elegant she had small lips locked into a frown as she stood crossarmed as if waiting on him her ears were tiny even for her race and ended in an upturned point she wore a long green dress tied with a golden sash well who sent you here she asked was it some mean man trying to toy with you im sorry harruq said before resuming his slackjawed staring aurelia uncrossed her arms those same soft features turning remarkably fierce as she glared at him stop that if you dont shut your mouth im turning you into a toad he shut his mouth so why are you here she asked i was just um i never got a chance to thank you harruq felt his face flush this was the most awful thing he had ever done hed prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat hed have better odds surviving too based on aurelias cold steeled look you came all the way out here to thank me hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do one would not have thought gray skin could turn so red but it did well i still want to repay you harruq held out a small bag filled with copper coins its all i have please take it aurelia glanced at the bag no she said but why the elf shook her head your swords where are they harruq glanced down at his waist theyre at my home he said are you any good with them the halforc shrugged better than most so yeah the elf looked him up and down sending chills roaring up his spine it seemed so strange that she had saved his life for at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead come tomorrow with swords to spar with she said at last tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear you can train me to wield my staff in melee combat i dont see a staff harruq said i dont see any swords either she shot back fine when tomorrow aurelia said early morning harruq nodded his whole body fidgeting now he had found her he wanted nothing more than to escape he was supposed to thank her and go not be mocked and ordered around go on home aurelia said ill be waiting for you he did as commanded and that fact disturbed him greatly qurrah was awake when he returned where have you been he asked i went out to train harruq said without them qurrah pointed to harruqs swords stacked in the corner the larger halforc shrugged didnt need them harruq went to the other side of the house and started punching holes in the walls qurrah might have inquired further but he was lost in his own secret the day passed both brothers eager for night to come t he air was cold a sudden chill from the north chasing away the heat of the day qurrah wrapped himself best he could as he climbed the hill he could see the small fire and beside it velixar bathed in its red glow the fledgling necromancer took his seat across from the man in black are you ready to listen velixar asked qurrah nodded good the story of this worlds gods is not lengthy nor complicated but it is a story that you must learn celestia created the rock the grass and the water her hand formed the wildlife and to tend her creation she created elves the goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort then the brother gods came ashhur of justice karak of order there are many worlds beyond our own qurrah i have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams karak and ashhur came from one of those worlds and celestia welcomed them to them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills these brother gods did not make their own creation instead they made man much the same as man existed in their former world they wanted to make a paradise one of justice and order the world they came from was full of chaos death and murder this world this land of dezrel would be different both men shared a soft laugh velixars far bitterer than qurrahs what caused their failure qurrah asked karak and ashhur spoiled their creations crops grew bountiful and healthy a single prayer cured all sickness and disease mankind spread across the land with remarkable speed forming two kingdoms east of the rigon river was neldar ruled by karak to the west was mordan governed by ashhur however there was a delta at the end of the river controlled by none within were a few small villages with no government no ruler karak brought his troops to establish order ashhur was quick to defend it and in turn claim it his own you speak of centuries ago qurrah interrupted yet you claim to be one of karaks first i was his high priest halforc velixar said his eyes narrowing he blessed me so i would never die of sickness age or blade i have watched the world shape and i have watched gods make war do not accuse me of a lying tongue the truth is always enough even for those who walk in the darkness forgive me master qurrah said bowing his teeth chattered in the cold velixar waved a hand the dwindling fire between them flared back to a healthy blaze the two brothers were arrogant to think they could create a paradise with a creature so full of faults as man velixar continued i saw the fight waged in the small town of haven there in the center of the delta it is an awesome thing to watch gods battle ashhur fled before either could strike a killing blow i summoned our armies as did the priests of ashhur think now of the many deformed creatures that walk this world know that they were all mere animals before the gods turned them into soldiers for their war the elves were vicious in this time slaying any that dared come near their forests but some elves did side with karak determined to help end the war so the world could heal did celestia not interfere qurrah asked in the darkness qurrah watched as velixars face curled into a deep snarl celestia befriended both brothers but she took ashhur to be her lover she begged each to stop neither listened it was a dark time qurrah all squabbles and wars since are a pittance compared ashhurs great city of mordeina nearly toppled to my hand but then the priests of ashhur brought the dead to life to fight against us yes qurrah it was the priests of ashhur not karak who first created the undead we were beaten back forced into veldaren with little hope to survive the man in black pulled back his hood to reveal a long scar it ran from his left ear across his throat and then down past the neck of his robe i died in that battle celestia had begged ashhur to make peace he should have listened the two gods fought once more as i remained a rotting body the fire between the two suddenly roared with life its flames danced high in the air far above their heads within qurrah saw images dancing they were scattered and random without time or order he saw a small town strewn with corpses he saw massive armies of undead marching across the plains to battle a horde of hyenamen he saw the walls of a great city smashed to pieces as men climbed over swords high and armor shining and then he saw karak and ashhur cross blades he tore his eyes from the fire unable to withstand the strength of the image the fire shrank back to a small blaze most men cowered at the sight of it velixar said do not be ashamed there might have been a victor but celestia interfered at last she cast each god far beyond the sky to where she herself had made a home she gave half to ashhur and half to karak the souls of the soldiers that fought and died alongside them were given to their masters she cursed the elves that sided with karak branding them the orcish or betrayers in her tongue with the brother gods locked away from the world and each other celestia issued her final decree what was it asked qurrah after velixar remained quiet for a moment she ordered that ashhur and karak continue the fight they refused to end for all eternity many centuries have passed qurrah i am the hilt of karaks sword i was his greatest priest in the war against ashhur and i have not relinquished my position the mans eyes grew so bright that the halforc felt the urge to grovel ashhur himself killed me karak brought me back he cursed those who had failed him changing his realm into the abyss i was the only one he spared and he gave me life with all of his dwindling power the two sat in silence as the fire crackled between them qurrah dwelt on all he had heard trying to decide what he believed strange as it seemed to him he believed every word so what the priests say qurrah asked of how karak is the god of death and darkness is it true velixars eyes narrowed and that vicious snarl returned there were good men and evil men in his abyss after the war the punishment was not to be eternal not then but celestia chose ashhur over my master qurrah watched as velixars hands clenched so tight his nails dug deep into his skin flesh tore but no blood surfaced she took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to ashhur left with nothing but thieves and murderers karak had no choice but to make it eternal the abyss is dark qurrah and there is fire but there is also order what do you wish of me qurrah asked velixars face softened into a dark smile to fight the war celestia may have condemned it to continue forever but she slumbers now with enough power we can defeat the goddess we can bring all of dezrel under our control and declare victory for karak qurrah stood his eyes glimmering with anticipation where will we strike first woodhaven is a symbol of cooperation between races that must be ended we will burn veldaren to ash thereafter once all of neldar is in chaos we may proceed however we wish will we strike the elves qurrah asked why do you ask the halforc laughed mother was an orc who had lived here in woodhaven i do not know her name other than what she instructed my brother and i to call her mama tun our father was from woodhaven she told us we later found out he was an elf bizarre as it seems it is an interesting elf who would mate with an orc velixar said no true elf would qurrah said this means he was weak to have done so his weakness has seeped into my blood you hold no weakness the man in black said the blood of orcs and elves is more similar than either race would care to admit what happened to your mother i dont know i was sold he said his face visibly darkening to whom i was never given his name qurrah said his voice already soft and quiet grew even quieter he was master that was all that mattered tell me of your time with master velixar ordered there is little to tell qurrah said i was his slave i cleaned up after him while he fed me scraps of his failed experiments i slept in a cage one time he caught me practicing words of magic as punishment he shoved a hot poker down my throat ruining my voice into what you hear now one night tribes of hyenamen stormed his tower wanting vengeance for the many of their kind he had taken to butcher and maim qurrah kept his eyes low unable to meet velixars gaze i was afraid when they came but as i watched master slaughter hundreds of them with his golems and his shields of bone i felt at home amid the carnage i knew then what i was to become how did you escape velixar asked master exhausted himself defending his tower qurrah said waving a dismissive hand he collapsed at the very top i cast a spell upon his throat filling it with ice i watched him die and then i left that disgusting place forever you were a worthy apprentice velixar said especially to learn such a spell on your own your master was blind he was weakened qurrah said even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man how old were you then velixar asked nine qurrah said the man in black shook his head his expression showed there would be no further argument if you had been mine at the age of nine my previous apprentice xelrak held but a shred of your strength qurrah straightened at the name i have heard of xelrak he toppled the citadel velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory indeed it was his finest hour and a significant victory for karak the paladins of ashhur are all but crushed what happened to him his burning eyes held no kindness when the man in black spoke xelrak failed even with all the power i granted him he failed he tried to destroy the council of mages they destroyed him instead velixar gave a greedy look at qurrah he was but a starving boy when i found him i gave him a name and lent him my power it is how i have survived all these centuries i do not risk my own life i give my power to others i am the hilt and my apprentice is the blade but you again that greedy look you are extraordinary i do not have to give you unearned power i must simply guide and instruct velixar stood and when his power flared qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master you are what i have searched for all these years you and i will destroy this world side by side we will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul teach me qurrah said his mouth buried into the dirt give me the power that i have sought for so very long velixar looked down at his thin ragged apprentice rise let us begin velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun qurrah returned home his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted when he climbed into bed he fell asleep instantly not long after harruq rose took his swords and left for his own meeting y oure late aurelia said stepping out from behind a tree harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords had to make something for me to spar you with he said those sticks are unnecessary aurelia said as she took up her staff the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips draw your swords are you sure harruq asked raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored form ill only end up hurting you you wont she said here strike me with your blade the halforcs jaw dropped a little you lost your mind i said hit me orc aurelia shouted harruq snarled and out came his weapons he swung for her face turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her the sword smacked off aurelias cheek as if she were made of stone the clear noise rang throughout the forest what the abyss was that harruq asked aurelia laughed ive cast an enchantment that protects me from your blades harruq looked at his weapons and then shrugged interesting do i get one too in answer aurelia smacked her staff against harruqs shin the halforc roared in pain as he hopped up and down on one foot damn it he shouted what was that for hitting you is my reward for doing well she said consider it my way of making sure you dont go easy on me so are you ready to begin harruq mumbled something obscene he nodded swung in a low chop and as it struck her staff the sparring began aurelia was familiar with her staff the wood comfortable in her grip she weaved it through the air naturally enough she had no sense of tactic though and all it took was a quick feint or two before she left herself horribly open harruq used only one sword running it in slow circles stabs and the occasional feint he enjoyed the steady workout and enjoyed even more watching aurelia move gracefully through the air whenever his eyes lingered too long however hed feel the sharp sting of aurelias staff against his arms or chest when they finished harruq slumped onto his rear and rubbed his bruises i shouldnt be able to hit you aurelia said as she sat across from him her legs tucked underneath her yeah so harruq asked so tomorrow dont let me hit you she said the halforc mumbled and rolled his eyes aurelia leaned back against a tree her eyes studying him her look gave him shivers both good and bad tell me about yourself she said harruq raised an eyebrow your childhood your likes your life for what reason he asked i heard those men i saved you from the gallows i would prefer to know more about the life i spared harruq leaned his head on his fist and stared at the grass growing increasingly uncomfortable i dont know not too much to tell really my brother and i grew up in veldaren and about three months ago the king kicked out all elves believe it or not that included us aurelia halted him with a hand first who is your brother second since when are you elvish the halforc chuckled but still kept his eyes downward our mum was an orc dad was an elf never met dad and mum sold qurrah and me when we both were little i ran away and lived on the streets of veldaren found qurrah about year or two later hiding in the streets after he escaped his master my brother well she watched as harruq struggled through some sort of internal debate his brown eyes finally rose up to meet hers qurrahs like you but not you can cast magic right aurelia nodded well he can too but he hes different when we were kids he found a little mouse it was dead as dead can be he closed his hands around it just like this he clasped his hands around an imaginary mouse and then he whispered some words he learned from secretly watching master master aurelia asked interrupting him again yeah harruq said frowning my brother didnt have too much fun before i found him we were both sold but i escaped qurrah though he was sold to masterforget it thats for another time all that matters is that he learned those words before he met me he whispered something opened his hands and then just like that the mouse got up and started running he brought it to life she asked well again he stopped obviously uneasy about what he wanted to say it was still dead but it was moving now that make sense qurrah could make it do whatever he wanted he let it run off and die that first one he showed me he was pretty embarrassed harruq suddenly stopped and laughed you should have seen us aurelia we spent the rest of the day chasing after mice so we could stomp them and have qurrah bring them back to do tricks aurelia smiled at the burly halforc you really made them do tricks she asked well yeah some jumps and flips we tried to see how high we could make one climb before what she was smiling but when pressed she refused to answer him instead she stood brushed off her dress and flipped her hair over her shoulders same time tomorrow she asked sure harruq said but how many times will we be doing this aurelia shrugged until i feel you have paid me back so what a couple days you know very well i cant obtain any proficiency in such a short time she said harruq shrugged fine then he said how long you want me stuck here with you two weeks she said the elf danced away behind a tree harruq followed but all he caught when he stepped around was a tiny line of blue fading on the afternoon wind well that was interesting he said before returning to woodhaven d eeper into the forest aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal an elf waited there a wicked bow slung across his back so do you think it could be him he asked her perhaps aurelia said i think its in him something is wrong though hes too light hearted too free what does that mean the other elf asked his fingers twitching at the string of his bow i dont know dieredon aurelia sighed it means hes capable but would not do so without reason if hes butchering the children hes doing it for someone else who dieredon asked she shrugged my guess is his brother he sounds like a necromancer dieredon nodded ill find him then and watch him for a bit if either of them slaughters another child i will see it and i will end it aurelia pulled a few strands of hair away from her mouth and tucked them behind her ear this seems like a small matter for a scoutmaster to be involved are you sure you have nothing more important to do murdered human children dieredon shrugged let the humans and orcs do as they wish but when they butcher their young they must be made to suffer you were right to contact me aurelia i hope so aurelia said i saw one of the bodies and what was done to him those vile carvings dieredon kissed her forehead put it behind you so you may focus on the task at hand if the halforcs are guilty they will make a mistake soon enough your eyes and ears are vital in confirming their guilt ill try to keep him talking then aurelia said and ill find out more about his brother i hope i can bear harruqs company in the meanwhile he can be quite a brute sometimes come now dieredon said his face suddenly brightening into a smile he sounds like a real fine man to me i wouldnt be surprised if you two got married perhaps a kid or three little grayskinned aurrys crawling over the forest wouldnt that be cute she smacked him with her staff and then teleported away leaving dieredon to laugh long after her departure w here did you get the bruises qurrah asked when harruq returned to their squalid home practicing harruq said we have anything to eat his brother motioned to a small plate of bacon and some eggs still in their shell wonderful the smaller halforc watched his brother wolf down the meal would you accompany me into madness he asked harruq gave him a funny look half a piece of bacon still hanging in his mouth of course i would he replied if you go mad ive got no chance in this world you brains me brawn right yes qurrah said absently thats right but would you kill without reason without pause could you harruq cracked open an egg and swallowed it raw dont i do so already he asked if i had to pick between the world and you the entire world would be a bloody mess he swallowed the other egg wiped his mouth on his sleeve and burped well put harruq qurrah said d id you practice the spells i taught you velixar asked as qurrah took his seat by the fire yes qurrah said i am more than pleased with them you will need to keep a fresh supply of bones with you velixar said reaching into his pouch take these for now until you can obtain more qurrah accepted the bones stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe a silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled i wonder velixar said gazing in the direction of the howl do you have a brother qurrah shifted his weight a bit why do you ask velixar looked up to the moon and stared as he spoke i have had dreams i see you beside me a strong ally but i see another halforc leading my army he is strong and wields two enormous swords again i ask do you have a brother qurrah pulled out a bone from his pouch and stared at it i do he said you wish for him to aid us he will do more than aid velixar whispered to the moon his power is as great as yours qurrah you two are vessels of flesh unseen in centuries it is as if one of the gods had a hand in your creation qurrah chuckled if any god had a hand in creating us we were forgotten soon after we both have suffered i more than harruq we never had a home or a family by will alone we survived there is nothing special about us not even our blood and that is why you are strong the man in black said with everchanging lips all things are for a reason even those who dwell in the darkness such as i will not deny this truth you were meant for me i will train you and you will aid me in sundering all that brings false stability to this chaotic world for death and power qurrah whispered for karak velixar corrected when can i meet your brother the halforc shrugged and while he seemed calm the man in black did not miss how his eyes still refused to meet his give me time qurrah said let me make sure he is ready is he not open to karak velixar asked he is open qurrah said a bit too vehemently a glare from velixar calmed him before he continued my brother can be a mindless butcher but he must be angered or spurned into battle when peaceful his mind entertains ideas that run contrary to what he and i are and what is that qurrah what are you and your brother the fire sparked a shower of orange into the sky as qurrah spoke superior in the distance elven eyes watched that cough of flame stretch to the stars as well as the sight of those two huddled figures talking long through the night t he first week of training went well for both harruq and aurelia the halforc kept offensive determined not to add a fresh set of bruises to his body aurelia still fell for the feints however slow but her blocks were already quicker and more precise they fought until both collapsed against trees their bodies soaked with sweat youre starting to get the hang of it harruq said after their fifth session dont flatter me aurelia said refastening one of her braids that had come loose youre still going too easy if i move too fast you wont learn anything harruq insisted how do you know she asked do you train elves often the halforc grinned all the time im known for it in fact harruq tun trainer of elves slayer of dragons and man of the ladies please she rolled her eyes not this lady never said you were one elfie aurelia gave harruq a brutal glare and why not he picked at some grass and said nothing well she asked well what he looked up his face blank and his eyes wide as if he hadnt a clue why am i not a lady aurelia asked i dont know harruq said did you cast a spell on yourself or something look like one to me she stood and took up her staff instead of grabbing his swords harruq ducked behind a tree dont hurt me he shouted me be a stoopid halforc that dunno what he saying his face poked around the tree his long brown hair falling down past his eyes much as she tried not to aurelia burst into laughter get over here she said a small silver dagger appeared in her hands harruq eyed it warily whats that for he asked when was the last time you cut your hair aurelia asked the halforc shrugged for some reason embarrassed i dont know i just hack it off with a sword if it ever gets to be a bother been awhile though it shows the elf motioned to the grass before her sit and tell me another of your wonderful stories while i make you look less like an animal harruq grumbled but when she frowned and crossed her arms the normal defiance in him melted away he plopped down and sighed something must be wrong with me he said shut up and start telling me more about yourself huh just do it so the halforc shut up paused shrugged and then began well this ones not a happy one but its the only thing i can think of its about a present qurrah gave me hes a softie at times and this is one of them times aurelia smoothed his hair in her fingers frowned and then sliced off a large chunk with the incredibly sharp dagger brown hair fell in clumps at harruqs feet youre going to leave me some up there right he asked dont make me cut your ears aurelia warned harruq began his story he told her of a gift from his brother a tiny sword qurrah had whittled from bone a bully had stolen it but then qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept the haircut ended with the story dirty hair was strewn over the grass never had much harruq said that bone sword was my only possession still had to hide it because of that bully you know its probably still there buried underneath our home you and your brother had such rough beginnings aurelia said tucking away the dagger very rough harruq shrugged never seemed a big deal to us others were better off a few were worse we did what we had to live just like everybody else he ran a hand through his now shoulderlength hair shaking away loose strands it felt odd having so little hair on his head aurelia sat down on her legs her hands folded upon her dress harruq have you killed before she asked the halforc opened his mouth and then closed it a boys face flashed before his eyes youre an orc arent you yes he said at last ive killed he eyed aurelia desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared tell me of the first time she said he shook his head not today maybe some other session if i feel i can they both stood aurelia stepping away while harruq stretched and popped his back goodbye harruq she said the elf was almost past the trees when he spoke hey aurelia yes harruq she said turning to face him have you ever killed she paused and then ever so slightly nodded the two parted without another word w hat did you learn this time dieredon asked as aurelia arrived at their designated spot in the forest something is wrong she told him hes kindhearted even goofy he takes to his swordcraft with almost perfectionist precision everything else he does is for fun or survival aurelia sighed and rubbed her hands across her face it could all be an act dieredon ventured or just a part of his whole self perhaps you see the elf in him there are multiple sides to all men for only the insane and the dull contain just one facet to their being it could be harruqs orcish side that pushes him to kill the children she nodded at the possibility i will defer to your wisdom the more time i spend with him the more i wonder what about you what have you learned dieredons face darkened his brother worries me i have seen him conversing at night with a strange man strange she asked how so he chuckled it may sound odd but i can see his eyes they burn like fire he dresses himself in the black robes of a priest and i cannot find his tracks come the morning that doesnt happen aurelia if it moves i can track it and i cant find a thing these two brothers are certainly a mystery aurelia said when will you meet this other brother dieredon asked qurrah aurelia shrugged when harruq is ready for us to meet very well i will continue tracking them there have been no murders for the past few days it seems our warnings have worked for now aurelia smiled praise celestia for that may she watch over you dieredon and you as well aurelia thyne he replied c lear your mind velixar said to his apprentice let the emptiness give you comfort the wind blew swirling cold through his ragged clothes velixar watched his apprentice take several deep breaths for this spell to work you must have a significant idea in mind he said make it bleak and vile if you are to darken someones dreams your own mind must be just as dark qurrah breathed out his eyelids fluttering as a memory surfaced in his meditation send the image to me my apprentice let me have the anger the darkness and the despair velixar lurched backward as the memory rammed into his mind qurrah was unpracticed and his delivery brutal still the vision did come clouded and chaotic a gang of children slept on a stack of hay they were filthy scrawny and sick with disease a small rat crept near its mouth covered with flecks of white foam when close enough it latched onto the hand of the biggest child who awoke screaming time distorted so that days passed as that scream lingered his face paled his mouth foamed and then he died screaming still screaming t he vision ended velixar opened his eyes what is it that i saw he asked the second time i ever killed qurrah said i watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat he took something i made for my brother and i made him pay dearly for it the man in black nodded going over the memory in his mind could be darker though he said you need not use memories but they are easier to project any thought can be sent to those who slumber after you have practiced we will try with images you created on your own the halforc pulled his robes around him and looked back to the city when will we assault woodhaven he asked velixars face was an unmoving stone when did i say we would when we first met qurrah said the cooperation between the races needed ending if we are to destroy our home i must know when then velixar did something completely unexpected he laughed it will not be our hands that destroy woodhaven velixar said king vaelor will do so for us starting a war that will give us the dead we need how qurrah asked the fire burned in velixars eyes deep with anticipation i will darken his dreams just as i have shown you he is a cowardly man and fears the elves already i played a large part in his banishing the elves from his city but after i move he will want them gone from all his lands including here the man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest this city has long been treated neutral even though it resides within neldars border the elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear kings grandparents were alive i eagerly await the bloodshed qurrah said he bowed to his master go the night is young taint the dreams of the slumbering qurrah left velixar to sit alone before the fire the dark night sang a song of crickets and wind even in the quiet dieredon entered the light of the fire without alerting the man in black greetings traveler the elf said bowing the town is not far and all are welcome would you not sleep in safety rather than in the wild velixar looked at the elf dressed in camouflaged armor and holding his wicked bow you are a scoutmaster for the quellan elves are you not he asked i am and you have remained outside our village for several days yet vanish with the morning sun have i done something wrong velixar asked dieredon frowned noticing the subtle yet constant changes to the mans facial features his instincts cried out in warning this man was dangerous children have been dying in our forest all found horribly butchered dieredon said as you can plainly see i am nowhere near the forest velixar said his voice was calm disarming dieredon did not buy it give me your name he said earn the privilege velixar countered the elfs arms blurred and then the bow was in his hands he pulled no arrow though for he held the weapon much like one would hold a staff leave this place dieredon ordered as two long blades snapped out of either side of the bow and many spikes punched out the front the man in black rose to his feet an aura of death and despair rolling out from him you should not threaten those who can rip the bones from your body with a thought he said his voice dripping with venom and you should not threaten an elf who can tear out your throat before a single word of a spell may pass through your lips go now as you wish velixar said giving a low mocking bow then he was gone fading away like smoke on a strong wind dieredon sprinted back to woodhaven knowing that the darkness was no longer safe to him o ne sword came from above aiming for her shoulder while the other thrust low the staff twirled batting the thrust to one side aurelia spun the downward strike sliced the air an inch from her arm she continued the turn her staff whirling the swords sliced back trying to block but they were too slow the staff cracked against harruqs forehead he staggered backward his eyes going wide and blank look at all the pretty colors he said very funny aurelia said she smiled that was my first good hit of the day mind if we make it the last im doomed harruq said ignoring her oh the agony what a way to die he collapsed his arms splayed wide and his tongue hanging out of his mouth aurelia giggled never thought a halforc dying could be so adorable his eyes flared wide im not he insisted she slid over beside him her long hair cascading down across his face oh but i think you are she said since youre down here how about i im fine im fine harruq sat up breathing heavily even though the sparring match that day had been relatively casual the elf smirked and trotted away hey aurelia harruq said yes harruq she turned around harruq tapped the hilts of his swords with his fingers and glanced about the clearing iyou still want to hear that story he asked the playful atmosphere vanished into the trees aurelia walked back over and sat on her knees she put a hand on his shoulder he tensed and jerked away then blushed at his reaction sorry harruq stood up his face burning red this is stupid im leaving stay please aurelia said the halforc halted turned and sat back down his face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind alright harruq grumbled no interrupting and no saying a thing i just want to get this over with dont even know why im telling you this because you must she said a bit of her stubbornness returning because i need to know the halforc nodded he began his story the only money i ever made was working for the king harruq said this was after the orcs attacked veldaren about a year ago and busted up the walls they were hiring everybody to help rebuild and i was just as strong then as i am now they werent paying much but you got to remember we were stealing food to live those few coins they gave me were a treasure most didnt mind me working with em i worked hard harder than most and i kept my mouth shut believe it or not only one guy there hated me though and i mean hated perry was his name always calling me names trying to make me lose my balance while lifting and carrying things then he did something stupid aurelia he did that in front of qurrah harruq thrust out his chin and squint his eyes this was how that perry guy looked seen dogs look more human he was strong and i think he was the strongest before i showed up i told him about this contest me and qurrah made up some arm wrestling thing guy was drunk out of his mind so when i told him we could win four gold coins he should have figured something was off we met after work just past sundown and i led him straight to qurrah we lived way down in the south of veldaren not too many out there at night and those who are dont see anything and dont talk about what they dont see qurrah cast a spell on perry then kind of like you did with the guards he shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort then qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid felt like i was holding a stick we took him inside and put him on the floor he wasnt supposed to die harruq said staring right into aurelias eyes so she would know it was no lie we didnt mean to have what happened happen but well qurrah put a bunch of meat on perrys face it was old and stank poor guy still had to keep smelling it though and then qurrah cast his spell the meat started bubbling and turning watery it ran down his face even into his eyes it burned him his skin turned black like it was rotting he called me dogface all the time perry did we were making him just like what he called me a dogface but it went wrong i yelled at qurrah to stop and i think he wanted to but he kept shrieking more of that curse then he harruq rubbed his eyes with his hands and refused to meet aurelias gaze and then qurrah removed the spells that kept him from talking and moving he screamed and screamed and he just he justhe tore off his own face he just reached up and yanked that mess off him he died qurrah fell over too weak to stand never seen him so scared in my life he kept staring at that guys face and blubbering he said he didnt mean to thats all he said over and over he didnt mean to he tried to stop we burned the body and i dont think we ever talked about it since silence filled their clearing as harruqs story ended i asked for the first time you killed aurelia said after an agonizingly long pause i know harruq said and i did i brought perry to qurrah i failed to stop him when i saw something was wrong if there is blame it falls on me the elf stared off into the forest her eyes seeing nothing harruq and qurrahs relationship could not be more clear to her mind qurrah directed qurrah ordered and then harruq bore the guilt and the blame did harruq ever consider disobedience she didnt know we done here the halforc asked yes aurelia said you may go harruq he did t hat night qurrah slept deep for the past week he had slumbered for a few hours and at the end of fitful dreams awakened to meet with velixar this time however he went deeper and deeper into his nightmare mobs of men surrounding him shrieked for vengeance and then suddenly fell lifeless velixar rose amid the bodies i am sorry i must meet you this way my apprentice velixar said what has happened qurrah asked we are being watched and therefore a little precaution is necessary i will send my darkness to you enter it without hesitation red lines pierced the darkness amidst the glowing hue of blood velixar pulsed like a god i shall do as you wish qurrah whispered he fell to one knee i will accept no less the god in black rumbled the nightmare broke like shattered glass and qurrah silently rose from his bed harruq snored as usual the stars were shining bright and through the hole in ceiling he could see their presence leave your home said a whisper on the wind follow the darkness the halforc did as he was told he slipped outside the door and into the cold streets of woodhaven a floating form hung outside softly rotating it was a blob of nothingness purely dark and empty qurrah slipped his hand into it and watched his flesh vanish from view heeding the words from the dream he stepped inside it was cold and his eyes saw nothing an invisible hand grabbed the front of his robe cold and ethereal it yanked him onward at a running pace he ran past the homes through the dark alleys and away from the town his chest burned and his throat throbbed in pain but he continued he would never let weakness prevent him from learning from his master never the blob of darkness suddenly halted the invisible hand leaving his robes wind blew and the darkness dissipated upon it qurrah collapsed to his knees and retched velixar sitting comfortably in the grass watched in silence where are we qurrah asked once he had regained his breath not far from woodhaven velixar said closer to the forest and hidden behind hills so that those in the town may not see us he gestured to where a fire normally would have been burning between them we must sacrifice some comforts eyes have been watching us given time we might have been attacked i do not fear for my life but you are still fragile then teach me more qurrah said still on his knees i am ready indeed you are from now on i shall send my cloud and you will follow inside the man in black glanced at the cold sweat covering the halforc i can slow the pace at which it travels if you would prefer qurrah did not answer only slowly nodded his head very well velixar said reaching a hand into his robe shall we begin he pulled out a small catatonic squirrel it would be the target for their spells i am ready qurrah said throughout the night they practiced throughout the night the halforc became much more dangerous t he final days of sparring with aurelia passed quiet and swift aurelia asked for no stories and harruq told her none they simply enjoyed each others company fought to the extent of their skill and then left on the fourteenth and last day however harruq was in an unusually quiet mood his mind refused to stay on the mock combat and many times a quick jab of aurelias staff cracked his arm or wrist when he should have easily deflected it away finally the elf called it a day she set aside her staff i thank you for sparring with me she told him its nothing he said better to spar with someone than practice alone aurelia smiled youre different than what i expected harruq smarter too harruq blushed no need for lies he said the elf laughed a little but said nothing instead she walked over and gave harruq a quick peck on the cheek keep your big butt safe okay she said the halforc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate somehow it seemed to have become unhinged besides it wasnt as if he could think of anything to say all his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elfs soft lips on his cheek the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm by the time his jaw and mind began working again aurelia was laughing whats so funny he demanded the elf smiled nothing just a big stupid halforc im going to miss byebye she waved and then vanished into the forest for a long time harruq remained he ran a hand through his hair and pondered what in the abyss was wrong with him never get involved with elves he mumbled never ever should have gotten myself screwed up like this but a part of him liked it and that scared him even more h arruq arrived at the clearing the next morning at the same time as always aurelia stepped out from behind a tree her cold emotionless face so different from the previous day we have sparred our two weeks harruq she said you have no need to come here yeah well you heard what i said yesterday harruq said his face red what was that he kicked a rock its better to spar with another remember aurelia frowned you know i am a sorceress my time should be spent studying my craft i only wanted to be proficient with my staff not a master a tiny bit of panic crept into harruqs voice yeah but but its only an hour or two and who said you were proficient anyway i could beat you without trying and so could anyone better than me it would be stupid now to just stop and aurelia crossed the distance between them and placed her hand across his mouth to shut him up a grin lit her entire face okay harruq i will do as you wish and keep meeting with you for sparring he said after she pulled her hand away sure that too harruq blushed but let it go well you ready to go little elfie he said trying act gruff of course aurelia retrieved her staff smiling to herself she was flattered with the offer more so than harruq knew well aurelia said twirling her staff ready for a go oh yeah harruq said drawing his swords youve got no idea but she did and it made her laugh all the more i t is time i met your brother velixar said as the clouds rolled above obscuring the waning moon he had trained with qurrah for almost two months and over that time the halforc had grown greatly in power king vaelors nightmares have never been stronger and he will act upon them soon i am not sure he is ready qurrah said it is difficult enough bringing me here the two of us sneaking out each night might be noticed you will not be noticed velixar said ending the debate bring him let him swear his life to me as you wish my master qurrah said with a bow h ey aurry i got something for you harruq tramped into the clearing his two swords sheathed aurelia waited there her arms crossed a present from a halforc she said should i be worried nope just take it he held out a small brown box it was in poor shape picked out of a heap of trash but the elf could see the great care spent attempting to clean and fix it what is inside she asked as she took the box open it harruq said youll see aurelia pried off the lid and peered inside a small bouquet of flowers lay on the bottom of the box she lifted them up smiling at the violets blues and reds thats sweet harruq but why just to you know he kicked a rock wanted to thank you for sparring with me he said theyre beautiful aurelia said as she inhaled the aroma but why the box harruq turned a new shade of red well id look weird walking down the street with those flowers in hand i do have a reputation to keep the elf laughed thank you harruq are you ready to begin he nodded eager to have the awkwardness pass aurelia twirled the staff in her hands as her smile faded into seriousness harruq drew his swords and then they sparred y oure out later than normal qurrah said when harruq returned to their home i get restless stuck in here he said he dropped his weapons in the corner shed much of his leather armor and then lay down with a loud groan harruq i must ask a favor of you qurrah said he sat next to his brother sure thing harruq said what you need qurrah fiddled with the bones in his pouch there is someone i need you to meet harruq raised an eyebrow the person youve been sneaking off to each night he asked you know qurrah asked course he said with a shrug youre sneaky brother but im not as deep a sleeper you think i am so who is this person qurrah bit his lower lip his name ishe will tell you his name he is powerful harruq very powerful he is my teacher and i want him to become yours as well harruq raised his arms and flexed watching his calloused hands open and close what can a teacher of magic offer me he asked qurrah chuckled youd be surprised he replied but will you come with me tonight fine fine i will he said you will impress him harruq do not worry about that qurrah left his brother to rest g rab my wrist qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night harruq did so and together they stepped inside he felt an unseen hand grab his chest and then they were running blind the minutes crawled their frantic breathing the only audible sound qurrah lagged further and further behind unable to keep the pace harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along the terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill the cold hand vanished the cloud dissipated before him standing with his arms crossed waited velixar qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head greetings master qurrah said i have brought him as you asked velixar grinned with delight as he looked over the tall muscular halforc as with qurrah he saw the untapped potential an incredible strength and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it the subtle shift of velixars features slowed as he approached when he spoke in his deep rumbling voice harruq struggled against a sudden urge to join his brother on one knee so you are harruq the man in black asked i am harruq said velixar reached out a hand it was frail bony so similar to his brothers kneel harruq did so unwillingly i am velixar the man in black said i am the voice of karak ive heard much about you harruq tun bastard child of an orcish womb you are strong and i sense your anger raging to be unleashed harruq trembled indeed feeling that anger he felt it deep inside his chest urging him to rise and defy velixar the orcish were elves who swore their lives to karak part of you still yearns to do what your ancestors have done they reveled in bloodshed they warred against men who followed a false god i offer you a chance to serve karak as you were always meant answer me this question halforc do you love your brother a chill ran through his spine he glanced to qurrah who still knelt his eyes were focused on him in them he saw pride aye i do harruq said i would do anything for him velixar let his hand slowly lower until his fingertips hovered before harruqs forehead then i ask you this will you devote your life to the protection of his will you swear your life to me as your brother has i can guide you teach you and give you the power to protect him answer me harruq looked once more at his brother and then let his head fall i swear my life to you and to qurrah i would have it no other way velixar said the hand touched his forehead all the anger that had raged inside harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest sweat poured from his skin his head jerked upward his eyes soaking in the white of velixars hand and the dim glow of the stars power flowed into him his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner rise harruq tun velixar said revel in the power of karak by the gods brother if you could see yourself qurrah said his voice full of shock and wonder just one god qurrah velixar corrected all this by the hand of one i am that hand harruq stood and looked down his arms and legs bulged with muscle he flexed his arm and stared at the explosion that traveled all the way up to his neck he felt within himself a lifewell of energy one infinitely deep discard your swords harruq velixar said you are the protector of my disciple you deserve better he slid his two swords out from their sheaths stunned by the ease in which he moved them it was if they went from being made of steel to air he tossed them aside velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone he placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars as the two brothers watched he whispered a few words of magic enlarging the chest to normal size over the centuries i have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me velixar said the locks clicked open the lid raised and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian these swords were once wielded by aerland shen he led the elves that aided karak in the great war against ashhur when celestia cursed his kind they shared his curse velixar smiled at harruq his eyes gleaming long have i waited for someone to wield these blades an elf crafted and used them in battle an elf cursed into an orc these swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him velixar held the hilts out to harruq who drew one from its sheath the swords blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow he weaved it through the air his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided they are not as long as your previous weapons velixar said but you will adjust with these blades you will be faster and more skillful than ever before forget everything you know about yourself and know only that you are unstoppable harruq took the other sword and held both in his hands he noticed the writing that flared on each hilt one red the other gold what do they say he asked staring at them in wonder condemnation and salvation you are judgment harruq may it be swift and merciless harruq sheathed the swords and clipped them to his belt he knelt as his head swirled thank you master none are more deserving qurrah said putting an arm on his brothers shoulder there is one and it is you qurrah velixar said he pulled out one more item before closing the chest and shrinking it back to its original size in his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive weapons may not be your preference but i trust you will find some use for this as both brothers watched the whip burst into flame velixar cracked it once to the grass instantly charring the green earth into ash why qurrah asked magic is not your greatest weapon my disciple fear and pain are and this whip is capable of producing both the fire died as the whip wound itself around velixars arm like a snake he held it out to qurrah who took it with great reverence with but a thought it will strike as you wish his master told him let it learn your heart and you will find it more than efficient velixar held out his arms and smiled at the two halforc brothers they both knelt before him basking in his unhidden power it is time you use these gifts not far is a small village go to it slaughter everyone without exception harruqs muscles screamed for use he could barely register the request asked of him all he could think of was wielding his swords in battle which way do we go he asked i know the way qurrah said his eyes lingering on the whip curled about his right arm their nightmares are crying out to me you have prepared them havent you master the man in black nodded they know death is coming so go qurrah bowed once more and then began walking west harruq followed as the two left his sight velixar broke out in hysterical laughter yes i do believe the time has come the man said to his master celestia has faltered greatly to let them fall into our hands he paused listening to the soft whisper of karak in his mind perhaps with qurrahs magic as strong as it is i have an ally worthy of your name all of neldar will burn and thereafter you will have your freedom velixar traveled west following unseen after his two apprentices he would witness their first true test and he would bask in the bloodshed that was sure to come t he two traveled over the gentle hills with only the rough gasps of qurrahs breathing breaking the silence as the two neared the village harruq dared speak qurrah he asked who is this velixar he is a teacher the halforc whispered in between ragged breaths one wiser than i ever thought possible so well do what he says well kill the village all of them without reason qurrah stopped their progress by turning and placing his hands on his brothers shoulders his eyes burned into harruqs so strong in force that the larger brother could not look away you have done much for me without question without pause this is different velixar has given us the power and privilege to do what we were always meant to do i need you to embrace this velixars reason is the only reason we need that we will ever need it is in our blood our orcish blood and that is a weight even your muscles cannot hold back we are killers murderers butchers now granted purpose within that that is our fate that is our reason do you understand harruqs fingers traced the hilts of his new swords he knew what his brother asked he had killed before but this was different this was a complete surrender to the murderer within he thought of his vow to velixar and also to his brother obedience loyalty he had sworn his entire life to them what else did he know what else could he be he thought of aurelia only once before he spoke her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother yeah harruq said i understand good now come the two resumed traveling up the small hill they stopped again however for from their vantage point they could see the village see the torches harruq asked pointing his brother nodded velixars nightmares have pulled them from their slumber it would be too easy otherwise its going to be easy anyway harruq said drawing his blades the soft red glow splashed across their faces are you ready brother i am he lied lets go j eremiah stoutmire walked through the village of cornrows the hair on his neck erect the cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine he held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other at first he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember then he saw others about lit torches in their hands and he knew his fear justified a young farmer with a fat nose saw him awake and approached couldnt sleep either jeremiah he asked aye had the worst of nightmares jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmers hand you feel the same dont you the farmer nodded feels like the dark god himself is coming for us part of me wants to grab my children and run perhaps it is a warning jeremiah said ashhur may be granting us a chance bandits or worse the orcs have struck veldaren once they may well have found a way across the bone ditch again hard to rest with torchlight flickering into your bedroom said an elderly man behind jeremiah something aint right corren jeremiah said and id bet all my harvest you feel it stronger than we do corren stroked his beard with his hand as his eyes went blank two men come from the east he said his voice distant but they are not men troubled spirits halfdemons the two farmers stared at corren in horror as the old mans voice returned to normal ashhur will not grant me to see any more gather the children on the west side of the town jeremiah ordered tell everyone they must be ready to flee flee from what the farmer with the fat nose asked it doesnt matter jeremiah shouted tell the others the man went to do as ordered he had not the heart to argue not with the fear of his nightmare still lingering he spread the word to the rest that searched the town ashhur help us corren suddenly whispered hurry i feel they have arrived a warcry rolled from the east a primal mindless roar that shook every man in the village flee west jeremiah ordered corren and take every one you find with you the old man put a hand on the young farmers shoulder fear not he said a weak smile on his face ashhurs golden eternity awaits us jeremiah raised his sword so that the flame of his torch flickered light across it not this night not if i can help it he said before running toward the battle cry the town held only ninety members half of them younger than eighteen when the second brutal cry rolled over the houses most were running west dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms the men young and old took up torches shortswords even rakes and sickles and prepared to defend their homes bravely they fought and bravely they died run run run jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy run west and dont look back a horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches held by the gathered defenders of the small village he kissed his sword as he approached horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light a great halforc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that jeremiah knew well strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior gifted with the dark gods power condemnation tore through his rusted sickle cut his arm from his body and then hooked around severing his ankles the boy fell dying in four pieces jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword the halforc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor he roared as he chopped that mans head in pieces the dropped torch sputtered and died all the courage he could ever muster failed to move jeremiah forward he watched friend after friend so many having never seen their eighteenth winter butchered by the raging warrior harruq tore a neck open punctured the same man with three stabs and then gutted another who had closed the distance so his sword could reach the man died with his final slash an inch from the halforcs skin come on jeremiah said to himself hang it all come on the halforc held both swords out wide and roared at the remaining three facing him when they held their ground jeremiah could bear the sight no more he charged screaming the cry of one expecting to die he did not get far though for a sharp burning pain enveloped his wrist his arm jerked back and the sudden force spun him to his knees as he knelt there a voice spat down at him pitiful jeremiah looked up to see another halforc clothed in ragged robes the fire came once more wrapping around his throat smoke blurred his vision the smell of his own charring flesh filled his nose he dropped his sword and clawed at his neck flesh burned off his fingers he felt the pain fade away then nothing the whip slithered off his throat and back around the halforcs hand simply pitiful qurrah said again but jeremiah did not hear it his soul was already on its way r ed eyes watched from afar their owner relishing the carnage amid the dying torchlight a smile grew on his everchanging face beautiful velixar whispered as the number of dead grew shifting sighs and mindless moans drifted from behind velixar glanced back at his companions numbering in the thousands surround the town he commanded them the nearest nodded the movement swinging the entirety of his rotting face he moaned to the others sending them in motion the man in black reached out a hand to his two disciples send on their souls he said accept my strength but leave the bodies for me they would h arruq stormed through the village roaring for any to stand and fight were coming for you he shouted his voice like the growl of a dog you are weak weak the cry of a child sent him bashing through the door of a small home inside a girl huddled with her much younger sister they were wrapped in blankets the little girl clutched a doll in her hands no parent was in sight harruq paused and deep in his heart some piece of him shrieked in protest im sorry he said salvation and condemnation quivered in his hands theres no room for compassion not here not tonight he left the house blood covering his blades he let out a primal cry to the stars whether of anguish or elation he did not know q urrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them he could smell the fear of the villagers and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled flames danced across the side of one house alerting qurrah the halforc wrapped the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch enough work with the whip it was time to test the spells his master had taught him an elderly man came around the corner the torch his only weapon he glared at qurrah with open hatred weakness the necromancer hissed in the wispy tongue of magic the old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs his arms already shriveled with age shrunk even more skin tightened against his frame and in seconds it was if the man had become a living skeleton decorated with flesh hair and clothes the man took a staggered step forward still determined to fight qurrah even as his arms struggled to bear their own weight he let out a moan of unintelligible loathing you are not worth my time qurrah told him so consider this an honor for your determination he began casting relishing the feeling of control flowing throughout his body never before had he felt so powerful so invincible he prayed the night would never end verl yun kleis he hissed hands of ice the halforc lunged forward grabbing the old man by the wrist blue light swirled around the contact of their flesh pain flared throughout the old mans dying mind the water and blood inside his arm froze qurrahs smile was wide as the man collapsed and died while still within his grasp when he let go the icy flesh hit the dirt with enough force to crack the arm at the shoulder blood poured out from the body but not the arm a marvelous spell the halforc gasped fighting away a momentary wave of dizziness he closed his eyes and felt the village with his mind a stench of fear trailed west women and children all of them panicked and confused harruq they flee west qurrah whispered magically enhancing his voice with a spell velixar had taught him his quiet words flooded the town audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper the fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified his brother heard and obeyed the two met at the edge of town not far in the distance they saw the scattered groups of families get them my brother qurrah ordered none may live or they will tell of the halforcs that destroyed their town then theyre dead harruq said clanging his swords together power crackled through them he took up the chase a n elderly man and woman propping each other up with their arms as they ran side by side refused to turn when harruq barreled down atop of them salvation took the womans life condemnation the mans the two bodies collapsed their lifeless limbs entangled not far ahead of them a woman ran in only her shift a child clutched to her breast why do you flee harruq roared at her when she glanced back with crying eyes this life is pain is suffering im here to end it end it all the woman ran faster and her child cried louder it didnt matter harruq rammed her with his shoulder the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall and not her child as the halforcs blades twirled in the air the mother kissed her child one last time before curling up around the joy of her life then the blades fell on the halforc ran innocent blood stained his sword as life after life ended harruq felt no remorse and saw no pain the blood haze of rage and dark magic blocked all man woman child it didnt matter they all died only seven managed to keep ahead of his berserking madness a mother her two children a few farmers and their daughters they dared to hope as they ran a strange sight met their eyes in the distance were hundreds of bodies lined in perfect formation they held no torches or lanterns the wind shifted and upon its gentle flow the stench of death came to them the villagers slowed eyeing the line with fear the stars were bright and with their light they could see something was amiss they were no soldiers only a scattered few wore armor still they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army a roar from harruq at their heels spurned them on they charged the line crying out for aid a creature attacked our town shouted the mother please my daughter is still there they might hurt her please help us theres two shouted one of the farmers they killed my wife you have to their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly their saviors were men orc and elf and they were dead flesh hung from their bones pale and rotting wounds spotted nearly every one although no blood poured from them their eyes were open but they saw little ashhur help us a farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them exhausted and with the forest butcher at their heels they could not run velixars army of undead tore the seven apart and cast their remains to the dirt so ended the last life of cornrows h arruq halted before the mess that had been his prey the line of undead stood motionless their dead eyes looking nowhere the wind blew through them shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies the halforc said nothing just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for qurrah the mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded by the time his brother arrived it was all but a memory the undead took them qurrah said his breath quick and shallow velixar did not trust us i trust little velixar said stepping through the line of his servants the truth is i do not take risks if any survived you would have been identified and my plans ruined both brothers bowed to their master what are the plans you speak of harruq asked in time my dear bone general i will tell you both for now though i must deal with your brother velixar brought his gaze to the young necromancer let us return to the village it is time we test your power t he three stood in the center of the town corpses scattered in all directions there was an eerie silence creeping about tickling harruqs spine with its soft touch he held the hilts of his twin blades in his hands drawing comfort from them at that dark moment it was his only comfort you know what i ask of you velixar said i do qurrah said i pray i do not disappoint he closed his eyes his hands stretched to either side his fingers hooked and curled in strange ways many times so twisted and odd that harruq could not bear to watch them dance words spilled from the frail halforcs lips some were strong demanding while others came limping out twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist the words however did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from qurrah his sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell a cold wind came blasting in seemingly from all directions faster and faster the words poured from qurrahs pale lips harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes the spell neared completion and velixar hissed in sheer pleasure at the power flaring from his apprentice qurrah shrieked out one final word the signal the climax of the spell rise all around corpses staggered to their feet qurrah harruq stammered but could say no more eight qurrah gasped dropping to his knees it isi am sorry master velixar walked about examining each of the undead farmers he remained quiet hiding all emotion from his apprentice and even refusing to look at him this is the first time you have ever brought the dead back to life velixar said correct of this size yes qurrah answered his entire body rose and fell with his unsteady gasps of breath the man in black turned to him when i was first taught that same spell i managed only four rise from your feet qurrah tun he turned to the undead kneel he shouted to them at once the eight bowed to qurrah velixar placed a hand on the halforcs shoulder it is your servants that should bow to you he said and one could not ask for a more gifted disciple qurrah stood but kept his head bowed harruq shifted on his feet scared and confused the eyes of his brothertears thank you my master whispered the halforc i have never felt more honored velixar placed a hand atop qurrahs head and accepted the tears he knew the halforc tried to hide he had long thought the weaker emotions burned from his soul but that night he felt an overwhelming sense of pride harruq velixar said his normally unshakable voice faltering escort your brother home protect him even unto death he will usher in a new age to this world of this i have no doubt he shouted an order to qurrahs undead the eight obeyed marching out of town to join the rest of velixars army i will take control now he said to his disciple in time the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless until then let me bear it look at me qurrah did his eyes red and his face wet yes master he asked no weakness tainted his voice the man in black put a hand on either side of qurrahs face and drew him close become a god among men he whispered remain faithful to me and to karak and i shall see it come to pass qurrah nodded but said nothing instead he turned and joined his brother lets go home he said im thinking thats a great idea harruq said the two stepped around the bodies of the slain as they headed east leaving velixar alone in the emptiness of cornrows incredible velixar said when they were gone never would i have guessed they had such power he paused listening to the words of his master the man in black smiled if you didnt know then i do not feel as blind he said he will surpass me surpass us all should i bring him to your dark paladins karaks answer was swift let him learn at your side he loves you and this love will drive him to power not seen since i walked dezrel use it give me a sacrifice worthy of my name burn the east to the ground velixar closed his eyes and bowed his head in acknowledgement only in absolute emptiness is there order he said the goal of all those who worshiped karak and knew the true purpose of their lives and i will bring order t he tun brothers did not go straight home that night harruq veered them off into the grassy hills south of woodhaven why do we go this way qurrah asked his arm draped around his brother his sagging body seemed ready to collapse into slumber at any time i need to pick up the swords i dropped harruq said quietly i want to train with them qurrah nodded so absently that harruq wondered if his brother even heard him they walked in silence under the beauty of the stars hey qurrah yes brother what we didis it did you revel in the power granted to you qurrah asked harruq paused searching for an honest answer aye he said at last i did then why do you now question it harruq shrugged velixars strong what do you think he wants with us order qurrah said we will kill brother it is all we are good at it was what we were made for what other purpose do you see for your life harruq shrugged i said it before im here to protect you then kill those that seek to kill me qurrah said a bit of his sleepiness leaving him our master has given us so much power weapons a purpose what more could we ever ask for yeah what else harruq said shifting more of his brothers weight onto his shoulder qurrahs eyes drooped and it seemed sleep would steal him away before they reached town harruq found his blades without too much trouble he laid qurrah down his brother slept peacefully and in silence the halforc took the old weapons into his hands he looked up to the stars even as a child those far away lights had awakened something in him something so different from what he thought he was right then it was awakening guilt and fear i do what i choose he argued to the stars no what i must the words felt hollow nothing more than selfserving lies he kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him when he had rammed her she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall right before the kill she had held him trying to protect him why he asked a part of him worried he might wake his brother but he was too drained to care why did she do that she could have run faster without the child no he knew that answer she would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon qurrah then what was bothering him so he fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt the faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes especially the mother and her child and the young girl holding her little sister the fear in their eyes the screams the panic horror i do what i have to do he said again but did the town have to die all those children mothers sisters fathersnothing but a test and all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate what was it he was accomplishing with his swords every action every kill seemed to confirm the words of his brother he was a killer and nothing more his legacy would be one of death and emptiness the ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck his choice was made when he looked to the stars he saw aurelias face among them he tried not to think of what shed say if she knew what he had done guilt and regret meant nothing so he choked it down it didnt matter what he wanted his oath was made his swords had swung the weight of blood was on his shoulders and who was he to fight against it im sorry if im weak harruq whispered to his sleeping brother i cant be like you i cant be strong like you the halforc buckled the old pair of swords next to the gleaming black blades on his belt he then gently took his brother into his arms and carried him back to town the weight of his brother in his hands was a feather compared to the burden on his heart h arruq arrived late to his sparring match with aurelia his face was haggard and his eyes bloodshot rough night aurelia asked she blinked as a tingle in her head insisted that something was different about the halforc after a few seconds she saw it harruq she asked is it me or did you grow thirty pounds of muscle overnight yup harruq muttered im magical like that the elf glared at him sorry he said his face reddening i had a long night aurelia nodded she twirled the staff in the air and then hooked it underneath her arm ready to start the halforc shrugged sure why not instead of starting she lowered her staff and crossed her arms somethings wrong harruq tell me what bothers you so harruq sighed and looked away he gently tapped his swords together i dont know bored am i not a challenge he made vague shrug that could be taken either way let her think that was it he thought it was a whole lot better than the truth aurelia however seemed none too pleased she twirled her staff again you might be surprised orcyboy but i could beat you in a spar harruq scoffed you have no chance he said first to three hits the elf said taking a few steps back well make it a wager even whats the bet the elf flashed a smile so quickly it may not have existed loser barks like a dog she said the halforc looked like he had been slapped a dog yes a dog very well harruq said drawing his swords in his gigantic arms guess you get to be my bitch today he lowered his weapons and thrust out his chest here ill prove it two free hits ill still beat you aurelia eyed him obviously insulted she gave him two quick raps across the chest two to zero she said before dancing away harruq raised his swords and roared he crossed the distance between them in a heartbeat twice as fast as he had ever moved in their previous sparring matches aurelia leapt backward as blades dove for her chest and abdomen her staff shot spun back and forth to parry thrust after thrust harruq pressed his attack shifting on one foot so that his next two attacks came slashing downward for her thigh and ankle the staff blocked one but the other banged against her calf one to two harruq said he double thrust offering the elf no reprieve she smashed her staff upward pushing the two attacks high and giving her room underneath she ducked forward trying for a strike against the halforcs leg she badly underestimated harruqs new speed one blade looped around and blocked the attack the other went straight down the edge smashing hard against the top of aurelias skull while it did not draw blood the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head have you lost your mind aurelia asked as she rolled away harruqs mad charge was her answer and it sparked fear in her heart sword strikes came in impossibly fast any thought of the fight being practice left aurelias mind it felt too real she stayed defensive parrying with all her skill while constantly dancing away harruq stayed with her and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward he was upon her notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder his strength grew as the fight progressed he held nothing back he weaved his swords through three stabs feint a high slash and then twirled up and around for a low thrust aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high leaving her lower half exposed her slender frame twisted a sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin she thought harruq might stop and claim the cut counted he didnt instead he crosscut his left arm swiping right while the other swept left she turned to one side using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her the staff continued twirling positioning harruqs hands further out of place she used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them her hands ached from the force of every block and parry her breath was fast and shallow her hair which she had failed to tie up before the fight hung in wild strands before her face she was beautiful but harruq did not see it to harruq she was the young girl cradling her sister he charged aurelia thrust her right hand forward her fingers spread wide and stiff words of power poured from her lips and without hesitation the forest obeyed vines shot from the earth and wrapped around harruqs arms and legs down he went aurelia gave him no chance to recover she raised her outstretched hand higher more and more vines appeared covering the halforcs arms and legs with green they lifted him into the air his boots dangling two feet above the ground harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage he jerked against his restraints but they held firm aurelia calmly walked over raised her staff and tapped him on the chest three she said the halforc roared his protest aurelia swung the staff with all her strength the end cracked against harruqs cheek blood shot from his mouth four she shouted the fierce pain appeared to knock some sense into him he looked down at aurelia with a mixture of anger and embarrassment sorry he said blood ran from a busted lip the skin on his cheek was already blackening i dont know what just happened she said the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech but i know i dont like it and will not accept it ever is that clear yeah harruq said now will you let me down for a moment she said nothing catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her as the fog cleared she smirked at the helpless halforc i do believe someone lost a bet she said harruq blinked not a chance no way im not doing it you will do it aurelia said her voice iron or i might just leave you here in case it helps you make up your mind my spell has a very long duration usually it will end after twenty hours or so you cheated though he said did we ever say no magic she asked harruq cursed and grumbled but had no counter i thought so now bark doggie no fine then ill see you tomorrow she said slowly walking toward woodhaven wait fine barkbark aurelia turned the corners of her mouth fighting against a smile better than that i dont want to hear you say bark i want you to actually bark harruq groaned do i have to oh well then enjoy your night the red of his blushing fought against the black of his bruise fine arf arf arf there you happy despite the seriousness of the day aurelia laughed yes you may go ill see you tomorrow i have something new planned the vines released the halforc landed with a thud by the time he picked himself up the vines had pulled into the dirt and the elf was gone youre going to pay for that he grumbled rubbing his sore wrists his heart was not in it though more than anything he was embarrassed and frightened about losing control just need some sleep he told himself that is all sleep good sleep and that was what he did he went home and slept i t can be one of your most powerful spells velixar said it is quick deadly and strikes from nowhere listen to these words very carefully if you give it enough of your power nary a soul can withstand the shock and blood loss the man in black listed off a stream of seven words seven times he pronounced them giving his disciple ample chances to hear the precise delicate pronunciations and mimic them himself prepare the spell with these words in the morning and you may trigger it at any time with but a single word and what is that qurrah asked once the words were tucked firmly into his mind hemorrhage velixar hissed the frail halforc smiled loving the sound harruq sat nearby the lessons in spellcasting had little to do with him so he politely remained silent the spidery words seemed so opposite of strength but he could not deny the power his brother wielded harruq tun velixar said suddenly jolting him from his drifting thoughts yes master he asked his back stiffening he could feel the eyes of his brother on him and he did not wish to disappoint stand qurrah has told me of the troubles in your heart i must see them he did harruq asked glancing at his brother his stomach dropped and his heart quickened as velixar approached he felt like a truant servant caught by his masterwhich perhaps he was you killed many yesterday the man in black said do you feel guilt for their deaths harruq took a deep breath analyzing every word before he opened his mouth velixar could surely tell if he lied but what did he believe did he even know im not strong like qurrah he said sometimes i can be weak only after though i will try to never question the order of my master or the will of my brother velixar nodded although he appeared not to listen instead his eyes burrowed into harruqs prying information not from his mouth but from his very soul tell me harruq why do you mourn the lives of those you kill i dont harruq said he wasnt sure if it was lie or truth most likely a lie war is brutal life is brutal velixar put a cold hand against harruqs face you do not understand but we are bringers of peace we will end all war we will end all murder we will end everything harruq kneel i will show you harruq obeyed his insides churned as icy fingers pressed against his forehead power crackled through his mind the entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind the painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion an artwork of death and fire he saw a city burning he saw people fleeing in the streets and then he saw himself he was dressed in black armor that shone with power salvation and condemnation waved high above his head both drenched in blood he looked like a god among men and the way the soldiers fell at his feet he might have been one this reddream self looked straight at him and spoke but he could not understand the words the sound of his own voice chilled him though for it was dark it was dangerous and it was exactly like velixars a god among men said a second voice one he had never heard before it was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares there was only one it could be and it was no mortal protect your brother and i will grant you a kingdom live as you have always lived and i will reward you with eternity kill as i desire you to kill and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm the time for questioning is over trust your god as i now trust you love me harruq tun kill for me the dream shattered amid the haze of red and black he heard the cries of battle urging him on offering him a future he had always feared and desired a life of killing and battle a life given to karak an orcish life the icy fingers left his forehead it is a select few who have received such a gift velixar said in the quiet night you have heard the voice of the dark god himself now tell me what is it you saw please brother qurrah said i need to know harruq stared at the dirt his shoulders heaving with each breath his mind reeled and for reasons he did not understand he opened his mouth and said that which i fear and desire i have had no questions answered but i do know this the time for questions has long ended velixar nodded indeed harruq it is time for action i am done with both of you go home and rest tomorrow we will begin my plan war shall come to woodhaven we await your orders qurrah said the two bowed and then returned to town beneath the blanket of stars a s the two brothers left another soul traveled in the dark he made not a sound as he moved any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away he was dieredon scoutmaster of the quellan elves and few souls could match his silence speed or skills with blade and bow it had been two days since he had heard word from his friend jeremiah stoutmire the elf had an uncanny gift for reading clouds and understanding weather if it would rain a few drops the following day he would know jeremiah being the farmer that he was craved every bit of knowledge over the weather that he could get every other day some young man or woman from cornrows came to him in woodhaven eager for news about the heavens but not the past two days normally dieredon would have given this no thought but times were not normal he had been unable to locate the mysterious man in black for many nights but he knew he was still there his dark dreams told him so when the village came into view of his eaglelike eyes his gut sank not a single sign of life decorated the streets or moved in the fields he prayed to celestia he was wrong but his heart knew he wasnt he found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village he found many homes with their doors open wide yet none answered him when he called inside everywhere staining the earth a dark crimson there was blood it is as i feared he whispered to the night he stood took his bow off his shoulder and then thoroughly searched the town he found no trace of life barring a few rats that fed off the now unguarded remnants of food several homes those with their doors smashed open had their floors smeared with gore one pained dieredons heart greatly for amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small bloodstained doll he said a silent prayer before moving on at the edge of the town he found many frantic tracks fleeing west he followed them wincing as some of the tracks ended in dried smears of red upon the grass a collection of tracks led far past the others they ended at once the town a somber image in the distance the pool of blood there was enormous chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks one of enormous weight the other light as a feather every one of them he said his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon they slaughtered even those that fled yet there are no corpses the corpses had been taken or made to walk again the man with infinite faces dieredon said another thought came to him or was it you qurrah tun he raced back to woodhaven his mind decided it was time he had a talk with one of the brothers tun h arruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day and he seemed in better spirits so what is your surprise for me he asked aurelia smiled from her seat against a tree she patted the grass beside her sit doggie hows your head very funny harruq grumbled as he plopped down and my head is fine from behind her back aurelia pulled out a small blue object ever seen one of these before she asked the halforc stared at it thinking suddenly he knew and he looked at aurelia in total disbelief is that a book the elf nodded is it a safe assumption that you dont know how to read harruq frowned at the book youre not going to teach me elvish are you i mean its me after all aurelia gave him a playful jab to the side no it is in the gods language your gods anyway karak and ashhur got something right having humans speak and write the same language what do you mean do you not know the story of karak and ashhur the halforc shook his head i will tell you it if you care to hear mankind as well as orcs wolfmen hyenamen and all the other odd races scattered about dezrel are less than five hundred years old many elves remember the arrival of the brother gods and the creation of man huh harruq said you may have to tell me the story sometime he grinned at aurelia so are you one of the elves that were there way back then she gave him a wink no but my father was im not that old harruq in elven terms i am but a child how old a child he prodded seventy seventy the elf laughed dont be too shocked you have elven blood in you as well i wouldnt be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself this is assuming someone doesnt kill you which i find rather unlikely harruq gasped at the thought he had always felt akin to man and orcs whose lives burnt out so quickly the idea of living two hundred years waswell it was more than he could handle strange he said guess i have plenty of time to learn to read dont i aurelia laughed you do but i would prefer we not take too many years spending that much time with you is bound to give me bad habits she handed over the book harruq opened it and flipped through the pages each one was filled with various symbols lines and curls aurelia winced at the rough way he handled the paper what are these he asked the human alphabet and youre going to learn it he protested but it was a weak protest aurelia opened up the book and pointed at a large colorful object this is the letter a say it with me a she frowned when harruq did not participate what she asked youre treating me like im a little child he sulked aurelia promptly hit him over the head with her staff until you get the alphabet down you are a little child now stop whining and start repeating a they went over the alphabet several times until harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard i want you to take it home with you she said when they were done to her annoyance harruq refused to accept the book i really dont want to take it he said why not well i just his face turned a mixture of gray and red qurrah doesnt know im doing this aurelia sighed and set the book down beside her why dont you tell him about me well why not im just embarrassed alright he finally shouted embarrassed why qurrahs smart can read and everything hed want to know why i never asked him that and well youre ayou know a girl harruq grew redder an elf whats wrong with that harruq viciously uprooted blades of grass with his fingers i dont know aurelia stared at harruq for a while her eyes probing the halforc endured the gaze concentrating fully on his grassremoving project i would feel better having met your brother she said at last but you may take as long as you wish good can we spar now of course aurelia said picking up her staff h ours later they finished and said their goodbyes see you tomorrow harruq called sheathing his blades the elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees he stared after her for a bit then turned toward home before he could take two steps a sudden weight crashed into his side he tumbled best he could his shoulder absorbing much of the impact his legs tucked underneath him and pushed shooting him back to his feet out came his swords standing before him was dieredon his bow held in both hands like a staff long blades stretched out from either end tiny razor teeth lining the front the elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged two quick hits batted one of harruqs swords out and away a feint so quick harruq blocked on instinct took care of the other with his weapons wide the halforc was exposed dieredon wasted no time his knee smashed the halforcs groin as pain doubled him over a snap kick smacked his chin splattering blood he dropped the sharp tip of a blade pressed against harruqs throat before he knew what was happening move dieredon said please move give me excuse to kill you harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted instead he lay there his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands what do you want he asked ignoring the sharp pain on his throat as a tiny drop of blood trickled down his neck the entire village of cornrows is missing dieredon said most likely dead harruqs breathing quickened his hands tightened around the hilts of his weapons i had nothing to do with it he said why would i children have been dying since you arrived here in woodhaven dieredon replied butchered with intestines removed strange carvings on the bodies and pieces of them missing we thought a sick mind but now i understand better necromancy requires many interesting artifacts for spells your brother is a necromancer isnt he harruq said nothing he fought back his swelling anger and panic i dont understand what aurelia sees in you dieredon continued you murdered the children and gave them to your brother youre the forest butcher admit it so i may kill you i will admit no such thing harruq said his jaw trembling youre guessing i have also seen your brother meeting with the strange man in black with the everchanging face what is his name harruq what is it he offers you youre out of your mind the tip buried in deeper the elf lowered his face so that the fury in his eyes was all harruq could see yes i am out of my mind i will let you live until aurelia sees you for what you are i will spare your life but know i will be watching you and i will be watching your brother one false move and i kill you both is that clear harruq nodded shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing up and down against the tender skin of his throat good pleasant days halforc may celestia watch over youand condemn your actions to death the biting tip left his throat the blades in the bow retracted and then the elf was gone harruq struggled to his feet clutching his neck as he gasped for air damn elf he cursed how dare you threaten us his hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded he had been terrified he thought the elf would kill him yet he didnt big mistake elfie he said he picked up his swords and sheathed them ill make you pay for that after a bit of debate he decided not to tell qurrah velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful now he understood why he wouldnt tell aurelia either that would be stupid and stupid he was notmost of the time i need a drink he said turning toward the town and trudging back all he could think about was getting a good stiff drink if he was lucky he might get in a good bar fight nothing helped him forget his worries better than walloping a fellow drunken idiot she felt guilty for spying on him but aurelia was convinced she had little choice over the past month she had grown close to the halforc harruq tun and with that closeness was danger she saw only a goofy young man while dieredon swore she met with a killer only one of them could be right but who perhaps not she wondered perhaps she saw the elf in harruq while dieredon saw the orc the kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes when harruq was with his brother or the strange man in black how then did he behave could he kill could he murder she had to know it took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace it was midday and the sun was high in the sky when the children had been killed it was usually near the evening and always when the child wandered into the forest to play lately no murders had been found and aurelia couldnt decide if she should be worried or hopeful that they had stopped at the same time she began training with harruq aurelia peered through a gap in the boards she and harruq had finished their sparring an hour before and she expected him to be resting she was right what surprised her was how qurrah remained asleep as well dieredon had mentioned nocturnal visits between the other brother and the man in black but she had no idea how long they lasted for qurrah to still slumber they must be lasting several hours if not the entire night she looked at him sprawled out on a thick pile of straw and wondered how he managed to walk let alone cast spells as harruq implied his skin was pale and had a stretched look across his bones he looked like a drained emaciated version of his larger brother a good set of meals would do him wonders aurelia thought boring as it was aurelia sat down and prepared to wait she glanced around making sure there was no chance a wandering passerby could accidentally bump into her invisible form slowly the sun moved along its path in the sky the brothers woke qurrah vanished returning later with meager portions of bread and tough meat they ate in relative silence aurelia watched oddly amused by the sight harruq continuously glanced over at qurrah and when the frailer halforc was overtaken by a coughing fit harruq was there pounding his brothers back and looking like his world was about to end qurrah merely looked embarrassed and pushed him away they clearly love each other thought aurelia maybe harruq more than qurrah the day passed thankfully uneventful she was almost ready to leave when qurrah pulled harruq closer and began whispering aurelia cast a spell over her ears heightening her already sharp hearing a pall settled over her as she listened must resume qurrah was saying as her spell enacted its dangerous harruq said i thought you were learning enough from velixar exactly said qurrah but i must practice what i learn these nights are not enough will never be enough what point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it harruq had no reply eyes low he stepped out into the night aurelia not far behind they travelled deeper into the town with some trepidation she noticed he had both his swords swinging from his belt a knot grew in her stomach and as they approached the poorer parts of the town the knot only tightened she watched the halforc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed she found herself begging he only meant to steal possessionsjust possessions nothing more keep the swords sheathed she prayed sheathed and bloodless he continued wandering and she found herself circling several streets multiple times stalling she thought but it was little comfort the day was almost done the town covered with long shadows and darkened spaces the older boys and girls would still be out to play but the younger harruq stopped aurelia positioned herself to the side struggling to keep her breathing calm lest she alert him to her presence they were beside an old house made of slanted boards shoddily nailed together there was no glass for the window nor a covering she wondered what the occupants did during the winter months preferring her mind to dwell on that than terrible look covering harruqs face his skin had turned ashen his right hand stroked the hilt of his sword like an itch he couldnt stop scratching he put a hand on the wood aurelia could only imagine what he saw a small child slumbering in bed positioned by the window to keep him cool just a child like any other the forest butcher had claimed when dieredon had first come to her she had expected little difficulty in the task they are new to the town and when they came so did the murders he had said meet with one of them discover who they are if they are the vagrant scum they appear to be it will be easy enough to catch them in their crime the humans can then deal their judgment with a rope it seemed perverse that she had met harruq by saving him from the fate she was supposed to doom him to still aurelia was not one to judge by appearances and what she had seen that night had burned her heart two soldiers beating harruq bloody without cause or reason harruq who was so kind to her when they sparred who brought her flowers and told her stories who looked upon her like she was a goddess of light in his dreary world harruq drew his sword it shook in his hand aurelia watched as if in a dream she felt magic spark on her fingertips under no circumstances could she watch him she couldnt nor could she believe it he was so kind to her so kind why she whispered he put a hand inside the window the other pressed his sword against the side of the house no longer a dream a nightmare she would kill him burn his whole body to ash so she never had to look upon his dead face hatred burned in her breast qurrah she thought you make him do this put the blood on your own hands you coward she knew the moment she struck with a spell her invisibility would end she wondered how he would look at her when she killed him surprise anger shame she didnt know she didnt want to know magic sparked on her fingertips harruq might have seen if he had looked over but his eyes stared through the window he pulled back the sword his hand reached in aurelia prepared to kill him damn it she heard him say im sorry qurrah i cant he sheathed the blade aurelia felt her world slow and the nightmare relent he did no harm she thought no killing he may not be the forest butcher and even if he meant to do what she feared it didnt mean the others were him the hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly the magic left her fingertips and doing her best to calm her heart she followed harruq back home nothing qurrah asked when harruq stepped inside nothing it seemed qurrah would leave it at that but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brothers face tell me the truth he said what happened harruq sighed and he removed his swords and flung them to the ground i cant do it he said we dont need it you dont need it our war is coming qurrah let us fight it when it comes but not sooner not now not while they sleep he looked away as if expecting to be berated for the outburst instead qurrah walked over and put a hand on his brothers shoulder be careful he said in his raspy voice your power was given at a cost any hesitation or doubt risks the permanency of your gift i understand please know that in time you will learn and you will see things as i do until then rest velixar will come for us soon i do not want to fail him that is all that matters we must not fail aurelia had heard enough she knew their roles the balance and position of their hearts it was absurd poor men without a home family or position to be speaking of power and obligation her hatred of their unknown master grew he was a puppetmaster and her dear friend was one of his puppets if they still doubted even for a moment perhaps she could save them perhaps there was still time to pull them from necromancers cold fingers aurelia turned and ran for the forest dieredon had not known of her spying but she would tell him everything if there was any hope it was in his skill with blade and bow to free the puppets one must cut the strings it was time for dieredon to slay the man in black t hat night velixar gave them their orders putting in motion his plan to blanket the east in war in celed there is a male elf by the name of ahrqur tundel he told the two under the cover of stars he has visited king vaelor before and was quite vocal when the elves were expelled from his capital city he is well known in woodhaven at least to those of elven blood i need him killed and his body brought before me how will we hide the body asked harruq wrap it in cloth and make sure you are not seen velixar said and make no mistakes we will not qurrah said how will i know where this ahrqur lives i will show you my disciple but first i have a gift for my dearest bone general velixar drew out his magical chest he set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size from within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black he threw it to harruq who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open the first horde war was caused by a disciple of mine the man in black explained he blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans i claimed it when he fell on the battlefield harruq examined the suit turning it over in his hands it was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather obsidian buckles and clamps held the pieces together the only color was a yellow scorpion emblazoned on the chest why the scorpion he asked the orcs have forgotten karak whom they once served they worship animals as their gods believing they take strength from them the warlord who wore that armor worshipped the scorpion it is appropriate for his opponent crushed him underneath his heel like one harruq folded the armor as best he could and clutched it to his chest my thanks master he said we do not deserve what you have given us you will earn your gifts in time ahrqur is a skilled swordsman the armor weapons and strength i have granted you will make you near invincible do not fail velixar turned his attention to qurrah give me your hand he said the thin halforc obeyed velixar closed his eyes and whispered a few brief words qurrahs head jerked up suddenly and his eyes flared open velixar released his hand as the halforc murmured i know where he is he said it is all i can see go now velixar said the night is young hide his body in your home and bring it to me tomorrow and qurrah remember to bring his blade with you the two brothers bowed and then left to do as their master commanded d ieredon watched the brothers travel back to woodhaven he had been waiting outside the town and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye he had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting his eyes flicked to and from the halforcs and their master his heart was torn he had already warned harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the everchanging face i do this for you aurelia he said his decision made he removed his bow and ran across the grass velixar had not moved since the brothers departure his hands resting on the grass palms upward his hood fell far past his eyes blocking nearly all of his face yet even with lack of sight and sound from dieredons approach the man knew someone neared greetings scoutmaster velixar said his deep voice rumbling i would call you otherwise but i have not been granted your name you have not earned it dieredon said he halted directly in front of the motionless man less than six feet separated them i have been watching you the man in black said i have dipped inside your dreams you have seen me before havent you you were the necromancer that led the orcs against veldaren you helped them cross the bone ditch correct velixar said his smile visible beneath his hood it was a glorious day men of the east no longer trust the elves and the elves hold little love for our beloved king of course thousands died but what is a little sacrifice compared to such gains they joined your army didnt they necromancer dieredon asked velixar laughed you are wise elf and you are strong but you have sheltered arrogance the man in black stood pulling the hood back from his face his eyes shone a blinding red his face was a pale skull covered with dead gray skin maggots crawled through the flesh feasting dieredon delayed his attack stunned by the horrific sight velixar however gave no pause from within his robe he pulled out a handful of bone fragments a word of power sent them flying the elf dropped low his right leg stretching back as he crouched the bone fragments flew over his head faster than arrows then he was up his bow in hand the string vanished from the bow spikes pierced the front and out came the long blades at each side you foolish mortal velixar said his voice was far deeper than before less like a man and more like a demon i do not fear your steel pale hands shot upward hooked in strange formations dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the mans throat the blade halted halfway there crashing against an invisible barrier the elf struck again this time lower velixars image rippled as if beneath water his body protected by some unseen wall faster and faster dieredon swung whirling his blades against where he perceived the wall to be power rippled in the air black and deadly as the elf fought against the shadow wall velixar began another spell words of magic flew off his tongue in perfect pitch and pronunciation in spite of their incredible difficulty a strong thrust from dieredon finally shattered the invisible barrier the explosion of power sent him flying backward he rolled when he hit the ground his legs tucked and then with a kick he vaulted himself into the air he landed on his feet and lunged at the necromancer the blades of his bow leading be gone velixar roared the sound of a daemon unleashed dieredon fought but it felt as if a thousand hands pulled him back pain spiked up his chest and a sick sound filled his head as two of his ribs broke a gasp of pain escaped his lips he dropped to his knees as the pressure finally ended dieredon lifted the bow with one hand as the other reached to his quiver the blades retracted and in the heartbeat it took him to draw two arrows a thin string materialized in the air ready to be drawn the elf fired the arrows velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest no blood ran from them you must do far better than that he said his fingers hooked in strange positions another blast of dark power washed over dieredon he felt his right shoulder crack into fragments darkness swam before his eyes darkness dominated by twin red orbs the elf reached into a small pocket of his armor and drew out a glass vial healing potions will not aid you velixar mocked this is no healing potion dieredon said he threw the vial it shattered velixar snarled as holy light of the elven goddess burned his decaying flesh after a few seconds the light vanished velixar glanced about seeing no sign of the elf no matter he said come my minions it is time to hunt he spread his hands wide and let all of his power flow freely a swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him a bleak wind wailing from it out came his undead marching in rows of ten more than a hundred rows spilled out surrounding their master with mindless perfection find him he ordered as he covered his face with his hood he is wounded find him and kill him as one the thousand moaned their acknowledgment they scattered spreading out like a ripple in a pond in the center stood velixar his hands out and his eyes closed reveal yourself to any one of them and i will know it he said his sick face smiling youre no longer amusing scoutmaster it is time you died the chorus of quiet moans agreed i f there was any time i needed you sonowin it is now the elf said as he fled across the grass his chest ached with every breath his right arm hung limp and his other hand clutched his shoulder he desperately needed to bandage it but he had no time a wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears dieredon shuddered how many does he command he asked he crouched as he ran his right arm dragging against the grass under normal circumstances he might have been able to hold his own against the undead however these were not normal circumstances minutes passed long and painful the light of woodhaven beckoned him to his left but he dared not approach velixar would expect him to flee there but he was as home in the wild as he was in any town he halted his run and fell to one knee his adrenaline was still high but deep inside he knew he had to find a place to rest the real pain was coming a glance behind did little to raise his spirits he saw at least thirty undead shambling as fast as they could in a widening arc if he remained where he was he would be seen he struggled to his feet and ran more minutes passed the glow of woodhaven drifted behind him breathing was agony moving was torment all his extremities grew cold and his head felt light the pain in his shoulder was eager to send him into shock it was just waiting for his body to succumb his eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover the forest was too far and all about was shinhigh grass no choice he gasped his entire right half of his body ached celestia grant me mercy i cannot go further he stumbled to the ground his face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns but with just grass to aid him it would be difficult to go unnoticed still he had no choice but to try he tucked his bow beneath him and then smashed his face into the dirt while sprinkling grass atop his head he shifted his legs back and forth until as much grass sprang up around them as possible he covered the rest of his body with his cloak a few words of magic shifted its colors better emulating the nearby terrain he tucked his arms underneath him closed his eyes and waited for his fate for the longest of time silence his shoulder pounded with each heartbeat his chest screamed with each breath a soft breeze teased his cloak and hair colors swam across his eyes his ears incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves strained for the sound of approaching dead he heard nothing but a strange ringing inside his skull it seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought a footstep fell beside his head his heart and lungs halted the pain had dwindled his skills they were atop him he thought a silent prayer to celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him he guessed at least ten he dared not move soft clacking sounds of bone swinging metal and crushed grass erased the silence of the night dieredons heart resumed his breathing continued slow and steady he fought down a laugh despite all his training as dire as his situation seemed he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived three times even then his ears heard what he had feared something walking directly behind him the others might not see him but seeing wouldnt be necessary if one stumbled directly atop his prone body his good hand fingered the bow pinned beneath him if discovered he would die fighting the footsteps neared a clacking sound haunted his hearing it rattled sporadically and it was most certainly bone hitting bone he imagined a loose jaw hanging by only one side or perhaps a hand held by a thread of flesh banging against a rotted femur it took all his will not to scream when a great weight pressed against his shoulder pain exploded throughout his body so great that he blacked out as he lay there in the grass a horde of undead searching for his wounded form a s dieredon fought for his life harruq and qurrah snuck their way through the streets of woodhaven they avoided the light of lamps at all costs and stopped only a moment so harruq could don his new armor they had to be careful for if any saw the two halforcs traveling amid the dark their lives would be forfeit when they neared celed qurrah halted he stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes harruq waited in silence that is the way qurrah said it will be the only gated home i already see it harruq said he pointed at a sizable mansion that stood out above the smaller nearby homes the two brothers hurried into the space between the fence and the surrounding buildings it seems our friend has some prominence qurrah said harruq nodded in agreement the twostory mansion was beautifully painted and decorated the sides of the building were a deep brown like the trunk of an ancient tree the roof jutted out far past the walls it was the color of wet leaves many windows decorated the front all covered with silken curtains the fence surrounded the entire property black iron spiked ten feet at the top how do we get in harruq asked qurrah examined the fence his face locked in a frown i dont know i have no spells that can aid us the bigger halforc stood and stretched his muscles well up to me then he took out condemnation grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face lets see how strong this girl is he swung the blade qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence if any did they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword two of the bars harruq cut cleanly and a third he dented in enough so that a follow up chop sliced it like butter pleased harruq reached up and took two of the bars into his hands his neck bulged his arm muscles tensed and then the iron screeched backward both winced at the noise they did not move for the next five minutes when both felt comfortable harruq shoved the third bar forward giving them a nice clean entrance the two brothers slipped under the bigger halforc having to squeeze his arms together to manage his way through they slunk across the lawn to the front door hold qurrah said softly i will take care of this harruq shrugged and let his brother work qurrah stood erect his hands touching the sturdy oak words of magic slipped from his lips the shadows that weaved about the door suddenly gained life crawling and gliding until impenetrable darkness covered every bit of oak whatd that do harruq asked his deep voice seemed like thunder in the quiet although he did his best to speak softly follow me qurrah whispered you will see he took a step forward and vanished into the shadows harruq glanced around swallowed took two quick breaths and then hopped into the door with his eyes squeezed shut he expected to thud against wood feel a strange sense of vertigo or some other bizarre sensation usually accompanied with magic instead he felt only the slightest tingle of cold air before his feet thumped against the floor he opened his eyes to see a posh living room decorated with red and gold furniture silk sheets and a lit fireplace everything oozed elegance to a point that even the halforcs knew was over the top when harruq looked behind him the darkness had left the door why did you not do that to the gate he asked i can let us pass but a single object at a time qurrah whispered the bars had gaps between them harruq gestured to the room amazing no one ever robbed this guy before he said qurrah shot him a glance his meaning clear the halforc shrugged drew his swords and began walking a sleek staircase led to the upper floor while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food which way do we go harruq asked up qurrah said and quiet before you wake him too late said a voice from the stairs both turned to see ahrqur standing at the top step his arms crossed he was dressed in a long green robe silver swirls marked the sleeves and front brown hair fell far past his shoulders pleased to meet you harruq said with a bow indeed qurrah said his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe if you are thieves you are certainly incompetent ones ahrqur said his voice filled with contempt he descended halfway down the stairs his eyes never leaving the two of course what could one expect from celestias cursed we are not thieves ahrqur tundel qurrah said we are assassins the whip writhed around his arm begging for use arrogant ones at that said the elf such a claim is foolish if you were assassins you would strike without chatter you are nothing but pretenders harruq clanged his swords together showering the ground with sparks his armor shimmered as his anger grew pretenders with wonderful toys the elf continued eyeing harruqs blades toys i will take from your dead bodies he leapt down the stairs in a single bound his feet hardly touched before he was vaulting over a red silk couch to land before the fireplace he drew an ornate sword that hung over the fireplace letting the scabbard fall to the floor the blade gleamed in the firelight impossibly sharp and deadly i have killed a hundred like you ahrqur said and i hope to kill a thousand just like you harruq said clanging his swords together one more time before lunging across the room salvation and condemnation smacked hard against ahrqurs blade the weapons sparked all three of the swords imbued with powerful magic the elf fell back his arms lacking the strength to block the massive blow he danced away his sword whirling upward to deflect two quick slashes by the halforc ahrqur found no reprieve for three bones flew for his eyes and face even veering to follow the elfs dodges the elven blade whirled cutting two out of the air the third smacked into his throat luckily the bone was part of a finger and lacked a sharp enough edge to cut skin instead the elf was left gasping for air and retreating from another series of strikes from harruq pretenders are we qurrah asked as his fingers performed a dark weave how much i wish for your pride to suffer magical energy ripped out of him and tore across the air the elf whirled sensing the incoming invisible blow only a tiny part hit his shoulder immediately encasing it with ice then harruq was upon him slashing recklessly ahrqur batted his sword left and right then jumped as harruq swung back in a scissorcut that should have shredded his waist the elf landed atop one of his couches balancing with ease what reason do you have to kill me the elf asked are you here for money i could pay you twice the pittance you work for just shut up harruq said hurling salvation across the room ahrqur leapt again the sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall the halforc gripped condemnation in both hands snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series the elven blade glided through the air repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that harruqs sword danced about for phantom blows ahrqur let out a mocking laugh gave him an obvious feint and then kicked high the foot smashed the bottom of harruqs chin the same sore part dieredon had hit harruq staggered back his sword swinging wildly the elf charged in knowing he outmatched the halforc in speed and skill the kill would be his hemorrhage pain exploded across ahrqurs side the force smashed him into a decorative table he rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe despite the wound no cut or hole was visible in the cloth you are pathetic ahrqur qurrah said his hands whirling you are skilled but you are soft you lack spirit you lack will it is why you cannot resist my power hemorrhage a visible wave of distorted reality crossed the distance between the necromancer and ahrqur the elf crossed his arms against the blow his mind was nearly overwhelmed by the sudden pain that hit him blood splattered from two horrid gashes along his forearms soaking the carpet crimson he collapsed to one knee his hands latched around his sword he tried to bring up the blade but all the strength had left his hands he had lost too much blood when harruq came charging forward condemnation red and hungry all he could do was dodge condemnation shattered what remained of the table the elf rolled his arms tucked against his chest when he pulled out of the roll he dashed for a large dresser inside was a stash of healing potions all he needed was one and he could fight again just one as he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back halting his momentum he crashed to the floor screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard then he felt his ankle start to burn take him brother qurrah said his whip wrapped around ahrqurs left foot harruq did not bother to cross the distance he had had enough condemnation flew through the air its aim true the blade sank into the elfs back blood and fluid covered the carpet as all life fled the body of ahrqur tundel harruq crossed the room the sound of his ragged breathing filling the sudden quiet he drew out his sword grimacing at the sick wet sound it made what do we do about all the blood he asked we will clean it but first we must drain the body the two dug through dressers upstairs grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts they then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes in a corner they dug a large hole and then bled the body dry letting the fluids soak into the dirt occasionally they would halt and listen worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears no curious investigators arrived however and they continued with their dark deed when the blood dripping from the elfs wounds became but a trickle they filled the hole and moved on using the clothes and robes from upstairs the two brothers wiped away as much of ahrqurs blood as they could the bloody clothes the table and the pieces of glass they tossed onto the fireplace and burned harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet grab the sword he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder i have it qurrah said retrieving the elven blade and its dark green sheath from the floor they gave one last look around everything was back in place no drawers remained open or scattered no blood stained the floor and only the sword that used to hang above the fireplace was blatantly missing come brother the night is waning fast qurrah said harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position lead the way the two slipped out the front door and into the night upon arriving home harruq tossed the body into the far room stripped off his gorgeous black armor and plopped down onto the bed nighters qurrah he said sorry but that elfie wore me out and i never thought cleaning a place could be so tiring i need to rest good night then qurrah replied crawling onto his side of the uncomfortable bed he curled his rags about him and drifted off to sleep pleasant memories of the battle looping in his mind dieredon was stunned by the simple fact that he was awake he had expected death he had also expected darkness instead the welcoming light of morning met his eyes when he leaned up and looked around the elf smiled then laughed they had walked right over him but not seen him thank you celestia he said his smile remaining even as the pain in his ribs and shoulder reawakened the pain however paled compared to the previous night he sat up still cradling his right arm a look around showed no sign of velixar or his undead the morning continued to improve the elf pulled out a roll of thick cloth from a knapsack and began bandaging his wounds aurelia we need to talk dieredon said while fashioning a sling for his right arm those halforcs have some very interesting friends he stood tested the tightness of his bandages took up his bow and then headed for town h arruq awoke late the next morning his tired eyes winced as sunshine streamed into them from the ceiling he covered his face with an arm moaning against the evils of interrupted sleep then he remembered aurelia aaah ill be late he said he rubbed his eyes once and then blinked when he saw his brother leaning against the far wall waiting for him what will you be late for qurrah asked his voice hinting only mild curiosity but his eyes revealing otherwise nothing just my practice is all indeed your practice i have held my tongue harruq but i will hold it no longer your hair is cut you come back every morning bruised what is it that you hide from me harruq lowered his eyes in shame its noti didnt mean anything what is it harruq tell me the truth iive been training with someone qurrah crossed his arms who is he the halforc chuckled she not he she saved my life and shes also been teaching me to read how did she save your life qurrah asked remember a few months back when i came home beaten bloody and blue he asked guards caught me trying to sneak inside maggies tavern they attacked me said they were going to arrest me as the forest butcher aurelia stopped them qurrah rubbed his chin lost in thought he glanced at harruq a tiny smile forming on his face may i meet her harruq immediately began blubbering no but you see i dont know if shes ready and you might noti need to let her know youre coming first qurrah chuckled why do you worry the big halforc let his gaze drop back down to the floor shes an elf is that alright qurrah walked over and put a hand on harruqs shoulder you may be with whoever you wish my dear brother just do not try to deceive me harruq nodded alright then you can come this morning we got to hurry though or well be late i am ready qurrah said when you are ready lead on the big halforc flew about their home grabbing his old swords and donning his faded leather armor when ready he nodded to qurrah who let out a rare laugh you are amusing brother was all he said before following him out t his is it harruq said as he gestured about the small clearing he and aurelia sparred in where is she qurrah asked harruq shrugged in response shes never here she always shows up after i do the smaller halforc scanned the area seeing no sign of the elf perhaps she is not coming qurrah offered you are late after all on the other hand perhaps i scared her off i do have a creepy aura about me wouldnt you agree suuuure qurrah harruq said crossing his arms as he waited youre big and scary and send little kiddies running when they see you on the street i wouldnt be surprised said a female voice behind the two brothers any man who would hang out with a brute like harruq must be a disturbed individual both turned to see aurelia step out from behind a tree she smiled at harruq and then nodded to his brother care to introduce me oh yeah this is qurrah tun my lady qurrah said with a bow that sent harruqs jaw dropping it is a pleasure to meet you may i have the name of the one who has brought civility to my brother aurelia laughed at harruqs flabbergasted look i am aurelia thyne she said offering a quick curtsy and it will take years to civilize that big lug im not sure i have the patience if your patience matches your beauty then my brother will soon be dressed in nobles finest sipping wine and commenting on the taxing errors of our dear king of neldar aurelia blushed she smiled at qurrah you surprise me it truly is a pleasure to meet you and it is a pleasure to meet the elf that my brother is so smitten for aurelia giggled at harruqs squirming hes a loveable puppy dog but i do not think he is smitten are you harruq um course not the halforc said aurelia and qurrah shared a quick knowing smile the frail halforcs face lost much of its lifelessness and a gentle caring filled his eyes his seriousness quickly buried it but aurelia had seen enough i shall leave you two to your studies and sparring qurrah said after a long pause to torture harruq although i doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone with such a beautiful teacher good thing you will not have to worry about that considering i see no beautiful teachers around aurelia replied qurrah walked to aurelia and bowed again taking her hand in his and kissing it as aurelia smiled he rose and whispered into her ear he loves you elf i can feel it do you love him back i dont know she whispered will you hurt him never then accept my blessing finished qurrah bowed once more wished his brother good luck and then trudged through the forest toward woodhaven when he was out of earshot aurelia walked over to harruq and jabbed him in the side with a finger now why did you take so long to let me meet him she asked i but he but no buts he was a perfect gentleman the halforc threw his arms up in surrender me just be all stoopid he said aurelia twisted her fingers and whispered causing a magical spring of water to burst up from the ground the spring vanished quickly as it came leaving a soaked harruq glaring at aurelia speak properly the elf warned or another bath for you buh wuh you harruq stammered yes dear harruq nothing he grumbled walking over to her before she could react he swooped her off her feet and bearhugged her soaking her dress he then set her down ignoring her openpalm smacks to the side of his head stupid halforc she muttered ready to teach me to read all smartylike yes just one second vines emerged from the woods and wrapped around harruqs arms and legs lifting him off the ground and holding him snugly in place the elf grinned crossing her arms over her wet dress um why am i hanging from the air like this he asked a spring of water soaked him felt like it she answered oh alright should we start sure aurelia took out a small book and levitated it before harruq letting him read aloud whenever he purposely erred or took too long on a page the elf blasted his face with cold water it was an effective teaching method when the halforc finally finished the book aurelia let it slowly descend to her hands why does your brother speak so strangely she asked trying to broach the subject casually she sat stretched out on the grass her legs crossed and her weight leaning back on her arms the whole time they had taught she had found her mind wandering to the sick spidery voice qurrah spoke in a voice that had nearly spoiled his otherwise surprising charm qurrah was sold to a necromancer i told you that right aurelia nodded i believe you did well he caught my brother practicing a spell once qurrah was forbidden from ever casting magic yet he tried anyway hes like that always been always will anyway his master took a hot poker and shoved it down his throat said that way hed never cast again harruq chuckled he was wrong obviously qurrah was stuck talking like that like a snake hiss or a raspy whisper or a dying man aurelia whispered so soft that harruq could not make out her words could you let me down now the halforc asked aurelia shrugged ready to spar you bet the elf ordered the vines to release him harruq landed with a plop a drippy mess in stinking leather armor sparring time he said as he rose to his feet im ready waterboy aurelia said taking up her staff and charging t he streets were all the same to him so down them all he wandered the image of aurelia and harruq danced in his mind and conflicting feelings tore up and down his chest she seems a kind enough elf qurrah said talking to himself since he had no one else beautiful as well of course harruq would be attracted to her we have elven blood in our veins do we not the words felt hollow against the constant ache in his heart hard as he tried he could not place it was it anger no surprise a little perhaps jealousy certainly not worry fear doubt the only emotion he was certain of was confusion so he walked and would walk for the rest of the morning wishing there was something he could do to banish the sick hollow feeling in his stomach there was nothing he knew to do though and that made it so much worse t heir sparring ended harruq and aurelia sat sidebyside against a tree both glistening with sweat getting better the halforc said youre going to be beating the orcy out of me in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are dont worry she said patting his hand your orcy is safe with me harruq laughed at the absurdity of what she said aurelia meanwhile absently drew lines in the dirt he watched for a moment suddenly nervous and quiet the words of his brother echoed in his head aurry he asked you said most elves remember when men were createddo you know how orcs were made the elf looked at him she was trying to read him harruq could tell but he endured it without protest when ashhur and karak warred there were elves that sought to end their war she said against celestias orders they joined karak hoping with their aid the conflict would finally end when our goddess imprisoned the two gods she cursed those elves she stripped them of their beauty their intelligence and their long life they werent evil harruq but karak offered them strength and they accepted it the dark god drove them to war against elves and men finally the orcs were banished to the vile wedge between the rivers do any still worship karak most dont aurelia said theyve turned to worshipping animals now ive even heard of some worshipping celestia once more hoping she will forgive them and remove their curse they are a sad race harruq but believe me in saying there is no shame in your blood the halforc shifted uncomfortably unable to meet aurelias eyes he watched her trace lines in the grass seeking a way to lighten the mood he asked her how to spell his name harruq she asked hrm my best guess would be harruk a soft blow of air from her lips turned the grass to dirt so that a large space lay available for her to write on she wrote harruk in the dirt with her finger spacing out each letter harruq stared at the words representing his name feeling a tiny thrill how about my last name tun she wrote out tun the halforc stared absorbing every detail of his name can i see your name he asked aurelia nodded tracing her hand across the dirt aurelia the halforc smiled at the name it even looks all pretty he said eliciting a laugh do qurrah now aurelia did not begin writing immediately instead thinking over the pronunciation qurrah she said at last it is a little tricky but i bet it is spelled like this letter by letter she wrote qurrah in the dirt harruq stared at it whispering his brothers name as his eyes traced the letters as he did a thought hit him his eyes went back and forth from his own name and qurrahs you spelled my name wrong harruq said what how the halforc reached over erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy capitalized q at the end he leaned back and smiled the name in the dirt now read harruq why did you change it she asked its a rather odd spelling look at my brothers name he said aurelia did and then she saw what harruq had also seen your name is your brothers only backwards yup harruq laughed mum was always smart for an orc even knew how to read if you believe that bet she did that on purpose yes but why harruq shrugged thought she was being clever who knows but i can spell my name now good for you aurelia laughed now go on home you bother me and you smell well fine then the halforc said feigning insult me know when me no wanted such a purposeful use of poor grammar could not go unpunished harruq dodged the first two springs of water but the third one caught him square in the face he was still dripping when he arrived home you and her go swimming qurrah asked him shaddup was all he said qurrah laughed the pit in his stomach suddenly didnt seem so awful a urelia dieredon screamed to the wilderness birds whistled back but no elven voice spoke back aurelia he shouted again wincing at the pain in his chest after arriving in town he had found one of his stashed healing potions and downed it his ribs had gone from several pieces to just a single break and his shoulder was slowly regaining strength it would still be days before he was back to full health days he did not have to spare im here aurelia said after the third yell from dieredon the elf turned and smiled at her even though she winced and moved to examine his arm which remained in a sling they are nothing he told her please you must listen to me stay away from the halforcs they arent safe nonsense she said she guided a hand across his chest feeling the break her hand then traveled to his shoulder and a deep frown grew across her face what did this to you she asked the man in black the one continuing to train the halforcs i approached him last night he nearly killed me harruq is no threat to me aurelia insisted and i have met qurrah he showed me nothing but kindness then it is a false kindness dieredon said he paused for a moment grabbed his chest with his healthy arm and then looked up at her again pain was evident in his eyes that man has an army of undead i barely managed to hide until daylight woodhaven is in danger and so are you aurelia stepped back frowning are you sure it was harruq i saw the warrior with my own eyes i ignored them and went after the master just as you asked he gestured to his wounds you can see my reward i could not kill him there are very few i cannot kill aurelia and i do not appreciate adding another to that list i will still see him aurelia said i will be careful but i will still see him he needs me i know it dieredon gave a oneshoulder shrug very well i will trust you aurelia he turned to go aurelia grabbed his hand and stopped him where will you go the elf glanced back to her war is coming i must alert my kin if this man and his army do attack woodhaven he will find the quellan army descending upon him from the sky besides i have been separated from sonowin far too long i miss her aurelia smiled for the first since she had seen dieredon i am surprised you have gone so long without retrieving her aurelia said she is a beautiful horse i wish to see her when you return i promise dieredon said aurelia released his hand may celestia watch over you she said as he left and she over you dieredon replied then he was gone through the forest and back into town there he bought a sturdy horse and began his long ride south to the quellan forest i t is a beautiful blade harruq said examining the elven weapon that had belonged to ahrqur they were killing the final hour before dark then they would hoist the wrapped body onto harruqs shoulder and sneak out of town qurrah sat meditating in a corner while harruq yammered to himself the blade was in one hand the decorative scabbard in the other he was a skilled swordsman qurrah said he was also arrogant i would expect such a blade from one like him harruq shrugged if i didnt have my own two swords id use it the halforc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it he turned the weapon over in his hands marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black he paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt tundel harruq read aloud slowly and carefully he even has his name on his sword did i not say he was arrogant harruq stared at the name on the scabbard mesmerized by the beauty of the writing he ran his fingers over it enjoying the feeling of pure gold when he covered the second half he paused qurrah harruq said look at this the bigger halforc shifted the blade so that his brother could see he kept his hand where it was qurrah read the name and then glanced at his brother that is our last name harruq nodded aurelia showed me t u n she said and then this sword here has our namekind of qurrah stared at the name thinking he was an elf he said i guess it is possible he was our father although i feel it more likely a coincidence our mother was intelligent at least for an orc but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names well hes dead now so well never know harruq said tossing the blade onto the floor qurrah however was far from dismayed he grinned at his brother and then spoke in his hissing voice would you like to have a conversation with our dear old dad he asked the body of ahrqur tundel lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt he remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two halforcs had used to smuggle him out of his house the wrappings provided a bit of cover against the growing smell of death that already permeated their home his spirit will be bound to mine qurrah said sitting on his knees before the body his eyes were closed and his hands atop ahrqurs head any question you or i ask he must answer truthfully do not be disturbed by the sound he first makes spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey harruq nodded dressed in his black armor they did not have much time before velixars dark cloud arrived they could not rush but nor could they dawdle qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell the words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in cornrows the bigger halforc was aware of subtle differences but had little clue to what they were words of power were beyond his understanding the body quivered but it was not a physical quiver translucent silver crept about the wraps blue smoke floated into the air the blue and silver grew thicker and thicker qurrahs words grew louder more powerful and then ahrqurs spirit ripped into the air a glowing bluesilver form of insanity the spirit looked much as he did in life except his clothes were different they were silvery robes beautiful and decadent the spirit wailed it took all of harruqs strength to resist the urge to plug his ears with his hands cease such nonsense qurrah ordered the spirit immediately hushed a bit of coherence came to his eyes and he glared down at the halforc greetings ahrqur qurrah said remember us the incompetent thieves the spirit glared harder did his tongue die with him harruq asked i havent told him he can speak yet qurrah responded his eyes flicked back from harruq to the spirit you may talk spirit but keep it quiet you take my life and now you dare keep me from eternity the spirit said for what reason do you torment me i have never harmed you never said a cursing word but now this just a few questions and you may return to your slumber qurrah paused a smile growing across his lips tell me did you ever sleep with an orcish woman the spirit recoiled as if struck you dare ask me if i ever committed an act so disgraceful and answer me the cry from qurrah rolled over him like a horde of stampeding horses yes ahrqur said the words dripped out of his mouth quiet and disgusted yes once harruq shook his head hardly able to believe it you did he asked how long ago many years fifteen twenty why did you sleep with her qurrah asked she filled me with drink and then tricked me the elven spirit said never would i willingly have touched one of celestias cursed qurrah shook his head answer me truthfully you wretched spirit was it willing or was it not the spirit gave no answer the halforc stood his hands clenched into fists he hooked them through the air as he repeated his question was it willing or not he demanded yes ahrqur whispered grimacing as if filled with horrid pain when she approached me i offered no resistance now will you let me return to peace not yet harruq would you like to tell him ahrqur glanced at harruq who was grinning wide you can see we have orcish blood in us right harruq asked aye you stink of it the spirit said well we also have elven blood in us our mum said she bedded an elf before she was thrown out of town so guess what im thinking were the children you sired with that orc lady so many years ago the glow of the spirit faded it looked back and forth shaking and moaning you cannot be bastard children of mine ahrqur said his voice weak and distant celestia cannot hate me so celestia has nothing to do with this qurrah said it is truth almost all the spirits glow was gone only hatred and disgust lingered in his eyes may i be released now wretched spawn of mine ahrqur asked yes go rest in your shame i have no use for you the spirit gave qurrah one last glare then dissipated into the fading light silence filled the room well what did you think asked harruq i think qurrah said that was enjoyable the two paused each thinking the same thing finally harruq voiced his thoughts you think velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him qurrah stretched letting out a small sigh as his back popped yes i do he said although i dont know why a test of some sort perhaps getting tired of tests harruq said keep such thoughts buried and dead qurrah pointed to the door the cloud of darkness waited bring the body e xcellent velixar beamed at his two disciples at his feet lay the still wrapped body of ahrqur tundel was a skilled swordmaster you both have proven yourselves as strong as i believed unwrap the body it is time we begin much preparation later qurrah and velixar stood on opposite sides of a naked ahrqur the elf lay on his back thin scars and symbols decorated his body including a slanted y across his forehead thirteen stones surrounded the corpse each dabbed with a bit of qurrahs blood velixar held a piece of ahrqurs flesh in his right hand are you ready velixar asked his disciple yes master qurrah said the elder necromancer crushed the flesh in his grip signaling the start of his casting dark whispering words flowed from his lips ominous in the starlight as the minutes passed the blood on the stones began to glow qurrah took up his own chant a single phrase he was to repeat so that the spirit of ahrqur could not flee once velixar summoned it drak thun drak thaye kaer vrek thal luen he chanted a part of him shivered the words so similar to black words master had spoken before the hyenamen had come he repeated his designated phrase feeling the magic flowing from him to encircle the body kala mar yund cthular velixar shrieked in a voice stronger than his frail form should have possessed the call echoed throughout the night sending wolves yipping away and night owls crashing in a squawking frenzy the symbols on the body flared to a brilliant crimson a sense of exaltation soared through both necromancers as ahrqur opened his eyes and snarled rise slave velixar commanded your soul is trapped in your body and answers only my command the naked elf rose his eyes burning with red rage the symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars give him his clothes velixar ordered his student qurrah fetched a pair of black pants a red shirt and a black cloak all of which velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him dress the necromancer ordered ahrqur growled some inane argument but a glare from velixar sent him cowering you must obey my every command wretch before you may return to the peaceful death you left fight me and you shall find your stay here spanning time greater than your understanding the undead ahrqur whimpered qurrah watched the display fighting against feelings of jealousy he had commanded ahrqurs spirit to speak truthfully but velixars very glare sent him groveling to his knees the elf stood and dressed covering his white form in the red and black garb once dressed harruq gave him the ornate elven blade your quest is a simple one he told his slave go to veldaren do whatever you must to sneak into the kings castle kill if needed when you find king vaelor wound him but do not kill him do not be captured either die in combat ahrqur nodded his eyes seething velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elfs forehead qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact yet neither flinched when the necromancer drew back his hand a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted y it was of a fallen man wreathed in flame when you fall the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash then your soul may find peace i shall do as you command ahrqur said in a lifeless voice of course velixar said there is no other way ahrqur glanced to qurrah and his mouth opened to speak both tun brothers felt a bit of panic wondering what their new master might say if he learned what they had done instead he closed his mouth and glared at velixar one last time before running north on legs that would never tire when will you know of his success or failure qurrah asked once his eyes could no longer perceive the elfs faint outline immediately velixar whispered all he sees i see all he hears i hear his thoughts dreams and nightmares are available to me hidden behind locked doors to which i now hold the key again qurrah lusted for such power and control velixar smiled clearly seeing the desire the halforc hid behind his eyes one day you will hold such control for now be content with what i have to teach you and that is master a wicked smile grew across velixars face all that i know qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded i believe that shall suffice harruq did not know why but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach t he next morning harruq met aurelia as usual the elf said nothing of what dieredon told her instead focusing on teaching the halforc how to read the dogcassid the cat chased oh the dog chased the cat a page turned the catwhats that say climbed ah the cat climbed the tree good stop treating me like that like what a little kid i know this book is for kiddies you dont have to keep reminding me awwww does da liddle widdy biddy halforcy feel all stoopywoopy im going to smack you just shut up and read fine the dog circled the tree but could not get the cat it was too high excellent aurry yes harruq a pause wisdom prevailed the cat was worried he could not get down sounds like a certain halforc i know the cats in a tree not vines want to change that youre going to write in the book i meant you not the cat another pause so the cat waited in the tree as the dog barked the dog got tired and fell asleep the cat was happy he climbed down the tree then the cat clawed out the eyes of the doggie and bit his throat thats not what it says does too where rightthere thumping footsteps of a heavy person running soft footsteps chased after then the sound of a great babbling spring quickly followed by cursing and grumbling t he night was hot and miserable when velixar met the halforc brothers and told them the news they had long waited to hear ahrqur was successful and in ways beyond what i could have hoped for he told them joy dancing in his features king vaelor has long felt inferior to the kings of his past i have haunted his dreams and i know his heart he wishes a war with the elves to prove his worth ahrqur gave him his reason and it was beautiful what is it your slave did qurrah asked in a court full of human nobles he broke through slew four of them and then took the kings left ear velixar laughed he killed five guards before he was slain two more died in the fiery consumption of his corpse qurrah smiled at the image harruqs blood heated at the thought of battle but the coldness in his stomach refused to succumb vaelor cannot yet risk war velixar continued he must have all the people see him as a peaceful man driven to conflict history does not favor the warmongers not among the peasants and scribes they favor socalled great men driven to war by horrid acts of others the man in black spat his disdain it is a sad age when conquerors are seen as warmongering butchers and the cowards backed into corners are seen as the true heroes ashhur can be blamed for poisoning so many with such rubbish what will the king do asked harruq his hands rubbing the hilts of his blades he has already evicted elven blood from his kingdom woodhaven however still contains hundreds of elves in his pride vaelor will demand them to leave a messenger is already en route i have haunted his dreams as well he is but a distant cousin to the king spoiled and stupid he carries orders to the elves of woodhaven leave or die they will never leave qurrah said they are stubborn and will defend their homes until death it is more than that velixar said the quellan elves have already been pushed across the rivers by the mordan people both races of elves fear for their existence celestia has grown distant to her clerics mankind breeds like mice while the elves find themselves gradually dwindling a man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust what are we to do qurrah asked velixar looked at him and smiled kill the messenger and the guards that accompany him vaelor will be furious at the death of family however distant he will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes will you accompany us qurrah asked velixar shook his head bring me the head of the messenger i will retrieve an elf to deliver it to the king the man in black stood and motioned to the stars follow the left wing he said his finger pointing to the constellation in the stars referred to as the raven it will not be long before you see the light of their campfire make haste the battle grows closer with every move we make yes master they echoed before beginning their trek i t was not long before they saw the firelight in the distance can you run brother harruq asked no i cannot the night is long please i will hurry but let me rest when i must course ill let you rest when you need it come on lets go they stopped twice for qurrah to catch his breath his weak body gasped for air sweat lining his face and neck in the starlight he looked so pale so frail that harruq wondered how his brother could be so fearsome in combat when they neared the firelight they stopped to plan so what should we do harruq asked they are not asleep qurrah said something keeps them awake i fear they know of our arrival velixar i believe so he tests us again harruq patted his swords so be it whats the plan qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire they kept their backs to the fire and sat far enough away so their eyes would not fully adjust to its light they camped within a sparse copse of trees the trunks not near thick enough to hide their approach they are wise and alert he whispered perhaps i can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two of them they are on flat ground so i see no way to ambush them then why dont we just walk over say hello and then whack em harruq asked my dear brother qurrah said that is a very good question brazenly they approached the campfire they kept their weapons sheathed and hidden the closer they got before the men panicked the better halt who goes there one of the guards shouted to them as they neared they wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight the crest of neldar adorned their tabards longswords hung from their belts me be harruq tun the halforc said as he stepped further into the light grinning stupidly and this be me brother qurrah get back you smelly thing the other guard said both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls they still wore their chainmail proof something had disturbed them greatly sleeping in armor was far from comfortable me only a little smelly harruq slurred do you have any food me be starving and me brother no be feelin too good just look at him qurrah chuckled at the act while his whip writhed unseen about his arm what is going on asked a whiny little voice from the lone tent a skinny man in purple and red emerged stinking of perfume it is nothing one of the guards said harruq held in a chuckle it was obvious the guard had little love for the disgusting noble nothing by ashhur it is the smelliest dirtiest nothing i have ever seen shoo you foul beast we have no need of your stench you have little need of what we bring qurrah said the whip uncurling from his arm and falling to the dirt with a thought the black leather burst into flames assassins a guard shouted drawing his blade the other guards six in total did the same the perfumed man in the center shook as he realized combat was about to erupt it is seven against two you stupid pigs he shouted what are you thinking that you will die last qurrah said before casting his first spell the fire in the center of the camp flickered and then died the halforcs through their mixed blood could see well in the darkness the humans had no such natural ability until their eyes adjusted to the moonlight the only thing they could see was their burning red eyes the demonic glow of harruqs blades and the fire that burned but did not consume qurrahs whip in that darkness they were demons of another plane furious and merciless the men fought but their hearts were afraid qurrah could sense it and knew the battle was already theirs harruq bellowed a battle cry clanging his swords together for effect the guards gathered as best they could forming a wall in front of the perfumed noble harruq charged a roar rolling out his mouth like a tornado it was loud strong and seemed to shake the earth to those before it when he crashed into the line of guards the blood ran quick and free of the seven only two stood their ground against the glowing blades one swung his sword in a high round arc while the other stabbed his blade forward hoping to gut the halforc because of his charge harruqs charge though was far from mindless with speed far beyond the guards he knocked the stab away then shifted his weight so that both salvation and condemnation blocked the other attack the weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords with one weaponless and the other horribly positioned the two were defenseless salvation took a throat condemnation pierced rib and lung harruq ripped his blade out of the guards chest and shoved the body to the side the dying heap of flesh collided with two other men knocking them back and delaying their attack he mocked them adrenaline flooding his veins is that all you can do he screamed wheres the fun in this heres your fun one said stabbing in at harruqs side from behind the blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh the halforc roared and then moved with speed that left the expert guard breathless his upper body jerked left and then twisted preventing the sword from going in any further salvation swung around ringing against the blade condemnation followed through aimed straight for the guards throat the guard ducked underneath the swing feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head then he was up both hands gripping his sword tightly harruq came charging in both swords striking the guard parried one after the other constantly retreating the others came to his aid swinging careful tentative blows all three tried to engage without being put at risk much like men prodding a bull of course the result was similar the bull got madder if youre gonna fight me fight me he yelled he ignored several strikes accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent the two engaged for three seconds the sound of steel was quick and brutal but after the humiliation against dieredon harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand at the end of the three seconds both of his blades had found flesh the guard fell at his feet bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly splattered with blood harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was the remaining two facing him were trained well they held firm when harruq charged and stayed close together because of this they managed to survive the initial onslaught d o not come closer qurrah said cracking his whip across the grass fire spread before his feet black with smoke the two guards ignored his threats knowing the difficulty in using a whip in melee combat casting magic would also be a great risk they only needed to close the distance and qurrah was theirs however knowing was easier than doing much easier when the two tried to close in qurrah lashed out with his whip one ducked away in fear the other managed to deflect the lash and then charge his sword leading the flaming leather curled back around like a living thing qurrah sent it at the closer man he blocked and then realized blocking was what the whip wanted him to do a cocoon of fiery leather enveloped his sword and a violent jerk by qurrah staggered him closer the halforcs free hand reached out a soft blue enveloped it as he whispered words of a spell his hand touched the chest of the guard frost spread out across the mans tunic then seeped inward as the guard screamed out in horrid pain the scream halted as quickly as it had begun the frost had reached his lungs encircled them and then frozen them still the man retched silently qurrah ignored him knowing he would soon be dead the other guard charged qurrah slashing with his longsword the necromancer smirked lashing with his whip the flaming leather wrapped around the guards sword hand charring flesh to bone as he screamed the blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him able to glimpse bits of white bone in the dark mercy he begged falling to his knees as the necromancer approached there is no such thing qurrah said before magically hurling two pieces of bone through the mans eyes he turned to the other guard who still gasped in vain for air he watched until death claimed him h arruq relished the feeling of true combat against skilled opponents one would slash out hoping for an opening then back away as the other guard lunged preventing harruq from any chance to counter blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts the pain was good it helped focus his mind it also fed his rage kill me he shouted to one guard after another hit and fade he smacked away a thrust but did not attempt to counter can you not kill me he asked holding his swords out wide neither one attacked instead holding their swords in defensive positions harruq shook his head feeling his anger growing these men did not fight with their hearts they fought with their heads such foolishness could not be tolerated fine ill show you a real warrior he said his muscles tensed his legs bulged and then he charged the two oblivious to his own safety the guards could not hurt him he would not let them he was a moving mountain of muscle dangerous and powerful the meager defenses of the guards faltered one tried to block as condemnation came for his head the blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two the other brought his sword down too late salvation tore through his chainmail harruq whirled on him a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand helpless the man staggered backward clutching his wounded side his eyes pleaded but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words harruq cut him again and again his arms his chest his face it all bled but he remained alive at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissorcut his neck harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him full of pride qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky please leave me be i can give you gold slaves whatever you want i can get for you qurrah chuckled tie the bonds tighter i do not want him breaking my concentration harruq nodded yanking harder on the knot that held the nobles hands behind his back he was on his knees his silk outfit stained by grass and dirt blood ran from where harruq had broken his nose name a price name it anything just name it harruq glanced at qurrah who only chuckled louder we have little need for riches noble all we want is you the man paled me what do you want me for the elvesthey sent you to attack me didnt they whatever they paid you i can double it triple it qurrah shook his head no elf hired us and no gold was put in our pockets the flaming whip appeared charring grass as it touched the ground then what do you want with me the man shrieked youll see harruq whispered into his ear before backing away the eyes of the nobleman grew wider and panic gripped him entirely no no you cant you wouldnt please i beg of you dont enough qurrah said his hand reached out the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the mans face whispering words of magic flowed from the necromancers mouth the nobles jaw dropped and black veins appeared on his eyes by the gods what is that harruq followed the mans upward gaze but saw only clear night sky keep it away from me the man shouted as qurrah released his hand and backed away a glint of pleasure shone in his eyes as he watched his handiwork the nobleman struggled against the ropes his gaze locked on the sky please no take it away ill do anything anything just keep it away dont let it touch me please please dont let it touch me the next two minutes the man screamed then he died what did you do to him harruq asked once the man was done fear is an entertaining weapon is it not the warrior shook his head in wonder but qurrah said no more do we leave the bodies here harruq asked the necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer instead he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king with his cold hands qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind then he turned to his brother do you remember what our master wanted harruq unsheathed condemnation and nodded aye i do he said when they returned to where velixar waited harruq dropped the head of the noble it rolled twice before stopping face down in the grass excellent the man in black said he looked his giant warrior up and down you are wounded is it serious bah i can handle far more than this harruq said ill bandage them when we get home very well leave me your work is done this night lying in the grass next to velixar was the dead body of an elf male qurrah glanced at it and then looked to his master do you need help bringing him back to life he asked velixar shook his head of course not both of you must rest i will not be able to see you for a while my disciples the elves are more than wary of my presence now be ready come nightfall and watch for my shadow when it does come that means war is on the horizon our glorious time has almost arrived with a pale hand he dismissed them qurrah turned to leave but harruq stayed behind master he asked when this fight starts which side will we be on his brother narrowed his eyes knowing exactly why the question was asked velixar however seemed to either not know or not care if the elves win vaelor will have no choice but to leave them be the assault of my orcs has weakened his army they cannot suffer any more losses if the humans win however a grin spread wide across his everchanging face chilling harruqs spine if the humans win the elves will declare full scale war against the kingdom of neldar so which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic we will kill the elves harruq said the man in black nodded and then dismissed his bone general go patch your wounds the halforc bowed and then joined his brother the two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside woodhaven when they reached their home harruq removed his armor and began wrapping his cuts with strips of old cloth qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking you know what you must do should it come to it he said harruq nodded knowing exactly what he meant dont have much of a choice do i he wrapped a long piece of cloth around his chest and then struggled to tie a firm knot behind his back with his beefy hands qurrah crossed the room silent he took the bits from harruqs hands and tied them in a double knot do your best to convince aurelia not to fight he said his voice quieter than normal do everything you can make her listen i dont want to kill her harruq whispered will you if you must the halforc did not answer qurrah stepped around and stared into his brothers eyes if we meet on the field of battle if we fight she might attack me instead of you her or me brother who would you choose which of us will die the burly halforc buried his gaze into qurrahs eyes he did not flinch and he did not lie when he spoke she would die i would hate it forever but she would die the necromancer nodded never forget it now let me help you dress those wounds some look deeper than you let on harruq remained silent as his brother scanned him over tightening bandages and cleaning out some of the nastier cuts his mind lingered on the fight that night he thought of blocks he had missed moves he made he shouldnt have and opportunities presented he had not taken advantage of but mostly he thought of aurelia giggling as she trapped him with vines and blasted his back with springs of water he did not sleep well that night it would be a long while before he did t he mood in woodhaven grew somber as dark rumors spread first came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city the more this rumor spread the more elves seemed to arrive elven men and women with camouflage and great longbows patrolled the city even more lingered in taverns and the homes of kin many humans left for family and friends wanting no part of the coming conflict many others spent hours whispering with the elf men in the bars the tension grew a group of men not daring to admit where their pay came from built sturdy palisades between the two halves of town everyone knew why but none spoke of it at least outside of a whisper two weeks after harruq and qurrah had slaughtered the messenger from veldaren the burning lights of an army encampment filled the fields north of woodhaven soldiers of neldar had arrived a ntonil copernus was quiet as he gazed at the town the wind teased his long blond hair never letting it rest as he stood the moonlight cast an eerie glow on his goldtinted armor which was carefully polished behind him the tents of his soldiers numbering more than six hundred lay scattered about in loose formation in the silence an elf walked up beside him his keen eyes taking in the torches that lit the city the city is quiet the elf said they await battle let us hope it does not come to that dieredon perhaps they will accept the kings orders for now the elf shook his head you know they will not antonil glanced at the elf who was painted in camouflage and still wore his wicked bow slung across his back he sighed youre right i do know silence followed the two continued staring each wishing to speak their mind but unable to summon the courage you are a wise man dieredon said breaking the moment you know who is in the right in this conflict as do i yes we both do antonil agreed he glanced to the elf his face asking the question he could not voice no i will not fight at their side dieredon answered never could i raise my bladed bow against you however i cannot fight against my brethren i will let fate decide tomorrow without my involvement antonil clasped the man on the shoulder thank you if there was a way i could stop this i would then stop it you know i cant you can defy the kings orders stop the bloodshed that his fear and paranoia are about to unleash an elf came killed several nobles and took the kings ear then his cousin is slain bearing a message to this town his head left at the gate of our city paranoia it might be but it is justified antonil quieted dieredon watched him amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight a year beyond forty yet he commanded the entire neldaren army publicly he handled the weight wonderfully but when prying eyes were gone his all toohuman fear and doubt showed when the man spoke again his voice trembled i will not break my oaths his majesty asked i enforce his edict and so i shall dieredon nodded the sparkle in his eyes fading i had hoped otherwise but follow your oaths and your heart as you must the elf whistled from the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats then a white winged horse swooped down landing in front of dieredon come sonowin the elf said to his cherished companion let us leave this place while it is still in peace the beautiful creature neighed in agreement dieredon mounted sonowin needing no reins or saddle antonil saluted the elf just before his mount leapt into flight stay safe friend he said you as well friend before the elf took to the sky however he paused antonilsomething more is at work here be wary i will not take sides in this conflict and neither shall the quellan elves but if i find who caused this war i will kill him it is the least i can do a great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air antonil watched him fly far south watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars before he stopped watching however he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon the guard captain smiled somehow heartened by the sight let us hope for miracles he whispered to the night and let us hope that at tomorrows end all my troops are still alive he stared at the stars for a long while before joining his troops in slumber h arruq and qurrah waited anxiously at their door they were fully armed and ready the halforcs sister swords were sharpened and gleaming wrapped around his arm qurrahs whip writhed hungrily their eyes rarely blinked but as hour after hour passed and no blanket of shadow came to them their patience wore thin the human army is right outside the town harruq grumbled we cant wait until tomorrow night patience brother qurrah said justpatience another hour and still no shadow harruq stepped back inside and plopped down the other halforc remained at the door his eyes not leaving the gray outside hes not sending for us harruq said you are correct said velixars voice startling both of them they turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home his red eyes gleaming how did you get in here the warrior asked listen to me velixar said ignoring the question i have little time the elves have erected barricades near their homes surely you have seen them slip past their defenses and wait when the battle comes slaughter the elves from behind you must weaken them enough so that vaelors army has a chance at victory we will not fail qurrah promised where will we meet you listen for where the screams are at their worst velixar said as his shadow began to fade there shall i be a pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts the vials contain powerful healing elixirs if either of you are injured tomorrow drink from them and resume the slaughter anew thank you master harruq said accepting three from his brother before kneeling as well we will await you in the chaos qurrah said then the man was gone vanishing into the shadows of the room the two glanced at each other harruq shrugged that was easy bed time sleep if you must qurrah said i will join you in a bit harruq removed his armor lay down on the bed of straw and slept the necromancer stepped outside his home walked to the side and stared at the flickering lights in the distance campfires and torches an army the same that had removed him and his brother from their home slept so close every one of them contemplated their death qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air yes the tension was delectable the quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience fear worry hope prayer regret and sorrow all floated to the stars the halforc let his attuned mind drink it all in beautiful he thought absolutely beautiful t he next morning harruq did not put on his armor or prepare his blades i have to see aurelia he told his brother who nodded in understanding i will wait for you qurrah said return before the battle starts i will harruq said then he was gone rushing down the streets of woodhaven toward the calm forest that nestled about it a urry are you there he shouted he had hoped the elf would be waiting for him but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her his heart skipped and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle aurelia come on out now he shouted again his eyes searched the forest im here aurelia said her voice was quiet subdued harruq turned and tried to smile there you are are you doing alright the elf shrugged her hands hugged her sides her walnut eyes filled with worry the elves are going to fight today harruq im sure youve heard why are you going to join them he asked the elf nodded they are my family this is my home i cannot abandon them harruqs heart skipped and the words of his brother echoed in his head he had to make her understand aurry im asking you please dont fight you arent needed the elves will win right right aurelia shrugged were outnumbered four to one we might win but well still suffer many deaths if i am needed i will fight no harruq said running up and grabbing her arms no you must understand you cant fight you cant why she asked as tears formed in her eyes i cant lose you aurelia i dont want to please dont fight for me will you not it seemed all the forest paused listening for the answer harruq i love you but i also love my home i love my brethren she stood on her toes and gave him a quick soft kiss on his lips a tear ran down harruqs cheek as he stood shocked still his mind relished the soft feel of her lips on his the scent of flowers and the subtle fire that had escaped onto his tongue ill see you tomorrow she said taking a hesitant step toward the trees sure thing harruq said rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there aurelia smiled tears were on her cheeks as well but she left them alone byebye harruq byebye aurelia then she was gone he stood there not moving his mind a chaos of fear swords velixar his brother and that lingering kiss then he screamed to the sky one long primal roar of hopeless confusion he stormed back to qurrah his chest a boiling pot of rage she had not listened he had begged he had opened his heart and she had not listened so fine then if he saw her well thenthen even in his anger he could not voice the words in his mind but the feeling was there death if he met her there would be death and that death would be preferable to the torment of pain he felt in his heart qurrah did not have to ask what her answer was when he returned to their home i am sorry was all he said before handing harruq his weapons get ready when the fighting begins you will forget all about her unless i see her he said qurrah chose not to respond suited and ready for battle the tun brothers left their home in woodhaven for the last time the men are ready milord sergan said do we march antonil stared at the small town seeing very little motion within no people wandered the streets no traveling merchants hawked their wares he sighed and turned to sergan his trusted advisor in war the man was old scarred and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders he had seen many wars and more than a few lives he had claimed with the axe that hung from his shoulder yes let us end this one way or the other antonil said order them to march ill lead us in yes milord sergan turned and started barking orders all his calm and politeness vanishing the guard captain glanced down at the edict from the king he carried in his hand a rash impulse filled him an insane desire to tear the paper to shreds and return to his liege with a lie on his lips under normal circumstances the king would know no difference his advisors however were many and every one of them would betray antonil for the chance to gain esteem in the eyes of the king no he would have to deliver the message regardless of his desires he sighed one final time turned toward his army and began the march w here celed and singhelm met there was a small clearing no buildings or monuments marked it just a single circle of grass upon which no house would ever be built on that spot singhelm the strong and ceredon sinistel leaders of neldars troops and the erzen elves respectively had made a pact that a city could exist between the two races without the need of bloodshed singhelm had long since passed away while ceredon remained two hundred years older as the leader of the elven elite ekreissar it was in that clearing antonil halted his army the men shuffled around nervously their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision the guard captain unrolled the edict his gut sinking as he realized where he stood long ago man and elf had agreed to live together in peace now on that very same spot he would rescind that agreement beyond the clearing loomed several palisades all nearby windows were closed and several boarded a few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city most kept themselves far from danger elves and men of the city of woodhaven antonil shouted by order of the noble and sovereign king of neldar all elven kind has been banned from human lands the elves of woodhaven have ignored this edict ignored the laws of the great kingdom in which they live this will not be tolerated any longer all elves must leave the city which being outside the forest of erze falls inside our borders those who do not immediately leave will be forced out at the edge of a sword these are the words of our great king vaelor and may they be never forgotten antonil rolled up the scroll in silence only coughs and the shifting sounds of uncomfortable armor filled the air seconds passed slow and crawling if one may speak for the elves of the city please let him come forth the guard captain shouted i seek the answer of the elven kind i do not want blood spilled this day a single elf approached he was dressed in a long green cloak silvery armor and he bore his bow openly antonil could barely make out his features he was so far down the street the elf halted drew an arrow and fired it into the air it smacked the dirt an inch from antonils foot sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander the man had not flinched i shall take that as your answer antonil shouted to the town woodhaven desires death he drew his sword and spoke softly so be it elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center full quivers hung from their backs sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows the men in the center raised their shields but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf they were about to be massacred stand firm antonil ordered raising his own shield stand firm do not break formation a shout came from the elven side and then the hail began more than a hundred arrows rained down on the army each deathly precise in its aim not one hit flesh antonil lowered his shield something was wrong he did not hear the screams of pain the thudding of arrows onto shields and the angry cries that should have followed instead he heard a stunned silence as his shield lowered his eyes took in a shocking sight a black wall encircled them translucent at times but flaring when an arrow struck it the projectiles snapped and broke as if hitting stone the guard captain looked around seeing his entire army protected sergan he cried yes my lord the old man asked do we have any mages with us antonil asked sergan shook his head flinching as an arrow aimed straight for his eye bounced away its shaft broken the guard captain nodded raised high his sword and then turned to his army stay calm and do not move from where you stand he shouted the men quieted and listened to their commander i do not know what blessing we have received but when it ends his voice drifted off movement behind his army caught his eye he shoved a few men aside tore through the center of his army and then emerged at the back far down the street his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind walked a pale man dressed in black his low hood covered all but the chin of his face his gait was slow and steady a hand he kept outstretched and from it flowed a black river that branched out to form the shield that had kept the men alive no arrows fired the battle was at a standstill all because of this mysterious stranger who walked so calmly down the street men of neldar this man screamed sounding like a giant among mortal humans some of you are meant to die this day rejoice for your souls will leave this mortal coil in the glory of combat raise high your swords and slay the elves that seek your death fight without pain and slaughter without mercy i have given them fear and the battle is yours for the taking the shield shook power flared throughout and then it exploded outward the wooden shutters on the buildings shattered into splinters the sides of homes rocked as if hit by the winds of a hurricane bows cracked and broke in the hands of their masters the few stray animals hit by the wave vomited their intestines and died the elves that endured it found their minds a chaos of horrors inescapable terror clutching their hearts kill them all the man in black screamed the men charged driven by madness they had never felt before come the battle is ours sergan shouted pulling against antonils arm the guard captain resisted the urge his eyes locked on their supposed savior you are him antonil whispered the man dieredon spoke of come antonil copernus the old veteran screamed pulling harder your men need you the bloodshed has begun antonils gaze broke he ran to where the sixty elves that had lined the street engaged against a large portion of his army they had discarded their bows and drawn swords wielding them with a precision his men would be blessed to ever match they didnt need to for they had numbers momentum and morale when antonil shoved to the front line they also had leadership the sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing give chase antonil shouted those in the back flush them out of the houses velixar watched the neldaren army scatter some chasing elves down streets others barging into locked homes screams of pain and dying although just few and random filled the air he drank it in and smiled where are you my disciples he asked let me hear the screams of your victims so that i may find you f lying overhead dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach the man in black had come he watched the arrows bounce off the magical shield and then watched the human army charge and overwhelm the small elven force that had come to face them i will keep my word antonil he said fly back to the others sonowin we will battle this day the horse snorted dieredon laughed no i am sure you wont be hurt sonowin banked giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi his horse neighed a quick question one dieredon wished he could laugh at everyone can be killed he said tying his hair behind his head and no i have no plans of breaking my ribs again the horse made an interesting little noise one dieredon had long ago learned was laughter he smacked her rump earning himself an angry neigh fly on you dont want to miss the fun do you a snort was his answer but the creature did fly faster toward the rest of its kin w hen should we attack harruq asked his twin swords itched in his hands qurrah sitting next to him in a little back alley next to ahrqurs old home laughed so eager to kill brother i was beginning to think you had grown soft the bigger halforc smashed his swords together focusing on the pain the shower of sparks caused his hands im still who ive always been he said youll see qurrahs smile faded at the ferocity in his brothers words he glanced down his mind spinning and reeling tell me if you love her qurrah suddenly ordered harruq glanced at him his eyes burning fire why now why do you have to ask answer me brother now no i dont love her is that what you want to hear the other halforc tightened the grip on his whip forget what i want if you do not love her then kill her now get your head beyond her and focus on the task at hand i want you fighting for a reason not just to forget do you understand me yeah i do harruq said so when do we know when to start kill them all both shot to their feet as velixars bellowing command rolled over the town which way do we go harruq asked follow me qurrah said the two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat they kept to the back alleys and because of this they met their first target three elves fleeing toward them hoping to use the lesserknown pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent bring them down the necromancer said with pleasure harruq said he raised his blades and charged the closest elf realized the halforc was an enemy and cried warning before rushing ahead his longsword ready come on pansyboy the halforc warrior roared the two collided in a brutal exchange of steel the elf shoved his sword upward using his forward momentum to slam the point straight at harruqs throat harruq swung condemnation left deflecting the incoming thrust past his head his other blade stabbed tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attackers ribcage the elf leapt back landed shakily and then lunged once more his speed was not what it should have been though and harruq needed little opening he swung both swords the entirety of his might behind them the elf blocked his sword was elvenmake and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years never would he have guessed harruqs were older by three centuries never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own pass through the explosion of steel sever his spine and cleave his body in two the halforc continued his charge engaging the two elves behind they struck as one their swords aiming for vitals high and low harruq knew he could not block both so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor grinning darkly as the sword punched through the enchanted leather the halforc cut his throat using that same swing to parry the other attack harmlessly away the remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery he backed away from the halforc his sword held defensively before him what demon magic is this he asked mine said qurrah and then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf the eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did hurry the necromancer said this is but a taste of what we must do very well harruq said he tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him he clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply his armor had saved him but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought are you fine harruq qurrah asked glancing back and halting his walk im coming he said marching after his brother he hid his pain well the alley opened up to the main street running south from the center of town into the forest beyond it was there that the bulk of combat had spread elves battled in the street horribly outnumbered they were skilled though and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces halt here qurrah said to their right was a large elven home with two stories three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers the men of neldar had their shields raised high but the strategy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb the tun brothers watched the sword wielders on the ground dance in make a few precise swings to change the positioning of the shields and then dart away arrows quickly followed these maneuvers biting into exposed flesh qurrah motioned to the building housing the archers go inside i will distract them you sure yes now go harruq smashed open the barricaded door with a single kick and then barged up the stairs qurrah drew out a few pieces of bone from a pouch he tightened his grip about them whispering a few words of magic as he did then he looked up to the window he could barely see a bow and part of a hand qurrah waited the neldaren warriors charged hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all the elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike but it was qurrah who did the killing four pieces of bone leapt from his hand they hit the elfs neck and temple with a loud crack the archer slumped out the window and landed with a clattering thud the rest are yours brother he whispered i nside felt like a modest rendition of ahrqurs home stairs in the center led to the upper floor harruq charged up them making no attempt at silence either they would hear him through the chaos of battle or they would not it turned out they did an arrow flew across the room and into his shoulder when he reached the second floor he bellowed letting the pain spark his rage one archer continued to fire out the window believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior he believed wrong the elf fired only one more shot before harruq crossed the room the arrow lodged into harruqs side and then salvation shredded through his bow and into flesh a kick sent the remains tumbling out the window the other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck his mind blanked he dropped his swords his hands closed about something soft by the time his rage calmed blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window stupid elfie he said gingerly touching the arrow in his neck not knowing what else to do he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled a minute later still lying in agonizing pain the halforc managed to pry open one of his healing potions he gulped the swirling bluesilver contents down and then tossed the vial he ripped the other arrow out of his side as a warm soothing sensation filled his body are you alright he heard a raspy voice ask up the stairs yeah im fine just had to take care of something up here he trudged down the stairs to where qurrah waited how many did you kill the necromancer asked just two he replied his brother looked him up and down and then raised an eyebrow that is a lot of blood for just two harruq ignored him where to he asked instead qurrah glanced outside the door the battle is moving on follow me lead on he said trudging after his brother into the daylight chaos o ut the window aurelia stared watching the battle with a solemn frown aurelia said a voice from behind she turned to see a female elf a friend of hers from many years before she moved to woodhaven yes felewen felewen stood beside her and faced the window her hair was tied in a long black ponytail her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races she had come from deep within nellassar the thriving capital of the dezren elves as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town many are dying felewen said the humans have a spellcaster of their own that repelled our ambush aurelia nodded she knew something had gone wrong otherwise the battle would have been over in seconds very well aurelia said will you accompany me felewen smiled at her she drew her longsword and saluted with it but of course lady thyne she said with nonetoosubtle sarcasm aurelia tried to smile back she failed come lets end this now the two left the building and joined the fighting on the streets it did not take long before a group of soldiers spotted them show them no mercy aurelia felewen said her warm voice turning cold they will die with little suffering the sorceress responded its the most i can give electricity arced between her hands blue fire surrounded her eyes the five human soldiers raised their shields and charged as a single unit felewen stood next to aurelia her sword high and her armor gleaming she kept the blade out and pointed at the center soldier when the bolt of lightning came shrieking out from aurelias hands it was that same soldier who found himself lifted from the ground his hands flailing his sword and shield falling useless another bolt killed a second soldier the blue electricity entering his body through his right eye he died instantly then the remaining three were upon the elves and it was felewens turn to kill the first to swing at her found his sword cut from his body his hand still clutching it as it flew through the air he cowered back pulling his bleeding arm behind his shield another leapt forward to defend him a longsword punched through his throat before he even saw her swing shock and panic took over and then the wounded soldier turned to flee the final human soldier smashed forward with his shield preventing felewen from chasing the slender fighter flipped backward clutching her sword with both hands she landed softly behind the sorceress take him she said a bolt of lightning hit his shield numbing his arm and knocking him back the shield slumped low the muscles in his arm unable to keep it high still he charged fully willing to die fighting for neldar he cried thrusting at aurelias chest felewen was there first all it took was three cuts the first took the mans sword from his hand the second took his arm from his body the third took his life a final bolt of lightning shot down the street killing the wounded soldier that had fled felewen wiped the blood from her blade and then sheathed it she then used the same cloth to clean the blood from her face come she said we must go north where we are needed most the two ran through the town listening for sounds of battle the worst seemed to be about the middle of celed and steadily working its way south they encountered a few soldiers as they made their way there all died before they had the chance to swing their blades at last felewen cried staring out from a side alley they were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back make haste they need us felewen charged desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed aurelia stepped out into the street and summoned her magic frost surrounded her hands and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers many of them stumbled unable to balance with sword and shield in their hands and heavy chainmail on their bodies felewen did not attempt to balance instead she fell and slid on one leg her sword out and ready she slid right between two men slicing out heels and tendons as she flew past the elf reached the end of the ice turned and went sliding back the two she had cut were on the ground unable to stand after such precise hits as she reached them she stabbed one of their legs to halt her momentum yanked her sword free and then rolled around to stab the other in the throat another roll back and the first soldier met the same fate the elves they saved wasted no time they both pressed forward unafraid of fighting on the ice their light armor made balancing an easy task while their human counterparts were doing all they could to swing and stand at the same time two men fell to each of their blades bringing the total down to four as felewen lay upon the ice a soldier stabbed down at her she spun on her rear her sword out in an arc she took his feet off at the ankles as he fell felewen snapped her legs high above her spinning her body off the ground she tucked her knees underneath her as she spun she landed on her stomach her sword skewering the guards innards she pulled herself to her feet with the hilt of her sword twisted the blade and then finished him the remaining soldiers turned to flee but there was one slight problem an enormous ball of fire erupted at their feet engulfing all three in flame two died from the horrible burns a third slumped and whimpered in pain aurelia walked over to him and knelt on one knee she placed a hand on his head and looked over his wounds while he glared up at her your wounds are beyond saving she said softly im sorry she ended his pain with a small lance of ice through his forehead thank you for your aid one of the elves said we must fall back to the forest if they chase us there it will be suicide we will not have to fall back so far felewen said they have scattered about our town their numbers mean nothing now besides she grinned we have aurelia thyne both bowed politely never could we have used a mages power more than now one said aurelia blushed and waved him off please we must a cold chill spread through her body like water from an underground stream meeting a creek she whirled and stared down the street walking without escort was a lone man shrouded in black robes the cowl of his cloak hid much of his face come brother one of the elves said it is the one who protected them from our arrows the other nodded took up his sword and charged his brother was not far behind felewen joined them for she too had watched as the black shield had knocked aside their arrows and then shattered their bows aurelia did not move her eyes were frozen on this strange man power rolled off him he was strong and even more so he was terrifying she had no doubt who this man was he was the nameless necromancer one of the few who could best scoutmaster dieredon in combat stop you cannot defeat him she shouted none listened felewen please felewen glanced back to her and that small pause saved her life the man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged they were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his everchanging face his deep red eyes and his horrible smile his hands lunged forward the floodgates opened and all his power came rushing forth a wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips the elven brothers tumbled through and vanished felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming she rolled behind a house and tucked her head the wave continued down the street straight for aurelia i do not fear you she hissed through clenched teeth a wall of water swirled about her growing from unseen streams she sent it forward just as tall and high as velixars the two met in a thunderous roar intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness water and air then they both dissolved their magic spent aurelia held back tears velixars magic had peeled the flesh from the elves bodies blood leaked through muscle and tendon and their innards spilled from their abdomens she hoped they died instantly but she knew better they had suffered tremendously you monster she shouted what meaning does this battle hold to you everything velixar shouted hurling a flaming ball of fire from each hand i desire panic and bloodshed all across the east aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body the fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated the two nearest buildings crumpled their walls and roofs blown back by the power the elf winced nearly knocked to her knees by the force what madness gives you such a desire she asked attacking with the strongest spells she knew several lances of ice flew down the street followed by a ball of magma the ball rolled behind the lances covering the ground in flame velixar laughed a wave of his hand created a similar shield as aurelias but instead of keeping it close to his body he shoved it forward the lances shattered into shards when slammed against it the ball of magma halted when touching the barrier and then reversed direction the elf glared detonating the attack with a thought molten rock covered the street splattering across both velixars and aurelias shields before sliding to the dirt how long can you keep this up the necromancer asked he took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces how long before you break one by one the bone pieces shot straight at aurelia the elf dropped to one knee words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence such as the conjured fire but animated objects were a different matter the magic projecting them would die at her shield but the pieces would retain their momentum the dirt before her rumbled cracked and then ripped up in a great physical wall on the other side pieces of bone thumped against it one after another cute velixar said but pointless an invisible blast of pure force shattered the wall aurelia crossed her arms before her face as chunks of earth smashed her slender form she rolled with the blows her mouth casting before she halted ice spread from house to house walling velixar off on the other side from dirt to ice velixar asked the end is just the same the center of the wall exploded inward but this time aurelia was prepared a rolling thunder of sound shoved all the broken shards forward sending even the remaining chunks of the wall down the street in a chaotic assault velixar grinned clever girl the wave of sound and ice slammed his body he flew backward ice tearing his skin no blood came forth from those wounds the larger pieces smashed his body from side to side which turned limply with each blow then the wave passed aurelia leaned on one knee gasping for air as she stared at the man in black now a crumpled mess of robes in the center of the street the body suddenly convulsed the chest going up and down in quick jerky spasms when the sound reached her aurelia knew her doom velixar was laughing he stood brushed off pieces of ice clinging to his robes and then glared at her from afar not good enough he said wild anger took over his face black lightning thicker than a mans arm tore down the street aurelia gasped as all her power flowed into her shield the collision sent her flying her magical barrier shattered into nothingness the lightning continued swirling about her body every nerve in her body shrieked with pain she landed hard unable to brace for the fall the air blasted out of her lungs and for one agonizing second they refused to draw in another breath slowly the black magic seeped out of her the pain faded away and then she felt dusty air pour into her lungs you are a powerful sorceress velixar said his anger gone as quickly as it had arrived but i have fought the founders of the council of mages i have killed men who thought themselves gods i have died but once to ashhur himself there is no shame in your defeat aurelia struggled to her feet the well of magic inside her was dry in time her strength would return but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest she used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff if she were to die she would die fighting any way she knew how the man in black paused outstretched his hands and began to cast he would give her no chance to strike a blade stabbed in at his side velixar whirled his speed far beyond mortal he stepped past felewens slash and slammed a hand against her chest dark magic poured in her arms and legs arched backward her sword fell from her hand and her mouth opened in a single aching shriek bits of darkness flared from her mouth her eyes and her nostrils done velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die when he turned he snarled aurelia was gone you have delayed me my kill he said to the alley pray you are dead before i return he placed his hood back over his head pulled it far down to cover his features and then began his search for the sorceress one after another the deft strokes came in and one after another antonil batted them away with the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place in the neldaren army his opponent a young elf with swordplay raw compared to most of his brethren tried to give him no reprieve the guard captain didnt falter in the slightest you sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes he said his breathing steady and practiced he assumed the elf spoke the human tongue and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct antonil pulled his head back the point stopping just shy of drawing blood an upward cut took the blade from the elfs hand his sword looped around thrust forward and buried deep inside flesh the elf fell gasping for air from the fatal wound blood pooled below him antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade well fought he said an arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off a warning for your honor said a camouflaged elf as he stepped out from behind a door a second arrow followed the first thudding against antonils shield a second out of respect he drew a third the guard captain charged his shield leading while his upper body was covered nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins antonil stumbled pain flaring up his right leg he forced himself to continue running if he could close the gap the bow would prove no match for his longsword another arrow fired striking an inch from his left foot his leg was aflame yet he continued pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out but the elf was not close enough and was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows he snapped the wood up cracking antonil across the bottom of his hand he did not let go of his blade undaunted the elf stepped closer ducked underneath the guard captains return swing and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin antonil dropped his blade the elf stood drawing an arrow as he did antonil now lying on the ground struggled to bring his shield up before his chest part of it caught beneath his side and would not come he would not be able to block in time a loud wooden crash stole away the elfs focus the door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it the elf spun his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door a massacred elven body he readied his bow and released an arrow at the next sign of movement unfortunately it was another elven body curiously missing its left arm and leg an enormous halforc in black armor followed soaked in blood and roaring in mindless fury he spotted antonils attacker screamed an incomprehensible challenge and then charged the elf fired another arrow but was horrified to see it lurch high behind him antonil kicked again this time aiming for the elfs knee instead of his bow the elf had to dodge the kick and that dodge was all it took the halforc bore down on him with his glowing black blades cutting his bow and his body in twain as the blood poured free he roared looked about and then ran off toward the sound of combat a frail form in rags followed from inside the house a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle you saw nothing this second halforc said to him before following the warrior antonil struggled to his feet shaking his head all the while it keeps getting stranger he muttered he took a step and immediately regretted it as pain flared up his leg he yanked the arrow out his armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh of course it still hurt like the abyss but he could deal with that what he could not deal with however was how few in number his soldiers had dwindled more than four of his own men lay dead around him joined by three dead elves five if he counted the two the halforc had thrown through the doorway a good ratio considering the skill of the elves but not good enough men he had trained were dying and for what i have honored your will my lord he said but it is time i honor my men from his belt he took a white horn bearing the symbol of neldar he put this ancient horn to his lips and blew all throughout woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat he gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north a urelia raced down the twisting back alleys of celed the dreaded chill of velixar was far behind her but still she hesitated to slow never before had she felt so vulnerable as she stopped to catch her breath a loud horn call echoed throughout the town the elf sighed clutching her staff to her chest as she slumped against the side of a house the battle was overbut would the man in black obey the call she thought not suddenly a hand closed about her mouth the foul smell of sweat and dirt filled her nostrils an arm reached around pinning her staff and hands against her chest we may have to leave a voice growled into her ear but im not leaving without something to remember aurelia felt her stomach churn her assailant turned her around and flung her back against the wall she glared at an ugly soldier bearing the crest of neldar youre a pretty one he said his smile missing several teeth he yanked at his belt while his other arm pressed against her chest and neck and youre an idiot she spat much of her magic was gone but not all her hand brushed his and a small shock of electricity crossed between them the soldier instinctively pulled his hand back giving aurelia the opening she needed she squirmed out from beneath gripped her staff and then whirled the wood cracked against the back of his skull his head went forward with the blow cracking just as hard against the wall blood splattered from his broken nose youll pay for the end of her staff knocked out two more of his teeth the soldier panicked he turned to run but found his feet entangled aurelia marched over remembering how difficult it had been to strike harruq and how strong a blow he could take without showing pain are you as strong as a halforc she asked her staff collided with his ribs he curled up at the blow crying out in pain guess not she thought a shove put him on his back he pleaded up to her sputtering blood she ignored him some people should not reproduce she said down came her staff all her might behind it the end smashed his genitals eliciting a cry of pain beyond anything her spells could do she continued to strike punctuating every word with another blow so let me fix that for you she stopped when he passed out from the pain she turned his head to the side so he wouldnt choke on his own blood a strange gesture of kindness considering what was left of his manhood glad to give you something to remember the town by she said with a flirtatious flip of her hair she turned down the alley and walked out into the street aurelia froze her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black this time no magic could be blamed and no sense of death no it was just the sight of harruq dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior oh harruq she whispered then he saw her and all time stopped t he two halforcs heard the sounding of the horn but did not know its purpose so far from any human soldiers they could only guess maybe theyre rallying at the horn harruq ventured qurrah shrugged glancing down the vacant street in search of victims perhaps or perhaps the elves are retreating or even the humans either way our time is running short we must find our master so far no resident of woodhaven has seen us and lived but i do not wish to press such luck looks like we have no choice harruq said crossing his swords in an x before his chest far down the street where the road hooked left like the back leg of a dog an elven archer approached his bow at ready two arrows shot into the air both halforcs dodged as the arrows whistled past close the distance qurrah said before beginning a spell harruq charged bellowing out a mindless war cry the archer fired two more arrows and then bolted around the corner hes seen us harruq shouted easily veering about the arrows as he increased speed wait brother it might be a trap qurrah doubled over hacking his reward for trying to shout so loud harruq halted his head jerking back and forth as he debated what to do qurrah glanced up tried to speak and then swore as the elf stepped back around the corner and fired another arrow he did his best to dodge but he was far less mobile than his brother the arrow pierced between his left shoulder and collarbone burying the barbed tip deep in his flesh the halforc let out a stunned gasp he staggered right clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home qurrah harruq shrieked racing to his brother qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound kill him for me the necromancer gasped go he cannot live but youre bleeding real bad and i have the healing potions now go harruqs gut screamed against the idea but in the end he listened to his brother he drew his swords and gave chase qurrah waited until harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials before he could pull the cork off the top he heard a voice speak so many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life the halforc froze the vial clutched in his hands an elf walked out from behind the building his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor it was the same elf that had fired the first warning shot to antonil before the entire battle had begun i am but a poor outcast qurrah said hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand the coiled leather vibrated hungering for blood do not lie to me i have watched you two slaughter my brethren i have seen much of your handiwork the elf glared down at him his handsome features skewed with ugly hatred by now your brother is dead three of my best warriors await him around that corner i thought it appropriate you knew this before i took your life do not talk to me of what is appropriate qurrah said kill me if you will but do not bore me with your hatred i have suffered beyond anything you can do to me a firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elfs features he stepped back and drew an arrow qurrah lashed his whip but his speed was not enough an arrow tore right through his hand the whip fell the fire vanishing the second it left contact with qurrahs skin a second arrow followed the halforc rocked backward his brown eyes wide with shock as the tip pierced deep into his throat the healing potion fell from his hands and broke against a rock he slid back resting against a home as he gasped for breath the elf grabbed the shaft of the arrow and again that sick anger filled his face how many of my kin died to your hand he asked a twist of his hand sent spasms of pain all throughout qurrahs body he coughed violently and blood ran down his lips and neck dont feel like answering the elf mocked why did you kill them for money power how many died to better your miserable excuse of a life another twist qurrah leaned forward clutching at his tormenter with shaking hands words spilled from the halforcs mouth garbled and nearly unintelligible what is it you wish to say to me the elf asked ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face hemorrhage the halforc hissed the elfs face exploded qurrah fell over onto his side breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat the dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him all of his hatefilled features gone from his face except for a single eye the halforc stared wondering if his brother was truly dead darkness crept at the corner of his sight his strength was fading fast and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake he struggled to lift a single numb hand then flopped it down on top of the dead elfs leg qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell each syllable was slow torture garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid thankfully the spell was not complicated and the words were few he finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes even though he was dead life energy still swirled inside the elfs body normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial but qurrah had other plans his spell took in this life energy through his hand filling his body with it healing his wounds and clearing his mind the darkness fighting for control in his head subsided a shred of strength returning to his limbs there was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant most likely he would die but he had to try he heard no screams coming from around the corner he told himself that meant nothing he had to believe his brother was still alive he had to help him qurrah took out his last healing potion popped the cork and then held it before him blood was beginning to fill his throat once more his stolen energy was quickly fading he had no time to waste he tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft one last hissing breath one tremble of his fingers he yanked the arrow out sheer reflex kept him alive his head shot backward and his arm went limp the potion tilted enough so that half spilled down his throat with the pain so unbearable he dared not cough against the liquid that came burning down some of it went into his lungs but he kept them still qurrah lay back down closed his eyes and let the potion do its work he could feel the magic flowing through his body concentrating about his ruined throat part of him hoped the liquid would heal the damage done so many years ago but he knew better a scar that old was beyond repair he would have to settle for surviving that was just fine with him when he finally dared a loud gasping breath of air the pain was not so bad qurrah stood picked up his whip and then went to help his brother he expected to see his body dead in the street for why else had he still not returned he held hope that harruq still fought against his enemies or that more had come beyond the three the elf had claimed what he was not prepared for was the sight of harruq hunched over the dying body of aurelia thyne harruq he tried to call out the flesh in the back of his throat tore blood poured down his throat slick and hot qurrah cursed such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help he needed to steal more life and for that he needed another body he glanced behind the dead elf was dry but far down the street were two more he and his brother had killed he glanced once more to harruq three elves lay dead about him he could use them knew he should use them but something turned him away it was the look on his brothers face he could not bear to see it qurrah hobbled to where two bodies full of life energy awaited his coming h arruq barreled around the curve determined to catch the foul elf that had dared injure his brother as he turned the corner the twang of bowstrings filled the air three arrows hit his chest barely puncturing his armor he bellowed furious all three elves were in the center of the street away from cover or protection they would die all of them the archers fired another volley as if not surprised the first three had done little but anger him one zipped by his head as he ran two others thudding into his chest and arm blood soaked the inside of his armor but the wounds were superficial halted by the magical leather before penetrating deep enough to be a bother for the head the closest elf shouted in his native tongue he managed one last shot before harruq closed the distance the halforc batted the arrow away without thinking you bastard he shouted slamming into the elf without pausing he buried his swords deep into the elfs chest as he plowed forward you hurt my brother you spineless cowards the other two abandoned their bows and drew their blades your brother is dead one elf said gaelwren waited for your departure he will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog the anger inside harruq more exploded than grew he charged the elf that had spoken ignoring any pretense at defense he slammed his blades down with all his might the elf held his own sword with both hands and blocked once twice then three times wincing each time he did then the other was behind harruq stabbing at his back while mad with rage harruq still knew very well where his opponents were he spun avoiding the thrust and then crunched in his elbow to trap his assailants arm a flex of his muscles cracked bone and the sword fell from a limp hand harruq let him go bellowed at the first elf and then hurled both his blades they turned end over end through the air one missing one not the one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead with the hilt the elf staggered back swiping at harruq as the halforc charged into melee a thin line of blood appeared on the halforcs forehead but he knew it not his hands were around his enemys throat and his strength at its greatest pain was an inconceivable notion the crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered the elf behind him retrieved his sword and charged his right arm hanging useless his left stabbing with his blade harruq flung the dying body around by the neck the sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out his backhand broke the elfs jaw pain overwhelmed the elf limiting his defenses to a meager arm raised above his head harruq smashed an elbow into his chest followed by knuckled fists atop his skull stay down harruq said he retrieved salvation and condemnation from the dirt and then stomped over to the beaten bloody elf warrior mercy i am beaten the elf gasped as harruq lifted his head by the hair no such thing he said salvation tore out his throat condemnation hacked off his head he sheathed his blades breathed in deeply and then let it all out in an ecstatic cry of primal things as the last of it left his lips he saw an elf staring at him with shocked walnut eyes from a nearby alley his gut lurched the fire in his veins sputtered why so surprised he asked aurelia shame fighting down the thrill of his kill how could you she asked him what harm have we done to you harruq shrugged you think you know me but you dont i kill aurry its what i do its what i do best he drew out his swords still dripping with blood perhaps you didnt believe it but this is me dont do this aurelia said softly it doesnt have to be this way please harruq i dont want to fight you i didnt want you to fight either harruq said his eyes leaving hers for an instant he took a step toward her and raised his swords just as when they sparred stop this aurelia said her staff remained at her side will you kill me too i asked you not to fight but here you are qurrah made it simple aurry either i love you or i kill you sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together is that how you feel she asked the tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks not to be replaced by any more so be it she took up her staff and held it defensively you are a fool harruq may you die as one harruq charged his black blades gleaming all his madness he poured into his swords every nagging doubt every tiny part screaming for him to sheath his blades he channeled into his mindless rage his swords hacked chunks out of the staff which held together only by aurelias powerful enchantments she blocked several attack routines but one finally slipped past a black blade cut across her cheek her dodge too slow she paused rubbing her cheek with her hand as harruq smirked blood it was as she feared harruqs weapons were enchanted your spells wont save you he shouted no elf will save you no one why this hatred she asked smacking away a dual thrust when have i shown you anything but kindness harruq gave her no answer instead he stabbed with salvation a higher thrust of condemnation trailing behind it aurelia turned her staff horizontal and pushed upward both swords stabbed high above her head a quick turn and one end of her staff rammed the halforc in the gut the blow knocked out harruqs air for what reason do we fight she asked for what reason do you harbor this hatred he glared i told you im fighting elves youre one of them no simpler than that liar harruq snarled the elf inside him all but impossible to tell he charged hacking at aurelia with wild abandon why do we fight she asked again desperately trying to block every swing blood covered her arms and another swing cut through her dress slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg why harruq why i dont know he cried strength surged into him dark and unholy in the blink of an eye he twirled both swords knocked aurelias staff from her hand and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury condemnation deep into her stomach everything all fighting all arguing all bleeding living and dying halted at that moment for harruq there was only the sight of aurelia doubled over her eyes filled with sadness his arm yanked the blade out of her without any thought on his part harruq she gasped she fell on her back still clutching her bleeding abdomen that look of sadness tore through his rage what should have been the exhilaration of the kill was instead the cold biting emotion of guilt his eyes lingered on the blood on his blade before something changed inside he looked back to the elf and again the words of his brother echoed in his head do you love her no hed said then kill her aurelia he asked as if seeing her for the first time i didnt mean to i aurry please he knelt down his blades falling from his limp hands he pulled away aurelias hand to see the blood to see the wound no he said he rocked backward the color draining from his face no i didnt mean to i didnti didnt aurelia tried to say something tried to comfort him but no noise came from her throat she was dying no harruq shouted he pulled out one of his healing potions yanked off the cork and forced the contents down aurelias throat the elf gagged retching up half of it onto her neck and chest harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands desperate he put it down picked up one of his swords and shattered the top of the vial he flung the potion back to aurelias mouth nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass more of the silveryblue liquid poured down her throat with nothing left to do harruq sat there clutching her hands in his and waiting the seconds crawled slower than the longest of years he didnt care if anyone came and saw him not even his brother his tears fell onto her bloodstained dress for far too long she did not move his heart cried out in agony it was too late he had killed her im so sorry he whispered to her forgive me please if you can what are you babbling about the elf asked her eyes cracking open harruq tried to smile but a sob came out instead he hugged her his forehead pressed against hers help me up she said harruq did as commanded when she was standing he grabbed his blades and sheathed them she leaned all her weight against him and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger he knew she watched him and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could why harruq she asked him the halforc shrugged wequrrahi still dont know no she said leaning on her staff why did you save me he kicked his toes into the dirt unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart all he could think of was what his brother had told him to do qurrah said to kill you if i didnt love you yet you didnt she said harruq nodded but said nothing else hana fael a voice cried from far down the alley both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire look out aurelia said shoving harruq aside the arrow hit her breast and reflected off as if hitting stone she glanced at harruq her face a mixture of anger and fear others have seen you kill havent they she asked harruq could only shrug more shouts came as two other elves turned the corner aurelia swore as she heard what they said they call me traitor she said i protected you and now i am a traitor the halforc stepped before her preparing his swords they wont touch you i know aurelia said summoning the last bit of magic inside her a tear in the fabric of reality ripped open swirling with white and blue magic get in she yelled what about qurrah he shouted go inside you dumb fool she cracked him across the back with her staff harruq stumbled into the portal and vanished aurelia stepped in after arrows landing all around her a s qurrah watched the blue portal closed leaving him alone and hunted in a town full of enemies brother how could you he asked dread clutching his throat elves were running down the alley yelling in their language qurrah ducked back around cursed his brother and then darted to the nearest home the first one had locks as did the second but the third was unbarred he hid inside as the shouts of search parties went rushing past qurrah climbed the stairs to the second floor sat down beside a bed and then in silence pondered his fate now that he was alone far from town a blue portal tore open above empty grass the big halforc tumbled out followed by a flustered aurelia upon her exit the portal closed swirling away as if it had never existed harruq groaned spitting out dirt that had made its way into his mouth where are we he asked about two miles east of woodhaven she told him harruq glanced around unable to see the town in the distance so thats how you always showed up behind me he said as he got to his feet that magicblue thingie that magic blue thingie is a portal aurelia said her arms crossed over her chest as she held her elbows and yes that is how i did it harruq shrugged glancing about as he tried to get his bearings a thought hit him harder than any whacks of aurelias staff qurrah he gasped youve got to send me back i cant aurelia said her eyes fixed west what do you mean you cant he stormed over and grabbed her arms send me back im telling you to qurrahs all alone and theyll kill him if i dont help him i cant harruq i cant she shouted pulling back from his hands i have no strength left to open another portal you and he will have to wait until i get some rest how long will that be tomorrow morning she said he raged and sputtered but could think of nothing to say or do finally he started walking where are you going she asked him to get my brother he said without turning around they will kill you she shouted they will see you and kill you you do your brother nothing by running off to die then what am i supposed to do he screamed he whirled around his helplessness showing on every feature of his face have faith in him she said she pulled a strand of hair from her face as the wind blew across her i have given up everything for you harruq dont you see that my friends my family my home they are all gone from me because of you dont make it all for nothing harruqs anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire he could not argue with her not about that even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life where do we go he asked his voice revealing his defeat well figure it out in the morning for now we travel north your brother will be fine i promise he nodded but said nothing the two traveled in between the hills exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement why did you fight the elves she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour itll be a long story he said we have time he chuckled aye i guess we do he told her of velixar and his plans he told her of the strength weapons and armor granted to him hesitantly he recounted killing ahrqur and the people of cornrows a fresh wave of shame filling him as he thought of both what part did ahrqur play in this aurelia asked was he enlisted by this velixar harruq shook his head me and qurrah killed him then velixar brought him back and sent him off to the king it was very much unwilling on his part that guy was me and qurrahs dad you know that we killed our own dad and never even knew it while we did she frowned and deep lines of exhaustion marred her beauty tonight we need to have a serious talk she said for now id prefer we speak of lighter things sure thing he said they spoke no word of woodhaven velixar or the battle that morning for the rest of the day t he sound of an opening door stirred him from his slumber qurrah glanced around furious that he had fallen asleep how much time had passed an hour five i cannot be so weak he muttered to himself footsteps echoed from the first floor one person he guessed most likely an elf judging by the design of the building qurrah stood and readied his whip he would not cower in hiding this was his home now he would defend it you are not safe here qurrah whispered for if you are safe then i am not he crept down the stairs the whip coiled and ready to burst into flame before the circular front window stood an elf one hand on the glass the other holding a bow qurrah reached into his pocket clutching a few pieces of bone before he could draw them out the elf spoke his voice soft and sad too much death this day he said for hundreds of years my brother and i lived here and for hundreds of years more we would have remained he is dead now and for what reason death has no reason qurrah said his whole body tensing no the elf said turning around so he could stare at qurrah eye to eye but murderers do neither moved neither spoke qurrah felt his nerves fray and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled he felt as if he hung over the side of a cliff and the bones he held were the rope the elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side no more have to die the elf said the flesh around his eyes sagged wearily and he leaned against the window to aid in standing it was as if grief had rendered him lifeless let go qurrah thought he could let go fall down the cliff and find what awaited him at the bottom all he had to do was let go of the bones the confusion burned hotter in his gut youre right qurrah said standing to his full height no more have to die but what we do doesnt matter for more always will he opened his hands fueled by dark magic the bones shot forth piercing the elfs throat and eyes against the window his dying body fell his arms still held wide as if offering an embrace that would never be returned qurrah stared at the corpse and as the blood pooled on the floor he felt himself standing once more on solid ground the elves were his enemy his brother was his only friend velixar was his master solid ground qurrah slipped over to the window and glanced out the sun hung low its top edge barely visible above the rooftops he had hoped the streets would be empty but instead he saw a patrol of elves turn the corner their swords drawn he stepped back and hid as they passed by the halforc chewed on his fingers as he thought harruq had abandoned him true but perhaps he remained nearby waiting for him then there was velixar no doubt furious at the elves victory where did karaks prophet linger now that the battle had ended there was only one way to find out he would have to escape the town regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area he waited until nightfall even in the dark the elves still patrolled carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight the longer he hid and watched the more qurrah was convinced they searched for him the neldaren troops were long gone harruq with them he knew he was being paranoid but the only other person they could be searching for was velixar and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him when a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished he opened the door winked at the bloody corpse near the window and then slipped out into the night the scent of mourning floated throughout the town and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart so many souls lost in battle and even in the quiet aftermath it was intoxicating no sleep tonight he said turning back to the building that had been his shelter fire swarmed around his fingers like streams of water it flowed from his hands splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze finished he ran searching for an alley or a corner to hide in as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols he heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder the houses ended and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle the two rolled a tangle of legs and arms the small bottle shattered what the abyss are you the man started to say but qurrahs hand pressed against his lips your voice or your life qurrah said danger flaring in his eyes the halforc pushed him away and got to his feet he glanced around trying to orientate himself when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back he spun his whip lashing out as it burst into flame it wrapped around the mans neck choking out death cries as his flesh seared and smoke filled his lungs the only noise qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire at last the man crumpled the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand damn it qurrah said wincing as he touched the cut on his back it was wide but not deep painful too he noticed as he took a few steps furious he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest the body shriveled into dust only the bones remaining halt shouted a voice from far down the street qurrah glanced up to see an elf with bow in hand just one the halforc noticed but that would quickly change perhaps youll have some use after all qurrah said to the bones he whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow a purple fire surrounded the bones pulled them into the air and then hurled them in a giant wave the elf released his own arrow but qurrah was faster he dove to the side as the arrow clacked against the stone as he rolled he glanced up at his target the elf tried batting the bones away but he was a fool unaware of the strength guiding them they shattered his bow crashed into his slender form and tore flesh and armor kill him qurrah said to the bones they swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado and all at once they plunged downward deep into his flesh more shouts he turned north and ran deeper into singhelm he doubted any humans patrolled the area not after the defeat of their army if he was to find safety it would be there in ragged breath after ragged breath he gasped tasting copper on his tongue his back ached and his whole body revolted against his constant motion still he had no choice he passed by home after home each one dark and quiet it seemed the occupants of singhelm were terrified the elves might seek vengeance for the kings edict qurrah chuckled even as it felt like hammers pummeled his chest he spread his hands to either side and bathed a few houses with fire the citys fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze and he wanted it to deepen an arrow whistled by clipping his ear qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home inches from his neck a spell on his lips he spun grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell from two windows a pair of elves held bows and as one they pulled back the strings and released their arrows the ground beneath qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed so that he fell into a deep pit the landing jarred his back and he gasped for air but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above the fire continued to spread qurrah could see its flickers of light and even in his little pit he felt the heat his whole body ached and he wished nothing more than to lay there like a corpse in a grave but he had no time he needed to take care of the meddlesome elves that had him pinned like shadows in the night he whispered remembering how velixar had described a certain spell to him shadows that vanish and reappear at will he spoke the words and poured his power into them he felt his body shift and his sight twisted so that he saw many things a spider he thought velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider a mere thought of moving sent him spiraling reappearing place to place his stomach churned and totally disorientated he ended the spell his sight returned to normal and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree as he retched on his knees he looked about discerning his location he was beside the building the two elves were in directly underneath their windows he could see the tips of their arrows sticking out glinting in torchlight two adjacent homes were already ablaze their occupants still inside qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door burn he shouted loud enough for the elves to hear the wood blackened smoke billowed from his hands and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil qurrah laughed untouched by the heat he could not say the same for the elves and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder the halforc ran as people flooded the streets calling out for buckets and water too many homes were aflame they could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared in the commotion qurrah vanished unseen and uncared for he had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds and in the dark of night surrounded by fear and worry he was just a shadow q urrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind the grass was soft and tall and it felt good to his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads stars filled the sky and he smiled to them often in the distance he spotted a small fire and he knew to whom it belonged where is your brother velixar asked as qurrah approached he has abandoned me qurrah said pulling at his robes he glanced back to the town hoping to change the topic velixars gaze followed his and together they noticed the smell carried their way on unfelt wind there are bodies nearby qurrah said hundreds i can feel them elves do not bury their kin velixar whispered the few tombs they do build house nothing but ash instead they pile the bodies of the dead to burn but not tonight tonight they mourn he stood erect stretching out his arms as if relishing the warmth of sunshine such wonderful dead to die in combat is a glorious fate qurrah never forget it the blessings of gods linger in those who fight and fall valiantly qurrah nodded he could feel power creeping out of his master cold and fierce soft purple dust flew from his pale hands the trust between man and elf is broken velixar said let the harvest of their distrust begin arcane words of power flowed from velixar qurrah knew them knew their purpose they were the exact same words he had used to raise the eight undead at cornrows the only difference however was in the power velixar gave them each word rolled forth like some unstoppable wave deep and resonating he relished the feel knowing that one day he would speak the words in such a manner velixar lifted his hands to the sky shouting out the last of the spell the final command came shrieking forth from his lips rise in the distance dark shapes rose from the grass four hundred bodies of men and elves marched silently away from town back toward their master qurrah smiled the macabre sight was beautiful what shall you do with them he asked they will join my army two thousand i now have we are close so close soon will have enough to crush veldaren where is this army velixar flashed an ugly smile they are with me always as if this very comment brought forth their existence thousands of decaying mindless beings surrounded them how can you command so many qurrah gasped you will learn come we must put as much distance as we can between us and woodhaven the hundreds from woodhaven joined the thousands flanked in an army of undead the necromancers made their way north c lever dieredon whispered from atop sonowin watching the undead armys departure they circled back returning to the erze forest nestled around woodhaven dieredon had returned too late to find and assault velixar so instead he had kept his troops hidden and waiting the battle ended as he had hoped and even antonil had survived celestia be praised the elf glanced back memorizing the exact direction the undead marched clever and disgusting he added death is nothing but a recruitment tool for you half an hour later he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north as they flew they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty green below their passage above went unheard and unseen for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation h arruq i want you to make me a promise and what is that aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly promise you will never strike at me or those close to me ever again the halforc shifted uncomfortably in the grass you know id never do that no harruq i dont know i think i know i desperately want to believe i know but i dont so promise me aurry promise me now or i will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve harruq glared into the fire it was such an easy promise but could he keep it what if velixar ordered otherwise or someone close to aurelia struck against qurrah he sighed in his heart he knew he could never again strike at aurelia regardless of what anyone else wanted of him the look on her face when he had stabbed her that combination of sadness and shock would haunt him forever fine he said i promise happy far from it aurelia crossed her legs tossed back her hair and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire i want you to listen to me alright harruq sure he glanced down uncomfortable and saddened that aurelia refused to look him in the eye velixar is not who you think he is he isnt what you think he is he tried to kill me harruq he enjoyed every second we fought i saw many of my friends die at his hand do you know why he helps you why he claims to train you she gave no pause no chance for him to answer this was good for he didnt want to too much was on his mind for argument he remained quiet and listened he wants to change you turn you into what you know he is a murderer without guilt without conscience a living weapon to be used however he wants you to be used harruqs heart sped up a few paces as aurelia rose and walked over to where he sat she knelt down and rubbed a soft hand against his face she finally looked into his eyes you are not a weapon harruq you are a kind intelligent halfelf you always have a choice never forget that she kissed his cheek his heart skipped when she sat back down he looked down at his brutish hands and muscles she noticed and crossed her arms velixars gift she said do you still desire it harruq closed his eyes his fingers shaking deep within his chest he felt a rage steadily growing when velixar had first given the strength to him hed felt an overwhelming desire to use it anger swelled inside and when he looked to aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack she was questioning his master his brother questioning everything that meant to be him when he opened his eyes aurelia stood shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from harruqs eyes you could never know what i am he said ive seen what you can be she said is that not enough the words stung him his vision swam crimson he felt his hands close upon his swords perhaps he shouldnt have saved her perhaps he should have left her bleeding upon the ground to die alone and no he screamed flinging himself to his knees he drew his swords and flung them aside not daring to have their touch near him just then velixars voice throbbed in his ears a chant of promises and loyalty deny the gift aurelia said the faintest hint of magic on her fingertips give me some shred of hope he closed his eyes tears trickled down his face he felt the anger growing inside him but he forced it down in his minds eye he saw velixar the old prophet warned of death retribution and pain but harruq silenced him let the gift be gone he denied the darkness within him if this was betrayal then so be it he would pay the cost great spasms racked his body all the power velixar had granted him fled his muscles shrank inward tightening in great painful shudders several minutes passed as the horrendous pain tore through his arms chest and legs aurelia held him as he lay sobbing in pain she did her best to comfort him stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away exhaustion came soon after and for an agonizing time harruq lay there mumbling incoherently and waiting for the pain to fade at last he looked up to aurelia his eyes a calm brown the whites bloodshot i love you he said sleep took him and relieved aurelia let her own eyes close and her hair drape across his face w ake up qurrah the halforc crept open his eyes to see the thoroughly unwelcoming sight of velixar frowning down at him yes master he asked puzzled for it was still before dawn he had slept no more than a few hours he figured who is it your brother travels with now velixar asked you say he has abandoned you but to whom an elf named aurelia qurrah said as he sat up he rubbed his eyes still feeling groggy why do you ask because he has rejected us my disciple velixar said his strength has left him my heart burns with this betrayal and i must know who to punish qurrah felt ill at ease all around him the sea of undead swayed and moaned as if they shared their masters anger perhaps it is a mistake he said or he has done so only to keep himself safe let me talk to him he will listen to me he always has velixar shook his head and pointed toward woodhaven in the far distance there is where he left you and there is where he will regretqurrah look to the sky qurrah followed velixars gaze and there in the distance he saw many white objects faintly illuminated by the stars about a hundred qurrah said but what are they elves the man in black said and i know who leads them prepare yourself my disciple i have erred and now we pay the price qurrah nodded then closed his eyes and rehearsed the spells he knew they were weak compared to his masters but they would claim a few lives his whip curled around his arm yearning for more bloodshed the white dots in the distance grew at a frightening rate such speed qurrah said how they are the ekreissar velixar answered the quellan elite are the only ones capable of raising and flying the winged horses when they fly in stay low and aim your spells for their horses the rider will die from the fall the man in black closed his eyes and spoke to the undead surrounding them hide our presence he ordered spread about and do not halt your movement for all eternity the two thousand obeyed scattering in a constantly moving jumble of arms and legs that should help keep our presence hidden for a time qurrah said they are but distractions the darkness will hide us from their arrows before qurrah could ask what velixar meant his master was already in the midst of another spell inky darkness rose all about his feet swirling like black floodwaters chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew velixar cried out the final words of the spell spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions so high it covered up to their necks it is cold qurrah said his teeth chattering you will not be harmed by it velixar said watching the approaching army with so much hidden they will be hard pressed to target us among my undead hold nothing back they are here w hat should we do one elf shouted above the wind roaring past their ears rain down with our arrows dieredon shouted back watch for the necromancer ignore the undead once you locate him the blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog filled with bobbing heads of velixars army in that chaotic mass dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden not until enough of the undead had been massacred he readied his bow his strong legs the only thing holding him to sonowin three arrows pressed against the string of the bow their tips dripping with blessed water his quiver as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him was filled with water given to them by their clerics of celestia when their arrows bit into dead flesh it would be like fire on a dry leaf let no life lost this night be in vain dieredon cried as they descended like a white river raining arrows into the darkness more than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass but a thousand more swayed in their sick distracting dance one free pass velixar said observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead they banked around still in perfect formation and then dove again kill them now he ordered his fingers crooking into strange shapes hemorrhage qurrah hissed pointing at the nearest horse blood ruptured from the beautiful creatures neck the rider steadied her best he could he knew his doom though for the horse could not maintain flight they crashed into the inky blackness crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces velixars first attack was far more impressive bits of bone ripped out from his undead army femurs fingers ribs and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault the elves broke formation as the barrage approached the first ten however were too close to have hope bone shredded wings and scattered feathers the elves that were alive when their horses landed died by the clawing hands of rotted flesh dieredon looped in the sky his calm fading at the sight of so many of his friends killed he fired arrows three at a time his quiver never approaching empty he ordered sonowin lower shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths skimming above the darkness dieredon fired volley after volley behind him when they were past the undead he pulled sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield the ranks of the undead were half of what they had been yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see come sonowin we will find him even if it means killing every last one of his puppets the horse neighed and dove spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death b ehind you master qurrah said he hurried the words of a spell as velixar turned an incorporeal hand shot from qurrahs own flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight the hand struck the elf in the chest freezing flesh and surrounding his insides with ice the flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog beautiful qurrah velixar said his red eyes burning with bloodlust his precious undead were being massacred he could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind now but a third of what his glorious army had been this has gone on long enough he seethed he outstretched his hands and shrieked out words of magic qurrah staggered back in awe of the power that came rolling forth the fog of darkness swirled and recoiled at each word velixar spoke the cold on his flesh grew sharper as the blackness grew thicker be gone from me velixar cried yanking down his arms power exploded from him shoving the darkness back six fingered hands ripped up from the black some smaller than a childs some as large as houses each one lunged to the sky clutching and grabbing at the elves that circled above retreat one elf shouted banking as black fingers tore through the air just before his mount another screamed as a hundred tiny hands enveloped him crushing the life from his body dieredon clutched sonowins neck as a hand the size of a tree swung openpalmed at him as if swatting a fly sonowin spun diving closer to the darkness and underneath the giant hand cries of pain filled the night as more and more elves fell to the reaching black magic dieredon held on tight trusting sonowin with his life he scanned the battlefield as they whirled up and down over one hand and then dancing away from another just as sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead sonowin he shouted to his steed there you must get to them the horse snorted banked around and dove straight for the approaching hands a quick spiral avoided the first wave dieredon clutched his bow as he held on for dear life his eyes locked on the man in black who stood perfectly still his arms at downward angles from his body the rest of the elves were in full retreat he was the only one left qurrah watched dieredons approach with a gnawing fear in his chest it seemed no hand could touch this one the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have had velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach his eyes rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands be gone qurrah said firing several pieces of bone all pieces missed he tried to cast another hemorrhage spell but the words felt heavy and drunk on his tongue his mind ached his chest heaved and when the spell finished it created nothing but a wound the size of an arrowhead in the side of sonowin master defend yourself qurrah shouted as loud as he could still nothing more and more hands curled in surrounding dieredon and sonowin in a magical maelstrom yet still they came fly sonowin the elf shouted fly safe dieredon leapt from sonowins back the blades on his bow gleaming he fell through the air the long spike on the bottom aimed directly for velixars head master qurrah shouted again shoving his body against velixars his concentration broken velixar lost his control of the black fog the darkness swirled inward as if velixar were the center of a giant drain the blackness filled him surrounded him and consumed him when all returned and dieredon about to land a wave of pure sound and power exploded outward velixar was awaking and he was angry qurrah flew through the air from this wave crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail the collision blasted the air from his lungs when he hit the ground stars filled his vision dieredon fought but could not resist that same wave of power the point of his blade halted a foot from the top of the black hood before he flew back in the distance qurrah watched his master glaring at the damned elf that had fallen like a mad man with his bladed bow scoutmaster velixar growled his voice deep and dark like an ancient daemon of old twice you have looked upon me and lived no more dieredon twirled his bow his face calm and emotionless too many have died at your hand what life you have ends tonight velixar roared a sound that made qurrah shiver and avert his eyes his masters back was to him so he could not see the face that dieredon saw full of rotted skin and crawling feasting things suddenly dieredon pulled back the blades in his bow snapped inward arrows cannot hurt me velixar mocked they did not the first time why do you hope so now because these arrows are different he fired three at once all burying deep into velixars chest the man in black screamed as the blessed water covering them burned his skin he fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots you will suffer he gasped for ages i will make you suffer try it said dieredon two more arrows flew but they halted in midair velixar stood his hand outstretched gripping the projectiles with his mind the elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others fool velixar hissed at once the arrows turned and resumed their flight straight at dieredon the elf dove rolling underneath the barrage not an arrow had hit earth before the elf tucked his feet and kicked the blades sprang from his bow he crossed the distance between the two in a heartbeat velixar accepted a stab deep into his chest a pale hand grabbed dieredons throat its grip iron and its flesh ice it will be painful velixar said vile magic swirled about his hand pouring into dieredons neck the blood in his veins there clotted and thickened flooding his mind with pain a toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air he rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat qurrah glanced about paralyzed with fear the remaining elves were returning deadly and furious and the darkness that had protected them was gone do you feel it velixar said stalking over to the dying elf the blood in your throat is clotting your mind will starve and your heart will burst trying to force blood through he knew he should speak he had to warn master but he could not open his mouth he could not move the pegasi were closer they were readying their bows he had to speak can you feel it the man in black asked can you feel your heart shudder and throb here let me help your pain dieredon lay on his back staring up at him his chest was a mess of pain his mind light and dizzy as velixar reached down his maggoty face smiling his hand dripping with unholy magic a wave of arrows rained upon him five buried into velixars back six more found his legs and arms he arched and shrieked as the blessed water flooded his wretched body with pain unimaginable dieredon staggered to his feet his bow still in his hands the man in black reached around and tore out the arrows from his body still no blood flowed my name is dieredon the elf gasped know it before i send you to the abyss he fired two arrows one for each eye they shattered into fire and finally blood did flow it ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face over his black robes and pooled in the grass below he fell prone still screaming out his anger and fury five hundred years he had walked the land of dezrel all that time all those killings and this was how he would fail karak he shouted all his power fleeing him his undead minions collapsed their souls released the gates to the abyss opened before his eyes and he felt the pull on his soul the dark fire already burned he saw the face of his master and the sick grin there horrified him i will not die he shrieked i will not die his flesh burned in fire his bones blew away as dust on the wind and only an empty robe remained of the being that was velixar yet still haunting the wind was his final cry a promise to the world of dezrel i will not die miles away harruq awoke screaming aurelia rushed to his side as he curled into a ball shuddering greatly hes dead he said cold sweat covered his body remnants of his nightmare floated before his eyes the icy voice of velixar rolling over him in his vengeful fury all hed known all hed ever loved was dead and gone only karak had remained furious at the loss through it all one single fact pulsed as an undeniable truth velixar harruq said clutching aurelias hands and sighing with a mixture of relief and terror hes dead im free aurelia kissed his forehead as the halforc drifted back to sleep still overcome with his exhaustion to her eyes it seemed he slept far better than he had before q urrah did not know what to say or do as he watched his master die his entire world had just come crashing down in the darkness above him were more than fifty elves each one eager to bury an arrow in his back harruq he said crawling amid the bodies he desperately hoped none would spot him he reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead qurrah shoved the body onto its side curled underneath and then let it fall atop him the weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful but it was his only cover miserable he hid there quietly whispering where are you harruq he said his face buried into the dirt his tears fell to the grass harruq i need you where are you then he heard talking and shut his mouth are you alright dieredon an elf asked the scoutmaster nodded leaning heavily on his bow i will be fine his magic left my body upon his death a neigh brought his attention upward sonowin landed next to him her white hair stained red in places she nuzzled the elf with her nose and snorted something you worry too much old girl dieredon said his voice cracking several times he patted her once and then turned to the elf standing nearby how many did we lose half we paid dearly to kill this man a heavy price dieredon said gingerly climbing atop sonowin heavy but well worth its weight in blood a great evil has left this land let us return to woodhaven for this place of death turns my mouth sour the two took to the air and joined the other survivors they did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies instead a few elves flew low and scattered firestones small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing grass and bodies caught fire and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as he heard the fires erupting all around him everywhere he looked he saw corpses and flame he spotted the robes of velixar and ran to them he picked them up and shook them furious that no body remained you lied to me velixar qurrah said you said you were eternal you said you held the power of a god but you lied you are nothing but dust surrounded by fire and death the halforc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master despite all the arrows and heat they seemed in perfect condition even the stain of blood was already fading qurrah held the side of the hood to his mouth and coughed as the smoke grew ever thicker goodbye velixar he said then he chose a direction and staggered away slowly and with a few wide curves through the carnage he found a way out he huddled the black robes tighter about his thin body relishing the soft feel and perfect fit smoke clogged his lungs but the stinking waves of it were lessening the farther he walked where are you brother qurrah asked once he could breathe freely in the dark before the dawn it seemed he would receive no answer at last he could travel no more he had no food no destination and no company his limbs were weak and his head throbbed with each step to his knees he slumped and with slow breath after breath he let time pass and his strength return while his mind reeled through ideas of how to proceed w hile the sun was still a sliver peeking over the horizon aurelia woke harruq with a shake of his shoulders she then sat back and put her hands to her forehead while the halforc tried to remember where he was can you find him harruq asked her realizing what she was doing he sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame in time she said i have met him only once but i doubt there are any like him stay quiet and be patient her mind was a net and she cast it further and further out scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond found him she whispered a blue portal ripped through the air before qurrah beckoning him he looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape seeing nothing to lose he got to his feet and stepped inside he felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step he could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away brother harruq cried wrapping him in a hug qurrah endured it with his hands at his side i was so worried about you velixar is dead qurrah said eyeing aurelia warily we know the elf said it is well to meet you again qurrah qurrah stepped back from his brother and as he did aurelia noticed his robes and frowned you should have left them he was an evil man following his footsteps will lead to a similar fate the halforc said nothing for a moment all three glanced about the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm qurrah broke the silence woodhaven is behind us he said i have made mistakes as has my brother i saw you leave with him and i know you sacrificed much to protect him for this i thank you all i ask is that we speak naught of this again if we are to travel together it is my only wish a wish gladly granted aurelia said a tiny smile finally cracking free so where is it we should go qurrah glanced at his brother and shrugged the only homes we have known are woodhaven and veldaren i doubt either will gladly accept us i have never been to veldaren aurelia said although i have heard it is beautiful in its own way i can get us inside if all you fear are the gate guards the edict to banish elves is foolish anyway after the casualties he took in woodhaven the king should be forced to revoke it lest any human villages be attacked i wouldnt mind going back home harruq said sound good to you qurrah wherever you two go i will follow he answered settled then aurelia said you two are going to have to play along when we get there though she glanced up to the sky which was still speckled with stars even though dawn fast approached well wait until morning i could use a bit more sleep with that she walked away cast a levitation spell upon herself and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass odd girl qurrah whispered harruq forced a laugh to qurrahs eyes he looked exhausted and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring im sorry i left you there at woodhaven harruq said and im sorry you were alone when velixar died how did it happen elves came and attacked no apologies are necessary harruq all is forgiven no its not all forgiven he said grabbing his brothers shoulders i can see it in your eyes please understand i would have given anything to be there with you qurrahs bloodshot eyes twinkled with fading rage and sorrow but you werent his voice lowered as if he were afraid aurelia would hear you abandoned me for her you left me still wounded and alone and i know what you did brother you turned against velixar you denied the gifts he gave you hes gone harruq said and i want that strength no more we are not his slaves we were his disciples we were his weapons harruq shouted he glanced back at aurelia and held back a curse weapons he said again his voice an angry whisper nothing more if that is your belief qurrah said settling down upon the grass but dont forget the blood on your hands you killed more than i brother now leave me be the night has been long and i need to rest harruq let qurrah sleep in the flattened grass by the fireside as for him he sat between aurelia and qurrah glancing back and forth between the two i can love them both he repeated though seeing the robes qurrah wore he wondered how long before that love split to one or the other he did his best to sleep until dawn epilogue far away ash floated on a cold breeze sucked into a forgotten cavern within a chasm feared by orcs and goblins on the damp floor it fell coalescing into a black muck which stirred by unseen and unfelt winds here a bone poked up from the filth there a fingernail floating above transfixed in patient stasis a soul awaiting a host shone two crimson eyes
