the divide by robert charles wilson part private experiments such an ordinary house such an ordinary beginning but i want it to be an ordinary house susan christopher thought an ordinary house with an ordinary man in it not this monsterto whom i must deliver a message it was a yellow brick boardinghouse in the st jamestown area of toronto a neighborhood of lowrent highrises and immigrant housing susan was from suburban los angeleslately from the university of chicagoand she felt misplaced here she stood for a moment in the chill sunny silence of the afternoon doublechecking the address dr kyriakides had written on a slip of pink memo paper this number yes this street she fought a momentary urge to run away then up the walk through a scatter of october leaves pausing a moment in the cold foyer the inner door stood open finally down a corridor to the door marked with a chipped gilt number she knocked twice aware of her small knuckles against the ancient veneer of the door across the hall a wizened east indian man peered out from behind his chainlock susan looked up at the ceiling where a swastika had been spraypainted onto the cloudy stucco she was about to knock again when the door opened under her hand but it was a woman who answered a young woman in a white blouse denim skirt torn khaki jacket her feet were bare on the cracked linoleum the womans expression was sullenher lips in a ready belligerent poutand susan dropped her eyes from the narrow face to the jacket where there was a small constellation of buttons and badges bon jovi jim morrison led zeppelin you want something susan guessed this was a frenchcanadian accent nasal and impatient she forced herself to meet the womans eyes woman or girl older than she had first seemed maybe around my age susan thought but it was hard to be sure with the makeup and all she cleared her throat im looking for john shaw oh him is he here no the girl ran a hand through her hair long nails short hair but he lives here uhsometimes are you a friend of his susan shook her head not exactly are you now there was the barest hint of a smile not exactly the girl extended her hand im amelie the hand was small and cool susan introduced herself amelie said hes not here but you can maybe find him at the hour on wellesley you know the doughnut shop susan nodded she would look for wellesley on her map amelie said is it important you look kind of ah worried its pretty important susan said thinking life or death dr kyriakides had told her that susan saw him for the first time her first real look at him through the plateglass window of the doughnut shop she allowed herself this moment seeing him without being seen she recognized him from the pictures dr kyriakides had shown her but susan imagined that she might have guessed who he was just from looking at himthat she would have known at least that he was not entirely normal to begin with he was alone he sat at a small table in the long room three steps down from the sidewalk his face was angled up at the october sunlight relishing it there was a chessboard in front of himthe board built into the lacquered surface of the table and the pieces arranged in ready ranks she had dreamed about this about meeting him dreams that occasionally bordered on nightmares in the dreams john shaw was barely human his head unnaturally enlarged his eyes needlesharp and unblinking the real john shaw was nothing like that of course in his photographs or here in the flesh his monstrosities she thought were buriedbut she mustnt think of him that way he was in trouble and he needed her help hello john shaw she thought his hair was cut close a burr cut but that was fashionable now he was meticulously cleanshaven regular features frown lines maps of character emerging from the geography of his fairly young face here is a man susan thought who worries a lot a gust of wind lifted her hair she reached up to smooth it back and he must have glimpsed the motion his head turneda swift owlish flick of the eyesand for that moment he did not seem human the swivel of his head was too calculated the focus of his eyes too fine his eyes suddenly were like the eyes in her dreams john shaw regarded her through the window and she felt spotlit or worse pinneda butterfly in a specimen case both of them were motionless in this tableau until finally john shaw raised a hand and beckoned her inside well susan christopher thought theres no turning back now is there breathing hard she moved down the three cracked steps and through the door of the shop there was no one inside but john shaw and the middleaged woman refilling the coffee machine susan approached him and then stood mute beside the table she couldnt find the words to begin he said you might as well sit down his voice was controlled unafraid neutral in accent susan took the chair opposite him they were separated now by the ranks of the chessboard he said do you play oh i didnt come here to play chess no max sent you her eyes widened at this holmeslike deduction john said well obviously you were looking for me and ive taken some pains to be unlookedfor i could imagine the american government wanting a word with me but you dont look like you work for the government it wasnt a long shotim assuming im correct yes susan stammered dr kyriakides yes i thought he might do this sometime its more important than you think but how to say this he wants you to know john hushed her humor me he said give me a game she looked at the board in high school she had belonged to the chess club she had even played in a couple of local tournamentsnot too badly but youll win she said you know that about me dr kyriakides said your move john said she advanced the white kings pawn two squares reflexively no talk john instructed her as a favor he responded with his own kings pawn i appreciate it she played out the openinga ruy lopezbut was soon in a kind of free fall he did something unexpected with his queens knight and her pawn ranks began to unravel his queen stood in place a vast but nonspecific threat he gave up a bishop to expose her king and the queen at last came swooping out to give checkmate they had not even castled of course the winning was inevitable she knewdr kyriakides had told herthat john shaw had played tournament chess for a time that he had never lost a game that he had dropped out of competition before his record and rating began to attract attention she wondered how the board must look to him simple she imagined a graph of possibilities a kindergarten problem he thanked her and began to set up the pieces again his large hands moving slowly meticulously she said you spend a lot of time here yes playing chess sometimes most of the regulars have given up on me but you still do it when i get the chance but surely i mean dont you always win he looked at her he smiled but the smile was cryptic she couldnt tell whether he was amused or disappointed one hopes john shaw said she walked back with him to the rooming house attentive now her fears beginning to abate but still reluctant how could she tell him but she must she used this time to observe him what dr kyriakides had told her was true john wore his strangeness like a badge there was no pinning down exactly what it was that made him different his walk was a little ungainly he was too tall his eyes moved restlessly when he spoke but none of that added up to anything significant the real difference she thought was more subtle pheremones or something on that level she imagined that if he sat next to you on a bus you would notice him immediatelyturn look maybe move to another seat no reason just this uneasiness something odd here it was almost dark an early october dusk the streetlights blinked on casting complex shadows through the brittle trees coming up the porch stairs to the boardinghouse susan saw him hesitate stiffen a moment lock one hand in a fierce embrace of the banister my god she thought its some kind of seizurehes sickbut it abated as quickly as it had come he straightened himself up and put his key in the door susan said will amelie be here amelie works a night shift at a restaurant on yonge street shes out by six most evenings you live with her no i dont live with her the apartment seemed even more debased in this light than susan had guessed from her earlier glimpse it consisted of one main room abutting a closetsized bedroomshe could make out the jumbled bedclothes through the doorand an even tinier kitchen the place smelled greasy amelies dinner susan guessed leftovers still congealing in the pan salvation army furniture and a sad dim floral wallpaper why would he live here why not a mansiona palace he could have had that but he was sick too maybe that had something to do with it she said i know what you are he nodded mildly as if to say yes all right he shifted a stack of magazines to make room for himself on the sofa youre one of maxs students i was she corrected molecular biology i took a sabbatical money money mostly my father died after a long illness it was expensive there was the possibility of loans and so forth but i didnt feeli just didnt enjoy the work anymore dr kyriakides offered me a job until i was ready to face my thesis again at first i was just collating notes you know doing some library research for a book hes working on then then he told you about me yes he must trust you i suppose so im sure of it and he sent you here finally yes he wasnt sure youd be willing to talk directly to him but its very important not just auld long syne he wants to see you for medical reasons yes am i ill then yes he smiled again the smile was devastatingsuperior knowing but at the same time obviously forced an act of bravery he said well i thought so susan had no relish for this talk of illness her fathers illness had dominated her life for almost a year keeping her on a dizzying rollercoaster of falling grades missed deadlines serial flights to california in her graduate work she had been doing lab chores for dr kyriakides a study involving the enzyme mechanics of cancerous cell division and it had been too painful an irony that shuttle between the colonies of laboratory cells and her fathers bed where he was dying of liver cancer there is such a thing susan thought as too much knowledge she could not bear this meticulous understanding of the mechanism of her fathers death she began to dream of malignant cells chromosomes writhing inside their nuclei like angry poisonous insects she suspected that the work dr kyriakides gave her was a kind of charity he had explained to herthe sophisticated european to the parvenu californian waspthat this was good and useful that a person in mourning ought to have tasks to attend to she was skeptical but grateful and within a month she began to admit he was right there was solace in the library stacks in the numbers that marched so eloquently across the cool amber screen of her pc terminal her grasp of the work began to deepen dr kyriakides was a brilliant man the book would be brilliant their relationship was not a friendship but something that in susans opinion was much finer she began to feel like a colleague she took her own work more seriously then in august dr kyriakides had escorted her to a creek restaurant in the mezzanine of a downtown hotel and had ordered impressively for both of them medallions of lamb an expensive wine she had wondered with vast apprehension whether he meant to proposition her instead he leaned forward and gazed into the bowl of his wine goblet a quarter of a century ago he said when i was just out of harvard and the government was paying so many smart people to commit such stupid acts i did something i should not have done it was the first time shed heard the name john shaw you can see his illness she thought now waves of discomfort seemed to sweep across johns face he clenched his teeth a moment then he said im sorry dr kyriakides wants to see you susan said the changes youre going through arent necessarily irreversible he told you that he can help no john said he told me you might react this way but theres no one else you can go to and hewants to help i think its beyond that how can you be sure no offense intended but my guess is as good as maxs but susan began and then faltered the pain he was sufferingif it was in fact a physical painovertook him again the smile that had grown small and ironic now disappeared altogether his knuckles whitened against the arm of the chair his face seemed to change as if a great variety of emotions had overtaken him a sudden shifting she thought of wind across a wheatfield she was frightened now she said what can i do can i help he shook his head you can leave the rejection was absolute it hurt susan said well maybe youre rightmaybe he cant help it was her own moment of cruelty but it caught his attention she persisted but what if youre wrong theres at least a chance dr kyriakides said fuck dr kyriakides susan was quietly shocked she stood up blushing no wait john said leave your number what leave your number or your address your hotel room write it down theres paper over there ill call i promise we can talk it over but right nowi need to be alone right now she nodded scribbled down her name and the hotel moved to the door she turned back with the idea of making some final entreaty but it was pointless he had dismissed her she was as good as invisible he sat with his eyes closed and his head pressed between his hands containing himself as if he might explode susan thought as she hurried down the walk into the cold october night or shutting out the world as if it might rush in and drown him amelie desjardins understood very quickly that she was having a bad dayand that it would only get worse george the manager at the goodtime grill had put her on a split shift for the week she worked from eleventhirty to twothirty took an afternoon break then she was back from fivethirty to eight oclock at night which pretty much fucks up your day amelie thought since she was too tired to do much after the lunch rush except trek back to st jamestown for a napher nap having been interrupted this afternoon by the woman looking for john which was mysterious in itself and amelie might have worried more about it but she had other things on her mind first she had come in to work a little late and george climbed down her throat about it then there was prep and setup and it seemed as if every salt shaker in the place had gone empty all at once which was a hassle then alberto the cook chose this terrific time to start coming on to her and that was a balancing act you wouldnt wish on a trapeze artist because you have to be on good terms with the cook a friendly cook will juggle substitutions fill your orders fast do you a hundred little favors that add up to tips but when you came right down to it amelie thought alberto was about as oily as the deepfat fryer which not coincidentally he seldom cleaned alberto rolled through the steamy kitchen like a huge sweating demiurge when he wasnt peeking through the door of the changing room trying to catch a waitress in her underwear so it was you look really good tonight alberto and winking at him and sharing some of her tips and then getting the hell out of his way before he could deliver one of his patented demeaning gropes it amounted to a nasty kind of ballet and today amelie was just slow enough that she was forced to dislodge alberto with her elbowwhich left him in a vengeful sulk throughout the dinner rush amelie was philosophical about working at the goodtime it was not a prestigious restaurant but it was not a dive either it was a workingclass wineandbeer establishment that had been in business for thirtyfive years in this location and would probably be edged out before long by the rising rentsjudging by the plague of croissant houses and sushi bars that had descended on the neighborhood at the goodtime there was always a fishandchips lunch special fifteen tables and a few framed photographs of the parthenon the walls had recently been stuccoed amelie had been working at the goodtime for almost a year now and she had a kind of seniority for what it was worththe newer girls would come to her with questions but seniority counted for shit seniority did not prevent the occurrence of truly rotten days like today when the new girl tracy innocently grabbed off a couple of her regulars and seated them in her own section like today when she was stiffed for a tip on a big meal like today when some lowlife picked a busy moment to walk out on his checkwhich george would sometimes forgive but of course not today today he docked her for the bill it was maybe not the worst day amelie had ever experienced that honor was held by the memorable occasion on which a female customer had come in during the afternoon ordered the soup of the day meticulously garnished the soup with crushed soda crackers then retired to the ladies and opened her wrists both wrists thoroughly and fatally amelie had found her there george told her later that this had happened four times during the history of the goodtime and that restaurant toilets were a popular place for suicidesstrange as that seemed well amelie thought maybe a suicide doesnt want a cheerful place to die still she could not imagine taking her final breath in one of those grim salmoncolored stalls so this was a bad day but not the worst dayshe was consoling herself with that thoughtwhen tracy tapped her shoulder and said there was a call for her on the pay phone bad news in itself no one was supposed to take calls on the pay phone she could think of only one person who would call her here thanks she said and delivered an order to alberto then checked to see if george was hanging around before she picked up the receiver it was roch her intuition had been correct avery bad day he said youre still working at that pit listen amelie said this is not a good time for me i havent called you for months you shouldnt call me at work then come by my placewhen you get off tonight we dont have anything to talk about amelie realized that her hand was cramping around the receiver that both hands were sweaty that her voice sounded high and throttled in her own ears roch said dont be so shitty to your brother and she recognized the tone of offhanded belligerence that was always a kind of warning signal a red flag she heard herself become placating its justits like i saida bad time i cant talk now call me at home roch okay youll be home tonight well she didnt like the way he pounced on that im not sure what you have plans she took a deep breath im living with someone what youre doingwhat the outrage and the hurt in his voice made her feel a hot rush of guilt crazy of course why should she consult him but she hadnt and he was family but she could never have told him about benjamin she had been hopingin a wistful unconscious waythat the two of them would never have to meet the party at table four was signaling for her this was amelie recognized a truly shitty day she forced herself to say that she was living with a guy and that it might not be all right for roch to come over she just couldnt say maybe he ought to phone up first there was a very long silence and then rochs voice became very sweet very ingratiating all right looki just want you to be happy okay im serious amelie insisted so am i id like to meet this guy i dont know if thats a good idea hey ill be nice what is it you dont trust me i justwell call me all right call me before you do anything whatever you want she waited until the line went dead then stood with her forehead pressed against the cool glass of the enclosure took a breath smoothed a wrinkle out of her uniform forced herself to turn back toward the tables george was standing therehands on his hips a monumental frown you know youre not supposed to use this phone she managed im sorry by the way the corner table the party that was waiting for the bill they had to leave now george smiled tracy took your tip she was out of the place by nine nine oclock on a friday in october and yonge street was crowded with the usual well amelie thought of them astypes street kids with leather jackets and weird haircuts bluehaired old ladies in miniskirts lots of the kind of lonely people you see scurrying past on nights like this with no discernible destination but in a wild hurry to get there heads down shoulders up mean and shy at the same time it made her glad to have a home to head for even if it was only a shitty apartment in st jamestown shitty but not of course cheapnothing in this town was cheap she peered into the shop windows trying to distract herself but it was a chilly night and she felt intimidated by the warm glow of interiors and the orange light spilling out of bus windows as she trudged past the transit station nights like this had always seemed comfortless to her you could smell winter gathering like an army just over the horizon nights like this her thoughts ran in odd directions she thought about roch although she didnt want to she thought about benjamin impossible to imagine the two of them together they were so different although and here was the only similarity each of them seemed to amelie endlessly mysterious roch should not have been a mystery roch after all was her brother they shared family if you could call it family an absentee father and a mother who was arrested for shoplifting with such startling regularity that she had been banned from eatons simpsons and ogilvys sometimes amelie felt as if she had been raised by a social welfare caseworker shed been fostered out twice but the thing was you learned to adapt roch her little brother never did they grew up in a rough part of montreal and went to the kind of catholic school where the nuns carried wooden rulers with metal edges embedded in themin certain hands a deadly weapon the nuns were big on geometry and devotions amelie however had had her own agenda in an era when the parti quebecois was dismantling english from the official culture amelie had resolved to teach herself the language not just the debased english everybody knew not just the english you needed to follow a few american tv showsreal english she had conceived of a destiny outside montreal she saw herself living in english canada maybe eventually the states doing something glamorousshe wasnt sure what maybe it would involve show business maybe she would manage a famous rock band maybe she would wait tables roch was different he never had any ambitions that amelie could figure out when he was real little he would follow her around as singlemindedly as a duckling she would tow him down st catherines street on sunny summer days buy cokes and hot dogs and spend the afternoon watching the types from the steps of christ church cathedral roch had needed the company he never had friends he took a long time learning to talk and he wasnt reading with any facility until he was in fifth grade roch it turned out was slow not stupidamelie made this important distinctionjust slow when roch learned something he hung on to it fiercely but he took his time and in that school in that place taking your time was a bad thing it made you look stupid not cleverstupid or sullenstupid or anything dignified it made you look dogdumb especially if you were also small and ugly and fat amelie had been bruised a few times defending roch in the schoolyard and that was when she bothered to stand up for him a thirteenyearold girl sometimes doesnt want to know when her idiot brother is catching flack she thought of him that way tooher idiot brotherat least sometimes but rochwasnt stupid amelie knew and he learned a lot he learned not to trust anybody he learned that you could do what you wanted if you were big enough and strong enough and he learned to get mad he had a real talent for getting mad pointlessly agonizingly mad skintearing mad going home and vomiting mad and then eventually he learned something else he learned that if you grow up a little bit and put on some muscle then you can inspire fear in other peopleand oh what an intoxicating discovery that must have been amelie trudged along wellesley into st jamestown past the hookers on the comer of parliament thinking octobernight thoughts she stopped at a convenience store to pick up a couple of tv dinners the threehundredcalorie kind she was skinnyshe knew it in an offhand waybut her reflection in the shop windows always looked fat mama had been fat with a kind of listless alcoholic fatness amelie dreaded amelie was young and skinny and she meant to stay that way she put roch out of her mind and thought about benjamin instead and that lightened her mood she even managed a smile standing at the checkout counter because benjamin was the great discovery of her life a recent discovery he had come into the goodtime just about six months ago on one of those ugly spring days when the wind is raw and wet and just about anybody is liable to wander in off the street she took him at first for one of those wanderers a tall benignlooking shy man with a puppydog smile his collar turned up and a black woolen cap plastered to his head an oddball but not a type exactly he looked straight at her in a way amelie appreciated she remembered thinking the odds were mixed on somebody like that he might tip generously or not at all you could never tell but he did tip and he came back the next day and the day after that pretty soon he was one of her regulars he came in late one wednesday and she told him im going offshiftyoure late and he said well ill walk you home in that straightahead way and amelie said that would be all rightshe didnt even have to think about itand pretty soon they were seeing each other pretty soon after that he moved out of his basement room on bathurst and into the st jamestown apartment benjamin was decent wellmeaning kind roch enjoyed crushing people like that amelies smile faded and of course there was the other problem which she tried not to think about because even among these other mysteries it wastoo mysterious too strange the thing about benjamin was he wasnt always benjamin the apartment was a mess but it felt warm and cozy when amelie let herself in she kicked off her shoes ran some hot water for the dishes plugged a doors tape into the stereo she was not deeply into sixties rock but there was something about morrison he just never sounded oldfashioned the tape wasstrangedays the song that came up was people are strange loping drumbeat and ray manzarek moaning away on keyboard that real sparse guitar sound and morrisons voice doing his usual psychosexy thing timeless but she turned it down a little when she peeked into the bedroom and saw benjamin asleep under the covers he slept odd hours that was one of the strange things about him but she doubted the tape would wake himhe slept like a slab of granite back to the dishes amelie thought awright yeah said morrison and if roch came by but maybe he wouldnt she consoled herself with that thought bearing down with the scrub brush on one of the chinese dragon bowls shed bought in chinatown the basic fact about roch was his unpredictability he might say he was going to do something but that didnt mean shit you never could tell she took some marginal comfort in these thoughts losing herself in the rhythm of the music and the soapy smell of the hot water she was draining the sink when the last song the musics over faded out she heard the click of the tape as it switched off the faint metallic transistor hiss from the speakers and the knock at the door you should have called i tried earlier you werent home roch stood blinking in the hallway youre supposed to invite me in amelie stood aside as he came through the door place is a mess he observed i just got home all right he shrugged and sat down it was six months since amelie had seen her brother but it was obvious he hadnt let up on his gym work he was six foot one a head taller than amelie and his shoulders bulked out under his bomber jacket ad the body work however had done nothing for his looks his face was wide and pasty his lips were broad he stood with his hands in his jacket pockets and amelie could see them moving there knitting and unraveling making fists the fingernails digging into the palms she told him to sit down he pushed aside a pile of newspapers and sprawled on the sofa amelie made coffee and talked to him from the kitchen there had been a letter from montreal mama was adjusting to the new apartment even though it was smaller than the old one uncle baptiste had been in town looking for work when the seaway trade picked up again she kept her voice down because it was possible even now that benjamin might sleep through the whole thing that roch would say what he had to say and then leave she pinned her hopes on that she poured a cup of coffee for him and one for herself and carried them into the living room she sat opposite him in the easy chair took a sipbitter black coffeeand listened to the sudden silence of the room the absence of her own voice roch said i lost my job she put her cup down oh shit he waved his hand it was a stupid job roch had been working as a parcel clerk at the bpx depot the last amelie had heard this was frankly not a great surprise roch had never been good at keeping jobs but it was not good news either she said you found anything else i have some leads what happened he shrugged you have any money he said is that an offer i dont have a hell of a lot to spare roch was silent for a while his expression was reptilian amelie thought the combination of his pout and the slow periodic blinking of his eyes she was tempted to stare instead she looked at her coffee cup roch said you could earn some whatgeorge is gonna raise my salary because i have an unemployed brother it was the wrong thing to say her brother paused in his blinking calyx amelie do you think im stupid when roch got angry he slipped into his fathers vernacular it wascalyx this and tabernacle that maudit ciboire de christ and so on venerable back country curses she shrank down in her chair thats not what i meant roch smiled the steady semaphoring of his eyelids began again waitressing is not the only way to make money i dont understand i have a problem here i have to pay rent you know look what do you want some cash a loan she reached for her purse i can give you twenty fuck that roch said twenty dollars christ she waited he said remember when we came to this city now amelie was silent for a beat yes she said you remember what we did then deep breath yes maybe the time has come again no amelie said what i said no all right is that clear i wont do it i dont like the tone of your voice i dont care she couldnt look at him he said you dont care that im brokethat ill be out on the street no i meant hey im your little brother you look after me so you want to pimp for me is that your idea of a good career move christ de calyx as her father might have said but roch only smiled you can keep your day job well fuck you her reaction was involuntary she hated him for bringing up the subject sure she had done some things in the past she was barely seventeen when they left home roch was younger they slept on warehouse roofs some nights and other nights they rented rooms in the wino hotels on queen street you cant survive on the street without doing something you dont like and so maybe she had done thatwhat he talked aboutwhen they needed the money and maybe once or twice just because they wanted the money but that was the old days he was crazy coming here with a proposition like that so she stood up and said fuck you and it was a mistake because roch did not take well to that kind of abuseas he had told her many timesand now he was standing up inches away from her so close she could smell the hotmetal reek of his breath he did not blink at all he took her wrist in a fierce grip all that weightlifting had made him strong he said you do it if i tell you to do it then he slapped her the slap was painful and amelie stumbled away from him she caught her foot against the table supporting the stereo she fell down hard on the floor and the tape player came tumbling down after her strange days popped out of the cassette compartment with a streamer of tape reeling after it amelie closed her eyes opened them and saw benjamin come out of the bedroom she looked up from the floor blinking benjamin stood in the doorway with his levis half unbuttoned and his belt undone he was naked from the waist up his hair was tousled he gave amelie a long look and then stared at roch he said who the hell are you never mind amelie said its nothing but the damage was already done roch broke out into a big anticipatory grin im her brother roch said who the fuck are you benjamin stepped forward he was as tall as roch but less bulkyhe looked emaciated by comparison and fragile his hairless chest exposed he said i guess you were leaving amelie had never heard him talk like that before roch said guess again benjamin didnt flinch he was looking at roch with an expression amelie had never seen on him before a kind of automatic and terrible contempt which unnerved roch who balled his fist get out of my face roch said get out of my home benjamin said roch drew back his fist but benjamin hit him in the face roch just stood there blinking as if he was working it out in his headwhat happenedwhatthen raised his hand to his nose it was bleeding roch examined the blood for a long moment then he drew back his fist and threw it at benjamin in a terrible pistoning boxers punch but benjamin moved out of the way somehow and then rochwho was a member of a cabbagetown boxing club a heavyweightthrew a couple of very serious street punches but benjamin just leaned around them somehow and threw a few punches of his own little nettling jabs that infuriated the bigger man it was crazy amelie thought it was not even a fight there was nothing fair about it it was a humiliation roch was turning a bright brick red he screamed stand still you fucking faggot and benjamin stood still but roch didnt respondcouldnt maybe the expression on benjamins face was terrifying it was a cold radiant confidence in his own supremacy an unblinking ferocity he moved closer to roch now stood so that he was separated from him by a few inches of air amelie imagined the space between them as whitehot flashing with some kind of invisible lightning she could not see all of benjamins face now but she could see rochs and she was stunned by the fear he began suddenly to radiate staring into benjamins eyes and seeing what something awful benjamin said one word very low amelie thought it was leave roch turned away like a whipped child and lurched to the door before he left he turned and pointed a trembling finger down at amelie he looked as if he was about to burst into tears you he said you cunt and then fled and amelie turned to look at benjamin and understood all at once what had happened he wasnt benjamin right now he was john he looked down at her in that way she hated a mixture of pity and condescension at the back of his eyes he started to say somethingit might have been im sorry get out amelie said she was embarrassed hurt humiliatedshe couldnt stand him looking at her just leave his eyes lingered a moment longer then he nodded he went back to the bedroom for a shirt and a jacket and then he left but he stopped on the way out and picked up something that had slipped off the lampstand during his fight with roch it looked like a scrap of paper amelie thought with maybe a phone number written on it it was near midnight when john called susan had eaten dinner at the hotel coffee shop and had come back to her room to read hiding from this strange city in the pages of a book she had a joyce carol oates novel and a travis mcgee mystery both from the paperback rack in the lobby she loved to read and after her fathers death she had thought about giving up the sciences and starting over as an english major she decided against it for a couple of reasons her taste in reading was way too catholicshe read faulkner and stephen king with approximately equal relish and she was afraid of destroying the pleasure she took in these books susan was not analytical about fiction she had been twelve years old before she understood that books had writers that they had to be manufactured somehow like shoes better not to inquire too closely into cherished illusions they were fragile tonight the joyce carol oates seemed a little too architectural she slipped into the welcoming embrace of travis mcgee old travis had mellowed a lot in his later books he had more second thoughts these days she liked that with the drapes open she curled up in bed propped up with pillows behind her and a view of the city lights running north to the horizon she was three chapters into the book and inclining toward sleep when the phone rang she picked it up expecting dr kyriakides but it was late for him to be calling she couldnt place the voice at first john shaw he said wellobviously but he sounded younger on the phone you couldnt see his eyes his eyes were ancient susan struggled to assemble her thoughts im glad you called i think youre right he said i think we should talk i agree uh maybe we can get together tomorrow youre at the carlton yes ill meet you in the lobby is noon all right of coursesure see you there and then the line went dead and she was left sleepy and amazed staring at the receiver in her hand she rode the elevator down at five minutes to noon the next morning and found him waiting he was standing by a marble pillar dressed in worn levis track shoes and a blue windbreaker over a tshirt with his hands tucked into his jacket pockets susan moved toward him with her heart beating hard as his head swiveled owlishly and his eyes focused in on her im sorry she said i dont think i did a very good job yesterday i didnt know how to start youre in a tough position john said the messenger with bad news plusi guess i was a little frightened he smiled of me she laughed but it was true she had been frightened still was but it was easier now at least a little where do we go for lunch depends i dont have a lot of cash are you on an expense account its paid for by max ultimately well theres a decent japanese restaurant around the block im sure max can afford it sounds fine susan said she had never eaten japanese food but didnt want to admit it the atmosphere in the restaurant was traditional koto music and waitresses in tight kimonos she felt somewhat gauche lost among the rice paper screens she let john order for her the waitress brought miso soup in a wooden bowl no spoonsapparently you were supposed to pick up the bowl like a cup john said youre not used to this she forced a smile redondo beach wasp we never ate anything more challenging than mexican i remember a lot of tv dinners the main course is tempura nothing scary unless you have a problem with shrimp no thats fine you know i learned to eat cantonese and szechuan in college just never got around to japanese john turned his attention to the soup he ate meticulously susan observed almost mechanically when the bowl was empty he pushed it aside and ignored it max knows im ill straight to the point susan thought he suspected it is he still working with prenatal growth regulators not officially but on his own some animal research out of curiosity i wonder or guilt susan frowned im sorry he waved his handnever mind the waitress brought sashimi on wooden plates thank you susan said the waitress bowed and returned a thank you it might be easier john said if you just told me what you know about me we can begin there but it was a tall orderwhat kind of monster do you think i am susan told him what dr kyriakides had explained to herthat john was the product of a clandestine research project conducted in the fifties before his birth he had received an intrauterine cocktail of cortical growth regulators human hormones dr kyriakides had isolated under a classified government grant the purpose of the research was to produce a superior human being specifically in the neocortical functionsthe most highly evolved functions such as intelligence johns smile was fixed highly evolvedsounds like max he told you all this at greater length and with more breastbeating he does feel guilty i have the impression he always did did he mention that his government grant was by way of a client operation of the cia that his name came up twice in the church committee hearings yes he says they were funding everything in those dayslsd at mcgill exotic botany at harvard postwar insanity did he also mention that he was the closest thing to a father i had for the first several years of my life something like that and that he farmed me out for adoption when the project was closed down he didnt have a choice but now he wants to talk because he thinks im dying i should never have said that im sorryi just wanted to get your attention but its possible the animal studies have been mixed susan admitted some animals have died she looked at the table yes the tempura arrived then susan picked at hers it was good but shed lost her appetite john ate vigorously when the check arrived susan used her credit card and filed away the customer copy john said are you up to walking a little she nodded its a good day for it autumn is the best time of year in this city he stood up and pulled his windbreaker over his tshirt i dont get many afternoons like this they rode the college streetcar west to augusta the day was cool but endlessly sunny the sky a shade of blue you never saw in la when the streetcar stopped john climbed down through the rattling midcar doors and offered her his hand how dry his skin is susan thought and then scolded herself for thinking it he wasnt an animal after all he led her south through a maze of ethnic markets fish stalls vegetable bins usedclothing outlets this was kensington market john said and it was his favorite part of the city it was also crowded and more than a little bewilderingno two signs in the same languagebut susan felt some of the carnival atmosphere maybe picking it up from john he took her to a cafe a sidewalk table under an umbrella and far enough from the fish stalls that the air was tolerable he ordered two cups of fierce cappucino legal drugs smiled at her she sipped the coffee he said well maybe i am dying her cup rattled against the saucer do you always have these twotrack conversations you mean is this a manifestation of my superhuman intellect or just an annoying habit no i dont mean that i meanwell if you dont want to talk about it max must have warned you surely john the monster he startled her by closing his eyes youre wearing levis and a brown sweater with a checked collar showing at the neck you have brown hair blue eyes a mole under your right cheekbone and another one just under your ear you have both hands on the table the nail is chipped on your left index finger you dont wear nail polish the building behind you is catching the sunlight it has twentyeight rectangular windows facing the street and a revolving door with a mango cart parked on the sidewalk in front of it the cart vendor is wearing a yellow plaid shirt and a black beret a grey nissan stanza just drove past southboundit should be at the intersection by now he opened his eyes and stared at her you come from southern california and youre timid with people you have an exaggerated respect for dr kyriakidestake my word for itand some unresolved feelings about your own father you have a suppressed speech impediment that begins to surface when you talk about your home which you dont like to do you think you like me but youre still a little frightened you stop it there was a silence susan blushed deeply john said more gently i dont want you to forget what i am as if i ccould she thought about leaving she wasnt sure her legs would hold her how can you know all that about me because youre a book not just you susan everyone a book of gestures and twitches and blinks and grimaces do you want me to be frightened of you only appropriately frightened he added im sorry gradually she relaxed back into her chair do you still want to talk do you still want me to she took a deep breath yes to you or to max talk to me if you want but only dr kyriakides can help you if in fact he can if she didnt want to risk lyingassuming it was possible to lie to him its a game of chance then isnt it roulette im not the doctor youre the doctoral candidate its not exactly my field i never worked directly with dr kyriakides on this except for a few tissue studies he shook his head im not ready to talk to max then me talk to me he gave her another long speculative look susan could not help wincing my god she thought those eyes not the windows of the soul more like knives like scalpels maybe it would be good to talk he said its been a long time since i talked to anyone im not going anywhere susan said she asked whether he had been having symptoms episodes of fever sometimes dangerously high transient muscular weakness and some pain fugue statesif you want to call them that is that what was happening yesterday he nodded i dont know what you mean by a fugue state he sipped his cappucino may i tell you a story the formal research project had ended when john was five years old he was adopted by a childless couple the woodwards a middleincome family living in a bleak chicago suburb the woodwards renamed him benjamin though he continued to think of himself as john from the beginning his adoptive parents were disturbed by his uniqueness he didnt do especially well in schoolhe was contemptuous of his teachers and sometimes a discipline problembut he read beyond his years and he made conversation like an adult which the woodwards told him was very disrespectful jim woodward was a lathe operator at an aerospace plant and he resented my intelligence obviously a child doesnt know this or doesnt want to admit it i labored for almost eight years under the impression that i was doing something terribly wrongthat he hated me for some fundamental legitimate reason and so i worked hard to please him to impress him for example i learned to play the flute i borrowed a school instrument and some books i taught myself he loved vivaldi he had this old heathkit stereo he had cobbled together out of a kit and he would play vivaldi for hoursit was the only time i ever saw anything like rapture on his face and so i taught myself the concerto in g the passages for flute and when i had it down i played it for him not just the notes i went beyond that i interpreted it he sat there listening and at first i thought he was in shockhe had that dumbfounded expression i mistook it for pleasure i played harder and he just sat there until i was finished i thought id done it you see that id communicated with him that he would approve of me now and then i put the flute back in the case and looked at him and he blinked a couple of times and then he said i bet you think youre pretty fucking good dont you thats terrible susan said but i wasnt convinced i told myself it just wasnt good enough thats all so i thought well what else is there that matters to him he had a woodworking shop in the basement we were that kind of family the formica counters in the kitchen sunday at the presbyterian church every once in a while the neighbors coming over to play bridge the woodwork shop downstairs but he had quality tools dremel and black and decker and so on and he took a tremendous amount of pride in the work he did he built a guitar once some cousin paid him a hundred dollars for it and he must have put in three times that in raw materials and when it was finished it was a work of art bookmatched hardwood polished and veneeredit took him months when i saw it i wanted it but it had been bought and paid for and he had to send it away i wanted him to make another one but he was already involved in some other project and that was when i saw my opportunityi said ill build it i was nearly thirteen years old i had never so much as touched his woodworking tools show me i said he said youll never manage it its not a beginners project i said let me try and i think now he saw it as his big opportunity maybe this would teach me a lesson so he agreed he showed me how to work the tools and he gave me some books on luthiery he even took me to lumberyards helped me pick out decent woods john paused to sip his cappucino i worked on the guitar that summer whenever he was out of the house because it was an experimentyou understand this would be the communication he would see this and love me for doing it and if he didntall bets were off so i took it very seriously i cut and sanded i routed the neck i installed the fretwire and the tuning machinery i was possessed by that guitar there was not a weekday afternoon through july or august i was out of the house i was dizzy with lacquer fumes half the time and when he came home i would hide the project i didnt want him to see it until it was ready i cleaned the tools and the workshop every day i was meticulous i think he forgot about it thought id given up until i showed it to him susan said oh no it was perfect of course max probably told you what his research had suggested long before it was fashionable sciencethat the neocortical functions arent just intelligence its also dexterity timing the attention span the sense of pitch eyehand coordinationthings as pertinent to music or luthiery as they are to say mathematics jim woodward thought hed found a task that was beyond me in fact he could hardly have picked one i was better suited to maybe that guitar wasnt flawless but it was close it was a work of art susan said he hated it john smiled his humorless raw smile he took it personally i showed him the guitar the last varnish was barely dry i strummed a g chord i handed it to him the final evidence that i was worthy of him to him it must have been i dont know a slap in the face a gesture of contempt he took the guitar checked it out he sighted down the neck he inspected the frets then he broke it over his knee susan looked at her hands john said i dont want sympathy you asked about symptoms this is relevant for years i had thought of myself as john while the woodwards were calling me benjamin after that day for them i was benjamin i became what they wanted normal adequate pliant and wholly unimpressive you understand it was an act they noticed it this change but they never questioned it they didnt want to they welcomed it i worked my body the way a puppeteer works a marionette i made up benjamin he was my invention in a way he was as meticulous a piece of work as that guitar i made him out of people i knew out of what the woodwards seemed to want he was their natural childmaybe the child they deserved i played benjamin for almost three years one thousand and eightyfive days and when i turned sixteen i took my birth certificate and a hundreddollar bill james woodward kept in his sock drawer and i left didnt look back didnt leave a forwarding address and i dropped benjamin like a stone he took a sip of cappucino at least i thought i did what are you sayingthat benjamin was a symptom he is a symptom he came back the cool air made susan shiver she watched three teenagers in leather jackets and spike haircuts stroll past eyes obscure behind roy orbison sunglasses john said i noticed other problems first minor but disturbing auditory hallucinations brief fugue states when was this three years ago more or less i was living in a cabin on a gulf island off the coast of british columbia i blamed a lot of it on thaton the isolation but then without any kind of warning i lost two calendar days went to bed on sunday woke up wednesday morning well that was frightening but i was methodical about it i tried to reconstruct the time id lost pick up on any clues id left i found a receipt in a shirt pocket nine dollars and fiftyfive cents for groceries at a supply store in town a place i never shopped it was a family grocery not much bigger than my cabin and when i went in to ask some questions the woman back of the checkout desk nodded at me and said hello benjamin back again and the fugues persisted im lucky to have a day like this a day to myself susan didnt know what to say he drained his cappucino and turned the cup over you want to know what it feels like its like learning to do a puppet act and then forgetting which one of you is which the boundaries fold away suddenly youre inside the mirror looking out i see he regarded her steadily is that what you expectedyou and max not exactly he stood up he said i think im dying because i cant remember how to be john shaw anymore he walked her back to the hotel he was quieter now almost reticent as if he had said more than he meant to he walked with big impatient strides and susan had to struggle to keep up she was panting for breath by the time they reached the lobby he turned to face her at the door wrapped in his jacket almost lost in it what had he saidthe boundaries fold away he said youve done your job you can go home with a clear conscience that wasnt the idea we hopeddr kyriakides thoughtif you came to chicago why so he can watch me fade away he has some ideas that might help he has a pathological curiosity and a bad conscience you havent spoken to him for twenty years i dont want to speak to him well what then you stay here you curl up in that cheap apartment until you disappear she was startled by her own wordsjohn seemed to be too he said im glad we talked im glad you listened you want to help thats nice and you have but im not ready to leave here you dont have to make that decision now ill be in town for a week she could extend her reservation at the hotel surely dr kyriakides would pay for it we can talk again john looked closely at her and this time susan thought it was very bad that xray vision stare the sense of being scanned but she stood up to it she stared back without blinking he said i it might not be possible because of benjamin he nodded but if it is possible then he said quietly i know where you are he turned and stalked away into the cool air she watched him go her heart was beating hard because she realized it matters now she had come here determined to do a job to intercede for dr kyriakides to find john shaw and say her piece and get it over with but that had changed now she wanted something else she wanted him to live john shaw left susan at the hotel and began the walk back to st jamestown he understood that he was losing himself in this bright cool autumn duskthat he was fading with the light hed been fortunate this time he had been lucid for more than a day and a half that was uncommon andif what the girl said was trueit would be increasingly rare he could feel the good time ending now the sky was a luminous inky blue the trees in the park looked etched in charcoal this was always the first sign of the change this sudden heightened vividness of things for most of his life he had lived in a universe of symbols language and memory nouns and verbs strange to have the world itself its crude essence suddenly crowding into his mind strange to look at an arc of cloud across the cold sky and lose awareness of it as a meteorological event to lose all the taxonomy of cloudsthe word cloud itselfit all being washed away by naked vision as if some vital boundary had been erased as if he had somehow become the cloud he stood immobilized on the sidewalk with his head canted up until the feeling passed then he frowned and walked on hands burrowing deep into his pockets fading he felt more alive than ever cling to it he thought it was a clear cold evening and he didnt want to give it up for a time he was tempted to turn back to the hotel knock on susan christophers door and say to her yes if you can cure me if max can cure me ill do what you want ive lost too much of my life already but he didnt turn back that direction was the past kyriakides the woodwards the gulf island too much to embrace in any case he doubted that max had any real answers susan had admitted as much max was the perennial scientist still anxiousbut not admitting it perhaps not even to himselfto see his most important experiment through to a conclusion the thought evoked a vivid memory of max as he must have looked to a fiveyearold stubbled huge wise and aloof glints of light off his wirerimmed glasses which he would sometimes allow john to wear the lenses turning kyriakides into a looming distorted monster angles of light through crystal the laws of diffraction but the daylight was failing now the streetlights winked on almost home john told himself if you could call it that the two dingy rooms benjamin shared with amelie it was benjamin who made the serious decisions now such as where to live and with whom he was benjamin most of the time and it was like a dream these long days of absence not an utter loss of consciousness but a cloudy capitulation floating underwater down some dark twisting conduit occasionally he would blink at the world through benjamins eyes wake up and think i i i and then sink back into the darkness one more lost thing he did feel some sympathy for amelie even though she regarded him as an illness of benjaminsand that was strange too to be considered a disease he remembered frightening away the man who had attacked her the night before her shame and her anger but maybe she was right maybe he had made things worse but he couldnt worry about that now he hurried up the steps and through the door down the gray stucco hallway into the apartment closing himself in amelie was off at work john locked the door and turned on the tv the babble of voices rose up like a physical presence and he gazed without comprehension at the screen rioting on the west bank the arc and explosion of teargas canisters thinking hold on but it was like falling asleep you couldnt resist forever couldnt stay awake forever faltering he thought about susan he had liked talking to her she knew what he was and that stripped away the burden of pretense there was the inevitable chasm between them the biochemical and physiological gapwhat max had once called an evolutionary gulf but that was inevitable and she was at least aware of it and acknowledging the gulf seemed somehow to narrow it the talk had been good but the talk had also evoked old unpleasant memories memories that were difficult to suppress at the best of times and these were not the best of times he knew what to do about susan christopher tell her firmly that he wasnt interested hope that max wouldnt press the matter fade if fading was inevitable that was what john shaw meant to do but it occurred to him closing his eyes that benjamin might have other plans he groped after the thought and lost it too late now the space behind his eyelids seemed to fill with a bright and unforgiving light his head throbbed and ached the change was coming too fast and fiercely to resist memories surfaced like phosphorescent seacreatures susans face their conversation kyriakides and the woodwards the shimmering veneer on the face of a handmade guitar all these pieces of himself fragile as a china cup for one weightless moment and then gone shattered dispersed he slept and someone else awoke hes refusing treatment dr kyriakides sounded angry his voice growling through the phone lines from illinois susan said at the momentyes hes not aware of the problem hes very aware of it she repeated the list of symptoms john had recited the recurrence of benjamin thats not what i would have predicted dr kyriakides said but it might be a positive sign you think so how could it be hes capable of tremendous things susanboth his conscious and his unconscious mind hes resurrected benjamin for a reason even if hes not aware of it its a response to the disease i suspect as if one suit of clothes has begun to wear out and hes preparing to put on a second but its not the same susan said its not him but in some sense it must be him benjamin is his creation its not something newit cant be only an aspect of himself but it isnt john shaw the john shaw part of him is dying there was a pause possibly dr kyriakides admitted in one way or another then we have to help him i agree but if hes refusing treatment he could change his mind he said he might call back i want to stayat least another week i need to talk to him again there was another crackling silence through the long exchange from chicago i dont remember you being this enthusiastic i suppose it never seemed real before then you must have felt it too im sorry his specialness theres something unique about john i mean beyond the obvious there always has been yes she said i know what you mean take whatever time you need thank you do you want a suggestion anything talk to the other one talk to benjamin ill try susan said but she had thought of that already the problem was how to begin she wasnt much good with people susan had figured that out a long time ago she was a bookreader and she had always been good with words but that facility did not extend to her tongue for most of her adolescence she had been a stutterer she loved words but could not gracefully pronounce them people often laughed when she tried she had retreated into muteness and spoke only when it was unavoidable her mother took her for sessions with a teen counselor who linked susans stuttering with her parents divorce a traumatic event for a twelveyearold yes she guessed so privately she connected the stutter with her fathers grim refusal to discuss anything connected with the event though he picked her up every weekend in his car and drove her places the beach park picnics disneyland his apartment day trips rituals of silence how are things at school susie fuhfuhfine then his cancer erupted a fierce round one in this corner laryngeal nodes in that corner the surgeons knife he recovered or seemed to except for his voice his conversation dimmed to a whisper the doctors said there were devices he could use but he refused to susan he seemed to have achieved a whole new identity more gaunt and wholly withdrawn after the surgery she was afraid to talk to him afraid that her own voice might strike him as a rebuke or a taunt see i still have my tuhtongue she felt infected by his silence and determined to overcome her own she performed speech exercises she joined the yearbook staff at high school and studied back issues of seventeen for clues to the social graces it was a scientific projectas solemn as that she was not john shaw inventing a new self but the inspiration was similar a willful disguise and it was effective it worked but she remained painfully conscious of the creaking machinery behind the proscenium people would look at her oddly and she would think oh i made a mistake approaching john shaw had been hard enough even under the cloak of impartiality approaching benjamin would be even harder because she wasnt just a messenger from dr kyriakides anymore this had become in a way her own project now and she needed her own words she began by renting a car she chose a latemodel volvo and spent a day with her city map learning the downtown then back to the hotel to shower followed by cheap chinese food on spadina avenue and another evening with travis mcgee no one called no one left a message she set her wristwatch alarm for am and slept with it under her pillow by the time it annoyed her awake there was morning light coming through the big plateglass window not sunlight but only a grey tepid halflight and a few flakes of snow she stood under the hot water of the shower until her skin hurt then dressed in levis a cotton shirt and a jacket she rode the elevator down to the parking level coaxed the volvo to life and drove into st jamestown she parked in front of the rooming house where john shaw lived the snow evolved into a cold steady drizzle as susan shivered in the car she watched the people who emerged from the rooming house made ghostly by the condensation on the volvos windows none of them was john shawor benjamin seven oclock slid past at seventhirty she was beginning to feel not merely misguided but embarrassedplaying espionage games before breakfast she pulled her jacket closer around her and decided she would go for coffee and a croissantshe had seen a place on yonge streetat say eight oclock if nothing had happened moments before her deadline benjamin left the rooming house she almost missed him dr kyriakides had warned her about the possibility that benjamin might not look much like john shaw obviously his features were the same but there were subtler clues of posture and style and movement and from this distancethrough the rainhe might have been another person altogether he walked differently he held himself differently he stepped into the october morning his face disguised by the hood of a yellow raincoat and this was not johns long impatient stride but something more diffident careful reserved he paused at the sidewalk and looked both ways his glance slid over the little volvo without hesitation but susan pressed herself back into the seat he turned and walked westward through the rain susan waited until he reached the corner then she turned the key in the ignition and eased the volvo into traffic he walked to work which made it easier by negotiating slowly through a couple of troublesome intersections she was able to follow him all the way to university avenue where he vanished into the lobby of a tall anonymous government of ontario building she continued up the street parked bought herself breakfast at a fastfood restaurant a sign on the wall announced a thirtyminute limit but susan found the table attendant a jamaican woman and said she had an appointment at eleventhirtywas it okay if she sat here out of the rain the woman smiled and said we dont get a big rush till noon make yourself comfortable dear she finished the travis mcgee while nursing a cup of coffee a steady rain washed over the tinted atriumstyle windows the air was steamy and warm at ten she ran across the street for a copy of time magazine came back for a second coffee and left the lid on at eleventhirty she left the restaurant and walked a block and a half to the building where benjamin worked she stationed herself in the lobby as the lunch crowd began to flow past no sign of benjamin she wondered if there was a second exit but she hadnt seen one at twelveten she asked the guard by the elevator whether there was a cafeteria in the building third floor he said do i need a badge he smiled no maam i dont believe its considered a privilege to eat there she took a deep breath and punched the up button youre not yourself today benjamin the secretary at unemployment insurance said but benjamin sailed on past deaf to the obvious pushing his mail cart it was true he was not himself he was full of disquieting thoughts thoughts he could barely contain he had missed a lot of work recentlymore evidence that things were not as they should be today he had noticed his supervisor mr gill eyeing him from the office behind the mail desk maybe wondering whether to launch a complaint or to say something to benjamin first in the provincial government with its labyrinths of employee protection the process of firing someone could be tortuous the absences were unusual though because benjamin genuinely liked his job he liked sorting the mail and pushing the cart twice a day when the work ended he liked coming home to amelie at least when she had the evening off he had fallen into the routines of his life like a sleepwalker caught up in an especially happy luminous dream and he would have been content to dream on forever but something had begun to interfere with the dreama wakingup or perhaps a deeper dreamless sleep trouble benjamin thought trouble all around him trouble inside him he felt its pulse beat at his temples with every step trouble trouble trouble all the office clocks were creeping toward noon he had nearly finished his run half of the building on bay street room to room and up the elevators dropping off mail with the pretty brightly dressed secretaries who smiled and thanked him from behind their reception desks their barricades of computer terminals and hanging plantstheir perfume mingling with the smell of broadloom and xerography to create what benjamin thought of as the government office smell shouldering past the men in suits who nodded or ignored him he was rendered invisible by his open collar the invisible man he wheeled down the corridor from unemployment insurance to social welfare with the unanswered statement now echoing in his head im not myselfim notim not myself in time with the squeak of the left rear wheel of the cart must oil that it was not the sort of idea he was accustomed to having it was troubling and strange and he knew but did not want to acknowledge its obvious source john the name arose unbidden a sort of greyness the name john shaw was associated in benjamins mind with things hard drab and unyielding asphalt concrete slate john was a dim memory a ghost impulse as ephemeral as the sense of deja vu but he was also a real presence suddenly more real than he had been for years a demanding presence dangerous not just because i might lose my job benjamin thought but because i might lose might lose no but oh well admit it might lose amelie might lose that touch voice smile night presence that yes say it love which had entered into his life so suddenly those eyes which regarded him and in some sense created him confirmed his suspicion that he existed if amelie can love benjamin then benjamin is real he understood this about himself he possessed only a few scraps of a past some of them illusory but the present was real this moment this now and especially his moments with amelie what he felt for her was uncreated was whole was beyond suspicion he didnt want to lose her he would not allow her to be taken away but how to stop it things were happening things beyond his control trouble he thought as he parked the mail cart behind the sorting desk in the basement he rode the elevator up to the employee cafeteria bought himself a hamonakaiser and a carton of milk then stood petrified with the tray in his hand staring at the woman across the room familiar but unfamiliar who was staring at himand the only thought in his head was trouble trouble trouble trembling he carried his tray to her table she gestured for him to sit down they regarded each other for a long moment benjamin arriving at the understanding that she was frightened too though he couldnt guess why she was a small nervous woman with short dark hair and brittle eyeglasses and a can of diet pepsi in front of her im susan she said do i know you im a friend of johns benjamin doubted it sometimes scraps of memory would cross the barrier between benjamin and johnmore often now than ever before that was how he had recognized the woman in the first place but the recognition did not signal friend instead it evoked a more complex reaction fear and hunger and hope and an old vast disappointment almost too big to contain i only have an hour for lunch he said she sipped her pepsi you work here in the mail room i sort and deliver interesting work i like it he unwrapped his sandwich but left it alone he wasnt hungry anymore this is about john he said somethings happening to john john my real father he thought john who invented me john who created me no not quite that but there was no obvious word for what john had done or benjamin had become no word that benjamin knew he knew about john it was a shadow knowledge ghostly and for a long time benjamin had tried to ignore it but the knowledge wouldnt go away useless to pretend for instance that he had had a childhood for a long time he had remembered growing up with the woodwards but most of that was false memory no more substantial than the picture on a tv screen his real childhood was johns childhood a confusion of threatening images a woman named marga a man named kyriakides in fact his childhood was no childhood at all because benjamin had never been a child benjamin was born a teenager and only gradually acquired a substantial existence imitation deepening into reflexthe mask growing roots into the skull he thought startled because it was a john thought more than a benjamin thought maybe john was coming back again so soon too soon i was sent here by dr kyriakides susan said and the name sent a shockwave up his spine dr kyriakides thinks john might be sick might be dying this was not the kind of information he could assimilate all at once his stomach was churning he looked at his watch i have to go back to work i can wait susan said i have my cari can drive you home trouble but there was no avoiding it now he stood i get off at four ill meet you in the lobby susan christopher said rain all day grey down the big office windows as he wheeled his cart around rain when he followed susan christopher out to her car redblinking rain all up and down the dark rushhour streets benjamin sank into the front passenger seat as susan pulled out into the traffic she said do you know about john about what he is a little benjamin said i know more about him than i used to his brain right his brain is different my brain too he thought its where we live briefly he imagined the kind of house called a semidetached two separate homes butted up against a common wall noisy neighbors benjamin thought used to be the wall was thicker nothing came through now when john was in control benjamin retained some sense of his own existence as if he had retreated to an upstairs room where he could watch from the window or just float and dream while his raucous neighbor shouted and raved his brain is unique susan was saying he was made that way there were hormonesdrugsthat changed the way he grew dr kyriakides susan nodded and now thats changing benjamin guessed she gave him a second look maybe surprised that he had guessed she nodded the tissue in the brain is more fragile than anyone expected it deterioratesit may be doing that already a mental breakdown benjamin said maybe maybe even worse than that not just for johnfor you but he could not dispel the image of his brain johns brain as a house a cavernous mansion strange and multichamberednow grown brittle dry drafty and susceptible to flash fires you dont really know what might happen no not really but something was happening benjamin knew it and he guessed she was right you couldnt burn down half a house and leave the other half intactwhat happened to john would surely happen to benjamin too for years benjamin had been johns shadow his halfself a marionette but in the last few months he had emerged into a real existencea life and when he said the word i it meant something he had moved in with amelie who looked at him and saw benjamin benjamin she would say maybe he had let himself believe that this would go on forever that john would fade that john would become the shadow reduced at last to john a memory but now maybe we both lose maybe were both memory susan drove into the core of st jamestown where the peeling apartment towers stood like sentinels she pulled up at the curb opposite the rooming house but neither of them moved to get out susan turned the heater up benjamin looked thoughtfully at her what do you want me to do i want you to help help how i want you to see dr kyriakides i want you to let him treat you can he change whats happening were not sure wed like to find out but the idea was disturbing he felt a spasm of unease that was clearly johns as if john had rolled over inside him john doesnt want me to do that hes reluctant susan admitted ive spoken to him benjamin gazed at the rain i dont control him you control yourself im not surei dont know if i could do something he didnt really want i mean its never come to that i just want you to think about it susan christopher said thats enough for now oh ill think about it benjamin unlatched the door you can count on that he crossed the rainy street to the boardinghouse where the front door opened and amelie stepped out hugging herself glancing a little nervously from benjamin to the rental car and back benjamin was suddenly in love with the look of her under the wet porch awning in her tight jeans and a raggedy sweater and her breath steaming into the cold wet air not for john he thought what susan christopher had asked for his help he might give even if it meant an end to everything he had assembled here his real life which might be ending anyway but not for john or even for himself for her he thought for amelie on the porch in her old clothes amelie who had drawn him out of the vacuum of himself with a word and a touch because there was a chance at least that he might survive where john did not and he owed her that chance owed her the possibility of a happy ending orif that failedif everything failedat least the evidence of his courage susan watched from the volvo as benjamin entered the rooming house scary she thought how easy it was to accept him as benjamin multiple personalityshe had seen the movies the pbs documentaries but those people had always seemed just slightly untrustworthy as if the whole thing might beon some levela sort of confidence trick the nervous systems way of committing a sin without taking the blame this was different benjamin was not the product of a normal mind pushed beyond its limits he was an inventiona work of art a wholly synthetic creation a normal mind susan thought cant do that it was a feat unique to john shaw as unpredictable and utterly new as the fiercely coiled cortical matter under his skull unnerving a new disease susan thought she put the car in gear and pulled away from the curb a new disease for a new species hypertrophy of the mind a cancer of the imagination bad night for amelie the rain didnt let up worse she felt as if a similar cold cloudiness had invaded the apartment benjamin was quiet all through dinner which was spaghetti and bottled sauce with some extra garlic and hamburger the kind of meal amelie assumed a man would like substantial with the steam from the cookpot fogging the windows amelie seldom had the opportunity to fix dinner but today was her day off she had planned this in advance benjamin was quiet all through the meal he didnt pay attention to the food ate mechanically frowned around his fork she put on the kettle for coffee brooding it was that woman amelie knew the one who had come looking for johnthe one who had driven benjamin home she had said something to him she was on his mind amelie wanted to ask what this was all about but she was scared of seeming jealous of seeming not to trust him maddeningly benjamin didnt talk about it either his silence was so substantial it was like an item of clothing a strange black hat he had worn into the house she tried to negotiate around it to accommodate herself to his mood but it was too obvious to really ignore she stacked the dishes and put bon jovi on the stereo the tapeplayer part still worked but rochs little twostep had twisted the tonearm off its bearings amelie hoped benjamin wouldnt notice she didnt want to tell him about roch the truth was that amelie didnt feel too secure about men in general she imagined that if she had a shrink this was the kind of thing she would confess to him i dont feel too secure about men it was one of those things you can know about yourself but knowing doesnt make it better maybe this was because of her shitty adolescence her absentee fatherwho knew what on tv these problems always had neat beginnings and tidy logical ends in life it was different the time when she came here from montreal with rochthat was an example its funny she thought you say a word like prostitution and it sounds truly horrifying like aids or cancer but she had never thought of it that way when she was doing it she met a couple of other girls who had been on the street a long time and they talked about hooking or turning tricks but those words didnt apply either not that she was too good for it it was just that her mind veered away from the topic she was surviving being paid for sex it just wasnt something you thought much about before or during or after and when you stop doing it you dont have to think about it and so it goes away it doesnt show no visible scars although sometimes in her paranoid moments amelie wasnt so sure about that sometimes she developed the urge to hide her face when she rode the buses or waited on tables but by and large it was something she could forget about and that was why roch had pissed her off so intensely reminding her of that worse acting like it was something she might do again as if once you do it youre never any better than that its what you are trained reflex go fetch lie down and roll over but really that was just roch roch always had a hard time figuring out what anybody else was doing or thinking one time when he was nine or ten roch asked a friend of amelies named jeanette how come she was so ugly jeanette turned brick red and slapped his face roch wasnt hurt his feelings werent hurt but he was almost comically surprised later he asked amelie what happened did he break a rule or something all roch wanted was a little cash a loan he hadnt meant anything by it she was too sensitive that was all what was really frightening was the question of how roch might respond to the beating john had given him because the thing was roch could not forget a humiliation he harbored grudges and generally tried to pay them back with interest but amelie told herself there was no point in dwelling on it now she dried the dishes put the towel up to dry joined benjamin in the main room the tv was a blackandwhite model amelie had bought from a thrift shop attached to a bowtie antenna from a garage sale the rooming house didnt have cable so they watched sitcoms on the cbc all evening benjamin didnt say a wordjust folded his hands in his lap and seemed to watch though his eyes were foggy and distracted sometime around midnight they went to bed she was almost asleep lying on her back in the dark room listening to the sound of the rain against the window when he said what if i went away for a while she felt suddenly cold she sat up where would you go he shrugged i dont want to talk about that part of it everything seemed in sudden high relief the faint streetlight against the cloth curtains the coolness of the bedsheets where they touched her thighs is it connected with this woman saying it out loud at last he said shes a doctor are you sick maybe is it about another taboo about john he nodded in the darkness a shadow amelie said well i dont want you to leave but if i have to i dont know what that meanshave to if you have to then you just do it i mean would you be here for me his voice was solemn careful i dont know she said thinking christ yes of course ill be here he was the best thing in her life and if there was even a chance of him coming back but she couldnt say that maybe she said he nodded again he said well maybe it wont happen talk to me she said before you do anything ill try benjamin said and then silence and the rain beating down they woke a little after dawn and made love there was one frightening moment when amelie looked into his eyes and for a secondnot longer than thatshe had the terrifying feeling that it was john looking down at her his cold and penetrating vision a kind of rape but then she blinked and the world slid back into place he was benjamin again moving against her with a passion that was also kindness and which she had allowed herself to think of as love the vision of him crowded out her fear he was benjamin and that was good for the rest of that rainy october week susan immersed herself in the mystery of john shaw ive talked to him she thought in a sense i know him but beyond that loomed the inescapable facthe is not entirely human there was no way to reconcile these ideas she tried to stay in her hotel room in case he called but by thursday morning she was overcome with cabin fever she left a firm order at the desk to take any phone messages and set out on foot with no real direction in mind the rain had stopped at least the sky was overcast and the wind was cold but even that was gratifying after the monotony of recycled hotel air she walked west away from the downtown core toronto was a banking city crowded with stark office towers its charm she had decided was peripheral to this in chinatown or the university district she turned north along university avenue willfully avoiding the direction of benjamins office shortly before noon she found herself between a phalanx of peanut carts and the granite steps of the royal ontario museum with pennies in her pocket and nowhere else to go inside the museum was all high domed ceilings and egyptians botanical displays and gemstones under glass susan appreciated these but she especially liked the dark vaults of the dinosaur arcade cool pleistocene fluorescence and faint voices like the drip of water the articulated bones of triceratops regarded her with the stately indifference of geological time susan returned the look for almost a quarter of an hour reverently beyond triceratops the corridor wound away to the left she eased back slowly into human history where she was startled turning a corner by the evolution of man it was one of those museum displays that compare the skull sizes tools curvature of the spine across the eons here was homo habilis leading the human march out of olduvai but surely susan thought the entire concept was archaic did anyone still believe evolution had proceeded in this reasonable arc from stone club to sidewinder missile here at the pinnacle of time but she supposed john would have had a place here too if anyone had known about him dr kyriakides had once told her that he wanted to engineer the next step in human evolution a better human being one who would make us obsolete or at least embarrass us for our vices so here would be john leading the march toward the future a little taller and a little brighter and in his handwhat a pocket hbomb a neutrino evaporator or he might be as pristine as dr kyriakides had envisioned him as weaponless and innocent as a child she turned away suddenly she wanted the high ceilings of the main arcades not this cloistered space but before she left she paused before the diorama of neolithic man stooped and feral in wax wincing at the first light of human awareness our father she thought mine and johns too as obdurate inscrutable and foreign as every father is still he did not call friday afternoon she phoned maxim kyriakides at his office at the university he said i should have come myself forced the issue then he could not have avoided me i dont think thats what he needs that isi had the impressionit would have made things worse you may be right still i could come there if necessary he added i suppose im feeling guilty about demanding so much of your time its all right is it really you werent so obliging when you began the project i had to talk you into leaving i think its different nowmeeting him and all i wasnt sure what to expect some kind of monster are you sure hes not she was quietly shocked i dont know what you mean only that its easy to forget that he is what he is he has abilities you wont have encountered his point of view is unique he may not feel bound by conventional behavior i understand that do you really susan i hope so i worry that you might be projecting your own concerns onto him that would be a mistake i know but she was blushing theres no danger of that then im sorry i mentioned it he was being very old world now very charming i really do appreciate the work youre doing susan she thanked himcautiously he said stay as long as you like but keep in touch i will and ultimatelyif theres nothing we can do i know she said im prepared for that she was lying of course benjamin called that evening the call was brief but susan could hear the anxiety in his voice theres a problem he said what is it is it john is he sick cold night and the city bright but impersonal beyond the windows hes thinking of leaving town benjamin said you want the truth i think hes afraid of you we have to talk susan said she met him at an allnight cafeteria on yonge street the club next door was hosting a highpowered reggae band the bass notes came pulsing through the wall susan ordered coffee and drank it black benjamin came in from the street shivering in his checkerboard flannel jacket she marveled again at how unlike john he was nothing to distinguish this man from anyone else on the street he smiled as he pulled up his chair but the smile was perfunctory he shucked his jacket and ordered a coffee he added cream and sugar sipped once said ohhey thats good i needed that you look tired i am ever since we had our talk i guess im kind of reluctant to fall asleep dont know wholl wake up he wants more time susan all of a sudden hes fighting me i didnt know he had a choice you come to terms with something like this but there was never any real conflict before i mean you dont understand what its like its not something you think about if you can help it you just live your life i think john was fading because he didnt really care anymore he let me do what i wanted and he wasnt around much now this whole thing has stirred him up susan leaned forward across the table you can tell that i feel him wanting to be awake benjamin sat back in his chair regarding her you think thats a good thing dont you well ii mean its important to know i had to take a couple of days off benjamin smiled ruefully john was kind enough to phone in sick for me you said he was thinking about going away both of us have been i talked to amelie about it i asked her if it would be okay you know if i didnt see her for a while what did she say basically that it would be okay but it wouldnt make her happy he took a compulsive gulp of coffee if we do thisif we go for treatmentwould it be possible for amelie to come along theres not much to keep her here i mean budget permitting and all id have to talk to dr kyriakides it may be possible she hoped not but that was petty you were saying about john johns pulling in the opposite direction i dont usually have much access to his thoughts you know but some things come through hes thinking of leaving but not for treatment he wants to hit the road get out of town run away from me from this doctor of yours from the situation but yes youre a part of it i think you disturbed him a little bit theres something about you that worries him what i dont understand benjamin shrugged neither do i you think theres a chance hell really do it leave i dont know i really dont maybe if he panics this is all new territory for me you know its hard to explain but i was just getting used to living a life i mean i know what i am im a shadow im aware of that i was always a shadow im something he made up but i look around i have thoughts i see thingsim as alive as you are he shook his head i dont want to go back to the way it was before you know what i like susan i like the sunshine i like the light his gaze was very steady and for a moment he did remind her of john so is that why youre here to send me back into the shadows susan inspected the formica tabletop no no one wants that because youre right there is something happening to us something up here he tapped his head i can feel it like the boundaries are loosening up things are stirring around and i dont know where thats taking me he added i have to admit im a little bit scared susan took his hand both of you need help we have to make sure both of you get it the thing is i dont know if i can do that ill do what i can whatever happens ill try to keep in touch ill let you know where we are but im not in charge here its not my choice tell me what i can do i dont know he smiled wearily probably nothing tony morriseau was hanging out at the comer of church and wellesley minding his own business when he saw the chess player coming toward him actually stalking him was more like it this was unusual and tony regarded the chess players lanky figure with a faint first tremor of unease tony knew the chess player from the allnite donut shop on wellesley tony had never spoken to him but the guy was a fixture there poised over his board like a patient predatory animal hardly anybody ever played him certainly not tony tony wasnt into games his experience was that the chess player didnt talk and nobody talked to the chess player still tony recognized him tony was a quarter cree on his mothers side and liked to think he had that old indian thing keeping his ear to the ground tony made most of his moneywhich was not really a lotselling dope out of the back of his corvette parked just down the block his profit margins werent high and his only steady customers were the local gay trade and some high school kids still tony was a fixture on the street he had been here since same corvette same business he told himself it was only temporary he wanted to make significant money and thisdealing in streetcorner volume at a pathetic margin from a supplier who had been known to refer to tony as pinwormthis wasnt the way to do it he would find something else but until then until then it was business as usualand what did this geek want from him anyhow tony pressed his back against a brick wall and gave the chess player a cautious nod the evening traffic rolled down church street under the lights an elderly korean couple strolled past heads down in abject courtesy tony looked at the chess player now directly in front of him and the chess player stared back big deep hollow eyes round head burr haircut he made tony distinctly nervous tony said do i know you no the chess player said but i know you i want to buy something maybe i dont have anything to sell the chess player reached into his pocket and pulled out a roll of bills he peeled a fifty off the top and stuffed it into the pocket of tonys down vest tonys heart began to pump faster and it might have been the money but it might also have been the look on the guys face he thought am i afraid and thought fuck no not me he transferred the bill to his hip pocket so what is it you want amphetamines the chess player said and tony was briefly amused at how dainty he made it sound amphetamines how many how many have you got tony did a little mental calculation he began to feel better come with me he said down the block to the corvette checking the guy out sideways as they walked tony kept most of his stock in the back of the vette he had been ripped off twice and while that was something you expectedhe was not a volume dealer and he could eat the occasional lossesit was also something you didnt want to set yourself up for but tony was fairly smart about people his cree instinct he told himself and he didnt believe the chess player was a thief something else something strange maybe something a little bit dangerous but not a thief tony opened the car door and rooted out a ziploc bag of prescription pharmaceuticals from the space under the drivers seat he held the bag low inside the angle of the door displaying it to the buyer but not to the public some of these suit your fancy all of them that would beyoud be talking some serious money there he named a price and the chess player peeled off the bills large money amounts and no haggling it was like a dream tony stuffed the cash into his rear pocket a tight little bulge he could go home he could have a drink he was prepared to celebrate but the chess player leaned in toward him and said very quietly and calmly i want the car too tony was too startled to react at once the corvette it was his only real possession he had bought it from a retired dentist in mississauga for a fraction of what it was worth put some money into it the fiberglass body had been through some serious damage but that was purely cosmetic under the hood it was mainly original numbers fuck man you cant have my carthats my car but it came out like a whine a token protest and tony realized with a deep sense of shock that he was afraid of this man it was just that he could not say exactly why big almost luminous eyes peering into his christ tony thought he can see right through me without blinking the chess player pulled out his roll of bills again tony stared at the cash as it came off the roll it was like a machine at work crisp new money he counted up to thenwithout thinkinghe said hey look i paid less than that for it it needs bodywork you know the chess player put the money in tonys vest pocket the touch of his fingers there was weirdly disturbing buy a new car the chess player said give me the keys be damned if tony didnt do just that handed them over without a word mysterious he would spend a lot of long nights wondering about it the chess player was about to climb in and drive away when tony shook his headit was like waking up from a bad dream into a hangoverand said hey my property take what you want the chess player said panicking tony retrieved ten ounces of seeded brown marijuana and a milk carton of valium and stuffed them hastily into a brown paper a p bag the door slammed closed as the corvette pulled away he watched as the automobile faded into the night traffic southbound on church all the while thinking to himself what was that jesus christ almightywhat was that john shaw stopped off at the apartment to pack a change of clothes and leave a note within ten minutes he had folded every useful item into two denim shoulderbags including the bulk of the money he had withdrawn from his private accounts the note to amelie was more difficult he hesitated over pen and paper thinking about the man who had sold him the corvette he wasnt proud of what hed done it was a skill he had mastered a long time ago a finely honed vocabulary of body and voice with the right gestures and the necessary words he could intimidate almost anyoneplay the primate chords of fear anger love or distaste and do so at will for a time when his contempt for humanity had reached its zenith he did it often it was a means to an end as irrelevant to ethical considerations as the shearing of a sheep or so he had thought that time had passed but he was pleased by the outcome of the little experiment he had just performed on tony morriseau old skills intact so much had been lost obscured by unconsciousness but maybe not permanently he had been asleep now he was awake he wrote must leave try to understand he wondered how much more he ought to say he could summon up benjamin long enough to compose a more serious message could even play at being benjamin without invoking the real or potent benjamin but he was reluctant to do that now it was a mistake he had made too often before he debated signing benjamins name then decided it would be more honest and possibly kinder not to in the end he simply hung the note two sentences five words on the kitchen cupboard hurrying to escape these small crowded rooms the corvette protested only a little when he nosed it onto the expressway and into the light midnight traffic northbound out of the city he had been awake for two days now and some of the old clarity had come back to him he was able to read the condition of the corvettes engine through the grammar of its purrs and hesitations and his sense was that the vehicle was old but basically sound something catastrophic might happen a crack in the engine block or an embolism in an oil line but the pistons were turning over neatly the gears meshed the brakes were clean with any luck the car would get him where he was going the rain that had hovered over the province for the last two weeks had finally drifted off eastward it was a clear cold night between the glaring roadlightsgrowing sparse out here in farm territoryhe was able to see a scatter of stars he had always liked looking at the stars and sometimes felt a special connection with them in their isolation in the dark sky it was the kinship he felt for all lost strange and distant things the road arrowed up a long incline an ancient glacial moraine and suddenly the stars were right in front of him impulsively he edged the corvettes gas pedal down it was long past midnight and nothing was moving here but a heavily freighted lumber truck he took the corvette past it in an eyeblink a brief taste of diesel through the cracked wing window then onward he watched the speedometer creep up at eightyfive mph the corvette was showing some of its age and neglect he read a whiff of hot metal and oil the spark plugs burning themselves clean he liked thisthe farms and empty autumn fields blurring behind him the sense of motion but more than that it was a private pleasure uniquely his own his reflexes and his sense of timing seldom came up against their inherent limits it was exhilarating to push that envelope a little he was very far from those limits even nowthe speedometer still inching upwardbut he was attentive focused and energized every shiver of the chassis or tremor of the road became significant information raw data flooding him he came up fast on a sixteenwheel mayflower truck and passed it left the truckers horn screaming impotently down a corridor of cold night air this was a world only he was fit to inhabit he thought this landscape of speed and reflex for anyone else it would be next door to death for john it was a sunny meadowland through which his thoughts ran in a cool rapid cascade there was a shimmy now from the rear end of the corvette and he would have to slow down soon in any case or risk running some radar trap or pushing the engine past its tolerances in any case it was time to fill the gas tank but he allowed himself one moment more this fine intoxication he was beginning to ease back on the gas pedal when the corvette fishtailed coming around a slow curve he was on top of it instantly manhandling the wheel feeling the sudden change from vehicular momentum to deadly inertia there was a long spin on the cool night pavement tire treads fraying and screaming as the rear end wheeled around and the car tottered wanting to turn over john held onto the steering wheel focused into this long moment working with the cars huge momentum tugging it back from the brink correcting and correcting again as the tires etched long vs and ws on the dark pavement he had the corvette under control within microseconds a moment later it was motionless on the shoulder of the road sudden silence and the ticking of the hot engine wind in a dark october marsh off to the right of him a shiver of relief ran up his spine he looked at his hand it was shaking he opened the glove compartment tugged out the ziploc bag rolled an amphetamine cap into his mouth he dryswallowed the pill and angled the car slowly back onto the highway carefully thinking now about nothing at all fundamentally it was a question of past and future he took the first car ferry of the morning across georgian bay to the northern shore of lake superior the north shore was a stark landscape of pine and rock and the brittle blue superior horizon gas station towns souvenir stands indian reservations black bear and deer in the outback during the last world war captive german military officers had been assigned logging duty in this wilderness there were places john understood where their kration tins lay rusting under the pine needles and the washboard lumber roads in summer the highway would have been crowded with tourists but it was late in the year now and the campgrounds were vacant and unsupervised he drove all day through the cold transparent air after nightfall he turned down a dirt track road to an empty campsite near the lakeshore he zipped up his insulated windbreaker and stoked a kindling fire in one of the bricklined barbecue pits when he had achieved a satisfactory blaze he added on windfall until the fire was roaring and crackling then he settled back to rising sparks and stars and the lonely sound of lake superior washing at the shore the fire warmed his hands and face his back was cold he heated a can of soup until the steam rose up in the wintery air when the meal was finished he sat in the car with the passenger door opened toward the fire thinking about the past and the future the past was simple he contained it he contained it in a way no other human being could contain it as a body of mnemonic experience he could call up at willhis life like an open book excepting the chaos of his earliest infancy there was not a day of his life that john could not instantly evoke he had divided his life into three fundamental episodeshis time with dr kyriakides his time with the woodwards his time as an adult four if you counted the recent reemergence of benjamin as a new and distinct epoch and each category was a vast book of days of autumns and winters and summers and springs each welling from its own past and arrowing toward its own future with a logic that had always seemed incontrovertible until now for most of his life he had been running toward the future as if it contained some sort of salvation in the last few years mysteriously that had changed the future he thought was a promise that might not be kept now he was running not quite aimlessly because he had a destination in mind not toward the past precisely but toward a place where his life had taken a certain turn a fork in the road maybe it would be possible to retrace his steps turn the other way this time maybe toward a genuine future an authentic light he recognized the strong element of rationalization in this selfdeception was a vice he had never permitted himself but there comes a time when your back is to the wall so you follow an instinct you do what you have to a sudden bitter wind came off the lake the fire was dying he banked the embers and then shut himself into the car blinking at the darkness and afraid to sleep he looked longingly at the glove compartment picturing the bag of pills there but he had to pace himself he felt the fatigue poisons running through his body no choice now but to sleep anywayhe would need the pills more later he watched the stars until the windows clouded with the vapor of his breath finally with an almost violent suddenness he slept he drove west into the broad prairie land coming through manitoba he ran into a frontal system rain and wet snow that sidelined the corvette in a little town called atelier while the dominion service station and garage replaced the original tires with fresh snowtreads john checked into a motel called the traveller and picked up some books at the local thrift shop entertainment reading for the posthuman a sciencefiction novelthe magic mountain the only mann hed never looked into a paperback bestseller also a battered penguin edition of olaf stapledons odd johnthe joke of course was on himself he had read the stapledon many times before it was a classic of english eccentric writing of the thirties the story of a mutant supergenius born to ordinary humanity during his adolescence john had adopted the book as a kind of bible the story was fuzzyminded uneven sometimes silly in its literalmindedness but he felt a resonance with odd johns sense of spiritual contamination by mankind his passion of loneliness the john of the book sought out others of his kindtelepaths and mutantsand founded a utopian colony which the great powers ultimately destroyed two unlikely assumptions there john thought that there were others of his kind and that such people would constitute a perceptible threat to anyone but the biggest mistake stapledon had made john thought was his characters selfsufficiency stapledon compared his odd john to a human being among apes but a human being raised by apes isnt a superior ape in all the qualities that matter to apes hes not much of an ape at all and if he feels contemptuous of the apes its only the automatic contempt of the rejected outsider stillin this desolate prairie townsome of that contempt came welling up after dinner he went walking along the narrow main street of atelier where the transcanada passed through atelier was a grain town its landmarks were a railway depot a chinese restaurant and a five and dime nobody much was out in the weather except for a few sullen leatherjacketed teens occupying the pizza patio he pressed through the sleet beyond the local mall and discovered signs of life at a tiny sports arena an illuminated portasign announced rev harmon belweather revival tonight miracles healing john gazed awhile at the sign thencurious sad and entirely alonehe joined the small crowd in the overheated lobby indoors and away from the rain the auditorium was threequarters full when the ushers closed the doors it was an elderly crowd with a few earnest young couples scattered around the arena he counted several wheelchairs a great many crutches a woman in a gingham skirt moved down the aisles stopping here and there to exchange a few words with the audience she paused at the row in front of john and chatted with a hugely overweight man about his gall bladder troubles she caught johns glance and moved toward him when he did not look away she asked are you here for healing he shook his head in the negative are you sure you look like a man with a need he gave her a long focused look the woman in the gingham dress tugged at her earlobe stared a moment longer then shrugged uneasily and moved away the audience hushed as the lights dimmed a local choir performed a hymn and then reverend belweather took the stage he was a squat compactly fat man in a sincere republican suit his hair was cut to marine length he wore rings on his fingers he began in a lowkey fashion whispering into the hand mikeyou had to strain forward to hear himbut he was good john thought he read the crowd well and he was good with his body with his aggressive strut and upraised palm he preached to the crowd for forty minutes under the fierce klieg lights rising to thunderous crescendos of damnation and salvation the sweat rivering off the slope of his forehead john closed his eyes and felt the crowd around him as a single physical thingan animal aroused to some terrible confusion of eroticism and fear the human odor was as physical as heat in the confined space of the auditorium and it beat against him like a pulse i pity them john thought and i hate myself for my pity and i hate them for provoking it wishing at the same time that he could be a part of it he understood the profound comfort here to be not alone but he could not wholly grasp the beatitude beneath this stink of human sweat he had read too much history it smelled like torquemada and his chambers it smelled like belsen and the killing fields of cambodia the healing came last reverend belweather called up the afflicted by name or disorder god informs me theres a michael among us michael with a gall bladder and the fat man in the forward aisle stood up and ambled toward the stage shocked into obedience obscure in the shadows john followed him down an experiment he stood in this cluster of diseased dying and broken individuals and felt a second wave of paralyzing contempt contempt for their sheeplike vulnerability contempt for the man who was shearing them i hate them he thought for cooperating in this for their stupidity he thought because i cannot forgive them for it the healing act itself was anticlimactic a tepid discharge of the tensions that filled the auditorium a hand on the forehead the hot breath of blessing the command to shed those crutches and walkat least as far as the wings where the reverend belweathers muscular stage crew redistributed the crutches and wheelchairs as needed the woman in the gingham dress lingered there also john edged his way to the stage reverend belweather regarded him with a certain amount of suspicionthis odd bird among the flockand said quickly son what exactly is your ailment i have a headache john said reverend belweather turned his eyes toward heaven as much exasperation as prayer in the look dear god he said to the microphone we join together in begging an end to this young mans discomfort and the hand on the head reverend belweathers hand was fleshy and moist john imagined something pale and unwholesome a dead thing touching him he concentrated for a moment he could not say why this impulse had overtaken him some marriage of cruelty and distaste one more experiment there had been many before but there was no restraining it reverend belweather yanked his hand away from johns head as he felt the skin writhing there spontaneous scars and wounds that appear in a religious trance are called stigmata the phenomenon occurs in faiths from catholicism to voodoo an interaction between mind and body triggered by religious ecstasy john was able to do it at will reverend belweather stared with honor at the cross of raised feverish skin that had formed on johns forehead he managed who are you it doesnt matter john said what matters is that your wife has a radio transmitter built into her hearing aid and that youre using it to defraud these people youre in violation of three federal statutes and youre committing a sin you should cancel tomorrows performance reverend belweather staggered back as if the floor had shifted under his feet he looked for his stage crewthe big men in the wings they had already sensed a ripple in the flow and moved forward get him the fuck out of here the reverend harmon belweather said his voice suddenly shrill and petulant just get him the fuck outnow but he had clutched the handmike to his chest in an involuntary spasm of panic and the words rang and echoed through the big tannoy pa speakers like an invocation or a failed and panicky exorcism it had been of course a stupid and dangerous thing to do john turned and merged into the crowd of the crippled and the ill as the reverend belweathers henchmen advanced they were large but slow and they hadnt had a good look at him he was out a tear door and into the cold rain before they realized he was gone he arrived back at the motel wet cold and rank with amphetamine sweat but the girl behind the desk smiled at him as he passed and the smile provoked an old response he stopped and turned to face her eighteen or maybe nineteen years old broad bones an aggressive blur of lipstick and that smile she returned his look right his room number he nodded you were here when i checked in right thats right im on till midnight shifts just about up he watched her eyes and her lips the smile was tentative but provocative an offer half made he surmised that she had allowed guests to come on to her in the past and that she had mixed feelings about it guilt colored with arousal that she liked him because he looked a little dangerous coming in holloweyed from the rain that she was scared of him too a little the possibility was tantalizing she was a sheep a goat an ape a human animalbut im human too he thought from the neck down she shouldnt have provoked him with that smile nobody ever smiled at him the rain and the tension had disguised some obvious clue to his natureshe doesnt recognize the devil horns and tail dont show in this light reverend belweather i am a stronger persuader than you are it was as easy as asking easy as buying a used corvette look deep into my eyes and see precisely what you want a tall westbound stranger with no attachments and big hands see our dovetailed needs he took her to his room and undressed her in the dark pronouncing the words she wanted so desperately to hear disguising himself so that she would not recoil and leave dangerous this eager merging of skin and skin sudden loss of surface tension this knocking loose of props inside him until delirious with orgasm and fatigue he was no longer sure who or where he was after a time she stood and dressed in the faint lightthe light that comes through motel windows in prairie towns on cold nights after midnighta glimmer of wet on her thigh and john was startled by the immediacy of the vision or was it a symptom of his decline the absolute solidity of white shoulder and cascade of hair a sudden longing radiated through him like a pulse she turned toward him momentarily and he waited for the revulsion in her eyes her dawning sense of his alienness but there was none only a flicker of curiosity she smiled whos susan john sat up on the bed wordless you said her name i guess you didnt even know it girlfriend wife well it doesnt matter he managed im sorry no im flattered you must love her a lot she left him staring at the door sleeping he dreamed of his first sexual encounter he was sixteen and he had abandoned benjamin and he was about to abandon the woodwards as an experiment he seduced a female classmate he selected his target and approached her methodically she was a fragile bundle of neuroses and exposed nerves therefore easy to manipulate which he did he flattered and provoked and humiliated her into a motel bedroom and he fucked her therethere was no other word for it he obtained her passive submission and he fucked her was it satisfying on the most elementary level yes it was as an experiment it was wholly successful fucking this schoolgirl in the dark was a confirmation of everything he had learned about himself about his superiority she was a lesser creature which rendered any ethical objections moot the sin if there was a sin here was not rape but bestiality surely excusable under the circumstances two things bothered him however and made him reluctant to repeat the experiment the first was that while he was with her while he was hovering at the brink of orgasm some subterranean and scary impulse caused him to mouth the words i love you against her ear she hadnt noticed thank god but it troubled john immensely the words werent his words and words were his environment words were where he lived if this brick could collapse how secure was the structure he had made of his life the second disturbing thing was the way she looked at him when they were finished he switched on the bedside lamp and began to dress he turned and caught her eyes fixed on him and the expression on her face was one of silent shockwhat am i doing here christ what have i done he recognized the look he hated it it was far too familiar when he awoke it was fivefifteen of the next evening and the last daylight was bleeding away in a steely grey sky he checked out at the desk there was another woman at the counter middleaged lumpily overweight she smiled and totaled his bill late to be leaving she observed are you one of those night drivers he nodded yeah she said we get a few of those some people prefer it me i think its lonely going down the highway all by yourself in the dark oh well i guess people are different that way he looked at the bill whats this charge why thats your phone call long distance to toronto about am this morning you came in the office and asked me how to get a line out and ihey mister is something wrong whats the matteryou dont remember in the corvette he swallowed two pills and washed them down with coffee from a thermos then gunned the engine and sailed west he passed the arena on his way out of atelier according to the billboard the reverend belweather had canceled for tonight there was freshfallen snow in the rockies but the roads were clear the corvette labored up and through a world of pine and snow and rock and cold blue sky he was closing in on his objective now john especially did not want to sleepthe sleep might revive his twin if only momentarily as it had in atelierand so he began to rely on the amphetamines when he felt fatigue settling in this effectively killed his appetite which in turn eliminated restaurant stops and saved a little time though he did periodically force himself to stop for food he was running the physical machine hard and he was conscious of the dangers that imposed he was careful but even so coming down the slope of the rockies into coastal british columbia he began to hallucinate rockfaces and switchbacks took on a sinister knifesharp significance one looming wall of granite where the mountain had been blasted to accommodate the road compressed itself into a sudden likeness of maxim kyriakidesthe rugged features fierce brows flat gray eyes max as he had appeared to john as a child this immense this unshakable well he thought as amelie might say fuck you max get thee behind me it was the pills he thought they were responsible for this the eruption of metaphor into his visual field he shook his head and worked hard at concentrating on the road of course he thought it might be the dissolution that susan christopher had warned him about the cortical locus of his ego the john shaw part of his brain misfiring in the dark of the skull as it had when he almost allowed the corvette to cartwheel on the highway out of toronto but that was not an allowable thought not yet he blinked away the mutant landscape and reached for his baggie of pills he abandoned the corvette in the vast parking lot at tsawassen where the ferries left the mainland of british columbia for the gulf islands it was a bright clear autumn day the ferry dock was at the end of a long artificial spit of land the waiting room windows looked over the placid blue water john stood in the sunlight watching as the victoria ferry eased into dock peaceful here but he was wound up with drug energy twitchy restlessness and fatigue poisons strange little seretonin rushes from his overworked neurochemistry he made his body calm tried to suppress the rawnerve tingling in his arms and legs he thought of susan christopher the thought was unbidden but very strong another eruption out of his past he thought this one more recent another face well he liked her face he held it in his mind for a moment and the influence was soothing her face was uncommonly revealing and it was possible to read every flicker of her psyche in it her timidity of course and her fear of him and under that something else a fresh grief but these things did not define her there was also an openness a willfulness intelligence and she liked him she felt some connection with him a dim sexual urge fought through the amphetamine haze but that was inappropriate now and maybe forever sudden associative memories of old experiments encounters in the dark and this cynical familiar thought a man may be raised by apes but does he love the apes in the blue gulf water a ferry sounded its horn john shouldered his knapsack and shuffled aboard the afternoon faded toward evening crossing the gulf standing alone on the windswept outer deck he watched the peak of mount hood ancient volcanic cinder cone fading to red on the horizon he had come to canada fifteen years ago memories of that time unreeled behind his eyes after he left the woodwards after a few years in transient jobs from detroit to san francisco he decided he would be safer in canada safer or at least harder to find john understood certain facts about his past he knew that his creation had been overseen by the american government in one of its more macabre incarnationsthe cias mkultra or some related institutionand that this agency had lost interest in him shortly before he was delivered to the woodwards he was also aware that he was a potential embarrassment to these powerful people and that he would be safer if he could become anonymous canada seemed like a good place to do that money had never been a problem he was able to bluff his way into almost any kind of work he paid for fabricated id and began with a typesetting job in vancouver he put his savings into small solid investments he anticipated the citys urban growth cycles throughout the volatile s and turned that insight into capital he wasnt wealthywealth invites attentionbut within a few years he was at least independent for a time his most permanent address had been a houseboat anchored on the north shore in the summers when he could afford the time he used the boat to explore the bc coastline those journeys had satisfied his appetite for isolation at least for a while but it was an appetite that once briefly whetted began to grow beyond all bounds the ocean fed it the ocean was indifferent calm and vast the ocean did not pay john shaw any particular attention the coastal rocks and piney inlets ignored his passage there were places where he could land come ashore and move among the dark trees as quietly as the haida or the kwakiutl of a thousand years ago the isolation was a new discovery for him a thrilling one alone he could become what he was meant to be a new thing a fresh creature on the earth in the spring of he had liquidated the bulk of his savings and bought property on one of the more obscure and inaccessible of the inhabited gulf islands a chain of rocky prominences paralleling the inner coast of vancouver island the smallest of these were unmapped rocks and shoals that disappeared with the tide the one he came to think of as his own was hardly larger the entire southern tip of this island was in effect his property a domain a kingdom though he did not think of himself as its owner or ruler he was its citizenits subject he had ransomed his savings for that privilege there was enough money left to keep him in provisions to pay for a cabin and a wind generator for the books and the pc terminal he ferried in from the mainland alone he had immersed himself in cellular biology he recognized the irony he was adopting maxs specialty but it was suddenly and overwhelmingly important to establish the link between himself and the rock pine the sea otter the sea itself at the most basic level they were all very much alike ribosomes and rysosomes hydrogen and oxygen evolutionary history was inscribed into the substance of itselforganelles once independent creatures were imbedded in the cellular structure like the effigies of saints in the wall of a cathedral climbing among the shore rocks in late summer he observed bluegreen algae in the glassy tide pools prokaryotic cells filaments of dna floating free in the cytoplasm primitive protein inventions he handled shells washed up by storms calciate rocks with the fibonacci series imposed upon their shapes as if the clay itself had been possessed by mathematics this was the estate from which he had been disinherited he was not even a genetic sportthe cells in his body his dna were no more unusual than anyones his progeny if he produced any would not resemble him max had intervened after conception in the womb had performed chemical modifications that operated at the level of transcriptase and rna skewed protein messages carried through cellular reproduction in the zygote in effect his blueprints had been tampered with specifically the protein code for the construction of a human forebrain had been altered the basic human neural commandto build a more complex cerebrumhad been amplified he was born with voluntary motor control and cutaneous sensation measurably greater than the norm other cortical functionsthe generalized sensory threshold language skills abstract thoughtregistered beyond the curve of expectation as soon as they could be reasonably charted by the age of five years he was way off scale on the stanfordbinet intelligence test he was smart he was also not entirely human he was not human but he was protoplasm and he guessed he had come to this isolated place to prove that to himself we are all cast out from some kingdom he thought it was how the process worked chordates exiled from the world of the invertebrates airbreathing vertebrates exiled from the sea mankind itself cast out from the animal kingdom into the high chilling air of selfawareness and the anticipation of personal mortality i am not unique he told himself merely alone it was a kind of consolation but it had faded through the long winter and he was left with a growing sense of morbidity alone he turned his attention to cellular pathology he read research abstracts he built an elaborate addon memory system for his pc and tinkered with its program protocols until he could use it to generate elaborate models of metastatic ll carcinomas he came to understand disease and aging as the agents of thermodynamic necessitythe spring of life unwinding on itself the universe itself he thought was a broken symmetry in the unimaginable unmaterial from which it arose an eruption of imperfection and life was both a product of that process and a mirror of it we carry our corruption from the womb he thought max had believed in the perfectibility of mankind but that was a superstition bad teleology and bad thermodynamics as time passed he had traveled to the mainland less often when he did he began to attract attention his levis were thin and sunfaded he had grown a beard he was astonished at his own reflection in the window of the night ferry to tsawassen here was some feral creature sundarkened and wildeyed where was john shaw what was john shaw but he knew the answer john shaw was an inventionthe lifework of dr kyriakides how strange it must be he thought to create a human beingor a facsimile of one but ive done that he thought i do know what its like he had invented benjamin waves of memory were triggered by the thought memory and the faint disquieting sensation that something alive had moved inside him coming back to this place now it seemed as if he had never left he bought a weeks rental on an aluminum motor launch from one of the larger islands and made his way directly to the cabin avoiding the main docks at the civilized end of the small island and beaching the boat in a rocky inlet he secured the boat against the incoming tide and followed a crude path to the cabin from the shore the cabin hadnt changed much the weather had pried up a few boards and dry rot had taken out a corner of the porch stairs a window was broken hikers had been herehe found a limp condom and the remains of a sixpack discarded in the back room forbidden pleasures violation and trespass he swept all this away down the back steps into the bushes there was a small storage closet built into the rear of the cabin which no one had bothered to loot it contained mainly maintenance supplies and he was able to mend the broken window with a sheet of polyethylene night was falling fast john moved into the lengthening shadows of the pines beyond the cabin and gathered windfall for a fire it had been a dry autumn and there was plenty of loose kindling he startled a deer which regarded him with wary eyes before it bolted into the bush he had a fire blazing in the stone fireplace before the sky was entirely dark and enough kindling set aside to last the night come morning he would chop firewood the weather was clear but very cold he rolled out his sleeping bag in front of the fire he was immensely tired he gave himself permission to sleep now here finally but sleep wouldnt come strange how it was possible to be crazed with fatigue and still wide awake too many amphetamines he thought for far too long he was still on some level speeding he wrapped himself in his down jacket and went outside walking a few feet down a dark path to a slab of granite overlooking the water he gazed at the cold wholly transparent sky and listened to the rustle of dry leaves against the windward wall of the cabin he felt his aloneness and he understoodquite suddenlythat it was that onceglimpsed sense of connection that had brought him back here the needeven if he was dying especially if he was dyingto feel himself a part of something if not humanity then this this stark unforgiving lovely night but there was nothing of him in this wilderness he had expected to find at least an echo of himself of his isolation in sky and sea and stone but the sky swallowed up his voice and the rock rejected his footprints he shuffled inside to wait for morning amelie did her best to ignore the note on the kitchen cupboard problem was it refused to go away she pretended it didnt exist when she came home from the restaurant and found it that first time the note was like something washed up in a bottle indecipherable and strange must leave try to understand what did that mean it didnt even look like benjamins writing he had talked about going away true but this it was too weird she washed the dishes george had given her the evening off she watched entertainment tonight followed by a game show and a detective show the images slid on past video valium one day she thought well get cable then maybe therell be something good to watch but the we made an odd hollow sound in her head she went to bed alone deep brooding dreamless sleep and then she woke upstill alone well that happened sometimes you couldnt predict with benjamin obviously he had problems it was not as if he could entirely control what he was she forced herself to make the trek to the bathroom cold these mornings she looked at herself in the minor naked and shivering and she didnt like what she saw small breasts pinpoint nipples a mousebrown thatch of pubic hair a ratty little body amelie thought someone probably sister madelaine from the ecole had called her that amelie you are a ratty thing ratty little me amelie thought she went to work without thinking about benjamin it was an ordinary day at work and that was good she thought maybe she was projecting some kind of aura because nobody bothered her much even her customers were politeeven george was polite at the door as she was leaving he put his hand on her shoulder and said are you okay just a little down amelie said regretting it instantly because in a strange way saying so seemed to make it true some woman thing george diagnosed yeah she thought im getting my period george could be such a moron sometimes but he meant well something like that so cheer up he said thank you a whole lot for that terrific advice amelie thought she walked home in the cold dark when she reached the apartment the note was still attached to the cupboard she looked at it harder this time forced her eyes to track it blue bic hieroglyphics really what language was this and at the back of her head where impossible thoughts were nevertheless sometimes pronounced she heard i am alone now oh no screw that hed be home he would it was only a matter of time she poked through the dresser drawers looking for something to smoke something that would soothe her to sleep this turned out to be a bad move because she discovered that benjamins clothes had been pretty much cleared out the vacant space was a signal to her more comprehensible than the note and more final this sad empty drawer she slammed it shut as it turned out there was a joint hidden at the bottom of her pursesomething shed bought from tony morriseau a while back it got her stoned enough to enjoy a william powell thin man movie coming fuzzily over the border from a network affiliate in buffalo but not so stoned that she didnt leap up from the sofa when the telephone rang benjamin she thought because it was late now and he must be thinking about her and who the hell else would be calling her at this hour her hand trembled on the receiver hello but it wasnt benjamin it was roch she couldnt understand him at first he was speaking thick muddled obscene french hes drunk she thought she said in english what do you want there was a long pause i need a place to stay oh no hey come on roch you know thats not a good idea oh it isnt isnt it amelie wished she hadnt smoked she felt suddenly feverish and sweaty she felt her brothers attention focused on her like a heatray through the telephone they fucking kicked me out of my apartment amelie nonpayment bitch landlady calls me a deadbeat you know this toad with a dress like a burlap sack looks at me like i came out from a crack in the plaster you are a deadbeat she says im locking you out i told her i have stuff in there she says you have trash in there and you can pick it up from the side of the road i should have fucking killed her amelie who was tired of this said so why didnt you because she had some goddamnned pit bull or something on a leash beside her one of those killing dogs he emitted a high drunken laugh it even looked like her but i should have you know i should have fucking killed her so do it sometime just do it and then theyll lock you up and i wont have this problem she said there must be someplace you can stay it sounded like pleading youre it roch said youre my sister you owe this to me he added whats the problemthat shithead youre living with well you can just fucking ditch him this is an emergency i mean im family right so tell him to get the hell out or ill kick his ass you didnt have much luck last time you tried amelie thoughtbut then she remembered that benjamin was gone maybe because she was stoned and frightened now his absence became abruptly real she really was alone here all by herself in these brokendown rooms she didnt want to give in to roch but if she refused odds were hed be over here anyway he would want a fight and she couldnt face that not now so she told him just tonight just until you find something okay just tonight he was instantly soothed thats my girl im not your girl roch youre there when i need you thats what counts right thats what family is for sure thats what family is for in the aftermath of his call the silence in the room was stunning she turned down the volume on the tv but she could still hear a highpitched whine radiating from inside the set a leaky tap ticked in the kitchen she turned away from the phone then turned back as a flutter of motion attracted her eye a slip of paper had been tucked under the phone now it slipped to the floor she picked it up and unfolded it a phone number a name susan christopher the woman who had come looking for john shaw maybe susan christopher knows where benjamin is she thought it was possible but the christopher woman might be out of town by now probably was there was a hotel address written under the fold of the paper probably she would have checked out still no amelie instructed herself dont think about it now save it she tucked the note into her purse down deep between her wallet and her makeup casea safe place she might want it she thought later susan stayed an extra month over schedule in toronto living frugally on the money dr kyriakides had wired her and waiting for the phone to ring she developed a schedule her mornings were her own and she used them to explore the city on foot or by public transit there was always the possibility that john might try to contact her during these hours but it was a calculated risk she could not simply sit in her room and wait so she would wake up shower buy breakfast in the hotel coffee shop she had left standing instructions with the switchboard to take her messageswhich must have amused the telephone staff since there werent any messages everand she was careful to get back no later than one oclock in the afternoon a stern rule that served to assuage her guilt in time she developed a few favorite destinations she liked riding the ferry to wards island and back lake ontario bleak and pretty in the november weather she liked chinatown she discovered cheap interesting lunches in the vietnamese restaurants along dundas west of universityjohn would approve she thought she shopped for reading material in the secondhand bookstores along the citys somewhat bohemian queen street strip afternoons she would read by the phone there were days when she spoke to no one except the waiter in the saigon maxima and the desk clerk at the hotel the isolation had become a fact of her life i am she thought like those people who live in caves for months on end she had begun to lose any real sense of time it was dr kyriakides who reminded her of how much time had truly passed he phoned at the end of november and said i want you to come home now but he hasnt called susan said he i think at this point we have to admit that it might not happen when was the last time he contacted you almost a month ago wasnt it approximately that and it had been benjamin not john and the news had not been encouraginghe was calling from a motel somewhere out west and he believed john was acting out some kind of regression unwinding his life down the highway toward some unknown destination but he said hed try to call again susan protested if i leave now he wont be able to find us john can always find us if he wants to that decision is in his hands i suppose it always has been we cant force our help on him but my main concern susan is you im doing all right but it sounded petulant childish youre becoming obsessive maxim kyriakides said shouldnt i be youre obsessive about john you told me so i have a legitimate reason im entitled to my guilt susan ive earned it she didnt want to explore the implications of that one more week i dont see any point in prolonging the inevitable ill make you a deal one more week then i fly backno arguments no regrets dr kyriakides was silent for a moment you know youre not in a position to bargain as a favor then well then let me make the arrangements ill buy you a flight back to ohare one week from tonight precisely the thought of it was chilling but he was right of course she couldnt stay here forever she was living on his money borrowing time against an academic career she could not postpone indefinitely all right she said the offer was generous really yes good ill call back when i have a flight number for you you can pick up the ticket tomorrow the deadline came quickly susan counted off the grey cold days one by one until they were gone she confirmed her reservation at a travel agency opposite the hotel and on the afternoon of the day of her flight she packed her bags funny she thought how anonymous a hotel room seems when you arrive and then you occupy it you make it your own now the process was running in reverse with her clothes folded into her suitcases the closet empty and the key on the dresserit was as if she had never moved in where had all the time gone but that was one of those dumb selfpunishing questions darkness came early these cloudy days at four oclock she flicked on the room lamps and began to dress for the flight a seventhirty flight but susan preferred to arrive early at airports dress and maybe catch a snack at the hotel coffee shop then a cab to the airport check in by six or sixthirty buy a book at the newsstand and camp out in a waiting room until the flight was ready to board she was standing in her slip when the phone rang she scolded herself for a sudden leap of hope reprieves did not come at the last minute only in the movies susan she picked up the receiver and said yes is that it was a womans voice is that susan christopher far away and unfamiliar tremulous and odd susan frowned whos this amelie desjardins you remember me amelie who had lived with benjamin amelie barefoot in the doorway of a slum apartment radiating suspicion of course susan wanted to add how did you get this number she asked instead is anything wrong i have to talk to you well ithe thing isi have a plane to catch im leaving tonight oh shit oh welllistenif you could just tell me you know where heisjust give me a number or somethingjust so i could talk to him susan said desperately i dont know you dont know i thought that was why you came hereto take him away he left john i mean he got scared and he just uh left should she be saying this what is it amelie is there a problem its my fucking brother i think he wants to kill me susan could not frame a response to this i just thought if i could talk to somebody amelie said then she added but you mean it dont you you lost him too yes well iif you could get here soon maybe we could talk i have some time before i absolutely need to leave is this connected with john partly look i dont want to make a problem for you no noi mean i want to talk well if theres time can you get here inside the hour pause sure its not that far ill wait for you susan said they met in the lobby and then found a booth at the back of the coffee shop amelies eyes were puffy and bloodshot her hair was down in matted bangs across her forehead she wore jeans and a tshirt under an oversized red plaid lumberjack shirt susan sitting across from her felt instantly helpless its roch amelie said hes my brother the girl seemed anxious to talk susan listened carefully she was not accustomed to having people come to her with their problems it wasnt the sort of thing that happened to her she paid close somber attention as amelie spoke amelie had a brother named roch who had followed her to toronto from montreal a real sonofabitch i mean he has trouble dealing with people i dont think he registers people at all they just dont exist for him unless they get in his way or humiliate himand then his instinct is just to crush them grind them under his foot he can be pretty singleminded about it i learned how to deal with it you know how to keep from making him mad but it isnt always easy when we came here when they came to toronto they had lived in the streets and roch had encouraged amelie into occasional prostitution but that sounds likei mean you have to understand it was the kind of thing a runaway kid might do it happened maybe four or five times and it was a question of having money for food a place to stay it was a long time ago susan nodded eventually amelie had found a job and a cheap apartment roch had taken a whole string of jobs mostly lifting and carrying he was strong amelie said but he didnt get along with people hed been working for the last six months at the bus parcel express depot down at front street but he lost that when he put a chokehold on his supervisor and almost killed him roch was outraged when they fired him his life amelie seemed to imply was a continuous series of these outrages he would be provoked he would respond he would be punished for it christ knows what the guy said to him some kind of insult so roch practically breaks the mans neck and hes fired and its business as usual right except that for roch every time this happens its like brandnew like hes filing it away on some index card in his headfucked over again amelie had avoided roch fairly effectively for a few years but the bpx firing had been a pointofnoreturn now roch was back and he had changed amelie said he was closer to the edge than he had ever been before like this thing with benjamin suddenly roch is jealous for three years he ignores me altogether then suddenly he resents this guy im living with what makes it worse is that benjaminor i guess it was johndid this humiliation thing on him the fight they had no real physical damage but the contemptyou could feel it shooting out of him and roch just soaked it up charging his batteryyou know what i mean you could say roch is at a very high voltage right now amelie stopped long enough to finish the beer shed ordered susan waited amelie drained the glass maybe its better benjamin left i dont think he could stand up to roch right now i dont thinkim not sure i can either susan said hes staying with you i cant make him leave is he hurting you amelie looked across the table then reached up and pulled her hair away from her forehead there was an angry blue bruise underneath susan drew in her breath my god amelie shrugged im just worried hell get worse you should call the police she laughed derisively have you ever seen a domestic dispute call i have you know what happens fuckall is what happens and it would make roch really mad you can leave though cant you its my apartment i mean temporarily susan said there must be a womens shelter in the city you could have a restraining order put on him a restraining order amelie said the idea was comic but she added are there really shelters wellwe can find out let me make a couple of calls susan looked at her watch oh lordmyplane thats right amelie said you gotta go she stood up susan fumbled out money for the check amelie added you expect to hear from him again meaning john i dont know susan admitted maybe maybe youll hear from him first we have to keep in touch listen there are phones in the lobby let me make a couple of calls for you amelie shrugged susan stopped at the front desk hunting in her purse for the room key check out locate a shelter in case amelie needed it then take a cab to the airportthere was still time for everything but only just she tapped the bell and the desk clerk hurried over ms christopher yes she began i that call came through the clerk said i suppose the one youve been waiting for long distance collect susan just gaped no message the clerk said except that he would try again in an hour or so susan checked her watch a second time when was this about twentyfive minutes ago thank you susan said ill wait up in my room yes maam was there anything else nonot just now she turned to amelie you can wait with me if you like amelie said wont you miss your plane yes susan said i will john said he would meet her wednesday morning at the ferry docks at tsawassen dr kyriakides wired the money for her flight to bc and two tickets back susan helped amelie check into a ywca spent a sleepless night at the hotel then caught a taxi to the airport and a westbound plane it was windy and cold at the docks susan bought a cup of bitter coinmachine coffee and huddled in the waiting room she was excited but terribly tired she slept for a few minutes with her back against the wall woke up stiff and uncomfortableand saw john standing a few feet away he looked thin and worn a duffel bag in one hand and a grey visor cap pulled down over his eyes he was sunbrown and his hair was longer than she remembered but it was john not benjamin there was something in the way he stood she knew at once she stood up she had envisioned this moment played it over in her mind a dozen times during the trip from toronto she wanted to embrace him but decided she didnt really know him well enoughit just seemed that way after all the waiting she took his hands a small spontaneous gesture im glad you decided to call he looked at her for a long time he reached up to touch her cheek and the expression on his face susan could not take the measure of it but there might have been surprise curiosity maybe even gratitude she said can i ask what it waswhy you changed your mind he took his hand away and held it up in front of her his hand was trembling it was a pronounced involuntary tremor susan was suddenly afraid watching it he was sickhe was admitting it now he said i found out that i dont want to die she called dr kyriakides from a booth in the airport confirming the meeting he hasnt said it in so many words but i think this is his way of telling us he needs us thats important isnt it possibly dr kyriakides said he sounds worried susan thought or worsehe sounds frightened hey she said the battles over isnt it were almost home no dr kyriakides said i think youre mistaken i think the battle has only just begun i think were a very long way from home part controlled experiments maxim kyriakides paid the taxi driver and watched as the automobile sped away leaving him alone in the gravel driveway of the house north of toronto in which he would be spending the next few months the house was a whitewashed pseudogeorgian structure isolated from its neighbors by groves of trees maxim had never seen it before it belonged to a colleague a university of toronto professor named collingwood who was a member of what they had called the network many years ago the house was to have gone up for sale a week ago but collingwood had offered it to maxim when maxim explained the problem he was facing the house was suitably large maxim walked up the driveway to the big portico fished a key from his pocket and inserted it into the lock on the double doors open they admitted a wash of december sunlight into the tiled foyer the house was cold the heat had been turned off for some days but the electricity had been restored yesterday maxim flicked a switch and the lights winked on the entrance hall yielded to a kitchen a living room a library these were furnished though sparselyvaluables had been removed and there were blank pale spaces where paintings had been taken from the walls well he thought that was appropriate too we shall all be entering a new unfamiliar space all three of us all four counting the frenchcanadian girl susan had mentioned no even more than that five he thought if you allowed benjamin as a separate entity maxim ascended the staircase carefully he was healthy enough to pass for ten or fifteen years younger than his age he was large but not fat he had always walked for pleasure sometimes great distances and he supposed that habit had helped preserve his health still he was conscious of his age at sixtyeight stairs were a chore to be undertaken with some seriousness he remembered his uncle constantine moving through the house in macedonia at this same solemn considered pace constantine had been a schoolteacher and a cynical communist a friend of the rebel veloukhiotis maxim was then a teenager and already an ideologue he had read marx with great determination now is it possible he wondered that as children were already learning how to be old had he been studying for infirmity under his uncles slow tutelage the second floor of the house on the outskirts of toronto exuded a closedin musty atmosphere he wanted to open a window but dared not that would only make it more difficult to heat these rooms when the furnace kicked on again he stood by a bedroom window and gazed through its double panes across a wooded ravine the ravine was stark and bare a swath of perhaps a hundred yards between the house and a housing project crowded up against a major highway the ravine afforded at least a little privacy and that was good the house he thought was as close to stateliness as one could achieve in such a prefabricated landscape he paused to scold himself for this momentary class snobbery to which he was not even entitled maxim though no longer a communist like poor dead constantine had once considered himself a socialist certainly he had never been wealthy but the important thing he thought is that i can work here it was john who had insisted on staying in toronto maxim had wanted him to fly to chicago with susan but john believed he would be safer on this side of the borderwhich might even be true though maxim had no evidence to suggest itand certainly he would be more comfortable less disoriented in a familiar setting so maxim had arranged a sudden sabbatical ostensibly for reasons of health no one inquired too closelyone of the advantages of seniority and tenure and borrowed this house from his friend everything was in place except for the people and they would be arriving tomorrow susan this young woman amelie and john whom maxim had not set eyes upon for many years resting a moment in the darkened hallway he silently framed the forbidden wordsmy son not literally of course maxim had never married never produced any children even his most intimate friendspossibly excepting those in the socalled networktook him for an elderly bachelor of the generic sort married to his research and his teaching and that was in fact largely true but no ones life is as simple as his friends believe in a real sense maxim thought i created john what else is fatherhood this was if anything even more profound a virgin fatherhood he thought i could have raised him it was one of those thoughts that came to him periodically unbidden and unwelcome ordinarily he would have shunted it aside it was not useful but now with the prospect of facing john once again there was no avoiding it if they hadnt taken him away if i hadnt allowed them to take him away but no he was too old to regret his life you do what you do and then you do what you can he sat down in a chair in the entranceway to wait for the deliveries he had been told to expect a few pharmaceuticals a tape recorder his notebooks bundled in a huge coat and away from the wind he was warm enoughexcept for his feet warm enough anyway to drift toward sleep drifting he was briefly assailed by a dreamimage of john standing before him john grown unnaturally tall pointing a finger of accusation and pronouncing the word liar the vision was disturbing and it startled him awake he sat up blinking the afternoon light had dimmed the house was dark he rubbed his face sighing traitorous sleep but he supposed there was some truth in his dream he had implied to susan that there was some treatment available for john presumably she had passed this implication on poor trusting susan who believed in his miraculous powers in fact there was nothing for john in this house but a warm bed in which to endure his crisis and my notebook maxim thought my obdurate curiosity and my guilt tests would be run of course and there was dopamine which had relieved some symptoms in the animal studies but there was nothing to forestall the ultimate resolution unwillingly maxim recalled his laboratory chimps the animals prostrate and comatose or consumed by fever in the initial testsbefore john was bornthe beasts had not been allowed to live long enough to exhibit symptoms they were grotesques capable of understanding a few words of written english and copying the alphabet from childrens books they were destroyed as a potential embarrassment but dr kyriakides had allowed his second animals his private experiment to live to maturitycaged homunculi with enlarged skulls and wizened cynical faces he had watched them live out their truncated lives scratching apple and orange onto yellow copypaper or probing their fur with the pencils and dropping into recurrent fevers which he mistook at first for some form of malaria then battering themselves against their cages and screeching as if they had suffered some unendurable insight into their own conditioncollapsing at last into a febrile unconsciousness most died some recovered but never fully never regained their facility with the pencil never remembered how to operate the infant toys the ones who survived lived on as lab animals caged and listless though an xray or an autopsy might reveal certain unusual cerebral lesions whatever its outcome the affliction was universal and now john i didnt mean this to happen but it had happened anyway maxim stood up groaning old bones but his feet were not as cold as they had been and he realized that the gas must have been turned on while he slept the house had begun to warm around him roch said he was going out for the daylooking for work he said amelie watched from the kitchen window as he drove off in his battered green chevy van then she telephoned susan today she said can you pick me up all right susan said amelie hurried to pack her things not that there was much to pack a suitcase full of clothes the stereo the tv set none of the furniture was worth hanging on to if there had been time she would have sent it back to the salvation army depot where shed found it but the arrangements had to be made in secret and quickly so that roch wouldnt find out he had been in a tolerable mood through christmas and amelie didnt want to provoke anything before she left above all she didnt want him to find out where she was going susan had said she would come by with the car around noon at eleven fortyfive amelie hiked her belongings out to the curb where they sat in a small unimpressive heap she wrapped herself in a jacket and stood shivering next to the luggage it was a cold january day and the clouds had begun to wring out a few flakes of snow the sidewalk was clear but cold ice stood in pockets in the grassy verge it was at least not one of those hideously cold days you sometimes get in january and february when the air steals your breath and even the short walk to the bus stop is an endurance testbut it felt like those days were coming amelie decided she would need a new winter coat not just this jacket she used to own a parka from the thrift village over on augusta but shed thrown it away when the seams ripped under the arms she looked up and down the street anxiously but there was no sign of susans car it felt funny leaving the apartment behind leaving it to roch who would probably have to be evicted but shed left so much behind already her job at the restaurant for instance susan claimed that dr kyriakides would be able to find her another job soon and maybe that was true or maybe not but she couldnt stay on at the goodtime because roch would be sure to find her there she had no illusions about roch she had lived with her brother for most of the past month and she understood that whatever was wrong with himshe thought of it as a kind of broken wheel inside himwas getting worse the wheel was running loose it had come free of all the gears and governors and pretty soon it might wreck the machine entirely you could tell by the noise by the smell of hot metal and simmering oil amelie who smoked cigarettes very occasionally fished one out of her purse now and lit it it made her feel warmer but then she coughed and felt mildly guiltyfelt the pressure of all those public health ads on tv she took a last drag and butted out the cigarette against the icy ground her watch said she whispered come on susan her breath made clouds in the cold air she tried to remember what susan christopher was driving these days she had seen the car a couple of times a rented honda she recalled some drab colorbeige or brown kind of boxshaped maybe that was it at the corner but no the distant grey automobile rolled on without turning there was a stillness in the air the eerie calm of a cold weekday noon everybody was inside having lunch amelie thought randomly of the ecole in montreal bag lunches in the dingy cafeteria and pale winter light through the mullioned windows dead hours like this behind closed eyes she pictured the honda willing it to arrive susan goddamn this was dangerous she opened her eyes then and looked down the street a vehicle turned the comer but it was not susans honda it was rochs green van she stood up panicked but what was there to do hide in the apartment how was she supposed to explain thisthe little sony tv the stereo taped tourister luggage all sitting at the curb in a neat pile she wanted to run but couldnt make her feet move susan will come she thought and ill jump into the car and well zoom away but susan didnt come the van rolled to a stop beside her oh amelie thought oh shit roch cracked open the door on the passenger side she saw him peering out from the dimness inside and the expression on his face was stony and opaque he said going somewhere it was like being back in school latin class she thought dizzily inevitably the sister would ask her to decline some verb and amelie who could not get a grip on latin would stand beside her desk in mute humiliation this same wordlessness overtook her now she could not run she could not speak roch said disgustedly get in meekly amelie obeyed susan turned the corner and saw amelies possessions piled on the curb then registered the green van idling ahead it was rochs van susan had seen it parked at the building before amelie had pointed it out no she thoughtand pulled the honda over before she could be spotted she watched amelie climb into the van susans mind was racing she wished john was here or dr kyriakides she remembered the bruise amelie had showed her remembered amelies description of roch she was what five minutes late she shouldnt have stopped for coffee at the hotel shouldnt have come up yonge street the traffic was bad shouldnt have but that was stupid not helpful at all she watched the green van roll away it turned right at the next comer now or never susan thought she gunned the honda down the street pretty soon amelie understood where roch was taking her when she was young and on the street in toronto she had heard about cherry beach it was a bleak strip of shoreline east of the harbor and if a cop picked you up after midnight for vagrancy say or trespassing or prostitution and if you said the wrong thing then the cop might drive you out to cherry beach and do some work on your attitude it was called cherry beach express and although amelie had never experienced it she knew people who had she was always afraid it was roch who would end up out therepermanently damaged maybe because he did not know when to shut up and lie down now roch was driving her past the peeling towers of grain silos and the shadows of lake freighters down industrial alleys and across rusted railway sidings cherry beach express because roch understood how punishment worked obviously it was punishment he had on his mind right now but its daylight she thought someone will see us but that was stupid she knew better she looked at roch a careful sideways glance his lips were compressed and pale he was nodding to himself as if he had expected this all along ratty old amelie showing her true colors at last this was not even hatred amelie thought it was something much colder and vaster than that she said roch i dont talk he said shut up she bit her lip the van rolled to a stop far along the isolated shoreline obscured from the road by a stand of leafless maples roch reached across and opened amelies door then pushed her out she stumbled onto the cold compacted sand the air was brittle with moisture and she could hear the waves lapping at the shore far off somewhere in the harbor a freighter sounded its horn roch climbed down after her amelie fought the urge to run there was nowhere to go roch was fast and she would only make him mad she stood with her hands at her side breathing hard roch stood in front of her close enough for her to smell his breath he said you dont trust me she said thats not true he slapped her it was a hard stinging openhanded slap it rocked her head to the right roch was strong he still worked out in the gym twice a week amelie knew this because he had borrowed money from her to keep his membership current you dont trust me he said and youre lying to me what kind of thing is that to do christ im your brother doesnt that mean anything to you he expected an answer amelie was rigid frightened sure it means something to me liar roch said sadly no i mean it i meanjesus christ roch he grabbed her wrists his grip was powerful you were running away amelie could not hold his gaze she looked at the lake instead grey under grey clouds running away from home roch elaborated look at me goddammit he took her jaw in his right hand and forced her to face him his hand traveled up along her cheek in a gesture that was almost a caress then he took a handful of her hair and twisted it amelie said ow and began to cry you were going somewhere he said i was moving out she said all right im sick of that place you didnt tell me roch said patiently you could have told me i thought youd get mad he seemed puzzled why why would i get mad i mean maybe youre right we need a bigger place hey im reasonable his grip tightened on her hair but thats not all of itright shit amelie said dont use bad language roch said it makes you sound cheap he was thinking his face was contorted with the effort of it you wanted to get rid of me thats it isnt it or elseits that guy you shacked up with right hes backright amelie hated it when roch talked about benjamin dirty dangerous words shut up she said he slapped her again this time with his left hand firmly tangled in her hair it was worse dont talk to me like that he said she moaned hes backright after a long pause amelie nodded you were going to stay with him pause nod again snow was falling gently now she felt the flakes against her burning cheek well you can go roch said amelie looked up roch smiled you can go if you want to sure go with him im on your side all i wanti just want you to prove you trust me i just want you to tell me where i can find you no amelie said instantly no you wont tell me ii dont know roch we havent but she did know susan had given her the address of the house amelie had written it down and hidden it in her purse roch understood this of course he always knew when she was lying this time though he didnt slap her this time he jerked his knee up into her belly and at the same time released her hair put his hand in a frightening grip around her face and pushed amelie fell to the ground doubled over and gasping for breath the pain was enormous roch said in a tone of weary patience all you have to do is tell me amelie blinked she felt like throwing up she rose to her knees and thenpast roch a great distance back the way theyd come along the shore roadshe saw a flicker of light it was a reflection from a car window and the car was rolling along in slow motion and it was greya grey honda it was susan amelie realized who must have followed them from the rooming house she looked up at roch trying hard to disguise her emotion he took her hair and dragged her up amelie grabbed a double handful of cold gritty beach sand and then she was on her feet she had seen this in movies you took a handful of dirt roch frowned what now reading her face amelie brought both hands up and thrust them forward spraying the beach sand into rochs eyes what the fuck he screamed amelie ducked past his groping hands toward the honda she saw susan accelerate suddenly down the gritty tarmac hurry susan but the sandintheeyes thing was not as paralyzing as it looked on tv roch turned and scrambled after her she could hear the thump of his big feet against the beach the sandy beach slowed her down it was like running in a dream but maybe it would slow roch down too amelie saw the honda speeding toward her as susan realized what had happened amelie drew in great ragged gasps of frigid air the honda veered away from the road and ran a few yards along the verge it wavered and amelie saw susan groping across the passenger seat to unlock the far door the door swung open as the honda curved back to the road amelie focused all her attention on that door it was her only way out of here because roch was mad enough now that he might kill her maybe not on purpose but he was strong she was not he was right behind her now she could hear his angry breathing she didnt look back because surely that would be the end because he might be right there with his arms outstretched she might freeze in her tracks seeing him she watched the honda roll forward in lazy dreamtime and thought here i am okay right here susan then she felt a tug as roch closed his hand on her jacket she pulled away but only briefly she stumbled and roch tackled hera football tackle she went down winded and breathless when she opened her eyes he was kneeling over her but the look on his face was not triumphant it was queerly mechanical a vacant gaze that was focused on her only approximately but his fist was raised and it was obvious what he meant to do amelie tried to squirm away but his other hand was clamped in a fierce grip around her neck amelie twisted her head to one side in time to see the front tires of the honda spitting sand as the car braked beside her susan amelie thought but it wasnt susan who saved her really it was the passengerside door which flew open as the honda stopped and caught roch across the head and shoulders roch slumped forward and his weight was immense but the grip around her neck had loosened and amelie slid out from under the limp bulk of her brother susan pulled her inside the car amelie slammed the door and hammered down the lock susan stepped down on the accelerator the little car revved against the sand for a long heartstopping moment then the rear wheels seemed to bite down and the honda shot forward the car missed a leafless maple by inches amelie cringed then they were back on solid tarmac and rocketing down the lakeshore road amelie knelt on the vinyl carseat and peered through the rear window she saw roch stand up he shook himselfshe thought of a wet dog shaking itself drythen stumbled toward his van hes coming after us she said susan said relax though she was breathing hard the honda turned left and roared through the industrial wasteland amelie watched vigilantly but saw no sign of roch then they were into traffic and there was no chance of him following amelie sighed and slumped down in the seat thanks she said its okay susan said amelie stared vacantly through the window the snow was falling harder now the afternoon was turning dark are you all right susan asked amelie touched the sore part of her cheek it would swell and bruise it would look shitty she was bruised down around her belly too but it was nothing terrible she told susan so nice guy susan commented amelie shrugged i guess he wanted to know where you were going yes amelie said did you tell him no thats why he hit you amelie nodded susan said that was pretty bravenot telling him brave amelie said she almost laughed jesus susanfor a smart person youre not very bright sometimes they took a long route back to make sure roch hadnt managed to follow coming up on amelies rooming house susan slowed there was no sign of the van roch wasnt here but he had been he must not have tried to follow at all he must have come straight back amelies things had been trashed oh no susan said she waited for some response from amelie but there was none amelie only looked morosely at the pile of wreckage that had been her stereo the little tv a suitcase full of clothes stop she said as the honda rolled past she opened the passenger door and leaned out to collect a couple of blouses some tapes a pair of levis from the snowy gutter she held these on her lap all that other stuff susan said you know we can replace all that amelie shrugged and closed the door she did not look back as susan drove away amelie was silent during most of the ride to the house dr kyriakides had rented seeming to watch the snow that had begun to accumulate across the brown farm fields and the cold marshes north of the city susan drove carefully grateful for the silence and the chance to begin to assimilate everything that had happened that terrible man and my god she had almost killed him slamming the car door into him the thing is amelie said quietly i just dont know susan looked across at her know what amelie studied her fingernails about roch she said i dont know whether we can do something like that to him i mean and get away with it she turned her large shiny eyes on susan i dont know if hell let us from the notebooks of maxim kyriakides finally we are all together in this house presumably for the duration of the winter the snow continues to deepen we are all confined by itthough of course it isnt the snow that keeps us together in our isolation certain things have become clear i begin to realize that there is underlying all else the question of benjamin the question of his sudden new presence in johns life the question of where benjamin comes from and perhaps what he will become from the taped transcripts of their meetings maxim kyriakides and john shaw january kyriakides hello john please sit down the sound of a chair being pulled up this is the room ive set aside for my work i hope well be meeting here often a long pause youre staring at me is something wrong john his voice firm but somewhat subdued im wondering what you want from me kyriakides well thats a complicated question i wont attempt to lie to you lets sayfor the moment im your doctor john you wont lie but you will condescend to me kyriakides is that what im doing john i know you max its been years obviously but i havent forgotten kyriakides you understand this is difficult for me too i know you i know what youre capable of i know what you could do as a child i can guess what youre capable of now so theres an element of caution john of fear kyriakides if you like does that make you happy john is this psychoanalysis kyriakides i suppose on one level it is i can be a better judge of whats happening if were able to talk to one another john you can judge my deterioration you mean kyriakides if it happens that way i hope to be able to prevent it a pause were being honest here john all those years kyriakides you resented me john no max i hated you john tell me about the treatment kyriakides treatment cant begin until we have more information i have an arrangement with dr collingwoodhes a neurologist hell be examining you and he has connections at the university and at toronto general so well have access to pet scanners and that sort of thing we need a complete neurological workup before we can proceed john in other words you dont have any treatment in mind kyriakides what i mean is that i wont discuss treatment until we know more i dont want you secondguessing me john even if my guesses are better than yours kyriakides it isnt a question of pride i admit that i need a certain amount of elbowroomemotional intellectual john you did animal studies kyriakides yes john the animals experienced loss of cortical tissue kyriakides they did john did they die pause max did the animals die kyriakides some of themyes kyriakides i think we have to begin by talking about benjamin john i wont submit to amateur psychoanalysisi thought id made that clear the problem is physiological kyriakides the symptoms may not be this is relevant john you do accept the implication that benjaminhis manifestation over the last year or twois a symptom john of something are you asking me to diagnose myself kyriakides im trying to justify my interest john youre suggesting benjamin began to manifest as a result of cortical disfunction maybe so maybe not sometimes i think i just lost interest when i invented him you know it was a willful acti wanted someone to run all the routine chores to gratify all the expectations i couldnt fulfill he was a kind of autopilot do you understand but i think thats the danger i created an autonomous cortical subroutine and allowed it access to my voluntary motor activity that must have created profound neural channelingits not the sort of thing you can simply erase and when being john shaw became too difficult benjamin was there he was waiting kyriakides why was it difficult to be john shaw john maybe i was sick maybe i was just tired kyriakides but it was a conscious decision john to resurrect benjamin noit was not kyriakides therefore we have to examine it john this is still parlor freudianism max benjamin as the unconscious mind of john shaw the three faces of eve but it isnt like that you should know better freud was a bourgeois apologist wasnt he kyriakides im not a marxist anymore john john how they fadethe passions of our youth kyriakides youre trying to nettle me is that why you keep calling me max john thats what they used to call you isnt it your colleagues in the network kyriakides you know about that john i overheard thingseven as a child im sorry if it bothers you calling you max i would feel a little odd about using formal titles im afraid kyriakides your conscious mind is exceptional john i havent made the mistake of assuming your unconscious mind is any less prodigious nor should you john superman and superego kyriakides obviously i cant force you to talk about benjamin but the implication is that you find the topic disturbing john im about to be evicted from my body max or lose my mind of course its disturbing kyriakides yes but there may be another way to think about it i wonder if benjamin isnt a kind of survival instinct unconsciousim forced to use the word but profound maybe youve resurrected him for a reason hes your creation after all he may be the key to your survival john a rapprochement we learn to love each other its a cliche kyriakides something more subtle than that what if neurologically speaking benjamin is a sort of liferaft the scrap of wood that survives the disaster john then i should cling to him kyriakides you should become him you should colonize him john you cant put all your cargo on a raft max it sinks kyriakides no but perhaps you can save whats most valuable john im tiredid like to go back to my room kyriakides i wont keep you only one more question youve been remarkably successful at restraining benjamin ever since susan contacted you john thats why im tired max kyriakides do you expect him to manifest his presence soon john it wouldnt surprise me im not sure how to keep him away in indonesia they chase away evil spirits by banging pots and pans would that work max stimulants are also good but i dont suppose dr collingwood would be willing to write a prescription a pause you want to meet himis that it kyriakides is that difficult to understand john you think he can help you kyriakides susan says hes been helpful john cooperating in his own annihilation kyriakides if thats what it means it may not do you despise him so much you created him after all hes a part of you john i dont think even shakespeare would enjoy having hamlet compete for the control of his bodydo you max kyriakides hamlet was imaginary john so was benjamin kyriakides but he isnt any longer surely thats the point youve created a living human being you have to live with the consequences john i yield to your experience in the matter from the notebooks of maxim kyriakides we live together in mutual isolation the house is big enough that we are not forced into interaction therefore that interaction has not yet begun susan and amelie are nervous with each otherrivals in a sense though i dont think either of them quite realize that i wonder about the wisdom of taking in amelie but susan was insistent and she may be useful in dealing with benjamin when benjamin finally appears he is the ghost that hovers over this house i do not know him i do not know what role he has to play or whether he will be willing to play it tomorrow john enters the hospital for tests perhaps after that we will have some useful approach to the problemcertainly we will all feel less aimless in the meantime i am chafing under johns hostility it is understandable and perhaps even therapeutic for him nevertheless it hurts i am in every important sense his father he must know i feel that wayit was always impossible to hide intense emotion from him but he resents it or uses it against me and i cannot blame him my god that is the worst of it he believes i abandoned him hes right susan drove everyone into the city in her hondashe thought of it as hers though it was dr kyriakides who had taken out the lease dr kyriakides didnt drive the task had fallen to susan by default therefore it was her car it was a cold clear january day the sun bright but barely strong enough to warm the tarmac snowplows had left huge hills of snow on each side of the highway it had been a snowy winter and the indications were that it would get worse no snow today but lots of icy runoff susan was cautious on turns downtown she parked in an underground lot today was the day john was scheduled for tests at toronto general tgh was the citys central hospital and as she passed through the lobby susan was reminded of every other hospital she had ever seen the corridors were pastel green and blue the paint abraded where gurney carts had bumped against the walls mysterious doors opened into mysterious rooms doctors and interns bustled past with fixed distant expressions dr kyriakides introduced john to another doctor a man named collingwood while susan and amelie staked out chairs in a waiting room collingwood was greyhaired bearded stout he spoke in a subdued tone then led john away down the corridor dr kyriakides sighed and rooted out a copy of newsweek from the sidetable amelie had found people susan could not concentrate on reading she kept her eyes on the corridor beyond the waitingroom door she glimpsed john when he passed a second time without stopping as he followed dr collingwood down the hall he had changed into a green hospital gown and paper slippers and the effect susan thought was of an immense indignity when susan was fourteen years old she had decided to become a doctor it was a serious ambition but in the end she realized she didnt have the stomach for it undergraduate biology courses offered confirming evidence that her squeamishness was fundamental inarguable and permanent that was when she detoured into cellular biology she could deal with living systems as whole entities or as specimens on a slide it was only that queasy middle ground the surgeons world of pumping blood and palpitating organs that repelled her that was the world where her fathers cancer had lived of all the ugly facets of his death she resented this perhaps most of all that he had become an ecology for a virulent and alien growth it struck her now that what she missed most was the illusion of his sturdiness fathers should be solid front to back susan thought otherwise nothing was certain anything could happen maybe that was how john felt about dr kyriakides but disappointingly she hadnt been able to talk to john much in the few days he had been back from vancouver he was moody he had isolated himself in his room susan had passed his door and seen him pecking at a computer terminal curious but vaguely familiar symbols flowing across the monitor she wanted to go in talk to him say something that would make him happy but it was not a privilege she had earned no real intimacy had passed between them and susan felt ashamed of her feelings the schoolgirl crush she had obviously developed john was as dr kyriakides continued to insist in some sense not even truly human but susan knew what it was like to feel set apart to feel different growing up in a california suburb bookish and shy citizen of an invisible country somewhere between fantasyland and pasadena she would have welcomed the idea of a gentle superhuman sweeping her off her feet except that he did not sweep and superhuman didnt mean what it should and he was not even especially gentle and worseunless dr kyriakides could do something about ithe might be dying or at the very least losing himself leaving me susan thought childishly voyaging off like her father wherever people go when they leave their sullen grieving families abandoned by the graveside but these were hospital thoughts susan walked down the corridor to a vendingmachine cafeteria and bought herself a cup of coffee hoping to shake the mood machine coffee in a styrofoam cup cloyingly sweet and hot enough to raise blisters she liked it when she got back to the waiting room dr collingwood was there he was a bearshaped man but not really large he was only just as tall as susan and the effect as he turned to face her was of some stern but basically amiable big animal this is susan he asked dr kyriakides nodded collingwood said we have john in a room upstairs while we wait for time on the scanner he asked for you to come up susan was a little flattered a little frightened she followed collingwood to the elevators and up two floors then down an identical corridor to a small room in which john was sitting in his hospital gown collingwood closed the door and left them alone john motioned to a chair susan sat with her hands primly in her lap he said you look more nervous than i am are you nervous not about the pet scan apprehensive about the results obviously hospitals frighten you yes she didnt explain why he said i brought this he reached into a day bag beside his chair and lifted out a portable chess set in a folding wooden box we have some time to kill while they warm up the machinery if you dont mind i thought id like a game she smiled youll win but thats not why i play he sounded almost sheepish i like the patterns its like a dance i like to watch it unfold is it all right of course susan said he cleared away a stack of magazines from the courtesy table and set up the game susan opened with her kings pawn john replied in kind it was a gentle opening a giuco piano the socalled quiet game she studied the board he said you think ive been avoiding you she was startled out of her thoughts well i because i have been not avoiding you personally its just that i didnt want to face the questions she could only echo questions the questions you never asked because you were afraid of what i might say questions about what i am about what its like being what i am susan felt herself blushing what kind of monster are youit was true the question had never been far away had it she moved a knight mainly to conceal her nervousness i thought we should talk about it now john said if you want to ive thought about it she admitted ive tried to imagine it did max ever talk about meabout his work in any detail i was never even allowed to see his lab animals nothing beyond the cellular level not much theory part of the problem is that we dont have an adequate vocabulary people talk about intelligence as if it consisted of certain discrete actssolving problems acquiring knowledge and storing it most of the standard tests reflect that but its really a superstition when you talk about intelligence what youre dealing with is human consciousness which is not simple or schematic i think even max knows better now he advanced his queens knight pawn susan gazed at the board abstractly she couldnt concentrate on the game he said theres an evolutionary question about intelligence what its for and how it arose theres a theory that intelligence evolved along with the upright posture and for a similar reason among other things susan a neuron is a clocka timing device but a single neuron has a widely variable firing timeits a clock but not a very good one he brought out his kings knight two neurons are a little better because the errors begin to average out three neurons are better still and so on and clocks are good for operations involving timing for instance a dog a dog is fairly good at catching things but a dog couldnt throw a rock at a moving target even if the dog were anatomically equipped to do so taking aim at a moving target makes demands on the neural clock the dog just cant meet even the primates you cant train an ape to throw a baseball with any accuracy making an accurate baseball pitch means solving a complex differential equation and doing it on the molecular level it takes neurons susan marched her kings bishop down the ranks if the theory is correct john said then we evolved all this neocortical tissue so that we could stand on our hind legs and throw stones consciousnessintelligencewas the unforeseen side effect because the very calculation the act of estimating speed and distance of picking up the stone and taking aim it exiles you from time you understand susan if the antelope is there and i aim over thereit implies i and thou self and other birth and mortality makes you human not just i am but i was and i will be fruit of the tree of knowledge it makes you the animal that stands just a little bit outside of time his own bishop came rolling out it was as if his hands were playing chess for him while he spoke susan responded with a reflexive pawn move awed by this outrush of words when max was doing his work of course no one thought of intelligence this way it was all much more linear brains were calculating machines and we had better calculators than the apes and there was no theoretical cap on ityou might imagine building a better brain the way the cybernetics people were upgrading univac building a better human being i think what max imagined was a kind of ultimate socialist man rational and benevolent john advanced his queens pawn a square smiling to himself it didnt occur to him that he might be creating the more perfect baseball player or that a man with more cortical tissue might have more terrifying dreams or that intelligence is a kind of exile from temporal experiencethat he might be engineering a creature more wholly alienated than anything that had walked the earth before lost in time your queens pawn what susan was startled youre thinking of moving your queens pawn not a bad move actually its that obvious there are only so many reasonable moves availableand youre a reasonable player but cautious sometimes timid that rules out a few things also its not hard to tell what part of the board youre focused on and there are clues when youre about to move you lean forward a little you clench your right hand yes its that obvious i dont like the idea of being sotransparent no one does she hesitated then pushed the pawn anyway he continued this is by way of a warning im sorry you see i know why youre here here in this room here with me youre here because you have the unusual perversion of falling in love with amiable monsters and thats what you mistook me for this is the kind of monster i am he was saying a genuine one and not amiable at all she should have answered with something polite and distancing to reassure him or she should have stood up and walked out because he was right she did neither she was feeling reckless and disoriented she obeyed a momentary impulse and stared back at him what about you you dont feel anything youre so ggoddamn aloof thats why you told me your life story that day in kensington market thats why you came back from your island she clenched her fists under the table tell the truth do you at least llike me he blinkedit wasnt the question he had been expecting maybe she thought that was a good sign the room was silent for a moment she could hear the ventilators humming i could lie john said slowly how would you know i wouldnt i would trust you ive lied to other people cheated other people stolen from them he looked away once i made love to a woman and left the bed wondering whether id committed an act of bestiality thats a stunningly arrogant question to ask yourself the terrible thing is i dont know the answer then answer my question he looked back at the board yes he said quietly i like you regarded her calmly youre thinking of moving your queens bishop damn his infuriating confidence no she said im not no obeying another impulse my knight theresee if i move him back into the first rank i uncover the rooks threat on your queen while youre getting her out of harms way the knight takes the black bishop she lifted the knight and thumped it down defiantly john stared at the board surprised him again susan thought finally he advanced his queen developing a threat toward her rook but the rook was defended his bishop was not she took the piece seven moves later he had cut through her pawn ranks and opened the white king to attack but his own defenses were a shambles his castled king was locked in by her rooks she was coordinating a strong final assault when he advanced his queen through an opening she had not noticed mate he said breathlessly but he was sweating he looked up at her and the look on his face now was the expression of a frightened child susan understood suddenly what this tepid victory implied oh she said she reached for his hand across the table it was feverishly warm john but then the door opened dr collingwood with dr kyriakides behind him collingwood cleared his throat were ready now maxim kyriakides watched through a glass dividing wall as a nurse installed john in the bonewhite ring of the pet scanner and administered an injection of glucose laced with fluorine a radioactive isotope the isotope would diffuse through the tissues of his body breaking down and releasing tiny bursts of radioactivity the video monitor over which collingwood was hovering like a protective parent would then translate this radiation into a picture of johns brain rather maxim thought of the activity of his brain not specifically the physical structure this was the superiority of the pet scanner over a cat maxim had never operated such a device he was more strictly a creature of the test tube the laboratory animal the microscope consequently he watched from a respectful distance as the images began to scroll up interesting collingwood said butterflies kyriakides said quietly hm or rorschach tests like the ones they gave us as undergraduates ink blots except these are red and blue in fact they were images of johns functioning brain and maxim was able to recognize the left and right occipitals the temporal lobes as the scanner read its sequential slices through the skull but the vivid colors meant nothing to him res externa and res cogita matter and the mind both those categories had lost some of their firmness since maxims college days res externa the notion of the solid body in physical space had receded into the conceptual fog of modern particle physics and res cogitawell we didnt really believe in it did we maxim had never been a radical reductionist like skinner but it had never occurred to him to doubt that every mental event had its precise physical parallel in the brain that a thought was simply a neuronal twitch of one kind or another today all that had changed neurological science was a wasteland of warring theories the brain was everything from a quantumevent amplifier to a chaotic equilibrium every step toward understanding the discovery of this or that chemical neurotransmitter seemed to unfold a chinese puzzle of increasingly complex questions some researchers had even concluded that the effort to understand the brain was necessarily doomedthat consciousness cannot comprehend consciousness any more than a box may contain itself this is really an extraordinary amount of activity collingwood said theres no question that what we have here is not a normal scan its all lit upits a bloody christmas tree i mean look at the occipitals ordinarily the only time youd find that much activity is in a subject whos hallucinating collingwood looked over his shoulder does he hallucinate occasionally but not just the occipitals its everything he must be burning glucose at a tremendous rate maxim said no sign of pathology hard to say we dont have a baseline do we i mean whats it supposed to look like however collingwood squinted at the monitor there are these shadowy patches scattered through the frontal cortex if you insist on a sign of pathology maybe that but i wouldnt stake a diagnosis on it he frowned what did your animal studies show in a mature chimp with induced cortical growth a decline over time periodic fever convulsions then accelerated deterioration of the induced cerebral tissue fatal often the decline was always permanent i dont suppose you ran pets i didnt have access to a machine you know what its been like funding had dried up decades ago and the work he had performed in the fifties was still tightly classified following the cortical growth into maturity and old age in a primate population had been his own ideaan impulse it would not only satisfy his curiosity but would be useful if the publication bans were ever lifted we did autopsies he told collingwood the symptoms were vaguely alzheimerslike but there was no specific loss of acetylcholine neurons no neurofibrillary plaques our suspicion was that the new cortical growth was sufficiently distinctin some waythat it eventually triggered an autoimmune response mortality depended on how essential the new growth had become to the organism collingwood shook his head all those years ago doing synthesis protocolsi never really imagined we would have to face this him i meana human being an enhanced adult human being are his symptoms severe intermittently advanced maxim shrugged well collingwood said we might be looking at tiny lesions peppered over the frontal lobes but theres so much activity max its just difficult to say he turned back to the video display maxim saw him stand suddenly erect as something caught his attention hold onwait a minute the attending nurse in the pet room picked up a microphone her voice was relayed to the speaker grille over collingwoods head doctor she said the patient is convulsingshall i pull him out maxim hurried to the window he could see john lying with his head in the mouth of the pet scanner as if he were being devoured by the machine his pale long limbs were trembling slightly collingwood looked at maxim maxim shook his head collingwood said hold him steady a few more minutes there was silence punctuated by the whirring of disc drives maxim looked over collingwoods shoulder at the video display the butterflywing image of johns brain was changing subtly but distinctly the bright colors began to fade in particular the hot band of the frontal lobes faded toward shadow watching maxim felt a cold hollowness at the pit of his stomach whats happening his glucose economy is suddenly down behaviorally you mean jesus i dont knowive never seen anything like it maxim said hes changing thats obvious i mean hes not john anymore i think hes becoming benjamin the secondary personality you mentioned i believe so this is radical collingwood said ive never seen this kind of bottomingout is this voluntary maxim began to shake his head then reconsidered it was a tremendous coincidence that benjamin should manifest just as john was in the pet scanner it was as if john wanted to show us this maxim thought johns way of cooperating with the test or benjamins not exactly voluntary he told collingwood not on the conscious level but john is a unique individual not voluntary but perhaps not an accident the patient is febrile and convulsive the nurse reported but he seems to be coming around doctor pull him out collingwood said he switched off the intercom and looked at maxim video images were still cycling through on the monitor behind him cool blue butterfly wings icy rorschach blots jesus christ max collingwood said tonelessly what did we do to this man just what kind of thing is he benjamin was back but benjamin had changed amelie was deeply pleased at first to be with him again she realized how much she had cherished the time before benjamin went awaybefore roch moved in and took his place having even a fraction of that life restored was like an answered prayer she worried that there might be some conflict with susan or dr kyriakides but there was not aside from the time benjamin spent in therapy sessions with kyriakides and a few medical tests amelie was allowed to have him to herself susan maintained a polite somber distance and after a few days she left the city on some mission for dr kyriakides in the beginning amelie was shy with him things had changed after all she knew so much more than she used to maybe too much she knew what dr kyriakides had told her that benjamin was an invention of johns a puppet creation that had somehow like pinocchio in the old disney movie come to life she accepted that this was true but she couldnt bring herself to believe it not really believe it certainly not when she was with benjamin who was after all a person a living human being more alive she thought privately than john shaw had ever been but this new knowledge saddened her and made her timid it meant that things were different now mostly she waited for benjamin to come to her he did one cold wednesday after a therapy session with kyriakides benjamin came to her room he touched her shoulder lets take a walk he said the snow had drifted into blue mounds and dunes across the lawn benjamin took her by the hand and led her down the front path to a lane that wound in from the main road along a column of snowy birches its pretty here he said amelie smiled he was always saying things like that simple things she nodded he walked a few more paces you know all about me now not all about she amended i wouldnt say that about john and me a little i guess about what i am she nodded he said i never lied to you you know but it was hard to explain john wasnt around much in those days amelie said a few nights at the doughnut shop i remember some of that now he looked at her somberly more of johns memories are spilling over getting mixed up with mine dr kyriakides thinks thats a good thing amelie didnt respond back then benjamin said i thought he might just fade away otherwiseif id known what was going to happeni would have told you more i guess i thought one day hed just be gone there would just be me its hard to understand amelie ventured how that must feel i remember a lot of johns childhood i think those memories were always there but theyre closer now i remember his time with the woodwards they were good people ordinary people john was never what they expectedbut how could he be in a way they were always my parents never his is it true what kyriakides said that john invented you that im a figment of his imagination benjamin smiled not altogether happily it doesnt feel that way how does it feel it feels like i live inside him it feels like ive always lived inside him you know what benjamin means its an old hebrew name it means son of the left hand in a way thats how it feels you are lefthanded amelie observed and johns righthanded i suppose its true he invented me but i think im more than that dr kyriakides agrees its like invoking a spirit john believes he made me up but maybe he just found me maybe id been there all along and he just opened the door and said all rightcome out amelie looked at benjamin with dismaynot because of what he said which seemed true and obvious but because of the way he said it benjamin had never talked about himself this way it wasnt like him hes different amelie thought hes changing she went to his bed that night cuddled with him under the blankets the furnace was roaring away in the basement but this old house was hard to heat she liked his warmth she liked being held they made love but when he was inside her and she was looking up at him at his big eyes strangely radiant in the dim light amelie felt suddenly afraid she could not explain it even to herself it was not just the fear that he might be john or partly john it was the depth of his eyes she was afraid of what she might see there something unfamiliar something she would not recognize something no one would ever recognize afterward she slept with her back to him he curled around her with his arm across her belly and her apprehension vanished into sleep really she had been living with two men all along john and benjamin the thing was that she had never admitted it to herself she would wake up some mornings with a stranger beside her she always knew at once when john was manifesting he looked different he had a different face but he manifested seldom and she had learned to anticipate his appearances even so inevitably there were times when she would wake up and find john in bed with her and then she would feel frightened and confused it was nothing she could ever explain to anyone it was not a topic that came up on donahuewhat to do when your lover is actually two people there was no one she had even tried to explain it toexcept susan who was a special case but susan when you came right down to it was a pampered california preppie who could not help condescending even when she tried to be amelies friend amelie forgave this it was predictable but she despaired of any real contact besides susan was obviously messed up over john so im alone amelie awoke with this bleak thought echoing in her head she turned and regarded the face of the man beside her it was benjamin absolutely no question but the uneasiness lingered she stood up pulled her nightgown on walked back down the silent corridor to the room dr kyriakides had assigned to her there was a little sanyo stereo theyd bought to replace the one roch had trashed amelie slid a doors tape into the player and plugged the headphones into the jack the tape was la woman she boosted the volume and flopped down onto the bed thinking of benjamin thinking of last summer when theyd been togetherbefore roch before susan hot days in that crummy little apartment hot nights thinking of wrapping her legs around him of his weight against her of his gentleness even when he was close to coming of the way he laid his hand alongside her cheek intimate as a kiss thinking of his eyes wondering where she would go because it was over wasnt it no way to crank back the seasons no way to make it be new again morrison performed his familiar death wail the sound seemed to come from inside her head she reached over to slide the volume up but her hand slipped and she hit the reject button instead the tape popped out the silence was eerie and sudden she went to the window and stood gazing out without music or thoughts as empty as she could make herself watching the snow fall dr kyriakides do you remember your childhood benjamin yes kyriakides but it wasnt your childhood benjamin it was a shadow i remember faces i remember moments is it so different for everyone else kyriakides you were another person then benjamin no that doesnt make sense i cant say i was john i was there all along with him in the shadows kyriakides and then you came into the light benjamin yes kyriakides when he created you benjamin if you say so kyriakides you were always yourselfis that how it seems benjamin i was always myself i came into the light i lived at home i went to school then i was back in the dark awhile and then i woke up and i was on the island johns island i knew what hed been doing and why he was there kyriakides and why you were there benjamin i knew that too pause you have to understand it was the end of his road hed gone as far as he could pause he wanted to die but he didnt want to kill himself kyriakides i cant imagine john saying that benjamin oh he would never say it especially not to you he doesnt trust you hes never forgiven you kyriakides for making him what he is benjamin for leaving him alone kyriakides but surelyits possible now that he is dying and yet he fights it benjamin the funny thing is that hes changed his mind he thinks maybe there is a reason to go on living kyriakides can you tell me that reason benjamin no kyriakides he doesnt want you to benjamin right kyriakides you know that about him benjamin i know a lot of things about him kyriakides have you always known these things benjamin known them maybe never thought about them much never used to do this much thinking kyriakides is that because of the way youre changing benjamin could be another pause hes all through me now you know were sort of mixed together there used to be a kind of wall but thats breaking down kyriakides well i think thats good benjamin i think that needs to happen benjamin well it isnt easy for him hes fighting it kyriakides thats unfortunate why is he fighting it benjamin the same reason he wanted to die back on the island because he hates me didnt you know that he hates all of us a longer pause almost all benjamin came into the room while amelie was packing amelie ignored himjust went on emptying the big chest of drawers into her ragged salvation army suitcase pretending he wasnt there after a time watching her he said where will you go it was a very benjamin thing to say straight to the point no bullshit kind of littleboy innocent it reminded her of what she had loved about him and what she still loved and that was painful she winced she looked up at him i dont know maybe back to montreal it doesnt matter he said i wish you wouldnt go she turned to the window the snow was still falling fucking horrible winter that was the thing about winter in this city it was likely to do any fucking thing if you were ready for snow you got rain if you were ready for rain you got ice i thought you understood youre leaving me she turned to him so you left me no john left you but you were talking about leaving even before that and when you finally called you called susan he shrugged as if to say yes thats so she said things had already started to change hadnt they even then you knew we couldnt stay together you knew what was happening he did not answer which was answer enough amelie nodded yeahyou knew i know a lot of things i dont want to know a lot of it is john theres more john now than there used to be his frown was huge i wish you would stay a while longer why because its cold out because you dont have anywhere to go that helpless look because theres nothing anyone can do about this about whats happening to me amelie narrowed her eyes how do you know john knows kyriakides was lying all along he lied to susan about it but john can tell kyriakides wanted to do the tests and maybe he thought there was a chance that something would happen something miraculous but theres nothing he knows it john knows it thats not why theyre here why then kyriakides is here to finish his experiment and because he feels guilty john is herewell its an experiment of his own but for me i think its only the end im scared of that goddammit benjamin she held out her arms for him he put his head against her shoulder she was blinking away tears but who was she sorry for herself or him maybe both of us amelie thought two fuckedup losers she just felt so sad nothing is the way it used to be he said i love you ill stay a while longer amelie said itll be okay not believing either of these things after some time had passed he helped her unpack again he was about to leave the room when he reached into his back pocket and said almost forgotthis came for you today it was a thick manila envelope bearing the return address of the goodtime grill on yonge street he held it out amelie took it from him frowning after the humiliation involving his sister roch had checked himself in at the family practice clinic at toronto general hospital a few days later and he might have run into amelie while she was in town for johns pet scan but he wasnt looking for amelieat least not yet his chest was a mass of bruises where the car door had slammed into it the clinic sent him up for xrays but there was no evidence of any significant fracture to the ribs which was good it meant he wouldnt have to be taped hurt like shit all the same though the doctor a woman about as tall as rochs collarbone asked whether hed been in a fight he said a fight with a fucking honda in return she flashed him a skeptical condescending look which burned but roch kept carefully silent this was not the place or the time he was getting older developing an instinct for these thingswhen to hold his tongue and when to act he merely stared into the female doctors wide green eyes until she frowned and looked away roch smiled to himself she cleared her throat warm baths might help with that bruising maybe tylenol for the pain youll be fine in a couple of weeks if you stay away from hondas it wasnt a joke what about the honda it wasnt a joke no i guess it wasnt she bowed her head and made a notation in his file folder is there anything else roch stood up and left the office the landlady had wanted to kick him out of amelies apartment but she backed off when he paid two months rent in cash and promised to clean the place up he told her he was working as a clerk for the provincial government which was a lie of course hed picked up the rent money doing day labor his life savings haha the fucking check had taken two weeks to clear or else hed have spent it by now but it was important to have a place to sleep though he hated being alone it was getting harder all the time at night especially with amelie gone he didnt have to sleep on the sofa but the bedroom was like a big box with its single square sootdarkened window he would lie awake in this cold dark room and feel the city pressing in at him the city made a noise as familiar as his own heartbeat but more disturbing sirens motors tires gritting down cold night streets this noise was amplified by the winter air and beat against rochs eardrums until he could not distinguish it from the singing of the radiators or the rush of his own blood he resented the sound it was the sound of everything he could not have pleasure companionship confidence he couldnt walk those streets except as an outcast he had learned that lesson when he was very young nowadays he did not attract much immediate attention he was older and less physically grotesque he worked out in the gym he was not the puddingy froglike thing he had been as a child but he was not one of those ordinary people either he could not move among these handsome men and confident smiling women except as an impostor he might have been a creature from outer space disguised as human he knew that he was alone in the dark and his ribs hurt and he had been humiliated and he was angry he thought about getting drunk but oddly the impulse wasnt really there when he thought about drinking he pictured his father coming home on winter nights like this screaming out curses in peasant french and beating roch with his stubby fists big mans hands with dark hair and callused knuckles roch remembered those hands lying in bed he looked at his own righthand fista shadow in the dim light it was his best friend his lover the instrument of justice his anger was like a cold uncomfortable stone that had lodged in his chest and he understood then why he didnt want to get drunk this was a pressure that drinking would not have relieved he needed all his energy for planning because he was going to fucking do something about this thing with amelie roch understood revenge in intricate detail the rules were basic when you were humiliated you had to eat itor else enforce a punishment and he knew all about punishment punishment was like a big simple machine it was easy to operate once you got it going and terribly difficult to stop and all it took to work that machine was some careful planning and he was good at that it was the only kind of abstract thinking roch enjoyed it shut out the night sounds of the city he could spend hours working out the details and the necessary steps the payoff being some act it was not yet specific some final and irretrievable moment of equalization an orgasm of justice this new purpose seemed to seize him all at once utterly he was not smart but he had a goal and he was methodical and determined and perhaps best of all he knew a secret he thought of all those people out there in the lively darkness of the city thought about how they were bound to one another with sticky ropes of loyalty love duty guilthow these impediments constrained them and restricted their movement and roch smiled in the dark because here was his deepest and most profound knowledge about himself that he was not bound by any of these things he could do things that ordinary people could not even imagine he was utterly alone and therefore he was utterly free the first step was to locate amelie he had never been to the restaurant where she used to work the goodtime grill mainly because her employment there had always rankled him it was scutwork and she deserved it but it had given her an independence from him that roch resented deeply this was back when they were on the street when she was shaving her hair and wearing that old leather jacket with the sleeves down over her hands so that only her fingers poked out how whorish she had looked and how she resented it when he suggested the logical and obvious way of bringing in some money as if she liked sleeping in abandoned buildings for christs sake he savored for a moment the memory of her in that jacket and how the cars would cruise by and sometimes stop and men would call her over and how she would come back sometimes with a little money and that expression on her face which he could not decipherof some deep secret grief but then she got the restaurant job and the crappy st jamestown apartment and roch got involved with some guys boosting cars out in the suburbs and he forgot about her for a while that was the basic mistake hed madeletting her get away from him so hed never been inside this particular restaurant but maybe that was a good thing nobody here would know him he stood a second on the yonge street sidewalk staring up at the goodtime sign cold noon sun on cheap faded plastic picture windows with bead curtains and a menu taped up souvlaki fish chips burger platter roch pushed his way through the door he took a table by the window this was the hard part he thought anything involving deception was difficult for him he could not predict what people would say and the thing she said often provoked strange hostile reactions but there was no need to hurry this was only the first the most basic step one of the waitresses brought him water she was a tiny smallbreasted woman who looked vaguely oriental according to the tag on her uniform her name was tracy in a voice so timorous he barely made out the words she asked him if he was ready to order he asked for the burger plate and a beer when she came back with the food he said tracyis that your name she ducked her head which roch took for a nod he said tracy listen is amelie around ohamelie ohshe doesnt work here anymore im sorry i didnt know that are you one of her regulars cause i dont recognize you but ive only been here since summer im her brother roch said he watched her face carefully she narrowed her eyes and tensed up a little obviously this information meant something to her amelie had been talking loudmouthed bitch but roch felt a tingle of excitement oh her brother okay tracy said and turned away roch let her go slowly now he instructed himself he forced himself to eat even though he wasnt hungry the food was tasteless it had the texture of styrofoam when tracy came back with his coffee roch smiled at her you a friend of amelies i cant talk she said her voice sounded like it had died in her throat i have other tables i know i havent been on good terms with her maybe she mentioned that the thing is shes gone off and i dont know where to find her tracy only stared at him the carafe somewhat slack in her hands look im not trying to hassle her is that the problem you dont have to tell me where she is the thing is that i have some of her stuff mail and things like that she didnt leave a forwarding address i just want to know whether if i gave you some of this stuff you could maybe get it to her there was a long delicate silence i dont know tracy said finally but roch had to struggle to contain his excitement because this was all the confirmation he needed tracy knew how to find amelie otherwise she would have said no or im sorry but he was improvising now he didnt really have a plan only the glimmer of a possibilityan idea beginning to take shape at the back of his head look he said if i packaged up some of this stuff and left it with youwould that be all right and bring it here to the restaurant tracy said because i cant give out my address or anything christ roch thought she thinks im after her it was laughable he imagined pinning down this goggleeyed bitch and raping her it was a joke but some of the thought must have been reflected in his eyes or his expression because she took a sudden startled step backward he restored his smile and aimed it at tracy again sure i can bring the stuff here well maybe i dont know tracy said and put down the check and scurried away roch left his money and a generous tip and went out into the street he walked aimlessly for a while breathing frost into the cold air really this was turning out terrifically well but he still had a lot of thinking to do some days passed while he pondered the problem of extracting amelies whereabouts from tracy the waitress roch approached the problem by stocking up on food mainly tv dinners and holing up in the apartment he kept the television turned on and insulated the windows with strips of hardwarestore foam so that the apartment absorbed as much heat as possible from the buildings big laboring oil furnace the combination of the dry heat and the staticky noise of the tv helped him think ideas came to him in harsh glaring staccato like commercials he thought about using force to extract the information from tracy follow her home one of these nights beat it out of her choke it out of her whatever she was scared of him already it wouldnt be hard but it would be messy and it might get him in trouble even worseunless he could frighten her into silenceshe might be able to warn amelie dangerous but how else he was frustrated thinking about it he did a set of pushups ate a frozen dinner and watched a movie of the week on tv nothing he went to bed inspiration came with the morning mail he had begun collecting amelies mail what there was of it in case he needed it to flesh out the story hed told at the goodtime the problem was that his sister had been getting junk mail and subscription ads and dunning letters from the credit department of a downtown department store but not much elsenot the sort of thing anyone would go out of his way to pass on today however there was an envelope with an illegible return address and a montreal postmark and roch sensing its importance sat down to think before he tried to open it amelies name and address were written in an arthritic scrawl across the front think he instructed himself who did she know in montreal somebody from school but amelie hadnt been that tight with friends anyway it looked like an old womans writing jesus roch said out loud mama he held the letter in his hand as if it were a religious relic the letter was important it was the key roch was suddenly intuitively certain of that he could use this letter to pry amelie out of her hiding place somehow but he had to be cautious he bad to make plans he deliberately set aside the letter and watched tv for a while he couldnt concentrate of course morning game shows flickered and vanished the news came on he forced his eyes to focus on the screen it was an exercise in discipline the question occurred to him was it really possible to steam open a letter he had heard about steaming open mail but he had no idea how to go about it and of course he couldnt risk destroying the letter itself he went to the kitchen and filled the kettle put it on the stove to boil while he waited he went through the mail hed been collecting and selected three pieces a bookclub flyer a phone bill and a sweepstakes ad all three were addressed to amelie all three were sealed he cradled them in his hand thinking hard the kettle whistled as it came up to steam it was a hard shrill whistle but roch didnt mind he liked the sound he took the bookclub flyer and grasped it in a pair of kitchen tongs then held it so that the gummed flap took the brunt of the steam he held it there while thirty seconds ticked off on his wristwatch he realized as soon as he pulled it away that this had been a mistake the envelope was a sodden mass he waved it in the air to cool it and then tried the flap the glue had been steamed away sure enough but the paper was drenched he tried again with the phone bill this time he passed the envelope quickly through the steam a little farther from the spout he managed not to damage the paper but the glue was still firm after a second pass he was able to pry up an edge without tearing anything a third pass and the envelope peeled open in his hand it was damp but would probably dry to its original condition he practiced again on the sweepstakes flyer and did a little better this time he figured he had the hang of it now the letter from montreal he carried it carefully into the kitchen and set it on the counter he dried the tongs and then grasped the envelope the kettle was still screaming he turned to center it on the burner and thendisasterthe montreal letter slipped through the pincerend of the tongs toward a sink full of dirty dishwater shit roch screamed he clenched the tongs convulsively and managed to catch a corner of the envelope it dangled over the water until he could snatch it away with his free hand his heart was beating a mile a minute he forced himself to stand still calm down the kettle continued to shriek inches from his ear he took a deep breath and started again the second time was lucky it worked like a charm he worried out the letter from the envelope unfolded it and sat down to read the kettle dried up and fell silent roch stood up to turn the heat off but too late the cheap aluminum was red hot and brittle he threw the kettle in the sink where it hissed and generated a white astringentsmelling cloud the kitchen was already tropical the whole apartment was as humid as a hothouse he imagined spores taking root in the old wallpaper fungus breaking out in the dark comers of these narrow rooms he was troubled by this thought but only briefly he sat down and concentrated on the letter he had important things to do the letter was typewritten pecked out on an ancient faded ribbon roch had a hard time reconciling the text with his memories of his mother mama was a big woman who had often been drunk and sometimes aggressive one time hed seen her get into a fight with a shoe clerk at ogilvysshe tore a flap of skin off the guys cheek whereas this letter was a whining pathetic document mainly about the lousy neighborhood she was forced to live in and how long it had been since amelie wrote back screw the old bitch roch thought she never wrote tome but the bulk of his plan was already beginning to take its final shape it was a grand glowing edifice and he was its architect a brace here a capstone there he smiled and set the letter aside in the afternoon he rode a bus down to the salvation army thrift shop and spent ten dollars on a clappedout underwood noiseless typewriter he took it home and discovered that the ribbon wouldnt advance but that he could produce legible copy if he cranked the spool by hand every line or two he typed the quick brown fox and compared this with the letter from mama the specimen was similar but far from identical still roch thought who notices these things he doubted that amelie would have an older letter to compare it with or that she would bother if she did as long as the counterfeit seemed authentic he inserted a piece of plain white bond into the underwood and sat before it sweating he could not think of a way to begin then realized that he could copy mamas letter as written with a few critical amendments of his own he smiled at the ingenuity of this and began pecking the cap came off the e key before he was finished but he managed to wangle it back on without too much mess he typed the penultimate paragraph from the original then dropped the you never write complaints and added because i want to see you i have bought bus tickets to toronto and will be arriving saturday feb hope you can meet me at the bus station as i do not know how to find your apartment exactly i would call you but unfortunately the phone has been take out again by those bastards at the phone co roch sat back and smiled at this especially the bit about the telephone which not only solved a potential problem but sounded a lot like mama he typed your loving mother and duplicated her signature with a blue bic pen masterpiece the only remaining problem was resealing the envelope amelie had left a jar of mucilage in the kitchen drawer and roch discovered that a very thin layer of this would pass for the original glue he sealed the envelope and set it aside good enough for today he turned on the tv and watched wheel of fortune content with the state of the world on his way back to the goodtime grill the next morning a troubling thought occurred to him what if amelie didnt take the bait there was no love lost between those two after all roch did not hate either of his parentsexcept his father sporadically hating them was a waste of time but he knew that amelie harbored deeper feelings mostly negative amelie sometimes talked about mama sympathetically but with her fists clenched and her nails digging into her palms maybe she wouldnt show up at the bus depot or maybeanother new thoughtshe was too far away maybe shed left the city she might be in fucking timbuktu although roch suspected not it wasnt her style but who knew anything was possible no he thought better not to borrow trouble if the letter arrangement fell through hed try something else he had the connection through tracy that was secure and that was enough for now tracy recognized him when he sat down at the table by the window he saw her say something to the manager who looked impatient and sent her scooting over with a glass of water and the order pad roch smiled his biggest smile and ordered lunch when she came back with the food he reached into his jacket pocket very casually and brought out a wad of mail including the spiked envelope i remembered to bring these he said thought maybe youd want to pass em on tracy took the envelopes but held them at a distance as if they might be radioactive oh she said well okay ill see what i can do okay if its convenient roch said oh tracy said one more thing one more small item to take care of and then hed be ready everything would be in place that night he walked down wellesley to the corner where tony morriseau the drug dealer was hanging out roch didnt know tony too well roch didnt believe in doing drugs drugs fucked up your mind he had admittedly sometimes scored a little of this or that from tony when the inclination took him or he wanted to impress somebody but he was not a regular customer tony stood on the snowy streetcorner done up in a khaki green parka with a big hood his breath steaming out in clouds he regarded roch from this sheltered space with an expression roch could not decipher tony seemed more paranoid these days roch had observed tony rubbed his hands together and said its fucking cold so tell me what you want something serious roch said speak english tony said roch mimed the act of holding a hypodermic needle against his arm and pressing the plunger tony looked ill christ he said dont do that all right you dont know whos looking he seemed to withdraw into the depths of the parka i dont deal with that you know where to get it roch said matter of fact i dont if you cant sell it to me tell me who can i dont like your tone of voice tony said i dont have to do you any favors christ roch stood up straight and looked down at tony who was at least a head shorter tone of voice tony cringed then tony looked at his watch oh well from now on you dont come to me for this go to the source okay its really not my territory roch nodded they walked down the street to tonys cara battered buick hey tony roch said what happened to the famous corvette tony scowled and shook his head you dont want to know it was a cool southern california winter day but susan was comfortable with a sweater wrapped around her she was able to stand for a long time on the exposed sunny hillside where her father was buried she had been given a weeklong leave of absence from the big house north of toronto and she wasnt sure whether to resent this or not dr kyriakides had practically hustled her onto the airplane claimed that the trip would be good for her that she had driven herself to the point of nervous exhaustionthat benjamin would probably be around for a while longer and there was nothing helpful she could do well need you more later he said during the crisis he meant when johns neurological breakdown reached its apex but no one could say for sure when that crisis would come or what the final resolution might be therefore susan thought it was a terrible risk to be away from him but dr kyriakides had been persuasive and it was true that she owed her mother a visit susan had promised at the funeral that she would be home every christmas a promise shed broken this year so she had spent five days in this quiet suburb driving to the malls with her sixtyfiveyearold mother anddodging questions about her work she said she was doing an exchange project with the university of toronto to explain her canadian address fluid transfer in mitochondria too complex to explain her mother nodded dubiously and todaythe last day of susans visitthey had come here to this grave where susan had stood frowning for the last fortyfive minutes poised on the brink of a mystery she was distressed to discover that she could not summon up a concrete image of her father she tried and failed she could remember only the things she associated with himhis clothes the mirror polish on his shoes the brown sample cases he had carried to work the rest was either hopelessly vague or worse deathbed images his emaciated body and hollow eyes she remembered the sound of his voice the soothing rumble of it but that was a childhood memory his laryngeal cancer had ended all that of course but it seemed to susan that he had fallen mute years before the operation a functional silence in which anything meaningful must never be pronounced his way of protecting her from the divorce from his own fears from adulthood she was trying hard not to hate him for it how awful that sounded but it was true she had never forgiven him for his silence for his cancer for his callous descent into the grave it was a monumentally selfish thought a childish thought but maybe that was the heart of the matter she could never come to this place except as a child suspended in time by his withdrawal and his death she would never be his grownup daughter she couldnt say any of the things she needed to say because he couldnt listen she was startled by the touch of her mothers hand on her shoulder come on susan weve been here long enough have we susan climbed into the car dutifully a child thinking maybe not maybe if she stayed long enough the right words would come to her talking to herself she would talk to daddy and daddy would answer his buried words would rise up from the ground and hover in the cool sunlit air but she couldnt stay forever and so the car carried her down the hillside in the long light of the afternoon away from the stubbornly silent ground her flight out of los angeles left an hour and forty minutes late which meant she missed her connection at ohare the next available seat to toronto was on a redeye flight she had an afternoon and evening to kill in chicago she phoned toronto with this news and thenon an impulserented a car for the day she did not want to stray too far from the airport susan distrusted official scheduling and usually preferred to lurk near the departure gates but she knew her way around this city and she recalled that johns old neighborhood the neighborhood where he had grown up with the woodwards was only a short drive from the airport winter hadnt affected the city too severely there was a glaze of snow along the highway embankments but the air was clear with faint trails of wintery cirrus clouds running down to a powder blue horizon but it was cold the kind of cold that made the tires crackle against the blacktop she had written down johns old address in her notebook the neighborhood was a levittown a postwar bungalow suburb treeless and bleak in the winter light she located the streeta culdesacand then the house a pastel pink box indistinguishable from any of these others the woodwards was printed on the mailbox a sign posted on the front lawn said for sale and a smaller one beside it announced a contents salesaturday february today susan allowed the car to drift to a stop she didnt think she would have the courage but she did she got out of the car and walked up the driveway and knocked on the door shivering she was about to turn away when the door opened a crack and a greyhaired chunky man peered out mr woodward yes she took a breath i uhi saw the sign sale ended at four oclock he said swinging the door wider but you might as well come in hardly anybody else showed up susan stepped inside the house had obviously been stripped down for moving there were blank spaces where there should have been furniture and curtain rods empty over the windows it seemed to susan that james woodward had been similarly stripped down he was not as big as she had pictured him not nearly as imposing he was a small barrelchested man with a fringe of grey hair and big callused hands he was friendly but distant and susan was careful to pretend an interest in this item or that as he conducted her in and out of these small rooms what she really wanted was to find some ghost of john or even benjamin lingering here but there was nothing like that only these mute empty spaces coming down the stairs she said is your wife home he shook his head she died thats why im moving i tried looking after this place for a while but its too big for one person he opened the basement door theres a few things still stored down hereif you think its worth the look please susan said this was where his workshop had been though most of the tools had been carried away not much lefta battered workbench with curls of pine and cedar still nesting under it an ancient pa amplifier with its tubes pulled in one shadowy corner an acoustic guitar susan went to it immediately oh that woodward said you dont want that maybe i do susan said you know i sold some guitars earlier i used to make em by hand like a hobby i guess you could say but that onesee the truss rods off true you know guitars well it means itll go off tune and be hard to fix the actions a little too high off the frets too its a bad instrument how much do you want for it say fifty bucks for the materials if youre serious you play no susan said but i have a friend who does she took the money out of her purse james woodward accepted the payment susan picked up the guitar it was heavier than she expected the strings rang faintly under her fingers i almost hate to sell the damn thing woodward said he looked past susan past these walls its funny he said its the broken things that stay on your mind broken bent halfmade or badmade you take them to the grave with you she climbed off the plane in toronto weary and dazed collected her suitcase and the guitar from the baggage carousel dr kyriakides was waiting in the crowded space beyond the customs checkpoint she understood by his hollow smile that something was wrong she followed him up to the carpark and loaded her baggage into the trunk of the honda daunted by his silence john is back he said finally thats good susan responded dr kyriakides opened the car door for her ever the european gentleman but amelie is missing he said it was a long drive back to the house a snowstorm had settled in from the west and wasnt leaving the car radio warned people to stay off the roads susan was grateful that dr kyriakides had been able to maneuver the honda all the way to the airport she was even more grateful that she was able to drive it back visibility had closed in and the road was blanked out north of the city the headlights probed into a swirling wilderness for the time she was too preoccupied with driving to press for details about amelie the weather grew steadily worse but the tires were good and there wasnt much traffic and they were back at the house before long kyriakides brushed the snow from the car while susan headed for the kitchen and a hot cup of coffee john was there waiting for her it was johnno doubt about it he looked up as she came through the door his expression was somber and utterly focused i need to do two things he said first i need to talk to you there are a lot of things i want to say while i still can susan nodded solemnly she was too tired to be shocked by this sudden volley she simply accepted it second he said i mean to find amelie susan slept for five dreamless hours between three and eight oclock in the morning she woke to find the window of her room laced with frost she stood for a moment touching the icy surface of the glass with one finger and wondering at the intensity of the cold outside the world was a blurred greywhite wilderness the snow had obscured the driveway the highway was empty save for a plough inching southward under its strange blue safety light the sky was dark and the snow was falling steadily she dressed in the darkness of her room she carried her portable sony tape recorder down the hall to johns door raised her hand to knockand then paused john was playing the guitar she had given him the instrument last night had explained about the layover in chicago and the sale at the woodward house he had taken the instrument wordlessly his expression unreadable the music came softly through the closed door he was good susan thought she didnt recognize the piecesomething baroque not passionate music but subtle a sad melody elaborated into a cathedral of notes she waited until the last arpeggio had faded away he put down the guitar when she came through the door looked questioningly at the tape recorder its for me she said i dont trust myself to remember he nodded she felt his sense of urgency it was like something physical a third presence in the room because of his impending neurological crisis susan thought his changeor because of amelie or both hes changed hes different but she put the thought aside for now sit down john said she plugged a cassette into the recorder and switched it on all that morning he talked about his childhood they skipped breakfast twice susan paused to change tapes she was afraid she would miss something it was a fear john didnt share obviously the words poured out of him like water from a broken jug a cataract of words she understood what he was doing he had explained it to her last night these were things he had never said small but vital fragments of his life and he was afraid they would slip away uncommunicated she was not expected to learn these things verbatim or play them back to himthe tape recorder was superfluous it was the telling that mattered nothing is permanent john said everything is volatile you me the worldeverything but its like throwing a stone into a pool of water the stone disappears but the ripples linger awhile she was that pool he was the stone he talked about his mother her name was marga novak and she was working through her apprenticeship at a hairdressing salon in downtown chicago when she answered a classified ad in the back pages of the tribune pregnant single women wanted for privately funded medical study she had recently become pregnant by a thirtyfiveyearold shingle and siding salesman who had promised to many her but who left town or was relocated a couple of weeks after she announced the results of the pregnancy test for marga answering the trib ad was a last resort but the salon was sure to fire her when she started to show and she needed some kind of income she passed two screening interviews and was introduced to dr kyriakides who explained that the treatmentto prevent low birthweight and give the child a healthy startmight involve some discomfort in connection with the intrauterine injections but would be perfectly safe for both mother and child moreover the followup study would include a fully paid private educational program for the baby and ongoing medical care for both of them in the meantime all expenses would be taken care of and housing would be arranged she agreed of course was there a choice the injections were uncomfortable but the delivery was easy even allowing for the infants exaggerated cranial size mother and child were installed in a twobedroom town house near the university district and johns schooling began almost immediately how do you know all this susan asked i broke into maxs office one night came in from the woodwards house in the suburbs i was twelve years old he kept his files and his notes in a little vault behind his desk id seen it there a few years before id seen him open it after all that time you remembered the combination john nodded and continued margas parents were czechs who had come to america before the war she hadnt spoken to her mother or father for fifteen years she didnt know whether they were still alive this baby was in effect her only family marga understood soon enough that john was a special child even the name johnshe hadnt chosen it herself it had been dr kyriakides suggestion the doctor was polite but firm and marga acquiesced because she was afraid of offending him he paid all the bills after all in a very real sense he owned her she hardly saw the baby she tried to be a responsible mother at least at first but there were research people always coming to take the child away he slept in a crib in margas room most nights they had that time together but the doctors must have been doing something to him she thoughtsomething she didnt understand he was a strange child he began talking too soonat only a few months but more than that she sensed it every time she picked him up every time she put him to her breast there was a discomfort she once described to dr kyriakides as something like the sound of a piano string gone off tune dissonance kyriakides supplied and the babys eyes were too observant it wasnt like touching a baby she said it was like touching a dwarf after that confession she saw even less of john marga pretended that this made her unhappy but really it didnt it was nice having some time to herself for a change i remember max more clearly than i remember marga marga is just a face small eyes big body big shapeless dresses she wore a perfume that smelled like linden flowers overpowering max was different then he had more hair a heavy joe stalin moustache and rimless glasses it was frightening i trusted him of course he was the central force the operating engine it was obvious that everything revolved around him everybody followed his orders he taught me more than anyone else i had plenty of professional tutors but it was max who would really talk to me if i asked a question he took it seriously child questions you know how high is the sky and what comes after it but he understood that i didnt want trivial answers i wanted the true answers and there was the way he looked at me you have to understand how the others treated me the other research staff even marga i would sit at a little table and they would run a stanfordbinet or a thematic aperception and after a while they would start to register their disbeliefor their fear or their resentment i was strange anomalous different i was scary i learned to recognize iti thought of it as the look after i was a year old marga would never touch me never wanted to pick me up and when she did the look but max was different max knew what i was took pride in me that meant a lot i decided he was my real father that marga was only some kind of hired nurse eventually of course they took me away from marga altogether and then max was my father or the nearest thing i trusted him that was a mistake susan said why did they take you away from marga she came home from the safeway one morning and found me taking apart the radio i was doing a pretty good job of it i had it sorted by component sizequarterwatt resistors on the left power supply on the right desoldered the parts with a needle from her sewing kiti heated it over a candle burned myself a couple of times but i was beginning to make sense of it marga was angry marga was frightened i think and angry and she was wearing the lookwhich is really a kind of horror changeling in the crib worm in the cornmeal she punished you susan guessed she turned on the leftfront burner on the hotpoint and held my hand over it seconddegree burns i healed up pretty fast but they took me away from heror vice versa it wasnt all bad john explained there was more luxury than torture he was pampered really and in some ways it was an ordinary childhood he had toys to play with he remembered the extraordinary vividness of colors and sensations the radiant blue luster of a crib toy the pale intricate pastels of a sunfaded beachball he remembered the letters etched on glass storefronts like black cuneiform chickentracks max called them pleasing but mysterious he remembered the day he learned to readacquiring the phonetics and the approximations of written english puzzling out a newspaper headline to himself he remembered riding into town on some errand with dr kyriakides and his amazement that the angular marks on signs and windows had resolved suddenly into wordsa p used books woolworthsthis pleasure mixed with frustration because having recognized the words he could no longer see the lovely strange chickentracks the marks had turned into words and words they stubbornly remained the abstraction had displaced the concrete story of his life one by one category by category the objects of his perception faded into language a tree became tree tree became a noun categorical hierarchies exploded around him somehow more organic than the organic things they named for instance the oak in front of margas town house even when he tried to focus exclusively on the texture of its bark or the color of its leaves he triggered a network of associative ideasgymnosperm and angiosperm xylem and cambium seed and fruitthat displaced the thing itself he became afraid that his visionthat the world itselfmight dissolve into a manic crystalgrowth of pattern and symbol its an inevitable process max told him its good nothing is lost john wondered whether this was true he began to understand the way in which he was different though no one would really explain it and even dr kyriakides dodged the subject he learned how to slip into the research units snail medical library when his keepers werent looking usually during lunch hours or bathroom breaks the neurological tomes that resided there were too advanced for him but he could divine a little of their subject the brain the mind intelligence on his fifth birthday he asked dr kyriakides did you make me the way i am after a hesitation and a frown max admitted it yes then youre my father i suppose in a way but marga wouldnt understand if you told her i wont tell her then john said it didnt matter he understood outside this small room in toronto the snow continued to fall susan wondered whether amelie could see the snow whether amelie was coldwherever she was the tape recorder popped up a cassette susan inserted a new one i trusted max until he farmed me out to the woodwards john said even thenat firsti gave him the benefit of the doubt the explanation was plain enough max had explained meticulously the research was funded by the government and now the funding had been revoked the legality of it was questionable and people were afraid of the truth getting out john would have to be careful about what he told the woodwards also we wont be able to see each other for a while i hope you understand john didnt answer max had checked the family out and they were decent enough people an older couple childless referred through a contact in an adoption agency obviously they dont know what you are you may have to conceal your nature do you understand youll have to become at least passably normalfor everyones sake john listened politely watching max across the barrier of his polished oak desk in this indifferent room his booklined office you have to do what the government tells you he said to max john was five years old yes i do in this case but youre a communist john said max rose slightly in his chair what do you mean who told you that nobody told me i watch you when people talk about politics i watched you when kennedy came on tv and talked about castro your face your eyes max laughed john was pleased even at this terrible moment the hour of his exile he was able to make max happy i should never mistake you for a child max said but i always do no im not a communist i was at one time during the war i gave it up when i came to this country my uncle died fighting for veloukhiotis and it was pointlesscompletely futile now we have the generals is there any sense in that i dont believe in revolution any more but you believe in the rest of it john pressed marxism leninism he had read the entry under communism in the columbia encyclopedia and these questions had been on his mind not even that max said more soberly i gave it all up you stopped believing in marxism do you really want to know john nodded i stopped believing in the people im an apostate from that central faith marx believed that mankind was perfectible through economics but its a childish idea people talk about stalinism but stalinism is only fascism with a different accent and fascism is simply the politics of the monkey cage the failure is herehe thumped his chestin the mechanism of the cells in our ontogeny if you want to perfect mankind thats where you begin but you still believe in the perfectibility of mankind wouldnt you rather talk about the woodwards your future i want to know john said whether i believe in the perfectibility of mankind i will tell you this human beings are cowards and thieves and torturers that i believe and yes i believe the species can be improved why not the only alternative is despair but theres a contradiction here john wanted to say how could you want to improve a thing when you despised it so entirely to begin with what could you build out of that contemptespecially if the contempt encompasses your own being but he didnt ask max was going on about the woodwards about schooldont trust anyone he said anyone might be your enemy it was a sweeping statement including you john wondered should i mistrust you too is that what this is all about but it was not a question he could bring himself to ask he was not a child max was right but neither was he old enough to endure the possibility that he might be fundamentally alone in the world life with the woodwards then began as a deception a concealment not always successful but at least he understood the rules of the game for years john chose to believe that max would eventually come and get him even if they couldnt be together max was still his truest father max cared about him he banked this belief in the most private recesses of his mind he never allowed the flame to flicker but max did not come and on his twelfth birthday after a perfunctory celebration with the woodwards john began to admit to himself that max might never come so he broke a promise he went looking for max it was spring and he rode a bus into the city through thawing snowpatches and muddy lots he had packed a bag lunch solemnly he ate it sitting on a transit bench outside margas old house a couple of blocks from the university did he want to see marga he wasnt sure but no one entered or left the house the shutters were closed and the siding had been painted eggshell blue maybe marga had moved away he stood and walked through the raw spring air to the research complex to maxs office there he opened the door and walked in max looked up maybe expecting to see an undergraduate frowning when he recognized john max was older than john remembered him fashionably shaggier he had grown his sideburns long his eyes widened and then narrowed you shouldnt have come here its good to see you too dont be flippant i could lose my tenure people in this building have long memories he frowned at his watch meet me in the parking lot i have a car therea black ford john left the building and waited twenty minutes in the pallid sunlight shivering on the curb beside the automobile then max came striding out and opened the passenger door for him john climbed aboard i wanted to see you john said i wanted to talk its dangerous for both of us i understand you dont want to lose your job i dont want to lose my job and i presume you dont want to be brought to the attention of any powerful interests were privileged to be an inactive file in someones cabinet i would like to keep it that way i thought you might try to see me at least try max compressed his lips ive driven past the woodwards house from time to time once i saw you walking to school i have a contact at the board of education hes been forwarding your records but we havent talked were not allowed to talk revolutionary john mocked you know im not but youre brave enough to bend your ethics from time to time for instance a little genetic manipulation neurological not genetic your genes are perfectly ordinary im afraid do you resent itbeing what you are john shrugged max said i rescued you from mediocrity you rescued me from the human race it amounts to the same thing jesus max how pathetically unimaginative his rage took him by surprise it was a sudden huge pressure in his chest he said im more than you ever dreamed of i could kill us both you know its been seven years things have changed if i wanted you to youd drive right off the retaining wall of this freeway you dont believe it but just think max think how nice it would be like flying flying out into the void a little gas a little twist of the wheel like flying max the words had spilled out of him he stopped aware of the sweat beading on maxs brow the way his fingers trembled on the wheel my god he thought its true i could do that he felt suddenly cold you can drop me at the off ramp he said max pulled up obediently near a bus stop wordless and wideeyed john climbed out without saying goodbye he watched as the black ford shuddered away from the curb and merged uncertainly with the traffic twelve years old alone on this empty wide boulevard it was nighttime now and very cold a week later john retrieved the journals from maxs safe he told the woodwards he was sleeping over at a friends house they were pleased to hear that he had finally made a friend and didnt press him for details he took the night bus into town and waited until the research unit was locked and dark then he shinnied up a maple tree and through one of the high access windows hinged open to moderate the fierce heating system he took the documents from the safe under maxs desk photocopied them on the xerox machine in the adjoining room then returned the originals he folded the copies and tucked them under his belt in order to keep his hands free in the corridor outside maxs office he was surprised by a security guard the guard was a fat bald man in a blue suit with a pistol at his hip he came around an angle in the hallway and stood gawking at john for a long instant before dashing forward john discovered that he was calm that he was able to return the guards stare and stand his ground he should have been frightened instead he felt something else a heady combination of power and contempt because the guard was transparent every twitch betrayed his thoughts he was a machine john thought a noisy engine of belligerence and fear he spoke up before the guard could find words made his own voice calm and uninflected i want to leave no one has to know i was here then watched the wheels turning as the imperatives registered uncertainty turning down the corners of the mans mouth and narrowing his eyes if i phone this in ill have to fill out a fucking report it was as good as reading his mind i ought to kick your ass the guard began but it was not so much a threat as a question can i say this dont john said the guard backed off a step amazing john knew about suggestibility and the phenomenon of hypnosis but he was surprised at how effortless it was how utterly pleasurable he had bypassed all the barriers he was talking now directly to the delicate core of self behind this uniform he pictured something wet and pinkly quivering an ego it was an easy target he said open the door at the back the guard turned and led him down the hallway at the door the spell seemed to falter thieving little bastard the guard said i ought to but john silenced him with a look he transferred the thick manila folder of photocopies from his belt to his hand the guard was standing directly behind him but didnt seeor didnt want to john closed the door and listened as the lock slid home the night air was cold and bracing he stood for a moment in the shadow of a tree smiling he felt good felt free freer than he had ever been before reading the research notes he was shocked to find marga described as an unemployed gravid white female of doubtful moralsshocked in general by the tone of callous indifference max had assumed but he supposed max had already cast his lot with homo superior this was contempt by proxy the exploitation of the old order for the sake of the new max did not believe in the people presumably marga was a thief and a torturer manqué the story of his genesis however the intrauterine injections and the forced cortical growth made perfect sense he had guessed much of this before in a way the theft had been more revealing than the notes themselves his commandeering of the security guard his intimidation of max a few days earlier had forced a new discoveryhe was not weak he had allowed himself to be dominated by maxs fears by the idea that he was different and therefore vulnerable how intoxicating now to suspect that he might be more than a freak that he might be functionally superior better at the things human beings were good at a better hunter a better predator but you still cared about the woodwards susan said night had fallen the window was dark though the snow still beat against it susan switched on a lamp i kept them separate in my mind john admitted i made a special exception for james woodward he was an ordinary man and there was nothing i owed him but i harbored fantasies about pleasing him it mattered to you it shouldnt have but it did i think he hesitated i think i just didnt want to be disappointed again they had missed lunch altogether and now it was past dinnertime susan went down to the kitchen fixed a couple of sandwiches and carried them upstairs after coffee john switched on a portable radio for the weather forecast the news wasnt good record snowfall schools closed until further notice city hall begging motorists to stay off the roads john shook his head we cant wait much longer to find amelie he meant as if it would be that simple but susan sensed the urgency in his voice no more talk he said the streetlights were a distant blur through the snowcrusted windows a gust of wind rattled the panes and susan stood up to go to her room john reached for her hand she hesitated stay he said please stay it was a request susan thought it was not a compulsion not a demand she could have left she didnt it was his life but not all his life he lay beside her in the darkness and wondered whether his sudden surfeit of conscience was actually benjamins a wisp of that other self the touch of susans skin against him was a rebuke almost painful she was asleep he moved against her she was warm and there was snow against the icelaced window he had gone cottonmouthed laboring at the days intimacy an intimacy of words honest as far as it went but oblique polished limited he hadnt told her for instance about that first act of seduction the act that had haunted him ever sincemost recently in a motel room in alberta seduction as bestialitymaking love to the look skin fucking skin souls in absentia the story of his life except for tonight with susan tonight had been different but if this was benjamins conscience that had begun to prick him then here was an even more disturbing notion maybe it was benjamin who had allowed him this moment just past maybe it was benjamin who had maneuvered around the look maybe it was benjamins sincerity she had registeredbenjamins eyes she had looked into maybe all those years ago when he bullied a girl into his bed for the first time maybe it was benjamin or some protobenjamin or shadow benjamin who had roused from sleep and pronounced the traitorous words i love you uncalledfor and unwanted a tacit admission of absurdity utterly unallowable benjamin not john who provoked love benjamin who loved amelie and was loved by amelie benjamin the idiot savant only in the mathematics of this fathomless emotion god damn you he thought you truncated false and stupid thing you prosthetic imitation of a human being god damn you for succeeding at it a surfeit of conscience and a memory he could not suppress this does not make for easy sleep he listened awhile to the beat of the snow against the window after a time without thinking he reached up and brushed away susans hair from her ear the ear was a pink shadowy cusp in the darkness he moved his lips experimentallyhardly more than a whisper i love you he said she didnt stir but he was calmer now and slept part uncontrolled experiments in the morning susan repacked her luggage most of it untouched since her return from california and went looking for dr kyriakides she found him in the study he was bent over his desk making notes in a looseleaf binder he looked up when she opened the door how old he seems susan thoughtsuddenly old and humorless were leaving today she said john and i were going to find amelie dr kyriakides did not react at once slowly he peeled away his glasses and massaged the bridge of his nose the silence was professorial devastating susan wanted to cringe he said thats absurd you cant stop us of course i cant youre both adults you can do what you like but surely you must seewell for one thing susan consider the weather youd be lucky to get a mile down the road and im certain neither of you know where to find amelie wherever she might be we cant even be certain she wants to be found all we know is that she left the house without warning last saturdaywhich is her privilege as it is yours he shook his head it might be understandable that john conceived this idea hes ill after all he has a neurological illness but you susan i thought you were interested in his welfare not coddling his disease in spite of herself susan blushed thats not what im doing john is perfectly lucid it was his idea yes doesnt it seem a little out of character i dont know what you mean he has no interest in amelie it was benjamin who cared about her john is as far beyond amelie desjardins as we are advanced beyond the starfish and you know it why would he want to risk his life for her because thats what this would mean after all he seems fine but the crisis could come at any moment fever and disorientation and possibly unconsciousnesspossibly death can you cope with that do you want that to happen while your car is buried in a snowdrift miles from here its important to him is it has he told you why or is this your own conclusion susan shook her head i dont want to have this discussion i just thought you should know were leaving she turned away wait dr kyriakides said and susan was embarrassed to discover she could not resist the command she hesitated at the doorway john talked about medidnt he thats what this is all about he talked about himself susan said you know i never meant this to happen his voice was suddenly chastened and tentative he stood up stepped out from behind the desk hes a small man susan thought hes shorter than i am another brandnew observation i had no idea things would turn out the way they did at every stepplease try to understandi made what i thought was the best decision the wisest decision even when i was tampering with john inutero even when i was dealing with his mother she was a stupid woman susan she would have had a stupid child and they would have lived stupid ordinary lives she was the kind of passive and amoral creature that allowed a hitler to come to powera stalin the words were fervent and his expression was utterly sincere susan was transfixed when i created john he said i meant to break that chain i was funded by a mercenary organization for a mercenary purpose its true but i never believed the government would benefit from my work in any substantial way if anything the opposite i meant to create a better human being for whom they would therefore have no use not just more intelligent in the obvious sense authentically better he shook his head but its a terrible burden and i should not have imposed it on john i understand that now i god damn your pious selfpity she had not planned to say this the words came spilling out her fists were clenched and her fingernails bit into her palms dr kyriakides gaped at her thats all we are to youall of usjust stupid ordinary people you took a child and you fed him all that contempt that arrogance christ of course it was a burden isnt it obvious thats why he had to invent benjamin she turned away no more hesitation thats why we have to leave she was too shaken to drive john slid behind the wheel of the honda he had excavated the car from a mound of snow but the driveway was still solidsusan wondered whether they would get as far as the road but she put her faith in john and curled up into the private space of her winter coat the snow tires whined and finally bit against the blacktop the honda struggled forward according to the radio the snow might begin again tonight a second front was pushing in from the high prairies but for now the sky was a glassy vacant blue cold and clear susan scrubbed frost from the window next to her and peered out at a frigid rural landscape of frozen ponds and hydroelectric clearances the highway had been ploughed during the night but a morning wind had scattered snow back across the tarmac in serpentine dunes now the honda picked up speed it occurred to susan that john was driving too fast for the roadbut she looked at him and was reassured his eyes had taken on an intense powerful focus his touch on the wheel was delicate and certain the road sped away behind them susan was warm and calmer now she sat up and stretched you told max we were leaving she nodded he says its pointless he says you dont know how to find amelie i dont precisely i think i know where to begin you dont really know that much about her do you no but benjamin does he nodded and you have access to that susan said to his memorieshis life more than i used to that makes it easier but even benjamin didnt know all about amelie she told me about her brother susan said he tried to kidnap her the day she moved you think hes involved in this that would be an obvious suspicion nothing is certain of course all we really know is that she left without leaving a message maybe she just got tired of us all thats possible but you dont believe it no he said i dont believe it they crossed the city limits coming down yonge street john slowed to deal with traffic susan watched a ttc bus slide into an intersection its wheels locked a pickup truck swerved to avoid it john pumped the brake and kept the honda a carlength back a brisk wind peppered the windshield with crystals of yesterdays snow glittering in the sunlight they were well into the city when susan felt the hondas motion grow more erratic she heard john catch his breath as they fishtailed coming around a curve just north of eglinton he pulled into a parking lot can you drive us the rest of the way it shouldnt be too hard the roads have been cleared since morning he was sweating susan frowned are you all right john held up his hand to show her the tremor which was obvious and pronounced oh god susan thought i think wed be safer john said calmly if you took over for a while there was this to deal with too his change they rented a room at a downtown hotel not far from yonge street they unpacked the few things they had brought including the woodward guitar susan had carried back from chicago meager fractions of their lives she rested on the bed while john showered the change was something she didnt really want to think about dr kyriakides had intimated that john might die john said that wasnt really likely but the question was open and there was nothing that susan or anyone else could do about it no real treatment apart from the bottle of pills dr collingwood had prescribed there were questions she would have to begin to face unpleasant as they were such as what would happen if john collapsed should she take him to a hospital this was all beyond her for now she was simply accommodating johns wishes helping him find amelie after that well it was impossible to predict she remembered dr kyriakides describing johns illness as a radical neurological retrenchment a shedding of the induced growth a onetime event which he might survive in one form or another one form or another as john or benjamin or some unpredictable amalgamation of the two and the event would be traumatic dr kyriakides had said like a fever it would run its course would peak would then be finished and its effects irrevocable hell be different susan thought hell want me with him or he wont he wont be the same something new will have been born something will have died but now he is john she told herself sternly the future was always the future always mysterious what mattered was that he was john and she was with him now he came out of the shower looking stronger though there was a certain persistent hollowness about his eyes that susan didnt like its early he said we havent had lunch lets head over to yonge streetthe place amelie used to work they braved the cutting wind susan was afraid the goodtime wouldnt be open a lot of places had closed because of the weather but the lights were all on and the sign in the window said open regular hours their waitress was a tiny timidlooking woman named tracy the food was greasy but filling when tracy came back with their coffee john asked about amelie tracy gave him a wideeyed stare i dont know anything anything about that she hurried off with the check still clutched in her hand john looked at susan susan shrugged it was the manager who brought back the check he wiped his hands on his apron and said whats this about amelie shes missing john said were looking for her so shes not here i know that i thought she might have talked to somebody havent seen her havent talked to her well all right john stood up your waitresstracyshe seemed pretty nervous the manager began an answer then hesitated and took a closer look at john john returned it steadily susan wondered if this was johns hypnotic power at work though she could see no sign of itsaw instead maybe a calculated sincerity then the manager seemed to reach a decision there was somebody else here asking after amelie tracys just skittish she gets upset somebody else her brother tracy says big guy kind of strange but he hasnt been back for a while susan said it only confirms what we suspected but thats important john said thats useful he led her back through the snowy streetsnot to the hotel but to the doughnut shop on wellesley where she had discovered him all those months ago susan wondered if this was some kind of deliberate irony but john was too serious for that he took the table with the chessboard engraved on its surface susan sat opposite him what now we sit here for a while carbohydrates and coffee we look around what are we looking for i dont know yet he shrugged out of his jacket you want a game wont that be distracting no all right then they played twice the first game was a rout susans mind wasnt focused on the boardshe was cold and frightened by what the manager at the goodtime had saidand john pried out her castled king with a bishop sacrifice checkmate came quickly she took the second game more seriously she played a kings indian defense and pondered each move scrupulously by playing a combination of aggressive and defensive moves she was able to keep him at arms length her interest deepened she saw a chance to open up his kinga knight fork that would force a pawn move she would lose the knight but it would leave her bishop and her queen in a single powerful diagonal aimed at his broken pawn ranks was there a flaw in this reasoning well probably but susan couldnt find it she shrugged and advanced the knight john captured it with his pawn susan hunched down over the board if she brought the bishop downand then the queen while his knight was still pinned john said look she raised her head a man had just come through the door a short man in a heavy coat shivering he bought a doughnut and coffee at the counter turned and spotted john recognition flashed between them the man muttered and turned toward the door susan whispered who is he his name is tony morriseau john said and we need to talk to him she stood up with john and cast a last glance at the chessboard she was a move away from checkmate he hadnt noticed chess john had told her was mainly a memory trick the difference between a chess master and a civilian player was that the master had stored a vast internal library of potential positions and was able to recognize them as they developed on the board that plus a certain finely honed ability to concentrate attention made all the difference john was not technically a master because he had not played in enough tournaments to acquire a significant rating his chess playing had been an amusement an experiment he once called it he had played at least in those days to relish his easy superiority over his competitors it was a cruel private entertainment or so he claimed but susan remembered what he had said when they first met across this table when she asked why he went on playing when it was obvious that he would win one hopes he had said hopes for an equal she thought hopes for recognition for understanding hopes for a touch for a contact miraculously across that divide what matters susan thought is that he had never really abandoned that hope even now deep in this killing winter it was alive inside him she took a last look at the chessboard then followed him toward the door john followed tony morriseau out into the cold afternoon a bank of snowclouds had rolled in from the west the sunlight was fading into winter dusk strange how vivid all this seemed it was true what he had told susan since childhood he had lived in a world of platonic abstraction schema and essence the word behind the shadow it was benjamin who had inhabited the universe of surfaces and colors but that was changing he felt it now and he felt it accelerating he stepped into the biting winter air in a shower of snow crystals and he was stunned by the immediacy of it all was this how susan experienced things all sense and no cogitansthis playground of perception made it hard to think he was deluged by dusk and snowdunes by the amber glow of the streetlights so cold and melancholy they seemed to burn into his sight the knife of the wind the hiss of his breath how meaningful it all seemed a new and ancient language john susans voice was crystalline and intimate he turned to look at her she was beautiful she was frowning are you all right he shook his head maybe he wasnt he started to say i but the word itself hovered in the air a pure and absurd syllable it had no antecedent he was as hollow as the sky please not now he thought just a little dizzy he said he turned the comer south of here susan said john hurried after the retreating figure of tony morriseau forcing recollection on himself tony morriseau who had sold him the corvette tony morriseau the drug dealer who might know something about amelie amelie whom he must find because he had assigned himself this task for benjamin it was the repayment of a debt for john say an experiment with an idea an idea about lineage an idea about descent tony was too proud to run and john caught up with him in the blank whiteness of a parking lot the streetlights splaying out weird shadows all around them tony whirled and said fuck off we need to talk john said he heard susan behind him now her cold breath and the squeal of her boob against the snow we dont have anything to talk about tony said about roch about amelie i dont know anything about them but tony was lying john heard it in the angle of his words brittle phonemes like tiny shards of ice tony knew roch and amelie from their street days john remembered amelie talking about it tell the truth john said go fuck yourself tony said but john possessed the key to tonys soul tony was a small pale undefended thing under his shell of skin and it was not difficult to trick him out he had done it before you talked to roch tony looked suddenly doubtful yes what did he want but now tony frowned and canted his head why should i tell you and john was startled because he began but the words werent there they had always been there before asshole tony said susan stepped forward she looked small and delicate in the snow please she said tony shifted to look at her amelies in trouble susan went on if you know roch you know the kind of trouble i mean all we want is to find her what are you her social worker her friend i talked to roch tony said but not about amelie he bought something from you not from me a guy i know what he wanted i dont have all right thats it thats all i have to say john collected himself did he tell you where he was going tony regarded him with instant contempt he began to speak then hesitated john was connecting but only sporadically no tony said excepthe mentioned something about the warehouse he said he was going to sleep in the fucking warehouse tonight that was last week i dont know what it means tony frowned massively just get the hell away from me all right i would really appreciate that he turned and was gone across the parking lot toward the lights on yonge street john was suddenly dizzy susan put a steadying arm around him john can you make it back to the hotel he felt her warm presence against the cold dark and decided he could susan wrapped her arm around johns waist and helped him through the hotel lobby ignoring the hostile stare of the desk clerk maneuvered him up the elevator and through the door of the room he was cooperative but loosejointed his body radiated a feverish heat she stretched him out across the bed john can you hear me he turned his face toward her his eyes were glazed but attentive he nodded she put her hand across his forehead and drew it quickly back the fever was intense and susan felt a surge of panic she couldnt deal with this she wasnt trained for it he needed a doctor a hospital he reached up suddenly and took her wrist in a clamping grip i need aspirin he said maybe cold compresses this will pass she nodded until her agreement registered and his hand slipped away she undressed him and pulled blankets over him then hurried down to the hotels convenience shop for a bottle of bayers when she got back he was shivering and moaning she fed him three tablets with a glass of tap water and pulled up a chair by the bedside the snow that had been predicted all day had settled in by nine oclock susan watched it through the hotel window it was a picturesque gentle persistent snowfall the big flakes danced against the window and drifted onto the ledge outside the snow obscured the city lights and softened the murmur of the traffic with the snowfall johns fever began to retreat susan pressed a damp washcloth against his forehead he had been sleeping restlessly for the last two hours it was only fortyfive minutes since the fever had broken and his temperature had dropped back to normal he needs the rest susan thought but when she took the cloth away he sat up i did what you told me susan said you did fine are you better now better than i was a little while ago is this it susan asked is this what dr kyriakides said would happen lets not talk about it now she took a shower she immersed herself in the hot rush of the water washing away the fear she thought washing away today and washing away tomorrow she wrapped herself in a towel and entered the darkened bedroom john was propped up in the bed a faint silhouette susan toweled her shoulders a last time then climbed in beside him the bed was hot and faintly damp a sickroom bed she didnt care his body was warm but it was an ordinary warmth now because she was afraid susan pressed herself against him he turned to face her this might happen again she guessed he nodded she felt the motion against her cheek might be worse the next time it might be she absorbed this information she said did it mean anything to you what that man said about the warehouse its an empty building down by the lakeshoreamelie told me about it he might have taken her there well go tomorrow and have a look in the snow in the snow ill be all right the snow fell steadily far into the night susan heard it tapping against the pane of the window begging admittance she thought but it cant come in neither of them slept the silence was a vast tapestry stitched with the sound of their voices why me susan asked why did you choose me to be with him in this bed she meant to touch him in the darkness he said because were alike are we in a way what way because both of us have lost something a certain kind of connection i dont understand the wind rattled the window were orphans he said isnt that obvious were feral children we dont know how to be human he touched her cheek thats what we have in common susan was too sleepy to explore this in all its nuances she said what we have in common is what we dont have yes a father lineage john said ancestry a father susan confirmed in the tranquility of the snowbound darkness she was able to admit it she had been looking for a father ever since her father died she had found a sort of fatherat least temporarilyin dr kyriakides she was embarrassed to realize she had said this out loud but you want more than that john said something finer and better she nodded he said you would have slept with himif hed asked yes i guess i would have i almost did isnt that strange there was one time he took me to dinner but he said hes not interested in women in men once but even that was a long time ago she rolled over and felt johns hand slide up her shoulder hes not a good man is he but still at least hes been able to help you no john said im sorry susan no he hasnt not cure you but he said he gave you a prescription he gave me dopamine its what they give alzheimers patients in my case its not much more than a placebo susan turned to face him he smiled in the dark max cant do anything to help me he never could thats not why he came looking for me why then guilt john said remorse and to finish the experiment later he said he was thirsty susan brought him a glass of water from the bathroom tap he sipped it in the dark she said do you know everything about me yes he said solemnly and you know everything about me but not really not everything curled against him she whispered will you die she strained to hear his answer against the hissing of the wind i dont know he said finally ive thought about it whats happening to me is very powerful a powerful process i feel it its like an engine running inside me very strong its not something you can simply resist you have to bendthis way or that but thats the hard part even if i can bargain with it im not sure i dont know if its a deal i want to make he held her against him but susan was wordless in the dark and this time the silence lingered amelie knew where her brother had taken her it was the place they called the warehouse at least she and roch had called it that it wasnt really a warehouse it was a big abandoned building beside the railway tracks where the cpr line ran along the lakeshore west of the city many years ago roch once told her the building had contained a furstorage business now it was a cold dark warren of cavernous rooms and windowless chambers and she was confined in it she remembered how she had come herebut dimly dimly she had gone into the city to meet her mother but it turned out that there was no bus from montreal scheduled at that hour so she had milled around through the crowded oppressively hot terminal for almost an hour and then roch put his hand on her shoulder and she knew it was roch knew it instinctively and immediately he took her arm she wanted to break free but couldnt he led her out to his van and then he locked her in the back they drove to a vacant lot by the cpr line and roch parked and climbed in back with her he had something in his hand a syringe memory clouded but she remembered him carrying her through the snow at dusk his strong arms enfolding her she had recognized the way to the warehouse where they used to go when there was nowhere else to sleep but only in summer it was winter now and cold and the snow was deep and getting deeper someone will see us she thought the railroad police will see us for sure but the railroad police who sometimes parked along these tracks werent here now the snow was too deep and recent everybody had gone home everybody had found a warm place to stay the warehouse the property had been in litigation for years it was worthless someday the building would be torn down for now it was abandoned and dangerous even when they came here during their time on the street amelie would never venture very far inside there were bats living in the old coldstorage chambers there were drippy ancient pipes and wild raccoons and bad smells since then apparently roch had explored the building he had a big eveready flashlight in one hand and he pulled amelie stumbling after him with the other there were rooms and corridors so deep inside this building that no light penetrated from the outside cracked linoleum or bare concrete floors drifted with sawdust and animal droppings roch put her over his shoulder took the handle of the flashlight in his teeth and climbed a narrow wooden ladder to a higher darker level in a small room here at the heart of the building he dumped her against the chipped plaster wall and started a small sterno fire the smoke wafted up to the ceiling and dissipated through a hole there up and up in lazy curls the room did not warm appreciably amelie was a spectator to all this she felt abstracted from her body what had roch put into her a drug she thought something lazy distancing and slightly nauseating she lifted her hand and looked at it it seemed to be floating in midair she watched roch pace the room checking the entrance and fiddling with the sterno there was a question she wanted to ask it was on the tip of her tongue she worked hard to recall it roch what is it you want what do you want from me he turned his face toward her but only briefly his eyes were blank with indifference he stood up briskly this isnt about you he said you dont matter anymore the snow had paralyzed the city overnight a winter blizzard had accumulated drifts and depths that the snowplows could not shunt aside at least not quickly or efficiently the main arteries were reduced to a single lane the subways were running but the buses were not susan awoke to an absolute silence the traffic outside the hotel had been utterly stilled john was in the bathroomshe could hear the shower running she went to the window outside the streets were transformed the city was white unsullied and motionless the snow had stopped falling but the sky was a uniform grey good she thought we cant go anywhere today it wasnt a blizzard it was a reprieve she turned when she heard the water stop john appeared a the bathroom door in his levis skinny pale a little shakybut his eyes were bright and lucid get dressed he said we dont have time to waste i should have expected this susan thought there was no reprieve it wasnt possible he couldnt afford one he didnt have the time its an old building down by the lakeshore john said over breakfast amelie showed me one time when we were out walking susan hesitated over her eggs showed you he was momentarily puzzled showed benjamin i mean an abandoned building susan repeated you think amelies thereroch took her there im almost certain of it is it safe to go there no its not safe at all we could call the police susan said we dont even have to tell them about roch say we spotted some vagrants on the premises john shook his head maybe that would flush him out but i think if he were cornered he might just kill her its pointless but its the kind of gesture roch might make how can you know that you never met him i met him once john corrected her and you know that about him i know that about him youre just going to walk in and take her away from him if i can maybe he wants you to come maybe hes jealous hes out there waiting for you thats why he told tony morriseau where he was going maybe john admitted how can you just walk into that because i have to its a debt i want to pay it off not just a debt to amelie he regarded susan solemnly across the table ill tell you another secret there are lives i could have saved thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands but i didnt so i have to save this life amelies life its not just one more experiment susan its the only experiment that matters she didnt know what he meant but it was impossible to askthere was a ferocity under the words that she was afraid to provoke he stood up suddenly put down money for the bill the roads should be clear by now he said they stopped at a home hardware outlet off yonge street miraculously open for business although there was only one clerk inside john bought a heavyduty flashlight and fresh batteries and assembled them as susan drove south and west through the snowbound streets she followed his directions toward the lakeshore west of the city over the railroad tracks and into a labyrinth of warehouses and crumbling brick factories where the snow lay in pristine mountains and the little honda labored like a crippled packmule she parked when he told her to park the silence was sudden and absolute we walk from here he said susan was dressed in high boots a ski jacket jeans she tore the jacket sleeve while climbing through a hole in the fence that defined the railroad rightofway now were trespassing she thought now the police will come and arrest us but there were no police there was only the snow clinging to the tree branches and the soft sound it made when it fell the glitter of the track where an early morning train had polished the rails she followed john along the arc of the railway for a hundred yards or more then scrambled after him up an embankment there he said thats the building susan stood panting and looked up the building was huge it was an old black brick building on an abandoned railway siding sooty and victorian there were no windows but the open loading bay gaped like a toothless mouth the snow had not softened or warmed this building susan thought it was big and indifferent and it frightened her johns gaze was fixed on it i want you to stay here he said if i bring amelie oat help me get her to the car give me twenty minutes inside if im not out by then find a phone and call the police understand yes she looked at him critically john are you surei mean are you all right he shrugged for now he said she watched him walk away from her toward the building and she understood with a sudden aching finality that she had been afraid of this place all along even before she knew it existedthis dark chamber where he was determined to goand that she could not stop him or bring him back roch was pretty comfortable in the warehouse sure it was cold of course but the sterno fire helped more important he was alone here except for amelie and he was able to keep amelie sufficiently blissed out that she was not a real presence he was alone in this vast empty building and it occurred to him that this was his natural state that he had discovered his ideal habitat his problems had always been with other peopletheir prudishness and their nasty glances he was a stranger out there in the world what he needed was what he had found his own kingdom this place he moved down these dark and windowless corridors with the flashlight in his hand king of the lightbeams his pockets stuffed with a treasury of d batteries and when he laughed his breath smoked out in front of him of course he had a purpose here none of this was random motion he was waiting for the man amelie used to live with no more than that he was waiting for justice he had left a trail and he believed the man would follow it if not maybe roch would wheedle an address or a phone number from amelieshe was cooperative in her present conditionand the challenge could be issued more formally but it would be better simply to lure the man here benjamin amelie had said his name was she whispered it to the air from time to time but the name didnt matter what mattered was the humiliation roch had suffered in amelies apartment months ago and its sequel his humiliation at cherry beach both events now blurring into a long history of similar humiliations for which they had become emblematic roch understood that his life was an arrow with moment following moment like the points of a trajectory toward some target not wholly of his own choosing but he was happy in that service and he was happy to have found a home here he explored the snowbound building in great detail he avoided the ground level where there had been extensive vandalism and where the walls were emblazoned with vulgar graffiti he preferred the lightless upper regions closed to the world a wooden ladder and the eveready flashlight his admittance into a pure and angular wilderness he also liked the coldstorage chambers at the rear where the furs used to hang behind the loading bays though these were less hospitable bleak caverns where snowmelt dripped from corroded freon pipes and animal dung lay thick on the floor time was nearly meaningless here or would have been save for the periodic demands of his body and the ticking clock of amelie now he ambled past a shuttered window where rags of winter light penetrated from the west afternoon therefore he circled back to the room where amelie bound at the ankles had crawled closer to the sterno fire some instinct for warmth operating through the narcotic haze she seemed to be asleep her breathing was shallow and periodic roch considered giving her another injection then decided not to it would be too easy to kill her this was a ticklish business still even if he did kill her hadnt she served her purpose already assuming benjamin showed up she was disposable really except as a potential hostage against some emergency roch could not entirely frame or predict dead she would only have to be disposed of still but he hesitated in his deliberation startled to a new level of alertness by the distant but distinct sound of footsteps in the cavernous space of the warehouse it was a cue he recognized it time had resumed its forward march his heart began to batter against his ribs he picked up a fifteeninch copper pipe segment he had set aside in rehearsal for this moment a weapon in one hand the eveready flashlight in the other be prepared the boy scouts motto haha a smile formed on his lips passing into the shadow of the building john felt its presence as a physical chill he didnt know this building but amelie had told him about it told him told benjamin in memory the merger was already complete it was a huge cold blackbrick nautilus shell and she hated it he understood why but that was pathology john thought his sense of the buildings soullessness because buildings dont have souls ever he had read extensively in abnormal psychology not psychoanalytic case histories but the infinitely subtler literature of brain dysfunction and it struck him that what he felt now was like the heightened significance in the intrarictal consciousness of temporal lobe epileptics the limbic system bleeding into perception animal foreboding injected into the loom and bulk of this stony victorian structure but then he knew what might be inside he took a step up onto the ancient loading bay the wooden platform creaked ominously he could smell the damp interior now animals had died in there hard to imagine even a homeless person sheltering here even in summer but amelie had said nobody went inside much just lingered here out of the rain brief shelter still he remembered amelie telling him about a tv show shed seen about dream interpretation if you dream about a house or a building amelie said youre really dreaming about yourselfyour mind and the attic or the basement is sort of your unconscious self maybe you dont like what you find there or maybe its something great you forgot about but either way its part of you its your secret self maybe he thought i dreamed this building it would be appropriate down into his jerrybuilt and crumbling soul echoes of his own voice rumbling through these ruined corridors moving into the darkness he thumbed the switch on his flashlight the beam lanced out ahead soon he was aware of another human presenceof the distant stealthy tread of feet faint echoes at the threshold of perception a whisper in this frigid air but revealing he didnt doubt that the presence was roch too many signs had pointed this way the truth was too obvious he tried to track the distant footfalls as he moved to range on them this was his uniqueness after all his secret weapon but he was sidetracked by his thoughts it was as if the sound of his own thinking had grown intolerably loud a din that drowned out the external world he recognized this as akin to the feverishness that had overtaken him last night or maybe the same feverishness a dementia that had never entirely retreated he was dying after all or if not dying then retreating into some utterly new form a dim shape just emerging from the darkness which was when you came right down to it a kind of dying he stumbled against a damp concrete wall vertigo this wouldnt do at all he had entered the world of greek and latin nouns vertigo dementia kinaesthesia aphasiatoo soon he thought he thought about roch there was a skittering from a dark room beyond the reach of his flashlight beam not roch some animal maybe a rat he hurried past he remembered roch from their confrontation in amelies apartment a big man muscular no real threatnot thenbut john recalled also his deeper sense of the man as a fierce kettle of hostility at explosive pressure but hostility what an inadequate word it was an anger as purified and symmetrical as a laser beam far more potent than any physical threat and more difficult to overcome john was at this moment more than a little frightened of it he had counted on his old abilities here the superhuman edge but since last night that surety had blurred the edges of things ran together events happened too quickly some internal clock had slowed down his impression of the corridor now in the sway of his flashlight beam over concrete and blackened ceiling beams was more vivid than it ought to be but less informative he was hardpressed to extract the implications of a footprint or an echo where was roch where was amelie moving deeper now he discovered a wooden ladder leading up through a gap in the ceiling where a staircase might once have been the rungs of the ladder were not dusty but seemed almost polished and this at least he could interpret he switched off the flashlight and in the darkness detected a fainter light flickering above him it wasnt much but it was something to follow at the top of the ladder he groped his way onto a horizontal surface and flicked the flashlight back on he was in a narrower older corridor the wallboard had been pried away in places and the yellow lathing peeked through the flashlight beam paled away in an atmosphere of dust motes he moved still deeper approaching the heart of the building he was totally enclosed nowthe thought inspired a new nauseating wave of vertigo he heard faint sounds lost in their own echoes which might be voices or water dripping down these old posts and columns or the sound of whimpering his own footsteps seemed impossibly loud and the dust was choking then without warning he turned a corner into a long windowless room which was not empty first he saw the flickering sterno fire then amelie bound at the wrists and ankles and squirming against the floor she was wearing grimy jeans and a striped top a soiled ski jacket her eyes were vague but she looked at him pleadingly amelie he was hardly aware of saying it maybe it was benjamin who spoke benjamins memories were powerfully present as he stooped to untie her their conversations meals together arguments their lovemaking she was tied with nylon clothesline and his fingers were too numb to manage the knots but he had a swiss army knife in his pocket and he pulled it out and fumbled open the blade amelie watched curiously as if she couldnt quite decide who he was which was reasonable after all because he wasnt entirely certain himself he had lost track of his own name words were suddenly elusive he imagined them the vision was crystalline in his mind as a flock of birds startled into a cold blue sky the blade parted the cords her hands faintly blue sprang apart but maybe amelie had lost her words too she was pointing and gasping backing away too late john understood her wild gesturing he turned in time to see roch rush forward from the doorway roch had a length of pipe in his right hand and john focused briefly on it on the islands of verdigris laced across the copper green in the flickering firelight in its own way it was beautiful mesmerizing roch smiled get out of here john told amelie roch brought the pipe down john managed to catch the first blow against the open palm of his left hand but the shock traveled up his arm to the shoulder and seemed to unhinge something there the arm fell limp as amelie scurried past passing she slipped and kicked the burning sterno across the floor it spilled against an exposed spruce stud the light was briefly dim and then flared much brighter but johns attention was on roch who had reared back for a second blow john tried to veer away but something was wrong here the weapon came down too fast or his legs were unsteadyeverything happened too fastand he was aware of the miscalculation but helpless to correct it as roch brought the pipe down in a clean trajectory that intersected precisely with johns skull the impact was explosive he felt as if he were flying away in every direction at onceand then there was only the darkness the blow connected solidly roch allowed himself a brief rush of satisfaction then turned and ran after amelie running he transferred the pipe to a loop in his belt and took the flashlight in his right hand he trained the beam on her but she was already a surprising distance down the corridor he must have been too cautious with the narcotics must have let the time get away from him he tripped over a spur of concrete and almost dropped the flashlight he managed to recover but it gained amelie some critical time he stabbed the flashlight forward and saw her disappear down the empty stairwella miracle she had found the ladder in this darkness but of course it was his own light his own trusty eveready that had led her there bitch he screamed and drew out the copper pipe and bounced it against an aluminum conduit suspended horn the ceiling the sound rang out around him like a bell metallic and cacophonous in this closed space amelie ducked her head down below the floor but roch didnt follow he was frozen in place paralyzed by the sudden and terrible suspicion that he had done something momentous something irrevocable that he had jackknifed off the high board into an empty pool how had he arrived in this dark cavernous hallway basically what the fuck was hedoing here but there was no answer only the keening of the ventilator shafts down these blind scabbed walls he clenched his teeth and suppressed the doubt maybe there was some truth to it maybe hehad taken the dive without looking but when you get this far he thought it just doesnt matter anymore youre up there in the spotlight and you tuck and spin because its the focal point of your entire life even if you dont understand it you just know so fuck all that pain and death thats rushing up at you thats after now is now he hefted the copper pipe and turned back to the burning room susan saw amelie stumble away from the shadow of the building and knew at once that something had gone terribly wrong amelie was sick or hurt she took five lunging steps into the snow and then seemed to lose momentumstopped wobbled and fell forward susan ran out from the cover of the trees the snow hindered every step it was like running in a nightmare she looked up briefly as she passed into the shadow of the warehouse the building seemed to generate its own chill potent even in the still winter air she put her arms around amelie and lifted her up amelie was trembling she was cold to the touch and her eyes wandered aimlessly susan guessed some kind of drug might be involved amelie some recognition flickered in her eyes amelie is john inside is he all right hes in there amelie managed is he hurt hes with roch susan stifled a powerful urge to go in after him she took a deep breath do what you have to ill take you to the car she said then we can call the police they crossed the railroad tracks and ducked under the link fence toward the honda both of them breathless and gasping by the time they reached the car amelie doubled over against the lid of the trunk her cheek pressed to the cold metal susan turned back toward the warehouse one edge of it still visible over a stand of snowy pine trees she shielded her eyes and frowned at what she saw a thick plume of white smoke had begun to waft upward from the western corner of the building the warehouse had been stripped bare years ago everything even remotely valuable had been sold or stolen there was no furniture left to burn the floor was pressed concrete the exterior walls were brick but there were ancient kilndried spruce studs there were pressboard dividing walls where these lofty spaces had been partitioned into offices there was an immense volume of subcode insulation that had been installed by the contractor as a costcutting measure during a renovation altogether there was plenty to burn john awoke to the burning the sterno can had spilled flaming jelly across the floor the bulk of it next to three exposed wooden structural studs the wood was porous and spectacularly dry the flames licked at it paused as if to gather strength then ran upward to the ceiling beams and through an open airway to the third floor where they encountered a fivefoothigh stack of the saturday edition of the toronto sun dated through the flames relished it awake nowdimlyjohn rolled away from the heat a glowing ember flaked down from the ceiling and scorched the skin of his wrist his lungs felt raw sandpapered he opened his eyes he saw the flames running across the ceiling in freshets like water where the room had been dark it was now bright with a sinister light he lifted a hand to shade his vision his head hurt when he moved the pain was dizzying nausea constricted his throat the agony was so generalized as to seem sourceless then he touched his head above his left ear and felt the pulpy texture of the skin there the hair was matted and wet his hand when he pulled it away glistened in the firelight this wetness was blood blood and fire all around him he remembered roch the overheated air created by the flames was vastly lighter than the cold stagnant air surrounding it it shot upward almost volcanically coursing through the abandoned building like a river cut loose from the restraints of gravity where stairways had fallen it rose through the gaping spaces it discovered flues and airways it was merely warm by the time it reached the top of the building but still hot enough to seek out an icy fivefoot gap where the ceiling had collapsed and to rise lazily at first into the still afternoon air this was how susan saw it from the honda a waft of almost pure white smoke it gathered strength john understood that something was broken inside him that was the way it felt and it might be literally true roch had hit him pretty hard he was confused about this place and he was confused about whether he was john or benjaminor what these names impliedand just about the only thing he was not confused about was the urgency of getting out of the building the building was on fire it was burning he could be trapped here that much was clear he managed to stand up he saw the flashlight on the floor and picked it up he could see well enough in the firelight but he might need this later there was a thin veil of acrid smoke all around himfortunately most of it was still being drawn up by the rising heat that might change however and even this faint haze was choking combustion products toxic gases these words floated up from memory briefly vivid in his mind he could read them like printed words on paper in the space behind his eyelids but the danger was real and imminent he staggered into the hallway where roch was waiting for hire roch came forward in a lunge with the copper pipe extended grinning hugely john knew that roch meant to kill him and leave him here where the fire would consume his body he understood this by the expression on rochs face there was nothing mysterious about it blunt burning hatred once again he watched the slow ballistic swing of the pipe above rochs head and the arc it would follow downward this was familiar too the ballet of his own death but not yet john decided it was not even a thought it was a denial so absolute that it felt like a seizure he took a step back hefted the big hardwarestore flashlight and threw it at roch the flashlight whirled as it flew end over end and it seemed to john that roch was staring at it perplexed and wholly attentive as it impacted squarely against his forehead roch teetered on his heels lunging forward with the pipesection for ballast no good he sat down hard on the concrete floor a line of blood seeped out from the impact point on his forehead he looked at john with mute angry amazement son of a bitch he managed began climbing to his feet again pipe in hand john turned and ran but who had thrown the flashlight this question occupied a brightly lit corner of his mind as he staggered down the increasingly dark and smoky corridor because he felt different not john or benjamin some third thing it rose and shifted inside him even now it was large and still wordless it didnt have a name it had never had a name some new presence or maybe not not new at all maybe john thought it had been there all along roch had cut him off from the ladder where he had climbed up to the second floor john ran in the opposite direction the fire was large and potent now able to leapfrog the stony breaks between oases of wood and insulation no part of the building was safe already on the floor above two of the tiny wirereinforced windows had been blown out of their frames by the pressure of the burning flame jetted from the empty spaces a newly crowned infant king surveying his kingdom the fire created its own weather throughout the eastern half of the structure air that had lain stagnant for years began to stir locked or boarded doors groaned against their restraints shuttered windows rattled the sour dust of limestone and decayed animal droppings stirred and lifted the fire drew in gusts of clean air from the winter afternoon and for one paradoxical moment it seemed as if a kind of spring had come john felt the air on his face a good sign it meant he was moving away from the main body of the fire he had decided there must be another way down it was only a question of finding it but the light had dimmed to a smoky nimbus he had lost the flashlight and soon he would be groping on his hands and knees and roch was close behind him he heard the footsteps though he could no longer calculate direction and distance he understood too that the fire had grown large enough that it might encircle him that if it did he would be helpless strange he thought to die without knowing his own name the darkness now was absolute interrupted in rare moments by the flicker of rochs flashlight from behind john toiled onward as quickly as he dared but the air was warm and choking he didnt have much margin anymore and he knew it when he saw a glimmer of light down the corridor he was afraid that it might be the fire circling around from the front he slowed to a walk groped ahead cautiously then stood for a moment surrounded by this dim aurora before it registered as windowlight the windows were tiny glass rectangles set in a wickerwork of framing they rose from waist level to the ceiling and they were so thickly crusted with grime that he hadnt recognized them at first for what they were he pushed against one of the panes with both hands but it didnt yield this was carpentry as old as the building itself victorian and hugely solid he took away his hands and carried enough dirt with them that the prints let through a brighter beam of light handshaped in the smoky air he looked around he wanted a brick a pipe like rochs anything but the corridor was bare rochs flashlight flickered behind him sighing john pulled off his jacket and wrapped it around his right hand bracing himself he drove his fist directly into the thick glass it was like punching rockbruising even through the cloth but the glass splintered and fell away leaving a razortoothed space where cool air came flooding in the panes of glass were maybe twelve inches square and he knocked out ten of them so rapidly that there was no time to notice the shards that ripped through the lining of the jacket and pierced his hand and wrist the pain was momentary and irrelevant when the glass was gone he kicked and ripped at the wooden latticework until there was a hole big enough to fit through he heard roch almost directly behind him now but there was time to ascertain that he himself was directly above the old loading bay that there was a roof below him twobyfours covered with lathing and tarry shingles some of this eroded by the weather not exactly a firm footing time enough too to see that the fire had reached the west end of the loadingbay roof and was spreading wildly he turned his head and saw roch running down the corridor toward him his features clenched in a concentration so total that john was reminded of a master chessplayerthe same allconsuming focus the copper pipelength was cocked at an angle ready john leaped forward and down onto the canted roof of the loading bay and then spreadeagled himself against it the shingles were already warm where his cheek pressed against them something was burning down below but the air was clean he began inching downward with luck he might make it to the edge before the flames caught up with him then he could swing down to ground level if there wasnt timehe could let himself roll and tumble take his chances on what might be down below in the distancealready audible though it escaped johns awarenessthe firetrucks howled their sirens the smoke that had drifted up lazily only minutes before was darker and it boiled skyward in massive gouts the roof of the building had drifted over with snow but that was meltinga sudden waterfall developed where the roof sagged toward the southeast cornerwhile the snow nearest the flames was simply vaporized by the heat the hissing was as loud as the crackle of the fire susan running back down the tracks from the payphone and the honda was startled by the sound the makeshift roof over the loading bay was just twelve feet above the ground at the lowest point of its slope what john had contemplated doing might have been safe to let himself tumble down and hope the snow would cushion his fall but he was transfixed by the sight of roch stepping up into the frame of the broken window a mist of smoke writhing after him clinging to the frame to keep himself from falling shards of glass piercing his hands as johns hands had been pierced the copper pipe fallen and rolling awaymissing johns head by three or four inchesover the roof and out of sight hanging there roch looked down at john in a blaze of distilled hatredand then across at the western edge of the roof where the flames had begun to creep forward he braced his feet and took his hands off the window frame the roof was old and weathered it had been designed to carry a calculated weight of snowbarely in the years since it was erected dry rot had invaded the studs ice and water had pried up the shingles and rusted the nails it could not support more than a fraction of its calculated load in particular it couldnt support roch his left foot pierced the shingles first rochs eyes widened as he slipped to thighlevel like a man in quicksand his right leg buckling under him and the shingles peeling away with sharp successive snaps his right knee penetrated similarly and then he seemed to hesitate for a moment straddling a joist hands clawing at open air and then the joist separated with a sound like a gunshot and roch simply disappeared there was a sickening moment of absolute silence then the thud as roch impacted against the loadingbay platform below john raised his head he could see susan running toward the building amelie not far behind her those two were safe that was good he could have joined them he knew what to do let go tuck and roll let his momentum carry him away from the loading dock and hope that the snowdrift would break his fall he was aware of the beat of his heart and the onrushing eagerness of the flameshow could he do anything else but he felt himself inching forward up the angle of the roof toward the hole roch had made he braced his fingers against the shingles at the edge and looked down roch was lying motionless his hips at an unnatural angle and his eyes closed the flames advancing from the western end of the loading bay and already hot enough to singe his eyebrows one more experiment john thought just one but maybe it wasnt an experiment maybe it was something more important he felt himself straddling a crossjoist and wrapping his arms around it then levering himself out over this high vacant space swinging down toward roch and the burning platform and he understood with a sudden piercing clarity that he wasnt john or benjamin anymore some new being had grown into the vacuum of his skin nurtured by his fever and the sudden desert heat of the flamesa fragment of self so fundamental that it had lurked undiscovered beneath all the latticework of words it had existed even before he learned the word i an uninvented self he let go of the creaking joist and dropped in a crouch next to roch feeling a sudden pain in his ankles and knees and spine but still able to stand his vision blurred in the smoke he was aware of the blood on his hands the cuts circling his wrists the throbbing in his temple where roch had struck him with the pipe he was not sure he had the strength for this for this experiment he kneeled against the hot floorboards and slipped his arm around roch roch was not wholly unconscious his eyelids flickered open as john lifted him up briefly he struggled but his legs dangled limp and useless and the pain of his injuries must have been excruciatinghis eyes riveted shut again the flames closed in from the western edge of the loading bay and began to lick out from the warehouse doors john glanced up and it was like staring into a furnace his skin prickled and itched overhead the joists were popping their nails with a sound like gunfire embers rained down all around him he should leave this burden and simply run but the thought was evanescent it vanished into the tindery air rochs legs would not support him it was like hefting a twohundredpound sack of sand roch opened his eyes once more as john hauled him up he did not struggle seemed only to watch almost impassively his eyes were fixed on johns eyes and his face now was only inches away his eyes seemed to radiate the single blunt message im not one of youand john understood in a final flash of inhuman insight that roch had willfully set himself apart that when he looked at other human beings he saw protoplasm bags of flesh vessels that might contain the elements of hatred or contempt but never anything of roch roch was only roch the only one of his kind alone in his uniqueness and across that vast escarpment there was no bridge or road or trail the divide was as absolute as a vacuum and john perceived that this was not some flaw of character or nurture it was more profound a trick of gestation a stitch in the glial network somehow it was built in my god john thought hes not even altogether human he pinned rochs arms in his own and dragged him toward the snow roch was stunningly heavy a dead weight but the fire was close enough to raise smoke from their clothes and john drew some strength from that he pulled roch along with his heels dragging against the steaming floorboards he felt rochs breath against his neck roch opened his eyes again now two blank wells of unimaginable hostilityand maybe something else maybe a question because i dont want to be what you are john said the words came out punctuated by his gasping overwhelmed by the roar of the flames but patient gentle because im tired of that he carried roch away from the burning platform of the loading bay into the steaming snow and beyond into the thick snow that had not yet melted and where the reflection of the fire was gaudy and strange in the end he was only dimly aware of amelie as she pried at his fingers his embrace of roch was fierce and hysterical but he gave it up at last part results spring is the rainy season in los angeles but today the air was cool and clean the sky was blue the smog had rolled away in a vast tide of pacific air susan placed a wreath of flowers on her fathers grave and stood up smoothing her dress the sun picked out a fleck of mica on the headstone like the winking of an eye daddy she thought what do i do now she meant about john for seven weeks after the warehouse fire john had been comatose in a toronto hospital susan had visited him daily she had helped to nurse him it hurt to see him silent and still in his hospital bed contained in a sleep so absolute that it was a fucker away from death sleep like another country susan thought some place where he had retreated miles and miles and miles away but it was not his sleep that had sent her fleeing to california it was his waking up john is awake dr kyriakides had said and the announcement touched off in her a fierce visceral panic it was impossible to face the prospect of pushing through the door of his hospital room and finding him changed beyond recognition so she bought a ticket for the next available flight and stayed with her mother she kept some secrets told some lies moped around in the fenced backyard while the ultraviolet burned her body brown but there was no avoiding this ritual journey to the cemetery daddy what now silent earth she looked up a silver dot was traversing the blue sky probably an airliner out of la international but susan didnt want to think about airliners which suggested travel which suggested that this sunny interlude was not any kind of solution that pretty soon she ought to buy a return ticket get herself on one of those planes cross that border startled she looked back at the grave it was her fathers voice her own thought of course but it was unmistakably his resonant deep and familiar voice drawn up she thought not from the grave but from the well of memory maybe this is why we invent people susan thought because we cannot bear the loss of them she touched the micaflecked granite headstone daddy should i go back there is that what i should do but the answer was obvious that would be the wise thing susan funny way to hold a conversation but then she thought its always hard when the silence has been so long and so awkward amelie decided to visit roch in the hospital just once because she had to it was safe she was safe from him there anyway she thought the whole world is pretty much safe from roch now and forever he looked up sullenly from the bed roch had lost a lot of weight his singed hair had been cropped short he looked like a convict amelie thought which she guessed he was or at least potentially she hadnt pressed charges but the holding company that owned the warehouse was pretty pissed off even though their insurance must have paid them off in fullthe fire must have been like hitting a vegas jackpot considering the condition of the property but roch didnt care he just looked up at her with his hollow eyes and amelie felt perversely guilty for coming here at all she was still that vulnerable to his anger im going away she said he didnt answer silence was one of the few weapons he had left she went on i know this is a shitty time and all considering what happened but i dont think i owe you anything anymore i guess thats pretty obvious i mean its too bad what happened but it isnt my fault i almost killed you he said the words were slurred with medication but totally sincere she felt his anger simmering inside him he had been insulted in a way he could barely comprehend the last insult amelie thought if only he would let it be i should have he added well maybe she had made a mistake coming here but it was important not just for rochs sake but for amelies important to talk to his doctors important to see him important to prove to herself that she need never be afraid of him again the doctors called it a spinal cord injury sustained during his fall but amelie knew it was really more than that it was her protection it was a guarantee that roch would never be able to hurt her again stillshe felt sorry for him lying broken in this hospital bed it should not have been possible this surge of pity mysterious she had talked to john about roch not long before all this happened john had encountered roch only that one time in her apartment but john had guessed a few things about him he asked was your mother an alcoholic and amelie said wellyou could say that she drank pretty heavy sometimes before roch was born when she was pregnant probably i think so why he told her theres a condition called fetal alcohol syndrome sometimes it causes retardation sometimes it has other effects more subtle you think roch has that its possible all that unfocused anger the alcohol interferes with fetal development particularly the development of the brain it has a sort of scattering effect on the neurons the glial cells amelie waved her hand maybe roch has that i dont know does it matter lots of people have lots of problems when it comes down to it what matters is what you doright not what you are and john had smiled a strange distant smile and nodded his head slowly yes amelie thats what matters she told roch goodbye now and left the room amelie had stayed on at the big house north of the city kyriakides had said it was okay but enough she thought was enough john was back from the hospital now and benjamin benjamin was dead well maybe that wasnt exactly true john wasnt benjamin anymore but he wasnt exactly john either privately amelie figured he was something that john and benjamin had both needed to become maybe something they had been all along something more basic more raw more true maybe what she had loved about benjamin was this becoming benjamin had been half finished and wholly innocent benjamin was a comingtolife an event and that was finished and so her part of it was finished almost finished she packed two tourister suitcases she could come back for her other stuff later when she found a place her little sanyo stereo kyriakides could keep it or susan or john she didnt care on her way out she stopped off at the big study where dr kyriakides was scribbling away in some kind of notebook his glasses practically toppling off the end of his nose she stood in the doorway until he noticed her he spotted the suitcases youre leaving she nodded do you have a place to go i can rent a room until i find an apartment maybe i can get my old job back i want you to knowyoure free to room here as long as you like i think it would be better to get away kyriakides frowned something he wants to say amelie thought then he cleared his throat she waited he said amelie i know about the pregnancy christ she was appalled who told you that it was collingwood right the clinic doctor told collingwood and collingwood told you jesus so much for fucking privacy this is an unusual situation kyriakides said i assume its johns child amelie considered walking out she didnt owe kyriakides anything he hadnt earned this conversation some impulse restrained her benjamins child she said an important distinction you bet it is calm down i didnt engineer this invasion of your privacy for the sake of voyeurism the point is i want to help help help the child i can arrange for money a place for you to stay i dont want to be a fucking research project i dont want you to be its just that i feel like a grandfather to this child ive thought about it a lot about the past the present i think now i might not have given john everything he deserved i would like a chance to do better even in a small way this is he spread his hands on the desk this is important to me he means it amelie thought the offer was absolutely sincere she couldnt say exactly why it bothered her so much stilli appreciate it she said but well be fine you cant be sure of that im not totally alone i have friends if i need help ill get in touch with john she thought privately or whatever john was now he had earned that connection kyriakides had not you dont understand what im offering the tone was imperious she frowned maybe i dont you wouldnt have to work no more tawdry little restaurant jobs no more coldwater apartments all that would be over and theres nothing i want in exchange no deal to make nothing to give up just say yes she picked up her luggage thank you anyway she turned to leave his voice boomed after her what can you give to that child you have nothing my god one more slutty welfare mother with one more worthless infantis that what you want to be im not good enough for you she turned to face him you want me to be something better you want this baby to be something better but you dont even know what that word means you talk about people like theyre bugs insects you say you hate them because theyre cruel and stupid but you can take a life and twist it all out of shapehow are you different ive seen more cruelty than you have cruelty and destructive stupidity god help us is it wrong to want to change that they were talking about john now amelie realized not the baby susan told me what happened with marga you used her and you bought her off she was a lump of clay right a tool one more slutty welfare mother but you cant make a better human being out of thatthat hate i just dont think you can his face was brick red obviously you dont understand anything i do amelie said i understand thats what you wanted john to be a better human being but thats not what happened not better a broken human being it struck home kyriakides sat down heavily for a moment he seemed to struggle for breath i know he said at last youre right thats what he is nowbroken no amelie said thats what he was before she picked up her bags now hes better she waited for a southbound bus at the foot of the driveway the snow had mostly gone and the crocuses were coming up it was a cold day but bright there was a little breeze blowing kind of nice amelie thought not a bad day at all a bus pulled up to the curb sighing diesel fumes she climbed inside paid her fare stowed her touristers under the seat the bus eased away and began to pick up speed she resisted the urge to look back time to look ahead she thought a clean horizon and this ribbon of road her future was up there somewhere waiting to be invented her baby was waiting to be born a new life she thought but not starting over as if the past had never happened she would carry it with herall the memories not just benjamin but roch too these things are what i am it was possible to make a better lifefor herself for this babybut not out of shame not out of hating what had happened you cant do that she had told kyriakides so and she believed it new life inside her anything was possible youll be my baby she thought amelies baby and thats not such a terrible thing to be she smiled to herself settled back into the seat turned to the window outside everywhere along the broad margin of the road the snow was melting in the sun susan called from california when her ticket was confirmed hes not john dr kyriakides told her be prepared for that but hes not benjamin either hes awake and functional and im certain hell eventually be able to hold a job to lead a normal life but he isnt the person we knew he isnt the person you created susan thought and she wondered if that wasnt johns ultimate act of revenge a score that had finally been evened she said im prepared his memory is erratic but i think hell know you thats good susan said she took a cab from pearson airport dr kyriakides met her at the door of the house such an ordinary house susan thought i told him you were coming hes looking forward to it thank you susan said and moved toward the stairs one more thing kyriakides said john was cleaning up his desk today he found this he asked me to give it to you it was a fiveinch dysan floppy disk in a paper sleeve it had her name written on itfor susan in block capitals its from before kyriakides said she knocked gently on the door of his room and pushed inside john was asleep he had pulled a chair up to the windowwatching the spring clouds susan guessedand he had fallen asleep there she moved to touch him on the shoulder then remembered the disk in her hand maybe she shouldnt wake him she sat down at his computer and slid the disk into its slot it began to run when she turned on the machine the disk drive whined a hard disk answered in deeper tones it was not an ordinary pc john had done something to the microprocessors susan wondered if she would be able to work it but the monitor blinked to life all by itself it displayed first of all a date the material was several years old this would be susan calculated when john was living on his island before she met him before the return of benjamin something from johns deep immersion in cellular biology the date disappeared and there was more whining from the drives as a plodding animation appeared on the screen susan blinked at it surprised it was a metastatic tumor cellit looked like diagrams she had seen of the ll mouse carcinoma a common experimental lab tumor the perspective closed in suddenly on the cell surface where john had ideographed certain molecules she recognized collagenase and the mhc glycoproteins these dissolved in turn into ballandstick perspective drawings of their molecular structure a new molecule appeared at the right side of the screen one that susan did not recognize although john had labeled it meticulouslya novel protein synthetic or even hypothetical suddenly it closed on the mhc glycoprotein and bound with it in a violent flurry of activity the product was a fragmented chain susan realized she was holding her breath the screen blanked then refreshed with the original metastatic cell exploded and dead it was a magic bullet a designer molecule the screen filled with a protocol for its synthesis not a cure for cancer susan thought but at least a cure for its metastasis a way to interrupt the fearsome colonization of a human body by tumor cells as a postoperative therapy it could prolong lives indefinitely she thought of her father rendered mute and then dying murdered by his metastasis before he could recover the courage for words she remembered too what john had told her on that cold january day before he walked into the warehouse and out of the worldthere are lives i could have saved thousands maybe even hundreds of thousands this was what he meant he had devised this program for his own satisfaction an experiment if he had made it public or even submitted it anonymously to some journal or some laboratoryit might be in production already susan thought or at least well down the fda pipeline she withdrew the floppy diskcarefullyand looked at the label again for susan she faced the bed he opened his eyes there was so much he didnt remember waking up seeing the woman he was acutely aware of his handicap he had lost a great deal over the duration of his fever memory vocabulary time the loss was endurable mainly because it was so farreachingimpossible to mourn the absence of a thing he could only vaguely recall but there were times like this when the immensity of his loss was painful and obvious her face was familiar i know that face memories surfaced and then winked away elusive as fish in a still deep pool he remembered her face next to his her eyes on his eyes snow on a window words spoken softly in a silence that had seemed as large as the night her name susan he said she smiled tentatively once he had been able to read the nuances of her face as simply as he might read a book he remembered the odd sense that she was transparent skin and skull invisible the trace of her thoughts etched there as clearly as animal tracks in fresh snow but now there was only her face opaque but pretty her eyes only eyes very blue another fragment of memory flashed past he said you saved my life no she said hurriedly no not really you did he affirmed he sat up crosslegged across the bed and regarded her seriously did you talk to dr kyriakides she nodded then you know what i am im not benjamin but im not john either theyre gone both gone youve changed she said well ive changed too thats not so strange you loved john he said susan blushed opened her mouth and then closed it yes she said finally i loved him and its hard saying it that wayas if hes dead but i dont think thats really true i think there was something in him he never talked about or acknowledgedmaybe it was in benjamin toosomething that doesnt go away because its too basic its built into every cell i know thats not scientific but i believe it he regarded her with open surprised interest im talking too much but i want you to know why i came i didnt come expecting johnnot the old john i came to see you she hesitated i guess i wanted to say well here i am if you need me and i have a car parked outside if you ever need to get away her fists were clenched and she was avoiding his eyes i couldnt not come but she looked at him finally i came because if you need to talk to someone you shouldnt keep silentbecause itll kill you doing that she looked at him across the room her eyes full of doubtsurprised at what shed said he guessed worried at what he might think he smiled those are good reasons he said they talked and he discovered that certain memories were not so elusive after all that the sound of her voice or the choice of a word evoked echoes from his life before the fire maybe this was how normal memory workedthe past made subtle and mysterious forgotten moments welling up miraculously whole at the touch of a hand or the turning of a head we used to play chess he said i remember thats right we can play again if you like im not surei dont know if i can itll come back to you she said i can help we can learn from each other thats true he thought and memory came welling up once again of her voice simple words the shape of her ear in a darkened roomof course we can learn from each other it wouldnt be the first time
