john irving until i find you a novel for my youngest son everett who made me feel young again with my fervent hope that when youre old enough to read this story you will have had or still be in the midst of an ideal childhoodas different from the one described here as anyone could imagine what we or at any rate what i refer to confidently as memorymeaning a moment a scene a fact that has been subjected to a fixative and thereby rescued from oblivionis really a form of storytelling that goes on continually in the mind and often changes with the telling too many conflicting emotional interests are involved for life ever to be wholly acceptable and possibly it is the work of the storyteller to rearrange things so that they conform to this end in any case in talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw william maxwell so long see you tomorrow i the north sea in the care of churchgoers and old girls according to his mother jack burns was an actor before he was an actor but jacks most vivid memories of childhood were those moments when he felt compelled to hold his mothers hand he wasnt acting then of course we dont remember much until were four or five years oldand what we remember at that early age is very selective or incomplete or even false what jack recalled as the first time he felt the need to reach for his moms hand was probably the hundredth or two hundredth time preschool tests revealed that jack burns had a vocabulary beyond his years which is not uncommon among only children accustomed to adult conversationespecially only children of single parents but of greater significance according to the tests was jacks capacity for consecutive memory which when he was three was comparable to that of a nineyearold at four his retention of detail and understanding of linear time were equal to an elevenyearolds the details included but were not limited to such trivia as articles of clothing and the names of streets these test results were bewildering to jacks mother alice who considered him to be an inattentive child in her view jacks propensity for daydreaming made him immature for his age nevertheless in the fall of when jack was four and had not yet started kindergarten his mother walked with him to the corner of pickthall and hutchings hill road in forest hill which was a nice neighborhood in toronto they were waiting for school to be let out alice explained so that jack could see the girls st hildas was then called a church school for girls from kindergarten through grade thirteenat that time still in existence in canadaand jacks mother had decided that this was where jack would begin his schooling although he was a boy she waited to tell him of her decision until the main doors of the school opened as if to greet them and the girls streamed through in varying degrees of sullenness and exultation and prettiness and slouching disarray next year alice announced st hildas is going to admit boys only a very few boys and only up to grade four jack couldnt move he could barely breathe girls were passing him on all sides some of them big and noisy all of them in uniforms in those colors jack burns later came to believe he would wear to his gravegray and maroon the girls wore gray sweaters or maroon blazers over their white middy blouses theyre going to admit you jacks mother told him im arranging it how he asked im still figuring that out alice replied the girls wore gray pleated skirts with gray kneesocks which canadians called kneehighs it was jacks first look at all those bare legs he didnt yet understand how the girls were driven by some interior unrest to push their socks down to their ankles or at least below their calvesdespite the school rule that kneehighs should be worn kneehigh jack burns further observed that the girls didnt see him standing there or they looked right through him but there was onean older girl with womanly hips and breasts and lips as full as alices she locked onto jacks eyes as if she were powerless to avert her gaze at the age of four jack wasnt sure if he was the one who couldnt look away from her or if she was the one who was trapped and couldnt look away from him whichever the case her expression was so knowing that she frightened him perhaps she had seen what jack would look like as an older boy or a grown man and what she saw in him riveted her with longing and desperation or with fear and degradation jack burns would one day conclude because this same older girl suddenly looked away jack and his mom went on standing in the sea of girls until the girls rides had come and gone and those on foot had left not even the sound of their shoes behind or their intimidating but stimulating laughter however there was still enough warmth in the earlyfall air to hold their scent which jack reluctantly inhaled and confused with perfume with most of the girls at st hildas it was not their perfume that lingered in the air it was the smell of the girls themselves which jack burns would never grow used to or take for granted not even by the time he left grade four but why am i going to school here jack asked his mother when the girls had gone some fallen leaves were all that remained in motion on the quiet street corner because its a good school alice answered and youll be safe with the girls she added jack must not have thought so because he instantly reached for his moms hand in that fall of the year before jacks admission to st hildas his mother was full of surprises after showing him the uniformed girls who would soon dominate his life alice announced that she would work her way through northern europe in search of jacks runaway dad she knew the north sea cities where he was most likely to be hiding from them together they would hunt him down and confront him with his abandoned responsibilities jack burns had often heard his mother refer to the two of them as his fathers abandoned responsibilities but even at the age of four jack had come to the conclusion that his dad had left them for goodin jacks case before he was born and when his mom said she would work her way through these foreign cities jack knew what her work was like her dad alice was a tattoo artist tattooing was the only work she knew in the north sea cities on their itinerary other tattooists would give alice work they knew shed been apprenticed to her father a wellknown tattooer in edinburghofficially in the port of leithwhere jacks mom had suffered the misfortune of meeting his dad it was there he got her pregnant and subsequently left her in alices account jacks father sailed on the new scotland which docked in halifax when he was gainfully employed he would send for heror so he had promised but alice said she never heard from himonly of him before moving on from halifax jacks dad had cut quite a swath born callum burns jacks father changed his first name to william when he was still in university his father was named alasdair which william said was scots enough for the whole family in edinburgh at the time of his scandalous departure for nova scotia william burns had been an associate of the royal college of organists which meant that he had a diploma in organplaying in addition to his bachelors in music when he met jacks mother william was the organist at south leith parish church alice was a choirgirl there for an edinburgh boy with upperclass pretensions and a good educationwilliam burns had gone to heriots before studying music at the university of edinburgha first job playing the organ in lowerclass leith might have struck him as slumming but jacks dad liked to joke that the church of scotland paid better than the scottish episcopal church while william was an episcopalian he liked it just fine at the south leith parish where it was said that eleven thousand souls were buried in the graveyard although there were not more than three hundred gravestones gravestones for the poor were not permitted but at night jacks mom told him people brought the ashes of loved ones and scattered them through the fence of the graveyard the thought of so many souls blowing around in the dark gave the boy nightmares but that churchif only because of its graveyardwas a popular place and alice believed she had died and gone to heaven when she started singing for william there in south leith parish church the choir and the organ were behind the congregation there were not more than twenty seats for the choirthe women in front the men in back for the duration of the sermon william made a point of asking alice to lean forward in the front row so that he could see all of her she wore a blue robebluejay blue she told jackand a white collar jacks mom fell in love with his dad that april of when he first came to play the organ we were singing the hymns of the resurrection was how alice put it and there were crocuses and daffodils in the graveyard doubtless all those ashes that were secretly scattered there benefited the flowers alice took the young organist who was also her choirmaster to meet her father her dads tattoo parlor was called persevere which is the motto of the port of leith it was williams first look at a tattoo shop which was on either mandelson street or jane street in those days jacks mom explained there was a rail bridge across leith walk joining mandelson to jane but jack could never remember on which street she said the tattoo parlor was he just knew that they lived there in the shop under the rumble of the trains his mother called this sleeping in the needlesa phrase from between the wars sleeping in the needles meant that when times were tough you slept in the tattoo parloryou had nowhere else to live but it was also what was said on occasion when a tattoo artist diedas alices father hadin the shop thus by both definitions of the phrase her dad had always slept in the needles alices mother had died in childbirth and her fatherwhom jack never methad raised her in the tattoo world in jacks eyes his mom was unique among tattoo artists because shed never been tattooed her dad had told her that she shouldnt get a tattoo until she was old enough to understand a few essential things about herself he must have meant those things that would never change like when im in my sixties or seventies jacks mom used to say to him when she was still in her twenties you should get your first tattoo after im dead she told him which was her way of saying that he shouldnt even think about getting tattooed alices dad took an instant dislike to william burns who got his first tattoo the day the two men met the tattoo gripped his right thigh where william could read it when he was sitting on the toiletthe opening notes to an easter hymn hed been rehearsing with alice the words to which began christ the lord is risen today without the words youd have to read music and be sitting very close to jacks fatherperhaps on an adjacent toiletto recognize the hymn but then and there upon giving the talented young organist his first tattoo alices dad told her that william would surely become an ink addict a collectormeaning he was one of those guys who would never stop with the first tattoo or with the first twenty tattoos he would go on getting tattooed until his body was a sheet of music and every inch of his skin was covered by a notea dire prediction but one that failed to warn alice away the tattoocrazy organist had already stolen her heart but jack burns had heard most of this story by the time he was four what came as a surprise when his mother announced their upcoming european trip was what she told him next if we dont find your father by this time next year when youll be starting school well forget all about him and get on with our lives why this was such a shock was that from jacks earliest awareness that his father was missingworse that he had abscondedjack and his mother had done a fair amount of looking for william burns and jack had assumed they always would the idea that they could forget all about him was more foreign to the boy than the proposed journey to northern europe nor had jack known that in his moms opinion his starting school was of such importance shed not finished school herself alice had long felt inferior to williams university education williams parents were both elementaryschool teachers who gave private piano lessons to children on the side but they had a high regard for artistic tutelage of a more professional kind in their estimation it was beneath their son to play the organ at south leith parish churchand not only because of the class friction that existed in those days between edinburgh and leith there were differences between the scottish episcopal church and the church of scotland too alices father was not a churchgoer of any kind hed sent alice to church and choir practice to give her a life outside the tattoo parlor never imagining that she would meet her ruin in the church and at choir practiceor that she would bring her unscrupulous seducer to the shop to be tattooed it was williams parents who insisted that although he was the principal organist for the south leith parish he accept an offer to be the assistant organist at old st pauls what mattered to them was that old st pauls was scottish episcopaland it was in edinburgh not in leith what captivated william was the organ hed started piano lessons at six and had not touched an organ before he was nine but at seven or eight he began to stick bits of paper above the piano keysimagining they were organ stops hed already begun to dream about playing the organ and the organ he dreamed about was the father willis at old st pauls if in his parents opinion to be the assistant organist at old st pauls was more prestigious than being the principal organist at south leith parish church william just wanted to get his hands on the father willis in old st pauls jacks mother told him the acoustics were a contributing factor to the organs fame the boy would later wonder if she meant that almost any organ would have sounded good there because of the reverberation timethat is the time it takes for a sound to diminish by sixty decibelsbeing better than the organ alice remembered attending what she called an organ marathon at old st pauls such an event must have been for fundraising purposesa twentyfourhour organ concert with a different organist performing every hour or half hour who played when was of course a hierarchical arrangement the best musicians performed when they were most likely to be heard the others at the more unsociable hours young william burns got to play before midnightif only a half hour before the church was half empty or emptier jacks mother was the most enthralled member of the audience the slightly inferior organist whose turn was next would also have been in attendancethe playerinwaiting who had the midnight slot william didnt want to waste old st pauls fabled reverberation time by selecting a quiet piece to the degree that jack could understand his moms story his father was playing to be heard hed chosen boellmanns toccata which alice called rousing and noisy outside the church a narrow alley ran alongside old st pauls huddled against the wall of the church seeking shelter from the rain was one of edinburghs downandoutsin all likelihood a local drunk he had either passed out in the alley or intentionally bedded down there he may have slept there most nights but not even a drunk can sleep through boellmanns toccatanot even outside the church apparently alice enjoyed acting out how the drunken downandout had presented himself would you stop that fucking racket how the fuck can i be expected to get a good nights fucking sleep with that fucking bloody fuck of a fucking organ making a sound that would wake the fucking dead it seemed to alice that the drunk should have been struck dead for using such language in a church but before god could take any action against the downandout william resumed playingwith a vengeance he played so loudly that everyone ran out of old st pauls including alice the organist with the midnight slot stood in the rain with her jacks mom told jack that the foulmouthed man was nowhere in sight he was probably searching for a resting place beyond the reach of boellmanns toccata despite such a reverberating performance william burns was disappointed by the organ built in the father willis would have been more highly valued if it were still in its original condition alas in williams estimation the organ had been much fiddled with by the time he got to try it it had been restored and electrified a process typical of the antivictorianism of the s not that alice could possibly have cared about the organ more devastating to her when william left his job as the organist at south leith parish church to play the father willis at old st pauls there was no hope of her following him to be a choirgirl there in those days there was an allmale choir at old st paulsand from the congregation alice could see only williams back how she envied that choir there was not only a procession wherein the choir followed the cross but the choir sat at the front of the churchin view of everyonenot at the back unseen as in leith jacks mother was particularly miserable when she discovered that she wasnt the only choirgirl whod fallen in love with jacks father but she was the only one who was pregnant as the new assistant organist at old st pauls william burns was answerable to the senior organist and the priest that william had knocked up a tattoo artists daughter from leith was a matter that his ambitious parents and the scottish episcopal church didnt take lightly whose decision it wasto whisk him away to nova scotia as jacks mom put itwould forever remain unclear to jack but both the church and williams parents probably had had a hand in it the counterpart of old st pauls in halifax the anglican church of canada was simply called st pauls they did not have a father willis the church with the best organ in halifax was the first baptist church on oxford street william burns must have been told to make up his mind in a hurry theres no other explanation for why he chose the denomination over the organthe music not the church was what mattered to him but the organist at st pauls in halifax was retiring the timing was providential the swath that william was alleged to have cut in halifax in all likelihood included a choirgirl or two there was also talk of an older woman he wore out his welcome with the anglicans in a hurry according to jacks mother his father wouldnt have lasted a day longer with the baptists williams parents reportedly told alice that they never sent him money or hid his whereabouts from her the first claim is conceivably truewilliams parents had little money but it was harder for alice to believe that they didnt conspire to hide him from her and when william was forced to flee halifaxnot long before alices arrival therehe must have needed money hed been tattooed again as alice discovered when she first went looking for himat charlie snows tattoo shop in halifax where the power for the electric machines was supplied by car batteries and it would be a while before william found a job and more quickly lost it in toronto alice never blamed old st pauls for whatever role the church may have played in arranging williams passage to nova scotia it was the parishioners of old st paulsand surprisingly not her congregation in south leithwho took up a collection to send alice to halifax to find him furthermore the anglican church of canada looked after her in halifax and they did an honest job of it but first they put her up in the st pauls parish house at the corner of argyle and prince streets to await her delivery day by this time she was not only pregnant she was showing jack burns was alleged to have been a difficult birth a csection his mom told him around the time of their arrival in the first of those north sea ports at four the boy took this to mean that he was born in the csection of a hospital in halifaxa part of the hospital designated for difficult births it was a little laterprobably during not after their european travelsthat jack learned what a birth by cesarean section meant only then was it explained to the boy that this was why it was not proper for him to take a bath with his mother or to see her naked alice told jack that she didnt want him to see the scar from her csection thus jack burns was born in halifax under the care of churchgoers at the other st pauls as his mother remembered themfor the most part fondlythey demonstrated considerable sympathy for a wayward choirgirl from the church of scotland and they expressed the utmost contempt for the licentious organist who was one of their own scottish episcopalians and canadian anglicans were cut from the same religious cloth apparently it was because of those anglicans at st pauls in halifax that william did not long remain in hiding in toronto the church was onto him as alice put it in the meantime after jack was born in nova scotia his mother went to work for charlie snow charlie was an englishman whod been a sailor in the british merchant navy in world war one he was reputed to have jumped ship in montreal where freddie baldwin who was also from england and had fought in the boer war taught him how to tattoo both freddie baldwin and charlie snow had known the great omi people paid to see the great omis tattooed face he used to come to halifax with a circus when he walked around town he wore a ski mask no one got a free look jacks mom told him this amounted to more nightmare material for the boy jack couldnt stop himself from imagining the terrible tattoos on the great omis face from charlie snow alice learned to rinse the tattoo machines with ethyl alcohol she cleaned the tubes with pipe cleaners which shed soaked in the alcohol and every night she boiled the tubes and needles in a steamer the kind meant for cooking clams and lobsters alice said charlie snow made his own bandages out of linen there wasnt much hepatitis then alice explained she told jack that freddie baldwin had given charlie snow his most impressive tattoo over charlies heart sitting bull sat facing general custer who stared straight ahead unseeing on the far right of charlies chest deadcenter on charlie snows breastbone was a fullsailed ship a banner unfurled from charlies clavicle said homeward bound charlie snow wouldnt get home to his final resting place until when he was eighty he died of a bleeding ulcer alice learned a lot from charlie snow but she learned how to do a japanese carp from jerry swallow whose tattoo name was sailor jerry hed become charlie snows apprentice in alice liked to say that she and jerry swallow apprenticed together with charlie snow but of course shed already been apprenticed to her father at persevere in the port of leith long before shed docked in halifax jacks mother knew how to tattoo jack burns had no memory of his birthplace until he was four toronto was the only town he knew he was still an infant when his mom caught wind of his father and what he was up to in toronto and they followed him there from halifax but jacks dad had left town ahead of them which was getting to be a familiar story by the time the boy could comprehend his fathers absence william was rumored to be back in europe having crossed the atlantic once again for much of his young life jack would wonder if the story of his dads exploits in toronto was what first led his mom to st hildas unthinkably the school had hired william burns to train the senior choir which was composed of girls in grades nine through thirteen william also gave private lessons in piano and organ these were almost exclusively for the older girls one can only imagine what jack as a teenager would think of his fathers adventures at an allgirls school williams noticeable contribution to the girls musical education led st hildas to make him the principal organist at the daily chapel services as well not surprisingly williams success at st hildas was shortlived although a girl in grade elevenone of his piano studentswas the first to succumb to his charms it was a gradethirteen girl whom he got pregnant he later drove the girl to buffalo for an illegal abortion by the time alice got to town with her illegitimate child in tow william had fled and jack and his mother were once more welcomed by churchgoers st hildas was an anglican school the schools chapel where many of the st hildas graduates were later married was a toronto bastion of the anglican church of canada the few scholarships to the school that existed in the s were funded by the old girls association a powerful alumnae organization children of the clergy were generally helped first other decisions regarding who got financial aid were arbitrary in addition to the anglicans and the school faculty and administration the old girls quickly heard of alice and her condition jack of course was the condition thus when alice told jack that she was arranging his admittance as one of the few new boys at st hildas he assumed that his mom had the old girls help in fact alice and jack had already been lucky theyd found lodgings in the home of an old girl from st hildas mrs wicksteed was a warhorse for the alumnae association inexplicably upon her husbands death shed also become a champion of unwed mothers she not only battled on their behalfshe even took them in mrs wicksteed was a widow long past grieving she lived virtually alone in a stately but not too imposing house at the corner of spadina and lowther where jack and his mom were given rooms they were not big and there were only two of them with a shared bath but they were pretty and clean with high ceilings the old girls housekeeper whose name was lottie was a former prince edward islander with a limp lottie became the boys nanny while alice sought the only work she knew in the s toronto was hardly a tattoo mecca of north america alices apprenticeship to her dad in persevereand her secondary education in halifax with charlie snow and sailor jerryhad overqualified her for torontos tattoo parlors she was way better than beachcomber bill who for reasons unknown to jack didnt offer her a job and she was also better than the man they called the chinaman who did his real name was paul harper and he didnt look chinese but he knew that alice was the best tattoo artist in toronto in he hired her without a moments hesitation the chinamans shop was on the northwest corner of dundas and jarvis near the old warwick hotel there was a victorian house with steps leading down to a basement door the tattoo parlor was in the basement and you entered it directly from the sidewalk on dundas the curtains on the basement windows were always drawn as a child jack burns occasionally remembered to include paul harper in his prayers the socalled chinaman helped alice launch her career in what would be the city of her choice even if it would never be jacks but its no good being beholden to some people indebtedness can come with a price while the chinaman never made alice feel obligated to him mrs wicksteed was another matter that she meant well was unquestioned but to say as her divorced daughter did that jack and alice were her rentfree boarders would be a misuse of rentfree mrs wicksteed rashly decided that alices scottish accent was a lowering mark upon her social stationmore permanently damaging than her exotic if unsavory involvement with the tattoo arts as jack understood things it was mrs wicksteeds belief that his moms burr was both a violation of englishthat is as mrs wicksteed spoke itand a curse that would condemn poor alice to a station lower than leith for all eternity as an old girl with deep pockets and an abiding devotion to st hildas mrs wicksteed hired a young english teacher there a miss caroline wurtz who was expected to change alices offensive accent miss wurtz in mrs wicksteeds view not only excelled in enunciation and diction it seemed she also lacked an interfering imagination that might have found alices burr likable or possibly miss wurtz more deeply disapproved of alicethe accent in her view being the least offensive thing about the young tattoo artist caroline wurtz was from germany via edmonton she was an excellent teacher she could have cured anyone of a foreign accentshe attacked the very word foreign with a confident air and whatever the source of her seeming disapproval of alice miss wurtz clearly doted on jack she could not take her eyes off the boy sometimes when she looked at him she seemed to be reading his future in the contours of his face as for alice her attachment to scotland had eluded her she submitted to carolines enunciation and diction as if there were nothing in her own language she held dear her fathers deathafter her arrival in halifax but before jack was bornand williams rejection had made alice no match for miss wurtz thus in addition to losing her virtue on one side of the atlantic alice lost her scottish accent on the other it was not a lot to lose she would one day confide to jack the boy assumed that his mother meant the accent alice seemed to bear neither miss wurtz nor mrs wicksteed a grudge jacks mom wasnt a welleducated woman but she was nonetheless well spoken mrs wicksteed was most kind to her and to jack as for lottie with her limp the boy loved her she always held his hand often taking it before he could reach for hers and when lottie hugged him jack felt it was as much for her own sake as it was to make him feel loved hold your breath and ill hold mine she would tell the boy when they did so they could feel their hearts beating chesttochest you must be alive lottie always said you must be alive too lottie the boy replied gasping for breath jack would later learn that lottie had left prince edward island in much the same condition as his mother had been when she sailed for halifaxonly lotties child was stillborn upon her arrival in toronto where mrs wicksteed and the network of st hildas old girls had been most kind to her whether you called them anglicans or episcopalians or worshipers in the church of england those old girls were a network considering that jack and his mom were waifs in the new world they were fortunate to be in the old girls care saved by the littlest soldier because stronach is an aberdeenshire name alices dad bill stronach was known in the tattoo world as aberdeen billnotwithstanding that hed been born in leith and had little to do with aberdeen according to alice who was his only child bill stronach spent a drunken weekend in aberdeenone of those weekends when everything went wrongand as a result he was aberdeen bill for the rest of his life as a younger man before alice was born aberdeen bill had traveled with circuses hed tattooed the circus people in their tents at night usually by the light of an oil lamp hed learned to make his best black ink from the soot on oil lamps which he mixed with molasses in the fall of before jack and his mom left for europe alice wrote letters to the tattoo artists she had heard of in those cities she and her son would be visiting she said shed learned her trade at persevere in the port of leith that she was aberdeen bills daughter would suffice there wasnt a tattooer worth his needles in those north sea ports who hadnt heard of aberdeen bill jack and alice went to copenhagen first ole hansen was in the shop at nyhavn hed received alices letter and had been expecting her like aberdeen bill tattoo ole was a sailors tattooera maritime man he would never have called himself a tattoo artist he preferred to say he was a tattooist or a tattooer and like aberdeen bill tattoo ole was a man of many hearts and mermaids serpents and ships flags and flowers butterflies and naked ladies it was tattoo olethen a young man in his early fortieswho gave alice her tattoo name she and jack walked into oles shop on nyhavn with the boats slapping on the choppy water of the gray canala latenovember wind was blowing off the baltic ole looked up from a tattooinprogress a naked lady on the broad back of a halfnaked man you must be daughter alice tattoo ole said thus alice had a name for herself before she had her own tattoo parlor tattoo ole hired her on the spot for the first week ole did all the outlining and assigned her the shading by the second week he was letting her do her own outlining all that seemed to matter at tattoo oles was that ole hansen was a maritime man and daughter alice fit in after all shed grown up practicing on her father shed poked her first tattoos by hand before her dad had shown her how to use the electric machine from persevere her fathers shop in leith alice was familiar with the acetate stencils that tattoo ole used she could do a broken heart or a heart torn in two or a bleeding heart in thorns and roses she did a scary skull and crossbones and a firebreathing dragon she could do a killer version of christ on the cross and an exquisite virgin mary with a green tear on her cheek and some sort of goddess who was captured in the act of decapitating a snake with a sword she did ships at sea anchors of all kinds and a mermaid sitting sidesaddle on a dolphin alice also did her own naked ladies refusing to copy any of oles stencils tattoo oles naked ladies had an element that bothered her the slim vestige of pubic hair on his women was arched like an upsidedown eyebrow like a smile with a vertical line slashed through it there was often more evidence of hair in the ladies armpits but the only criticism alice would make to oles face was that she preferred her naked ladies from the back side oles other apprentice lars madsen who was called ladies man lars or ladies man madsen was a semiconfident young man who told alice he liked his naked ladies any way he could get them from the front side and the back side he said alice would generally respond if at all by saying not around jack the boy liked ladies man lars jacks mom had almost never taken him to the chinamans shop in toronto although jack knew a lot about her skills and training as a tattoo artist his mother had never been keen for him to see her work but there was no lottie to look after the boy in copenhagen and until tattoo ole found them two rooms with a bath in the chambermaids quarters of the hotel dangleterre jack and his mom slept in the tattoo parlor at nyhavn im sleeping in the needles again daughter alice would say as if she had mixed feelings about it despite reservations she had let jack play with the electric machine before to the boys eyes it resembled a pistol although its sound is more comparable to that made by a dentists drill and it is capable of making more than two thousand jabs a minute until jack and alice went to copenhagen what little needlework jack had been allowed to do was practiced on an orange or a grapefruitand only once because his mom said fresh fish were expensive on a flounder a fresh flounder aberdeen bill had told alice was the closest approximation to human skin but ladies man lars let jack practice on him lars madsen was a little younger than jacks mother but he was a whole lot greener as an apprentice maybe that was why he was generous to the boy after tattoo ole saw the needlework alice could do poor lars was strictly limited to shading with some exceptions ole and alice let lars color in their outlines but ladies man madsen let jack outline him this was a bold even a reckless thing for lars to let a fouryearold do fortunately jack was restricted to the area of madsens ankles where some scratcher a bad tattooist had etched the names of two former girlfriends which were now an impediment to larss love lifeor so he believed the boy was given the task of covering up the old girlfriends names actually twenty percent of all tattoos are coverupsand half the unwanted tattoos in the world incorporate someones name ladies man madsen who was blond and blueeyed with a gaptoothed smile and a crooked nose from a lost fight had one ankle wreathed with small red hearts budding on a green thorny branchas if an errant rosebush had grown hearts instead of flowers the other ankle was encircled by black links of chain the name entwined on and around the branch was kirsten linked to the chain was the name elise with the tattoo machine vibrating in his small hand and making his first penetrating contact with human skin the boy must have borne down too hard the client unless drunk is not supposed to bleed and madsen had been drinking nothing stronger than coffee the needles should not draw bloodprovided they puncture the skin no deeper than one sixtyfourth of an inch or even one thirtysecond jack obviously went deeper than that with poor lars the ladies man was a good sport about it but with the thin sprinkling of the ink and the surprisingly more vivid spatter of the blood there was a lot to wipe away madsen was not only bleeding he was glistening with vaseline that lars didnt complain was more than a testimony to his youth he must have had a crush on alicepossibly he was trying to win her affection by sacrificing his ankles to jack while alice was in her early twenties and lars in his late teens at their age almost any difference takes on an unwarranted magnitude moreover madsens facial hair did little to help his cause he wore with a misplaced arrogance the merest wisp of a goatee which seemed not so much a beard as an oversight in shaving the madsen family business was fish selling them not tattooing them the fish business was not one that ladies man lars longed to join his talent at tattooing may have been limited but in the tattoo world lars madsen had found a measure of independence from his family and the world of fish he rinsed his hair with freshsqueezed lemon juice every time he shampooed the problem was not unlike kirsten and elise the former girlfriends who clung to his ankles lars believed that the smell of his familys business had permeated even the roots of his hair tattoo ole closely examined jacks coverup of kirstenthe one entwined with hearts and thornsand announced that herbert hoffmann in hamburg could not have done better despite this accolade lars madsen kept bleeding alices method of covering up letters consisted of leaves and berries out of every letter she told jack you could construct a leaf or a berryor an occasional flower petal some letters had more round parts than others you could make a berry out of anything that was round the letters with angles instead of round parts made better leaves than berries a flower petal could be either pointed or round kirsten yielded more leaves than berries and one unlikely flower petal together with the untouched hearts and thorns this left larss left ankle wreathed with a confused bouquet it looked as if many small animals had been butchered their hearts scattered in an unruly garden jack had higher hopes for covering up elise but those black links of chain made a startling background to any combination of leaves and berriesbesides an e is not easily converted to anything remotely resembling vegetation the fouryearold had chosen a sprig of holly for his second effort on human skin the sharp pointed leaves and the brightred berries struck him as ideal for a name as short as elise yet the result called to mind a destroyed christmas decoration that someone had mockingly affixed to a chainlink fence nevertheless tattoo oles only comment was that the legendary les skuse in bristol would have been envious of jacks needlework this was high praise indeed only ole making some remark about aberdeen bill sitting up in his grave to take notice could have been more flattering but ole knew alice was sensitive to references that placed her dad in his grave shed not been there to scatter his ashes through the fence guarding the graveyard at south leith parish church although her father had arranged for a fisherman to scatter his ashes in the north sea instead and ole only once mentioned the sad fact that aberdeen bill had drunk himself to death which every tattoo artist in the north sea knew was it his daughters disgraceher running off to halifax to have her wee one out of wedlockthat drove him to drink or had aberdeen bill always been a drinker given the weekend when everything went wrong in aberdeen maybe his daughters departure had merely exacerbated the problem daughter alice never spoke of it tattoo ole never brought the subject up again either jack burns grew up with hearsay and gossip and the boy got a good dose of both at nyhavn in typical fouryearold fashion jack had left to his mother the cleaning up and bandaging of the ladies mans ankles a tattoo usually heals itself you keep it covered for a few hours then wash it with some nonperfumed soap you never soak it you should use a moisturizer ole told jack that a new tattoo felt like a sunburn while the fouryearolds coverups may have failed in the aesthetic sense the names of those two girlfriends were successfully concealed that ladies man madsen had encircled his ankles with a shrub of what looked like body partsworse with what tattoo ole called antichristmas propagandawas another matter poor lars while ole had nicknamed him ladies man the opposite seemed true jack never saw him with a girl or heard him speak of one naturally the boy never met kirsten or eliseonly their names which he covered in ink and blood like any fouryearold jack burns didnt pay close attention to adult conversations the boys understanding of linear time might have been on a level with an elevenyearolds but what he understood of his fathers story came from those private little talks hed had with his mothernot what he managed to overhear of alices dialogue with other grownups in those conversations jack drifted in and out he didnt listen like an elevenyearold at all even ladies man lars remembered meeting william burns although tattoo ole had done the needlework and there was no shading of the musical notes williams tattoos were all in black there was only outlining apparently everything about him was all in black as ole put it what jack might have made of this was that his father wore allblack clothesthat is if the boy registered the remark at all given oles fondness for daughter alice the blackness might have been a reference to williams unfaithful heart as for oles nickname for jacks dad the boy had correctly overheard the tattooer call him the music man ole had transferred some christmas music by bach to williams right shoulder where the tattoo lay unfurled like a piece ripped from a flag either bachs weihnachtsoratorium or his kanonische veränderungen über das weihnachtslied alice guessed she knew many of the pieces the young organist liked to play and in the area of williams kidneys an especially painful place to be tattooed ole had reproduced a rather lengthy and complicated phrase by handel more christmas music ole said dismissively alice wondered if it came from the christmas section in the messiah tattoo ole was critical of two of williams previous tattoosnot aberdeen bills work of course ole much admired the easter hymn on the music mans right thigh and there was what appeared to be a fragment of another hymn which wrapped his left calf like a sock missing its foot this one had words as well as music and ladies man madsen had been so struck by the tattoo that he even remembered the words they are sung throughout the anglican communion breathe on me breath of god alice knew the rest it sounded more like a chant than a hymn but she called it a hymn which she said was simply a prayer put to music she had sung it to jack shed even practiced it with william by both oles and larss high esteem of the breathofgod tattoo alice surmised this would have been charlie snows or sailor jerrys work her old friends had spared her the details of the tattoos theyd given william in halifax lars was less critical of the music mans two bad tattoos than tattoo ole was but the ladies man agreed that the needlework was not impressive there was more music on williams left hip but the tattooer had not anticipated how the bending of williams waist would scrunch some of the notes together on the slim evidence of this description alice decided hed been to see beachcomber bill in torontoalthough she later admitted that the chinaman was also capable of such a miscalculation the second mistake where some notes were lost from view because they curled around the underarm side of williams right biceps could have been committed by either of those men from tattoo ole and ladies man madsen jack and his mom had a pretty good idea of the music mans bodyinprogress he was an ink addict all righta collector as aberdeen bill had predicted but what about his music alice asked what about it tattoo ole replied he must be playing the organ somewhere alice said i assume he has a job jack burns remembered the silence with a fair amount of accuracy if not the conversation that followed for one thing it was never what you would call quiet in tattoo oles shop the radio was always tuned to a popularmusic station and at the moment jacks mom raised the issue of his dads whereabouts which even at four jack recognized as the centermost issue of her life there were three tattoo machines in operation tattoo ole was working on one of his naked ladiesa mermaid without the inverted eyebrow that alice disapproved of the recipient an old sailor appeared to be asleep or dead he lay unmoving while ole outlined the scales on the mermaids tail it was a fishtail with a womans hips which alice also disapproved of ladies man madsen was also hard at work shading one of oles sea serpents on a swedish man it must have been a constrictor because it was squeezing a bursting heart alice was applying the finishing touches to her signature rose of jericho this one was a beauty that half covered the heart side of a boys rib cage to alice he looked too young to know what a rose of jericho was jack was much too young to know what one was the way it had been explained to him was that a rose of jericho was a rose with something hidden inside it a rose with a mystery his mother had told him concealed in the petals of the rose are those of that other flower you can discern a vagina in a rose of jericho but only if you know what you are looking for as jack would one day learn the harder to spot the vagina the better the tattoo and in a good rose of jericho when you do locate the vagina it really pops out at you three tattoo machines make quite a racket and the boy getting the rose of jericho had been audibly crying for some time alice had warned him that the pain of a tattoo on the rib cage radiates all the way to the shoulder but when alice said i assume he has a job jack thought the electricity had failed even the radio fell quiet how can three tattooers without a word or signal to one another take their feet off their respective foot switches simultaneously nevertheless the three machines stopped the flow of ink and pain was halted the comatose sailor opened his eyes and looked at the unfinished mermaid on his reddening forearm the swede getting the color in his heartsqueezing serpentover his heart of all placesgave lars a questioning look the weeping boy held his breath was his rose of jericho not to mention his agony finally over only the radio started up again even in danish jack recognized the particular christmas carol since no one had answered her alice repeated her inquiry he must be playing the organ somewhere she said again i assume he has a job he had one tattoo ole said with that change of tense jack wondered if they had once more arrived too late to catch his dad but the fouryearold might have misunderstood he was surprised that his mother didnt betray her disappointment her foot was back on the switch and she went on about her business hiding the rosered labia among the flower petals the roseofjericho boy commenced to moan the old sailor who was patient about acquiring his mermaid closed his eyes lars forever engaged in coloringin saw to it that the serpents grip on the heart over the swedes own heart appeared to tighten the walls of tattoo oles shop were covered with stencils and handpainted drawings these possible tattoos were called flash jack occupied himself by staring at a wall of flash while ole elaborated on the abscondingfather story this was one of those moments when the boys attention wandered he was playing the organ at kastelskirken ole said mind you he wasnt the head guy the assistant organist i suppose alice ventured like an apprentice lars offered yes but he was good tattoo ole said i admit i never heard him play but i heard he was quite the player quite the ladies man too we heard lars began not around jack alice told him the area of flash on the wall that had caught jacks eye was what they called mans ruin they were all tattoos on the theme of various selfdestructions peculiar to mengambling drink and women the boy liked best the one of a martini glass with a womans breast just the nipple protruding from the drink like an olive or the one that similarly portrayed a womans bare bum in both cases floating in the glasslike ice cubeswere a pair of dice jacks mother did a swell mans ruin a little different from these in her version a naked womanseen naturally from the back sideis drinking from a halffull bottle of wine the dice are in the palm of the womans hand so there was some trouble at kastelskirken alice asked ladies man madsen nodded enviously not around jack was tattoo oles answer i see alice said not a choirgirl ole offered she was one of the parishioners a military mans young wife said ladies man lars but jack must have misheard him the boy was still staring openmouthed at the womans nipple in the martini glass as dumbstruck as if he were watching television he didnt see his mother give lars a notaroundjack look so hes left town alice asked you should inquire at the church ole told her i dont suppose you heard where he went alice said i heard stockholm but i dont know ole answered lars who had finished with the swedes sea serpent said he wont get a decent tattoo in stockholm the swedes come here to get tattooed lars looked quickly at the swede isnt that right the swede proceeded to pull up the left leg of his pants i got this in stockholm he said there on his calf was quite a good tattoogood enough to have been one of tattoo oles or daughter alices a dagger with an ornate greenandgold handle had been thrust through a rose both the petals of the rose and the hilt of the dagger were edged with orange and twisted around the rose and the dagger was a greenandred snake evidently the swede was fond of serpents jack could tell by his moms expression that she admired the needlework even tattoo ole agreed it was good ladies man madsen was speechless with envy or perhaps he was imagining his nearcertain future in the family fish business doc forest did it the swede said what shop is he in ole asked i didnt know stockholm had a shop said lars he works out of his home the swede reported jack knew that stockholm was not on their itinerary it wasnt on his moms list alice was gingerly bandaging the boy with the sore ribs he had wanted the rose of jericho on his rib cage so that the petals of the flower would move when he breathed promise me you wont show this to your mother alice said to the boy or if you do dont tell her what it is make sure she doesnt take a long look i promise the boy told her the old sailor was flexing his forearm admiring how the contractions of his muscles moved the mermaids tail which still needed to be colored in it was almost christmas the tattoo business was good but the apparent news that william had escapedto stockholm of all placesdid little to lift alices holiday spirits or jacks and it was always dark when they left the shop on nyhavn even at four or five in the afternoon whatever time it was the restaurants on nyhavn were already cooking by now jack and alice could distinguish the smells the rabbit the leg of deer the wild duck the roasted turbot the grilled salmon even the delicate veal they could smell the stewed fruit in the sauces for the game and many of those danish cheeses were strong enough to smell from a winter street for good luck they always counted the ships moored along the canal perhaps because it was almost christmastime the lighted arch that stood over the statue in the square by the dangleterre seemed to them an abiding kind of protection the hotel itself was decorated with lighted christmas wreaths on the way to their chambermaids rooms jack and his mom often stopped for a christmas beer the beer was dark and sweet but strong enough that alice diluted jacks with water one of alices clients at tattoo olesa banker who had different denominations of foreign currency tattooed on his back and chesttold her that christmas beer was good for children because it prevented nightmares the boy had to admit that since hed been drinking it the bankers remedy for bad dreams seemed plausible either hed not had a nightmare in a while or hed not had one he could remember in jacks dreams he missed lottiehow she had hugged him without reservation how theyd held their breath and felt their hearts beating chesttochest one night at the dangleterre jack had tried to hug his mom that way alice had been impatient about holding her breath feeling the thump of her heart which seemed to beat at a slower more measured pace than lotties jack said you must be alive mom well of course i am alice replied with more detectable impatience than she had demonstrated when hed asked her to hold her breath you must be alive too jackieat least you were the last time i looked without his knowing exactly how or when she had already managed to extricate herself from the boys embrace the next day before the sun was upin copenhagen at that time of year this could have been after eight oclock in the morningjacks mother took him to the frederikshavn citadel kastellet the historic fortification was called in addition to the soldiers barracks there was the commandants house and the citadel churchthe kastelskirken where william burns had played is there a boy who doesnt love a fort how exciting for jack that his mom had brought him to a real one he was more than happy to amuse himself as alice asked him to do i would like to have some privacy when i speak to the organist was how she put it jack was given the run of the place his first discovery was the jail it was behind the citadel church where a prison aisle ran along the church wall there were listening holes in the wall to enable the prisoners to hear the church service without being seen it was a disappointment to jack that there were no prisonersonly empty cells the organists name was anker rasmussena typical danish nameand according to alice he was both respectful and forthcoming jack later found it odd that the organist was in uniform but his mother would explain that a soldiermusician was what one might expect to find in a citadel church during williams brief apprenticeship to rasmussen the young man had mastered several bach sonatas as well as bachs präludium und fuge in b moll and his klavierübung iii jack was impressed that his mom could remember the german names of the pieces his dad had learned to play william was quite the hand at couperins messe pour les couvents too and alice had been right about the christmas section from handels messiah as for the seduced parishioner the military mans young wife jacks mother told him littleonly enough that the boy assumed his father hadnt been asked to leave kastelskirken for flubbing a refrain when jack tired of the jail he walked outside it was freezing cold the mediumgray daylight merely darkened the sky while the boy was thrilled to see the soldiers marching about he kept his distance from them and went to have a look at the moat the water around kastellet was called the kastelsgraven to a fouryearolds eyes the moat was more of a pond or a small lakeand to jacks great surprise the water was frozen hed been told in tattoo oles shop that the nyhavn canal rarely froze and that the baltic sea almost never froze except in only the coldest weather seawater didnt freeze what then was in the moat it had to be freshwater but jack knew only that the water in the moat was frozen there are few wonders to a child that equal black ice and how did the fouryearold know the water was frozen because the gulls and ducks were walking on it and he didnt think the birds were holy just to be sure jack found a small stone and threw it at them the stone bounced across the ice only the gulls took flight the ducks raced to the stone as if they thought it might be bread then they waddled away from it the gulls returned to the ice soon the ducks sat down as if they were having a meeting and the gulls walked disdainfully around them at times far away at other times marching nearer the soldiers tramped around and around there was a wooden rampart near the frozen moats edge it was like a thin wooden road with sloped sides jack easily climbed down it the roundeyed staring of the gulls taunted him the ducks just plain ignored him when the boy stepped onto that black ice he felt he had found something more mysterious than his missing father he was walking on water even the ducks began to watch him when jack reached the middle of the moat he heard what he thought was the organ in the citadel churchjust some low notes not what he would have called music maybe the organist was calling upon the notes to enhance a story he was telling alice but jack had never heard notes so low on the scale it wasnt the organ the kastelsgraven itself was singing to the boy the frozen pond was protesting his presence the moat around the old fort had detected an intruder before the ice cracked it moanedthe cracks themselves were as loud as gunshots a spiderweb blossomed at jacks feet he heard the soldiers yelling before he felt the frigid water the boys head went under for only a second or two his hands reached up and caught a shelf of ice above him he rested his elbows on this shelf but he hadnt the strength to pull himself out of the waternor would the shelf of ice have held his weight all jack could do was stay exactly where he was half in and half out of the freezing moat the gulls and ducks were put to flight by the racket of the soldiers boots on the wooden rampart the soldiers were shouting instructions in danish a bell in a barracks was ringing the commotion had brought alice and a man jack assumed was the organist in a crisis of this kind what good is an organist jack was thinking but anker rasmussen if thats who he was at least looked more like a military man than a musician alice was screaming hysterically jack worried that she would think this was all his fathers fault in a way it was the boy considered his own rescue struck him as uncertain after all if the ice hadnt held him how would it hold one of the soldiers then jack saw him the littlest soldier hed not been among the first of the soldiers to arrive maybe anker rasmussen had fetched him from one of the barracks he wasnt in uniformonly in his long underwear as if hed been asleep or was sick and had been convalescing he was already shivering as he started out across the ice to jackinching his way as jack imagined all soldiers had been trained to do on his elbows and his stomach he dragged his rifle by its shoulder strap which he clenched in his chattering teeth when the soldier had crawled to the hole jack had made in the ice he slid the rifle toward jackbuttend first jack was able to grasp the shoulder strap in both hands while the soldier took hold of the barrel at the bayonetend and pulled the boy out of the water and across the ice to him jacks eyebrows were already frozen and he could feel the ice forming in his hair when he was on the surface again he tried to get to all fours but the littlest soldier yelled at him stay on your stomach he shouted that he spoke english didnt surprise jack the surprise was that he didnt have a soldiers voice to jack the soldier sounded like a fellow childa boy not yet a teenager as if jack were a sled he lay flat and let the littlest soldier pull him across the frozen moat to the ramparts edge where alice was waiting his mom hugged and kissed himthen she suddenly slapped him it was the only time jack burns remembered his mother striking him and the second she did so she burst into tears without hesitation he reached for her hand jack was wrapped in blankets and carried to the commandants house although he didnt remember meeting the commandant the littlest soldier himself found clothes for jack they were too big for him but jack was more surprised that they were civilian clothesnot a soldiers uniform soldiers also have offduty clothes jack his mom explainednot an easy concept for a fouryearold when jack and his mother were leaving kastellet alice kissed the littlest soldier goodbye she had to bend down to do it jack saw him standing on his toes to meet her kiss halfway that was when jack got the idea that his mom should offer his rescuer a free tattoosurely soldiers like sailors were fond of tattoos alice seemed amused at the notion she approached the littlest soldier again this time bending down to whisper in his ear instead of kissing him he was certainly excited by what she said her offer clearly appealed to him it turned out that jack and alice had more reason to go to stockholm than to meet the talented doc forest anker rasmussen told alice that the organist at the hedvig eleonora church in stockholm erik erling had died three years ago hed been replaced by a brilliant twentyfouryearold torvald torén torén was rumored to be looking for an assistant alice expressed surprise that william would seek a position as an assistant to an organist younger than he was anker rasmussen took a different view william was clever and talented enough to be a good organist now was the time for him to travel to play on different organs to pick up what he could learn or steal from other organists in rasmussens opinion it was not just the trouble with women that kept motivating william to move on jacks mother told him that she was disconcerted by anker rasmussens theories she had fallen in love with william burns because of how he played the organ yet shed not considered that the instrument itself had seduced him did william restlessly need to be around a bigger and better organ or at least a different one was it in the tradition of the way a young girl can love horses no doubt it further disconcerted alice to realize that william might have liked trading mentors as much as he liked trading women jack assumed they would be leaving for stockholm right away but his mother had other ideas through the christmas holiday there was much money to be made at tattoo oles if a tattoo artist as good as doc forest was working out of his home in stockholm tattooing was barely legal there alice decided that it wouldnt be easy for her to make money in stockholm she thought she should take advantage of the holiday season at tattoo oles before she and jack continued their journey at nyhavn they said a prolonged goodbye jack didnt remember posing for a photograph there on the street in front of tattoo oles but the sound of the camera shutter was overfamiliar to him obviously someone was snapping pictures alice was so popular with the clients many of them sailors on christmas leave that she worked until late at night ladies man madsen was less in demand he often walked jack to the dangleterre while alice tattooed on lars would sit on the bed in jacks room while the boy brushed his teeth then the ladies man would tell jack a story until jack fell asleep madsens stories never kept jack awake for long they were selfpitying tales of lars himself as a child mostly misadventures with fish which struck jack as easily avoidable yet these catastrophes were of immeasurable importance to lars while the boy slept in the narrower of the chambermaids rooms which was divided from his mothers bedroom by a bathroom with two sliding doors ladies man madsen read magazines on the toilet jack sometimes woke and saw larss silhouette through the frosted glass of the bathroom door often he fell asleep on the toilet with his head on his knees and alice would have to wake him up when she came home at his request alice gave lars a tattoo he wanted a broken heart above his own heart which he claimed was broken too alice gave him a blushingred heart torn in half horizontally the jagged edges of the tear left a bare band of skin wide enough for a name but both alice and tattoo ole urged ladies man madsen against a name the rippedapart heart all by itself was evidence enough of his pain lars however wanted alices name she refused your hearts not broken because of me she declared but maybe it was what i meant said ladies man madsen summoning an unexpected dignity was that i wanted your tattoo name aha signature tattoo cried tattoo ole well okaythats different alice told lars on the very white skin between the pieces of his torn heart she needled her name in cursive daughter alice for his thoughtful care of jack alice was grateful to the ladies man theres no charge she told him as she bandaged his broken heart jack didnt know what gift his mom might have made to ole perhaps there was no gift for olenot even alices coveted rose of jericho which tattoo ole much admired their last night in copenhagen ole closed the shop early and took them to dinner at a fancy restaurant on nyhavn there was an open fireplace and jack had the rabbit jack how can you eat peter cottontail his mom asked let him enjoy it lars told her you know what jack tattoo ole said that cant be peter cottontail because danish rabbits dont wear clothes they just get tattooed cried ladies man madsen when no one was looking jack scrutinized the rabbit for tattoos but didnt find any the boy went on eating but he must not have had enough christmas beer that night very late he had a nightmare he woke up naked and shivering he had just fallen through the ice and drowned in the kastelsgraven more terrible jack was joined in death at the bottom of the moat by centuries of soldiers who had drowned there before him the cold water had perfectly preserved them illogically the littlest soldier was among the dead as always the light in the bathroom had been left onas a nightlight for jack he slid open the two doors of frosted glass and entered his mothers bedroom whenever he had a bad dream he was permitted to crawl into bed with her but someone had beaten him to it at the foot of his moms bed which was as narrow as his own he saw her upturned toes protruding from the bedcovers between her feet jack saw the soles of two more feetthese toes were pointed down at first for no comprehensible reason the boy believed it was ladies man madsen but closer inspection of the strangers bare feet revealed to jack two untattooed ankles also the feet between his mothers feet were too small to belong to lars they were even smaller than his momsthey were almost as small as jacks in the light from the bathroom something else caught the boys eye on the chair where his mother often put her clothes was a soldiers uniform which jack thought was about his size however when he put the uniform on it was bigger than hed estimated he had to roll up the cuffs of the pants and cinch the belt in its last notch and the shoulders of the shirt and jacket were much too broad the epaulets touched his upper armsthe sleeves entirely covered his hands if hed had to guess jack would have said that the littlest soldiers uniform was at least a size larger than his civilian clothesthe ones jack had borrowed to wear following his misadventure in the moat the soldiers offduty clothes his mom had called them undaunted by this clothing mystery which seemed of no consequence at the time jack was determined to stand at attention at his mothers bedside when she and the littlest soldier woke up jack would salute themas soldiers do given the costume and the boys intentions his mom would later refer to this episode as jacks first acting job but while he was standing there at attention he realized they were not asleep the gentle movement of the bed had at first escaped his notice although his mothers eyes were closed she was awake her lips were parted her breathing was rapid and shallow and the muscles of her neck were straining all that could be seen of the littlest soldier was his feet he must have been lying with his head between alices breasts which were under the covers he was probably recovering from a nightmare or so jack deduced that would explain the quivering of the bed besides jack knew it was a night for bad dreams having just had one himself it seemed perfectly obvious to the boy that the soldier had suffered one too and had therefore climbed into bed with his mom jack no doubt still thought of the soldier as a fellow child suddenly the littlest soldiers nightmare returned with a vengeance he violently kicked the covers offjack saw his bare bum in the bathroom lightand alice must have squeezed him too hard because he whimpered and groaned that was when her eyes opened and jacks mom saw him standing thereanother little soldier this one at attention alice didnt recognize her son at first it must have been the uniform her scream was a shock to jack as it was to the littlest soldier when he saw the fouryearold in uniform he screamed too he sounded like a little boy again and jack was suddenly so afraid of the mutual nightmare they must have been having that he too began screaming he also peed in his pantsactually in the littlest soldiers pants jackie his mother cried when she caught her breath i dreamed i drowned in the moat jack began dead soldiers from the past were with me you were there too he told the littlest soldier the soldier didnt look so little now jack was astonished at the size of his penis it was half as long as the bayonet on the rifle hed used to rescue jack and it was thrust forward at an upward angle in the manner of a bayonet too you better go alice told the littlest soldier true to his calling he took orders well he marched straightaway into the bathroom without a word of protest and when hed done his business there he came back to alices bedroom to fetch his clothes jack had taken off the soldiers uniform folded it neatly on the chair and crawled into bed with his mom together they watched the littlest soldier dress himself jack was embarrassed about pissing in his rescuers pants and he could tell the exact moment when the little hero discovered what had happened an expression of uncertainty and distress was on his facenot unlike the anxiety and discomfort jack had seen there when the brave lad was inching across the thinly frozen moat in his long underwear but after all he was a soldier he gave jack a glance of vast understanding and grudging respect as if the boys peeing in his pants struck him as appropriate to the situation and before he left the littlest soldier gave jack and his mother what jack had intended to give them a proper salute despite having seen him stark naked jack hadnt noticed a tattoonot even a bandage the boy thought about it in lieu of falling back to sleepwhich would in all probability return him to his nightmare about drowning in the kastelsgraven he asked his mom his troubling question did you give him a free tattoo i didnt see one i certainly did give him one she replied with some hesitation you just missed it what was it jack asked it was a little soldier she answered with more hesitation it was even littler than him having seen his halfabayonet of a penis jack had revised his impression of how little the soldier was but all he said to his mother was where did you put it on one of his anklesthe left one she said the boy thought that the bathroom light must have been playing tricks on him because hed looked closely at the soldiers ankles and hadnt seen a tattoo there he assumed that hed just missed it as his mom had said jack fell asleep in her arms as he often did after nightmaresand not at all in such an uncomfortablelooking position as the one the littlest soldier had taken up with her that was copenhagen which jack burns wouldnt visit again for almost thirty years but he would never forget tattoo ole and ladies man madsen and their kindness to his mom and him or the frozen moatthe kastelsgraven which almost claimed him or the littlest soldier who saved himand by so doing saved his mother too in reality jack understood little of what had happened there although he didnt know it a pattern had begun at the time he had lots to learn especially in those areas his mom kept largely to herselfnot only the meaning of a free tattoo but all the other things as well and when he had that nightmare about drowning in the moat it was always the same he had already drowned there was no more struggle only a lasting cold in eternity jack was joined by centuries of europes dead soldiers the little hero whod saved him stood out among themnot for the disproportionate size of his penis but for the stoic quality of his frozen salute rescued by a swedish accountant one day when jack was older he would ask his mother why his father hadnt gone to englandwhy theyd not looked for him there after all england has its share of women and organsand a longestablished history of tattooing as well alice simply said that william was scots enough to hate the english he would never have gone to england for a woman let alone for an organnot even for a tattoo but william burns wasnt quite scots enough to have kept the callum was he from copenhagen alice and jack took the ferry across the sound to malmö and then the train to stockholm in sweden in january the hours of daylight are few it was the new year it seemed that william had gone underground not long after his arrival and doc forest wouldnt open his first tattoo parlor for two years doc was almost as hard to find as william burns alice and jack went first to the hedvig eleonora church the building was a glowing dome of gold surrounded by tombstones in the snow the altar and the altar rail were also gold the organ façade was a greenish gold and the pews were painted a graygreen colora faint silvery tint not as dark as moss the glass in the paired symmetrical windows of the rotunda was uncolored as somber as the winter light the hedvig eleonora was the most beautiful church jack had ever seen it was lutheran with a fine choir tradition this time william had made the fond acquaintance of three choirgirls before the first learned of the third although it was the second choirgirl ulrika who exposed him surely the other two astrid and vendela were just as upset until then william had been doing rather wellassisting torvald torén on the organ at the hedvig eleonora and studying composition at the royal college of music in stockholm poor astrid ulrika and vendelajack later wished he could have met them he remembered meeting torvald torén even to jack torén seemed young twentyfour is young and torén was a slight man with quick movements and lively eyes jack had the feeling that his mom was as utterly disarmed by torén as she was by his devastating news of the three choirgirls and unlike many organists jack would meet torvald torén was well dressed the boy was struck by the businesslike efficiency of toréns black briefcase too given his youth his alert presence his bright futurehe was teaching the organ to a few carefully selected studentsalice may have seen in torén all the promise that william had once embodied jack thought at the time that it might have been hard for his mom to say goodbye to torvald torén as jack and alice were leaving the hedvig eleonora the boy saw his mother turning to look at that golden altarand out in the snow in what struck them both as stockholms perpetual darkness alice kept glancing over her shoulder at the lighted dome of the church but jack had heard very little of alices conversation with torén the church itself and the young organists appearance had completely captured the fouryearolds attention here they had yet to find doc forest and william was already underground but alice believed that william was incapable of passing through a port without being tattooed and somewhere in stockholm there was at least one good tattoo artist just possibly doc forest might know where william had gone if only to distract himself from the pain a man getting a complicated tattoo is inclined to talk in the meantime while they were trying to find doc forest alice was spending a fair amount of money they were staying at the grand which was the best hotel in stockholm their room faced the old town and the water with a view of the wharf where the boats to and from the archipelago docked jack would remember posing with one of those ships as if he were the captain just stepping ashore he knew the hotel was expensive because his mom said so on a postcard she sent to mrs wicksteed which she read out loud to him but alice had a plan the grand was near the opera and the theaterpeople met there for drinks and dinner local businessmen had breakfast and lunch there too and the lobby of the grand was both bigger and less gloomy than the lobby of the dangleterre jack lived in that lobby as if the hotel were his castle and he was the grands little prince alices plan was simple but for a while it worked jack and alice had few dressy clothes and they wore them day and night their laundry bill was expensive too looking most unlike the solicitors they were they ate a huge breakfast every morning the buffet was included with the price of their room it was their only complete meal of the day while they gorged themselves they would try to spot the tattooseekers among the wellheeled people eating breakfast they skipped lunch few people at the grand ate lunch alone and alice knew that the decision to get a tattoo was a solitary one you didnt make a commitment to be marked for life in the company of colleagues or friends in most cases they tried to talk you out of it in the early evening jack stayed alone in the hotel room snacking on cold cuts and fruit while his mom checked out the potential tattoo clients at the bar later at night after jack had gone to bed alice would order the least expensive appetizer in the dining room at the grand apparently many hotel guests ate their dinners alonetraveling businessmen in alices estimation her approach to a potential client was always the same do you have a tattoo shed even mastered this in swedish har ni någon tatuering if the answer was yes she would ask is it a doc forest but no one had heard of him and the answer to the first question was usually no when a potential client said he or she didnt have a tattoo alice asked the next questionin english first in swedish if she had to would you like one skulle ni vilja ha en most people said no but some would say maybe maybe was good enough for aliceall she ever needed was her pretty foot in the door when jack couldnt sleep he recited this dialogue it worked better for him than thinking about lottie or counting sheep maybe what made jack burns an actor was that he never forgot these lines i have the room and the equipment if you have the time jag har rum och utrustning om ni har tid how long does it take hur lång tid tar det that depends det beror på how much does it cost vad kostar det that depends too det beror också på jack would wonder one day at the line i have the room and the equipment if you have the time were those traveling businessmen whom alice solicited alone ever confused by her intentions the one lady who said she wanted a tattoo wanted nothing of the kind not only was she surprised to find a fouryearold in alices hotel room she wanted him to leave alice refused to send jack away the lady who was neither young nor pretty seemed greatly offended she spoke english very wellin fact she may have been englishand she was the likeliest source of the hotel manager discovering that alice was giving tattoos in her hotel room the tattoo machines the pigments the power pack the foot switch the little paper cups the alcohol and witch hazel and glycerine the vaseline and paper towelsthere was such a lot of stuff yet everything was put away completely out of sight when the maid came as underground as tattooing was in stockholm alice knew that the grand would not have been happy to discover she was earning an income at that enterprise there though he later suspected that the trouble with the hotel manager probably came from the englishspeaking lesbian at the time jack wasnt aware of the negotiations that transpired between his mother and the manager he simply observed that his moms attitude toward the grand abruptly changed she began to say things like if i dont get a lead on doc forest today were out of here tomorrowalthough they continued to stay and jack often woke at night to find her absent he was too young to tell the time but it seemed to him that it was very late at night for anyone to be having dinner in the dining room so where was alice on those nights was she giving a free tattoo to the hotel manager they were lucky to meet the accountant jack would soon wonder if in every town his mother needed to meet someone in order for them to be saved it was a little anticlimactic to be rescued by an accountant especially after encountering such a hero as the littlest soldier naturally not knowing he was an accountant jack and his mom spotted him in the grand at breakfast torsten lindberg was his name and he was so thin that he seemed in need of more than a meal but breakfast was a huge event for him as it was for jack and alice theyd noticed him not because he looked like a potential tattoo client but because he had heaped on his plate a plattersize serving of herringjack and alice hated herringand lindberg was making his way through the fishy mound with remarkable relish with no thought of asking this tall lugubriouslooking man if he had a tattoo or wanted one jack and his mother watched him eat spellbound by his appetite they couldnt help but wonder if the breakfast buffet at the grand was his only complete meal of the day too at least in his appetite if not in his taste for herring he seemed a kindred soul probably they were staring that would explain why torsten lindberg began to stare at them he said later that he couldnt help but notice how much they were eatingjust not the herring as a shrewd accountant he might have guessed that they were trying to keep their expenses down jack had carefully removed the mushrooms from his threeegg omelet hed saved them for his mom shed finished her crêpes and had saved her melon balls for him lindberg plowed on devouring his archipelago of herring whoever thinks accountants are pennypinchers and emotional misers not to mention joyless in the presence of children never met torsten lindberg when his great meal was finishedbefore jack and alice were through with their breakfast because they were still scouting the café for potential tattoo clientslindberg paused at their table and smiled benevolently at jack he said something in swedish and the boy looked to his mom for help im sorryhe speaks only english alice said excellent lindberg cried as if englishspeaking children were in special need of cheering up have you ever seen a fish swim without water he asked jack no the boy replied while his dress was formala darkblue suit and necktiehis manner was that of a clown lindberg may have looked like a man attending a funeralworse like a skeleton dressed for an overlong coffinbut in presenting himself to a child he took on the magical promise of a circus performer mr lindberg removed his suit jacket which he handed to aliceboth politely and presumptuously as if she were his wife he ceremoniously unbuttoned one sleeve of his white dress shirt and rolled it up above his elbow on his forearm was the aforementioned fish without water actually it was an excellent tattoo and the fish looked very much as if it belonged there the fishs head curled around lindbergs wrist the tail extending to the bend at his elbow the tattoo covered most of his forearm it was almost certainly of japanese origin though not a carp the colors alternated between an iridescent blue and a vibrant yellow blending to an iridescent green which turned to midnight black and shanghai red as torsten lindberg tightened the muscles of his forearm and slightly rotated his wrist and lower arm the fish began to swimundulating in a downward spiral like a fantail diving for the palm of lindbergs hand well now you have mr lindberg said to jack who looked at his mother thats a pretty good tattoo she told lindberg but ill bet its no doc forest he replied calmly but without hesitation it would be awkward to show you my doc forest in a public place you know doc forest alice said of course i thought you did i only know his work alice answered you obviously know something about tattoos lindberg said with mounting excitement put your fish away alice told him i have the room and the equipment if you have the time in retrospect it disappointed jack that he and his mom never learned the swedish for put your fish away they took torsten lindberg to their hotel room where alice showed him her flash and set up her outlining machine the latter action was premature as it turned out torsten lindberg was a connoisseur he wouldnt get any tattoo on the spot first of all he insisted on showing alice his other tattoosincluding the ones on his bum not around jack alice said but he assured her that the tattoos were safe for children to see it was no doubt the crack in lindbergs ass that jacks mom hadnt wanted him to see but a thin mans bum is only a mild shock and lindberg had nothing more offensive than an eyeball on the leftside cheek and a pair of pursed lips on the right the eye appeared to be glancing sideways at the crack in his scrawny ass and the lips looked like a kiss that had been newly planted therewhen the lipstick was still wet very nice alice said in a way that let mr lindberg know she disapproved of his display he quickly pulled up his pants but he had other tattoosin fact many the public life of an accountant is generally conducted in clothes possibly none of mr lindbergs business associates knew that he was tattooedcertainly not that he had an eyeball on his ass he also had a tattoo ole which alice recognized right away it was oles naked lady with her oddly upturned eyebrow of pubic hair there was something a little different about this naked lady however jack couldnt tell what was different about it because his mother wouldnt let him have a closer look and torsten lindberg had a tattoo peter from amsterdam and a herbert hoffmann from hamburg as well but even among this august company it was the doc forest that most impressed alice on mr lindbergs narrow sunken chest was a tall clipper ship in full saila threemasted type with a fast hull and a lofty rig under its bow a sea monster was cresting the serpents head was as big as the ships mainsail the beast rose out of the sea on the port side of the bow but the tip of its tail broke water off the starboard side of the stern the doomed ship was clearly no match for this monster alice announced that doc forest had to have been a sailor in her view the sailing ship on torsten lindbergs chest was better than that homeward bound vessel on the breastbone of the late charlie snow torsten lindberg knew where doc forest livedhe promised to take jack and alice to meet him and the following day lindberg would make up his mind about what kind of tattoo to get from alice i am inclining toward a personalized version of your rose of jericho he confessed every tattooed man should have one alice told him mr lindberg didnt seem convinced he was a worrier it was the worrying more than his metabolism that kept him thin he was worried about alices situation at the grand and about jacks wellbeing in particular even in the swedish winter a boy must have exercise did jack know how to skate lindberg asked alice learning to skate had not been part of jacks canadian experience alice informed him torsten lindberg knew the remedy for that his wife skated every morning on lake mälaren she would teach jack if alice was at all alarmed at how readily mr lindberg offered his wifes skating services she didnt saynot that jack would have heard what his mother said the boy was in the bathroom he had a stomachache having eaten too much for breakfast he missed the entire skating conversation by the time jack came out of the bathroom his winter exercise had been arranged for him and it didnt strike the fouryearold as odd that his mother spoke of lindbergs wife as if shed already met the woman shes as robust as lindberg is lean jacks mom told him she could keep a beer hall singing with her relentless good cheer alice further explained to jack that mrs lindberg had no desire to be tattooed herself although she liked them well enough on lindberg a big broadshouldered woman who wore a sweater capable of containing two women the size of alice mrs lindberg took jack skating on lake mälaren as her husband had promised jack noted that agneta lindberg seemed to prefer her maiden name which was nilsson who wouldnt agree that agneta goes better with nilsson than it does with lindberg alice said to her son putting an end to that conversation what most impressed jack was how well the large woman could skate but that agneta became so quickly out of breath bothered him for someone who skated every morning she got winded in a hurry the personalized rose of jericho that torsten lindberg had selected might be a threeday jobgiven his limited availability the outlining would take nearly four hours perhaps the shading of the cleverly concealed labia would require a fourth day it was unfortunate that jacks mother didnt let him take a close look at the finished tattoo for had the boy seen what lindberg meant by a personalized version of alices rose of jericho he might have realized that there were other things that were not as they seemed lake mälaren is a large freshwater lake that discharges itself into the baltic sea right next to the old town at a place called slussen when it doesnt snow too much the lake is perfect for skating despite his experience with the thin ice on the kastelsgraven jack had no fear of falling into lake mälaren he knew that if the ice could support agneta it could easily hold him and when they skated she often took his hand in hersas assertively as lottie had while jack learned how to stop and to turn and even how to skate backward alice completed the rose of jericho on torsten lindbergs right shoulder blade it was the shoulder that he turned toward his wife when they were sleeping jacks mom told him when agneta opened her eyes upon her husband in the morning there would be a vagina hiding in a flower when he was older jack would wonder why a woman would want to wake up to thatbut tattoos were not for everybody without the torsten lindbergs of this world jacks mother wouldnt have become such a successful daughter alice when mr lindbergs rose of jericho was finished he took jack and alice to meet doc forest where doc lived was no place special but for the walls of flash in the small room where hed set up his tattoo practice alice much admired doc he was a compact man with forearms like popeyes a neatly trimmed mustache and long sideburns he was sandyhaired with bright twinkling eyes and he had indeed been a sailor hed gotten his first tattoo in amsterdam from tattoo peter doc regretted that he couldnt hire alice as his apprentice but it wasnt easy for him to find enough work to support himself in fact he was looking for a benefactor someone to help him finance a first shop as for the music manbecause of course william burns had found doc forestthis time it had been either an aria quarta or a toccata by pachelbel jacks mom told him she mentioned a swedish movie that had made some piece by pachelbel famous or maybe that was mozart alice added jack wasnt sure if she meant the music in the swedish movie or his dads tattoo but the boy was badly distracted by a snake an entire wall of flash was devoted to snakes and sea serpents and other monsters of the deep i dont suppose you have any idea where william might have gone alice said to doc forest shed outworn her welcome at the grand or maybe the manager of the grand had outworn his welcome with her hes in oslo i think doc forest said oslo alice cried there was more despair in her voice than before there cant be anyone tattooing in oslo if there is hes doing it out of his home like me doc replied oslo jacks mom said more quietly this time like stockholm oslo wasnt on their itinerary theres an organ there doc added an old onethats what he said of course there was an organ in oslo and if there was anyone good or bad tattooing thereeven if only in his homewilliam would find him did he mention which church alice asked just the organhe said it had a hundred and two stops doc forest told her well that shouldnt be too hard to find alice said more to herself than to doc or jack a theme was emerging from the wall of flash and the boy had almost grasped itsomething having to do with snakes wrapped around swords you should stay at the bristol alice torsten lindberg was saying you wont get as many clients as you got at the grand but at least the manager isnt onto you years later jack would consider all that lindberg might have meant by onto you but alice made no response other than to thank the accountant naturally she thanked doc forest too doc picked jack up in his strong arms and whispered come back and see me when youre older maybe then youll want a tattoo jack had loved the lobby of the grand and waking in the morning to the ships hornsthe commuter traffic from the archipelago hed enjoyed skating on lake mälaren with agneta nilsson the formidable mrs lindberg aside from the darkness he would have been content to stay in stockholm but he and his mom were on the move again they traveled by train to göteborg then by ship to oslo much of this journey must have been beautiful but all the boy would remember was how dark it wasand how he felt cold after all it was still january and they were way up north given all their tattoo paraphernalia they had a lot of luggage upon their arrival anywhere they never looked as if they were visiting for a short time at the hotel bristol the frontdesk clerk must have thought theyd come for an extended stay not your most expensive room alice informed the clerk but something nicenot too claustrophobic they would be needing a hand with their bags the clerk was smart enough to observe he called for a bellboy and gave jack a friendly handshake but the handshake hurt the boys fingers jack had never met a norwegian before the bristols lobby was not so grand as the grands jack hoped he wouldnt have to get used to it it didnt matter to him that the organ was an old one for all he cared the stupid organ could have had two hundred and two stops so far jack and his mom were indebted to three tattooers two organists a small soldier and a tattooed accountant in whose debt would they be next the boy wondered as they followed the bellboy and their luggage down a dark carpeted hall their hotel room at the bristol was small and airless when they checked in it was already dark outsideit almost always wasand the view from their room was of another building there were some dimly lit rooms with their curtains closed which spoke to alice of dull silent livesnot the life she had once imagined with william anyway theyd not eaten since their last breakfast at the grand the bellboy told them that the bristols restaurant was still serving but he urged them not to dally jacks mother had forewarned her son that the restaurant was no doubt expensive and they should order sparingly jack didnt much care for the bellboys suggestions you must try the cloudberries he said and of course the reindeer tongue have the salmon jack his mom said after the bellboy had gone ill split it with you that was when the boy began to crynot because his fingers still throbbed from the frontdesk clerks handshake or because he was hungry and tired and sick of hotel rooms it wasnt even because of that winter darkness special to scandinaviathe absence of light which must compel more than a few swedes and norwegians to jump into a fjord if its possible to find one thats not frozen no it was not the trip but the reason for the trip that made him cry i dont care if we find him he cried to his mother i hope we dont find him if we find him youll careitll mean something she said but if they were his fathers abandoned responsibilities didnt that mean that his dad had already expressed his disappointment with them both hadnt william rejected alice and jack and wouldnt finding him mean that he might reject them again not that the boy at four could ever have expressed these thoughts but this was what he was feelingthis was what he was crying about at his mothers insistence jack stopped crying so that they could go down to dinner well share the salmon alice told the waiter no reindeer tongue jack said no cloudberries virtually no one else was eating in the restaurant an elderly couple sat in silence that they had nothing to say to each other did not necessarily predispose them to wanting a tattoo a man was alone at a corner table he looked depressed beyond desperation a candidate for a fjord a tattoo cant save him alice said then a young couple came into the restaurant it was the first time jack saw how his mom was affected by a couple in love she looked like a surefire fjordjumper one who wouldnt even hesitate he was thin and athleticlooking with long hair to his shoulderslike a rock star only better dressedand his wife or girlfriend couldnt take her eyes or her hands off him she was a tall lanky young woman with a wide smile and beautiful breasts even at four jack burns had an eye for breasts whether they were guests at the hotel or oslo natives they were as cool as any young couple whod ever walked into tattoo oles probably theyd already been tattooed ask them jack said to his mom but she couldnt bear to look at them no she whispered not them i cant jack didnt understand what was the matter with her they were a couple in love wasnt being in love a pilgrim experience like getting your first tattoo jack had heard his mom and ole talk about those turning points in peoples lives that inspire a tattooalmost any pilgrim experience will do obviously this young couple was having one and if they were guests at the hotel theyd probably already had sex that eveningnot that jack knew in all likelihood they couldnt wait to eat their dinner so they could have sex again not even the presence of the waiter who stood ready to tell them the specials could keep them from fondling each other after the waiter had left with their order jack nudged his mom and said do you want me to ask them i know how to do it no pleasejust eat your salmon she said still whispering even in that brutal weather the young woman wore a skimpy dress and her legs were bare jack thought that they must have been staying in the hotel because no one would have gone out in such a dressnot in that weather he also thought that he spotted a tattooit might have been a birthmarkon the inside of one of her bare knees it turned out to be a bruise but that was what propelled the boy out of his chair and gave him the courage to approach the couples table his mother didnt come with him jack walked right up to that beautiful girl and said the lines he still said in his bed to help him sleep do you have a tattoo in english first but if hed spoken in swedish most norwegians would have understood him the girl seemed to think jack was telling her a joke the guy looked all around as if hed misunderstood what sort of place he was in was the boy what amounted to live entertainment jack couldnt tell if hed embarrassed the young man or what else was the matter with him it was almost as if it pained him to look at jack no the young woman answered also in english the guy shook his head maybe he didnt have a tattoo either would you like one jack asked the girljust the girl the guy shook his head again he regarded jack strangely as if hed never seen a child before but whenever jack looked at him he looked away maybe his beautiful wife or girlfriend said i have the room and the equipment if you have the time jack told her but something had distracted her neither she nor the man was looking at jack instead they were staring at his mom shed not left her table but she was crying jack didnt know what to do the girl seemingly more concerned for jack than for his mother leaned so far forward that the boy could smell her perfume how long does it take she asked him that depends jack managed to say only because he knew the lines by heart he was frightened that his mom was crying in lieu of looking at his mother jack stared at the girls breasts he became even more alarmed when he could no longer hear his mom crying how much does it cost the guy asked but not as if he were serious about getting a tattoomore like he was trying not to hurt jacks feelings that depends too alice said she had not only stopped crying she was standing right behind her son maybe some other time the guy said a certain bitterness in his voice made jack look at him again his wife or girlfriend only nodded as if something had frightened her come with me my little actor jacks mom whispered in his ear the guy for some reason had closed his eyes it was as if he didnt want to see jack go without turning around the boy reached behind him his hand the one the clerk had hurt instinctively found hers when jack burns needed to hold his mothers hand his fingers could see in the dark no luck in norway alice found few clients for tattoos in oslo among the foreign guests and restaurantgoers at the bristol those intrepid souls who accepted her offer had been tattooed before because their breakfasts at the bristol were included in the price of their room jack and his mom continued their habit of overindulging in that meal during one such exercise in overeating they met a german businessman who was traveling with his wife the german had a sailors grave on his chest a sinking ship still flying the german flag and a st pauli lighthouse on his right forearmthe solid maritime tattooing of herbert hoffmann whose shop in hamburg was just off the reeperbahn the german wanted alice to tattoo his wife who already had an eighteeninch lizard tattooed on her back after breakfast the businessmans wife selected an iridescentgreen spider from alices flash alice tattooed an allblack spiral on the german womans earlobe the spider suspended from a red thread hung out in that hollow between her collarbone and her throat ambitious work for oslo alice told the german couple alice was looking forward to meeting herbert hoffmann shed always wanted to visit st pauli hoffmann like tattoo ole and tattoo peter represented those north sea tattoos shed first seen in her dads shop she knew that tattoo ole had given herbert hoffmann his first tattoo machine and that hoffmann had been tattooed by ole and tattoo peter jacks eagerness to get a look at herbert hoffmann was less professional ole had told the boy that hoffmann had a big bird tattooed on his assthe entire left cheek of his bum was a peacock with its fan in fullfeather display and jacks curiosity about tattoo peter had less to do with his reputation as a tattoo artist than the tantalizing fact that he had one leg but if seeing the germans herbert hoffmanns made alice wish she were in hamburg she was further disappointed that she was a whole week in oslo before she got to tattoo a firsttimervirgins alice called them perhaps no one in norway was seeking a pilgrim experienceat least not of that kind or not at the bristol in their continuing gluttony at breakfast which stood in flagrant contrast to their nearstarvation tactics at lunch and dinner jack learned to prefer gravlaks to smoked salmon the cloudberries which were offered with repeated zeal to children at every meal turned out to be quite good and while it was impossible to avoid the reindeer in one form or another jack managed to resist eating the poor creatures tongue but despite limiting their lunches and dinners to appetizers and desserts the cost of their food was greater than the amount alice was earning and no one in oslo wanted to talk to them about william in norway the alleged object of williams desire and his subsequent ruin was a girl too young to be comfortably discussedeven among adults from the front entrance of the bristol the view of the oslo cathedral is slightly uphill from that perspective the first dark morning they saw it the domkirke appeared to rise out of the middle of the road at the end of the long street marked by trolley tracks but they never took the streetcar the cathedral was within easy walking distance ill bet thats the one alice said why jack asked i just bet it is the domkirke looked important enough to have an old organ with one hundred and two stops a germanmade walcker the organ had been rebuilt in and again in the exterior dated back to it had been painted gray in the original was greenand its grayness enhanced what was monumental and somber about the walckers old baroque façade the oslo cathedral was brick the dome that greenish color of turned copper and the tower clock was large and imposing the clocks face suggested an elevated selfseriousness beyond lutheran as if the buildings purpose lay more in the enshrinement of sacred relics than in the usual business of a house of worship consistent with this impression was jack and alices first encounter with the churchs interior there were no candles the cathedral was illuminated by electric lights huge chandeliers were hung from the ceilings oldfashioned bracket lamps cast a fake candlelight on the walls the altar which unmiraculously combined the lords last supper with his crucifixion was as festooned with bricabrac as an antiques shop the short squat staircase leading to the pulpit was ornate with wooden wreaths painted gold overhanging the pulpit as if the firmament itself were about to fall down was a floating island of angelssome of them playing harps no one was playing the organ not a soul was praying in a pew either leaning on her mop as if it were a cane only a cleaning woman was there to greet themand she did so warily as alice would later explain to jack no one even marginally associated with the domkirke wished to be reminded of william jack was a reminder when the cleaning woman saw the boy she froze she drew in her breath and stiffened her arms the mop held in both hands in front of her it was as if her mop were the holy cross and clinging to it for protection she hoped to fend jack off is the organist here alice asked which organist the cleaning woman cried how many are there alice replied scarcely daring to take her eyes off jack the cleaning woman told alice that a mr rolf karlsen was the organist in the domkirke he was away the word away caused jack to lose his concentration the church suddenly seemed haunted mr karlsen is a big man the cleaning woman was saying although it wasnt clear if big referred to his physical size or his importanceor both no minister of the church was present either the cleaning woman went on by now she was waving her mop like a magic wand though such was her transfixed gaping at jack that she was unaware of her efforts jack was looking everywhere for her pail which he couldnt find how can you work a mop without a pail the boy was wondering actually alice began again i was looking for a young organist a foreigner named william burns the cleaning woman closed her eyes as if in prayer or with the hopeless conviction that her mop might turn into an actual crucifix and save her she solemnly raised the mop and pointed it at jack thats his son the cleaning woman cried youd have to be blind not to recognize those eyelashes it was the first time anyone had said jack looked like his father jacks mother stared at him as if she were aware of the resemblance for the first time she seemed suddenly no less alarmed than the cleaning woman and you poor wretch must be his wife the cleaning woman told alice i once wanted to be alice answered she held out her hand to the cleaning woman and said im alice stronach and this is my son jack the cleaning woman first wiped her hand on her hip then gave alice a firm handshake jack knew how firm it was because he saw his mom wince im elsemarie lothe the woman said god bless you jack she said to the boy remembering the clerk at the front desk of the bristol jack didnt shake her outstretched hand elsemarie would not discuss the details of what had happened except to say that the entire congregation couldnt put the episode behind them alice and her son should just go home the cleaning woman told them who was the girl this time alice asked ingrid moe is not a girlshes just a child elsemarie cried not around jack alice said the cleaning woman cupped jacks ears in her dry strong hands and said something he couldnt hear nor could he hear his mothers response but there was no poor wretch in elsemaries final remark to alice no one will talk to you elsemarie called after them as they were leaving the domkirke her words echoing in the empty cathedral the girl willi mean the child alice said ill talk to ingrid moe but it was jacks impression that when they came a second time to the oslo cathedral they were shunned the cleaning woman wasnt there a man on a stepladder was replacing burnedout lightbulbs in the bracket lamps mounted on the walls he was too well dressed to be a janitor an especially conscientious parishioner perhapsthe churchs selfappointed fussbudget and whoever he was it was clear that he knew who jack and alice werehe wasnt talking do you know william burns the scotsman alice asked but the man just walked away ingrid moe do you know her alice called after him although the lightbulb man kept walking jack had seen him flinch and there was that overfamiliar sound of the camera shutter againwhen jack was holding his mothers hand in front of the domkirke someone took their picture as they were about to return to the bristol finally on a saturday morning an unseen organist was playing jack reached for his mothers hand and she led the boy to the organ he would wonder only later how she knew the way the organist sat one floor above the nave to reach the organ you needed to climb a set of stairs in the back of the cathedral the organist was so intent on his playing that he didnt see jack and alice until they were standing right beside him mr rolf karlsen alices voice doubted itself the young man on the organ bench was a teenagerin no way could he have been rolf karlsen no the teenager said hed instantly stopped playing im just a student you play very well alice told him she let go of jacks hand and sat down on the bench beside the student he looked a little like ladies man larsblond and blueeyed and delicate but younger and untattooed no one had broken his nose which was as small as a girls and he was without larss misbegotten goatee his hands had frozen on the organ stops alice reached for his nearer hand and pulled it into her lap look at me she whispered he couldnt then listen she said and began her story i used to know a young man like you his name was william burns this is his son she said with a nod in jacks direction look at him he wouldnt im not supposed to talk to you the student blurted out with her free hand alice touched his face and he turned to her a son sees his mother in a certain way especially when he was a child jack burns thought his mom was so beautiful that she was hard to look at when she put her face close to his jack understood why the young organist shut his eyes if you wont talk to me ill talk to ingrid moe alice told him but jack had shut his eyesin sympathy with the student perhapsand whenever the boys eyes were closed he didnt hear very well there were too many distracting things happening in the dark ingrid has a speech impediment the student was saying she doesnt like to talk not a choirgirl i guess alice said both jack and the young man opened their eyes no certainly not the teenager answered shes an organ student like me whats your name alice asked andreas breivik the young man said do you have a tattoo andreas he appeared too stunned by the question to answer her it was not a question hed expected do you want one alice whispered to him it doesnt hurt andif you talk to meill give you one for free one sunday morning before church jack sat in the breakfast room at the bristol stuffing his face even more than usual his mom had told him that if he stayed in the breakfast room while she gave andreas his free tattoo jack could eat as much as he wanted she wouldnt be there to stop him hed been back to the buffet table twice before he began to doubt the wisdom of his second serving of sausages and by then it was too late the sausages were running right through him although his mother had instructed him to wait for her in the breakfast roomshe would join him for breakfast when she had finished with andreas shed saidit was clear to jack that he was in immediate need of a toilet there must have been a mens room on the ground floor of the bristol but the boy didnt know where it was rather than risk not finding it in time he ran upstairs and along the carpeted hall to their hotel room where he pounded on the door for his mother to let him in just a minute she kept calling its the sausages jack cried he was bent over double when alice finally opened the door jack raced into the bathroom and closed the door behind him so quickly that he hardly noticed the unmade bed or his moms bare feetor that andreas breivik was zipping up his jeans the students shirt was untucked and unbuttoned but jack hadnt spotted the tattoo andreass face looked puffy as if hed been rubbing itespecially in the area of his lips maybe hed been crying jack thought it doesnt hurt alice had promised but jack knew it did some tattoos more than others depending on where you were tattooed and the pigments that were usedcertain colors were more toxic to the skin when jack came out of the bathroom both his mother and andreas were fully dressed and the bed was made the tattoo machines the paper towels the vaseline the pigments the alcohol the witch hazel the glycerine the power pack the foot switcheven the little paper cupshad all been put away in fact jack didnt remember seeing any of that stuff when he raced through the bedroom on his way to the bathroom did it hurt jack asked andreas either the young organ student hadnt heard the boy or he was in a state of shock recovering from the pain of his first tattoo he stared at jack dumbfounded alice smiled at her son and rumpled his hair it didnt hurt did it she asked andreas no he cried too loudly probably he was in denial not another rose of jericho on the rib cage jack guessed there hadnt been time something small in the kidney area maybe where did you tattoo him jack asked his mom where hell never forget it she whispered smiling at andreas possibly the sternum jack imagined that would explain why the teenager trembled at alices touch she was pushing him albeit gently toward the door it looked as though it hurt him to walk just keep it covered for a day jack told andreas it will feel like a sunburn better put some moisturizer on it andreas breivik stood stupefied in the hall as if even these simple instructions were bewildering alice waved goodbye to him as she closed the door by the way jacks mother sat down on the bed jack knew she was tired she lay back with her hands behind her head and began to laugh in a way her son recognized it was the kind of laughter that quickly turned to tears for no apparent reason when she started to cry jack asked heras he often didwhat was the matter andreas didnt know anything alice sobbed when she got control of herself she added if hed known anything he would have told me they would be late for church if alice paused now for breakfast besides she said jack had eaten enough breakfast for both of them whenever they had their laundry done at the bristol it was returned with shirt cardboards their clothes were folded among the shirt cardboards like sandwiches jack watched his mom take one of these stiff white pieces of cardboard and write on it in capital letters with the kind of felttipped pen she used to mark her tubes of pigment the black lettering read ingrid moe alice put the shirt cardboard under her coat and they walked uphill to the domkirke the sunday service had already begun when they arrived the organ was playing the choir was singing the opening hymn if thered been a procession theyd missed it jack was thinking that the great or at least big rolf karlsen must have been playing the organ because the organ sounded especially good the church was nearly full they sat in the back pew on the center aisle the minister who gave the sermon was the lightbulb man he must have said something about jack and alice because in the middle of his sermon a few anxious faces turned their way with expressions that were both pained and kind there was nothing for jack to do but stare at the ceiling of the cathedral where he saw a painting that frightened him a dead man was stepping out of a grave jack was sure that jesus was holding the dead mans hand but that made the boy no less afraid of the walking corpse suddenly the minister pointed to the ceiling and read aloud from the bible in norwegian it was strangely comforting to jack that the parishioners were all staring at the frightening painting with him it would be years before jack understood the illustration or saw the english translation which was of that moment in john verses and when jesus brings lazarus back to life now when he said these things he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was wrapped with a cloth jesus said to them loose him and let him go when the minister cried lazarus jack jumped lazarus and jesus were the only words hed understood but at least he knew the dead mans name this was strangely comforting too when the service was over alice stood in the center aisle beside their pew with the shirt cardboard held to her chest upon leaving the church everyone had to walk by her and the sign saying ingrid moe a boy about jacks age was the acolyte he led the congregation out carrying the cross he passed alice in the aisle his eyes cast down the minister whom jack thought of as the lightbulb man was the last to come up the aisle normally he was the first to follow the acolyte but he had purposely lingered behind he stopped beside alice with a sigh the lightbulb mans voice was gentle when he spoke please go home mrs burns the minister said if shed noticed the mrs burns alice made no attempt to correct him maybe on his part it was not a misunderstanding but another kindness the minister put his hand on her wrist and shaking his head said god bless you and your son then he left jack concluded that since even the cleaning lady had blessed him they were big on godblessyous in norway certainly lazarus leaving his grave seemed predisposed to offer a blessing back at the bristol alice sipped her soup that was their lunchjust the soup but if alice had lost her enthusiasm for spotting future tattoo clients jack thought he saw one a young girl stared at them from the entrance to the dining room she had a childs face on an overlong body and she refused to let the maître d show her to a table jack doubted that his mother would tattoo her alice had her rules you had to be a certain age and this babyfaced girl looked too young to be tattooed the instant alice saw her she knew it was ingrid moe alice told the waiter to bring another chair to the table where the tall awkwardlooking girl reluctantly joined them she sat on the edge of her chair with her hands on the table as if the silverware were organ stops and she were preparing to play her arms and fingers were absurdly long for her age im sorry he hurt you im sorry for you that you ever met him alice told the young girl jack assumed his mom meant his dad who else could she have meant ingrid moe bit her lip and stared at her long fingers a thick blond braid hung down her perfectly straight back reaching almost to the base of her spine when she spoke her exquisite prettiness was marred by what an obvious strain it was for her to speak she clenched her teeth together when she talked as if she were afraid or unable to show her tongue jack thought with a shiver of what an agony it might be for her to kiss someone or to kiss her years later he imagined his father thinking this upon first meeting herand jack felt ashamed i want a tattoo ingrid moe told alice he said you knew how to do it her speech impediment made her almost impossible to understand at least in english youre too young to get a tattoo alice said i wasnt too young for him ingrid replied when she said the him she curled back her lips and bared her clenched teeth the muscles of her neck were tensed thrusting her lower jaw forward as if she were about to spit it was tragic that such a beautiful girl could be so instantly transformed the notsosimple act of speaking made her ugly i would advise you not to get one alice said if you wont do it trond halvorsen will ingrid struggled to say hes not very goodhe gave william an infection he gives everyone an infection i think perhaps hearing the girl say william made alice flinchmore than the news that hed been infected by dirty needles or a bad tattooist but ingrid moe misunderstood alices reaction he got over it the girl blurted out he just needed an antibiotic i dont want to tattoo you alice told her i know what i want and where i want it ingrid answered its on a part of me i dont want trond halvorsen seeing she added the way she contorted her mouth to say the name trond halvorsen made him sound like a kind of inedible fish ingrid spread the long fingers of her right hand on the side of her left breast near her heart here she said her hand cupped her small breast her fingertips reaching to her ribs it will hurt there alice informed her i want it to hurt ingrid replied i suppose its a heart you want alice said maybe a broken one jack was thinking he was playing with his silverwarehis attention had wandered off again alice shrugged a broken heart was such a common sailor tattoo that she could have done one with her eyes closed i wont do his name she said to ingrid i dont want his name the girl answered just a heart ripped in two jack was thinking it was something ladies man madsen used to say one day youll meet someone and have to explain everything alice warned ingrid if i meet someone hell have to know everything about me eventually the girl responded how will you pay for it alice asked ill tell you where to find him the girl said but jack wasnt listening ingrids speech impediment disturbed the boy the girl might have said ill tell you where he wants to go so much for rules ingrid moe was not too young to be tattooed after all she was no child she just looked like one despite her baby face even jack knew that if hed had to guess jack would have said she was sixteen going on thirty he didnt know that a world of older women awaited him at midday the amber light that suffused the hotel room made ingrid moes pale skin seem more golden than it was she sat stripped to her waist on one of the twin beds alice beside her jack sat on the other twin bed staring at the tall girls breasts hes just a childi dont mind if he watches was how ingrid had put it maybe i mind alice said please id like to have jack here while you do it ingrid told her hes going to look just like william you know that dont you yes i know alice answered possibly ingrid didnt mind the boy seeing her because she had no breasts to speak of even so jack couldnt take his eyes off her she sat very straight with her long fingers gripping her knees the blue veins in her forearms stood out against the gold of her skin another blue vein which began at her throat ran down between her small breasts that vein seemed to have a pulse in it as if an animal lived under her skin alice had outlined the whole heart which touched both the side of ingrid moes left breast and her rib cage before jack got the idea that it was not a broken heartnot a heart ripped in two as hed thought ingrid had requestedbut an unbroken one without a mirror ingrid couldnt see the tattooinprogress besides she kept staring straight at jack who was paying more attention to her breasts than to the tattoo even when alice did the outlining on ingrids rib cage the girl sat completely still and didnt make a sound although tears flowed freely down her cheeks alice ignored ingrids tears except when they fell on the girls left breast these errant tears she wiped away as perfunctorily with a dab of vaseline on a paper towel as she wiped away the fine spatter of black ink from the outlining it wasnt until alice began to shade the heart red that the strangeness of it became apparent given the slight contour of ingrids breast the plump little heart seemed capable of beating the rise and fall of ingrids breathing gave the tattoo a visible pulse it looked real enough to bleed jack had seen his mother tattoo a heart in a bed of flowers or frame one with roses but this heart stood alone it was smaller than her other hearts and something else was different about it the tattoo held the side of ingrid moes left breast and touched her heartthe way one day an infants hand would touch her there when alice was finished she went into the bathroom to wash her hands ingrid leaned forward and put her long hands on jacks thighs you have your fathers eyes his mouth she whispered but her speech impediment made a mess of her whisper she said mouth in such a way that the mangled word rhymed with roof and while alice was still in the bathroom ingrid leaned farther forward and kissed jack on the mouth the boy shivered as though he might faint her lips had opened so that her teeth clicked against his naturally he wondered if her speech impediment was contagious when alice came back from the bathroom she brought her hand mirror with her she sat beside jack on the twin bed while they watched ingrid moe have her first look at her finished heart ingrid took a good long look at it before she said anything jack didnt really hear what she said anyway hed gone into the bathroom where he put a gob of toothpaste in his mouth and rinsed it out in the sink maybe ingrid was saying its not brokeni said a heart ripped in two theres nothing the matter with your heart alice might have said its ripped in two ingrid declared jack heard that and came out of the bathroom you only think it is his mom was saying you didnt give me what i wanted ingrid blurted out i gave you what you have an actual hearta small one alice added fuck you ingrid moe shouted not around jack alice told her im not telling you anything the girl said she held the hand mirror close to her tattooed breast it might not have been the heart she wanted but she couldnt stop looking at the tattoo alice got up from the twin bed and went into the bathroom before she closed the door she said when you meet someone ingridand you willyoull have a heart hell want to put his hand on your children will want to touch it too alice turned on the water in the sink she didnt want ingrid and jack to hear her crying you didnt bandage her jack saidto the closed bathroom door you bandage her jackie his mother said over the running water i dont want to touch her jack put some vaseline on a piece of gauze about as big as ingrid moes hand it completely covered the heart on the side of her breast he taped the gauze to her skin being careful not to touch her nipple ingrid was sweating slightly and he had a little trouble making the tape stick have you done this before the girl asked sure jack said no you havent she said not on a breast jack repeated the usual instructions after all he was pretty familiar with the routine just keep it covered for a day the boy told ingrid she was buttoning up her shirtshe didnt bother with her skimpy bra it will feel like a sunburn how do you know what it feels like the girl asked when she stood up she was so tall that jack barely came to her waist better put a little moisturizer on it he told her she bent over him as if she were going to kiss him again jack clamped his lips tight together and held his breath he must have been trembling because ingrid put her big hands on his shoulders and said dont be afraidim not going to hurt you then instead of kissing him she whispered in his ear sibelius what tell your mom he said sibelius its all he thinks about i mean going there she added she opened the door to the hall just a crack she peered out as if she had a recent history of being careful about how she left hotel rooms sibelius jack said testing the word he thought it must be norwegian im only telling you because of you not her ingrid moe said tell your mom jack watched her walk down the hall from behind she didnt look like a child she walked like a woman back in the hotel room the boy cleaned up the little paper cups of pigment he made sure the caps on the glycerine and alcohol and witch hazel were tight he put away the bandages on a paper towel jack laid out the needles from the two tattoo machineswhat his mom called the jonesy roundback which she used for outlining and the rodgers which she used for shading jack knew his mother would want to clean the needles when alice finally came out of the bathroom she couldnt hide the fact that shed been crying while jack had always thought of his mother as a beautiful womanand the way most men looked at her did nothing to discourage his prejudiceshe was perhaps undone to have tattooed the breast and golden skin of a babyfaced girl as young and pretty as ingrid moe that girl is a heartstopper jack was all she said she said sibelius jack told his mom what sibelius at first the word was as puzzling to alice as it had been to jack but she kept thinking about it maybe its where hes gone the boy guessed where we can find him alice shook her head jack took this to mean that sibelius was another city not on their itinerary he didnt even know what country it was in where is it jack asked his mother she shook her head again its a he not an it she told him sibelius is a composerhes finnish jack thought shed said hes finishedmeaning that the composer was dead hes from finland alice explained that means your father has gone to helsinki jack helsinki was definitely not on their itinerary jack didnt like the sound of it one bit not a city with hell in it before leaving for finland alice wanted to have a word with trond halvorsen the bad tattooer whod given william an infection halvorsen was what tattoo ole would have called a scratcher he worked out of a groundfloor apartment in gamlebyen in the eastern part of oslo what passed for a tattoo shop was his kitchen trond halvorsen was an old sailor hed been tattooed by hand in borneo andagain without the benefit of a tattoo machinein japan he had a tattoo jack tattoo oles teacher on his right forearm and one of oles naked ladies on his left he had some simply awful tattoos mostly on his thighs and stomach hed done them on himself when i was learning he said showing alice and jack his myriad mistakes tell me about the music man alice began i just gave him some notes he asked for halvorsen said i dont know what the music sounds like i understand you gave him an infection too alice said trond halvorsen smiled he was missing both an upper and a lower canine infections happen do you clean your needles alice asked who has the time halvorsen replied a pot was bubbling on the stove something with a fish head in it the kitchen smelled of fish and tobacco in more or less equal parts alice couldnt hide her disgust even halvorsens flash was dirty his stencils smudged with cooking grease and smoke some pigments had hardened in the open paper cups on the kitchen table you couldnt tell what their true colors had been im aberdeen bills daughter alice she suddenly seemed uninterested in her own story i once worked with tattoo ole her voice trailed away ive heard of your dad and everyone knows ole halvorsen said he seemed unembarrassed by her evident disapproval jack was wondering why theyd come the music man alice said for the second time i dont suppose he told you where he was going he was angry about the infection trond halvorsen admitted when he came back he wasnt in a mood to talk about his travels hes gone to helsinki alice said halvorsen just listened if she already knew where william had gone why was she bothering halvorsen do you know any tattoo artists in helsinki alice asked theres nobody good there he answered theres nobody good here alice said trond halvorsen winked at jack as if acknowledging that the boys mother must be hard to live with he stirred the pot on the stove briefly holding up the fish head for jack to see in helsinki halvorsen said as if he were talking to the fish you can get a tattoo from an old sailor like me a scratcher you mean alice asked someone working at home like me halvorsen told her he was sounding a little defensive now even irritated and would you know such a person as that in finland good or not alice asked theres a restaurant in helsinki where the sailors go trond halvorsen said you get yourself to the harbor you look for a restaurant called salve someone will know itits very popular then what alice said ask one of the waitresses where you can get a tattoo halvorsen told her one of the older ones will know thank you very much mr halvorsen alice said she held out her hand to him but he didnt shake it even scratchers have their pride you got a boyfriend halvorsen asked her he smiled showing his missing teeth again jacks mother rumpled the boys hair and pulled him against her hip what do you think jack here is she said to halvorsen trond halvorsen never did shake alices hand i think jack here looks just like him the scratcher said back at the bristol they packed in silence the clerk at the front desk was happy they were checking out the lobby was overcrowded with foreign sportswriters and skating fans the world championships in speed skating were due to take place at bislett stadium in the center of oslo in midfebruary but the journalists and fans had arrived early jack was sorry they were leaving hed been hoping to see the skaters that february the temperature in oslo was eight degrees below average the cold weather meant fast ice the frontdesk clerk said jack asked his mom if speed skaters skated in the dark or were there lights at bislett stadium she didnt know he didnt ask his mother what helsinki would be like because he was afraid she might say darker in the pale midday light their hotel room again had an amber hue but without the golden glow of ingrid moes skin oslo seemed plunged in an eternal darkness in his dreams jack still saw that girls inflamed ribs and the throbbing heart on the side of her breast when hed held the gauze against her skin he could feel the heat of her tattoo her hot heart had burned his hand through the bandage when jack and alice made their way down the carpeted hall where hed watched ingrid moe walk awaylike a womanthe boy was thinking that their search for his father was also a dream only it was neverending one day or night they would walk into a restauranta popular place called salve where the sailors in helsinki wentand they would meet a waitress whod already met william burns she would tell them what shed told himnamely where to go to be tattooedbut by the time they went there william would have acquired another piece of music on his skin according to jacks mother his father also would have seduced some woman or girl hed first met in a churchand no amount of sacred music could persuade a single member of that churchs congregation to help jack and alice find him once again william would have vanished the way the greatest music from the best organ in the most magnificent cathedral can drown out any choir and displace all other human soundseven laughter even grief even sorrow of the kind jack heard his mother give in to when she believed he was fast asleep goodbye oslo jack whispered in the hall where he believed that ingrid moe had walked away with a whole heartnot one ripped in two his mom bent down and kissed the back of his neck hello helsinki she whispered in his ear once again jack reached for her hand it was the one thing he knew how to do as it would turn out it was about the only thing he really knew failure in finland they took the long trip back to stockholm the way they had comethen sailed from stockholm to helsinki an overnight voyage through the gulf of finland it was so cold that the salt spray froze on jacks face if he stood outside for more than a minute undaunted by the weather some finns and swedes were drinking and singing songs on the icy deck until midnight alice observed that they were also throwing upwith best results to the leeward side of the ship in the morning jack saw some finns and swedes who had suffered the misfortune of throwing up to the windward side of the vessel alice found out from the drunks many of them young people that the hotel in helsinki best suited to a tattoo artists circumstances was the hotel torni where the socalled american bar was a hangout for welloff students one of the finns or swedes on deck referred to it as the place where you went to meet brave girls brave girls were right up daughter alices alley since she took brave to mean that the girls and the boys who wanted to meet them would be open to being tattooed the hotel itself had seen better days because the old irongrate elevator was temporarily out of service and they were on the fourth floor jack and alice became well acquainted with the stairs which they climbed holding hands they had a room without a bath or a toilet there was a sink although they were advised not to drink the water and a view of what appeared to be a secondary school jack sat on the window seat and looked with longing at the pupils they seemed to have many friends the bath and the wc which jack and his mother shared with some other guests on the floor were a fair hike down the twisting hall the hotel had a hundred rooms one day when jack was bored he made his mom count them with him fewer than half had their own bathrooms yet alice had been right to choose the torni from the beginning of their stay she did a brisk business among the clientele at the american bar while only a few of the girls jack saw were beautifuland he had no experience with whether or not they were bravemany of them as well as even more of the boys were courageous about being tattooed but in the tattoo business drunks are bleeders in helsinki jack saw his mother go through a lot of paper towels in a weeks time alice was earning almost as much money as shed made at tattoo oles in the christmas season jack often fell asleep to the sound of the tattoo machine once again you could say they were sleeping in the needles at the restaurant called salve jack and alice took an opinionated waitresss advicethey ordered the poached arctic char instead of the fried whitefish or the freshwater pikeperch for a first course they politely tried the reindeer tongue largely because it was an increasing burden to avoid it to jacks surprise the tongue was not rubbery and tasted good and for dessert he had the cloudberries they were a darkgold color and the slight sourness of the fruit contrasted nicely with vanilla ice cream jacks mom waited until hed finished his dessert before she asked the waitress if she knew where to get a tattoo it was not the answer alice expected i hear theres a woman at the hotel torni the waitress began shes a guest at the hotel a foreignera goodlooking woman but a sad one sad alice asked she seemed surprised jack couldnt look at her even he knew she was sad thats what i hear the waitress replied shes got a little boy with her just like you she added looking at jack i see alice said she hangs out at the american bar but she does the tattooing in her hotel roomsometimes while the kids asleep the waitress went on thats very interesting alice said but i was looking for someone else another tattoo artistprobably a man well theres sami salo but the woman at the torni is better tell me about sami salo alice said the waitress sighed she was a short stout woman whose clothes were too tight her feet appeared to hurt her she squinted whenever she took a step and her fat arms jiggled but she wasnt much older than jacks mother under her apron she kept a dish towel with which she commenced to wipe the table down listen dearie the waitress told alice in a low voice you dont want to bother sami he already knows where to find you alice seemed surprised again maybe she hadnt realized that the waitress knew she was the tattoo artist at the hotel torni but they hadnt been hard to figure out in helsinki who else fit the description of a young woman and a little kid who spoke americansounding english i want to meet sami salo alice said to the waitress i want to ask him if hes tattooed someone i know sami salo doesnt want to meet you the waitress told her youre putting him out of business and hes not happy about it thats what i hear im impressed by all you manage to hear alice said the waitress turned her gruff attention to jack you look tired she told him are you getting enough sleep is all the tattooing keeping you awake jacks mom stood up from the table and held out her hand to her son the restaurant was noisy and crowded finns can be loud when they eat and drink the boy didnt quite catch what his mother told the waitress he could only guess it was something along the lines of thank you for your concern or more likely if you want to stop by the torni some evening ill be happy to tattoo you where it really hurts alice might also have given the waitress a message for sami salo that the waitress and sami were friends was pretty obvious even to jack they didnt go to salve again they ate at the torni and called the american bar their home but what about the church jack would wonder as he was falling asleep why werent they asking someone about the particular organ his father might be playing in helsinki where were the destroyed young women whod had the bad luck to meet william here and what about sibelius jack wondered if his mom was growing tired of looking for his dador worse if she was suddenly afraid of finding him maybe it had occurred to her how awful it would be to finally confront william only to have him walk away with a shrug surely william must have known they were looking for him church music and tattooing were both small worlds what if william decided to confront them what would they have to say for themselves did they actually want him to stop running and live with them live with them where helsinki is a hard place to be afflicted with selfdoubts alice appeared to be unsure of herself she would not get up at night to go to the bathroom without waking jack and forcing him to walk down the hall with her she wouldnt let him leave the hotel room by himself either some nights jack peed in the sink and those evenings when she roamed the american bar soliciting clients jack often watched her from the crowsnest perspective of the irongrate elevator which was frozen in seemingly permanent disrepair on the floor above the bar whenever a prospective client decided to get a tattoo alice would look up at the outofservice elevator and nod her head to jack who was suspended in it like a boy in a birdcage jack would watch alice lead the client to the stairs then he exited the elevator and ran up the stairs to the fourth floor ahead of them he was usually waiting by the door to their room when his mother brought the tattoo customer down the hall whyfancy seeing you jack his mom would always say is it a tattoo youve come for no thank you jack would always reply im too young to be tattooed im just an observer it may have been a silly ritual but it was their routine and they stuck to it the client recognized that they were a team by their third week in helsinki jack had forgotten all about sibelius two young women bravelooking girls approached alice in the american bar they asked her about a tattooone they wanted to share in the elevator one floor above them jack couldnt really hear what they were saying you cant share a tattoo he thought his mother said sure we can the tall one replied maybe the short one said we shared youknowwhat together sharing a tattoo cant be that bad from the broken elevator jack saw his mom shake her headnot her usual signal hed seen her say no to young men who were too drunk to be tattooed or to two or more men she wouldnt take more than one man at a time to their room these two women tall and short were different they made alice seem awkward jack thought that his mother might already know them alice abruptly turned and walked away but the brave girls followed her they kept talking to her too jack got out of the elevator when he saw his mom start up the stairs tall and short came up the stairs behind her were not too young are we the tall one was asking alice shook her head again she just kept walking up the stairs with the two young women following her you must be jack the short one said looking up the stairs at the boy it seemed to jack that she even knew where to look for him were both music students the short one told him im studying church music both choral and the organ alice stopped on the staircase as if she were out of breath the two girls caught up to her on the halflanding between the first and second floors jack stood waiting for his mom on the secondfloor landing looking down at the three of them hello jack the tall girl said to the boy i play the cello she wasnt as tall as ingrid moenor as breathtakingly beautifulbut she had the same long hands her curly blond hair was cut as short as a boys and over a cotton turtleneck she wore a grungy ski sweater with a small herd of faded reindeer on it the other girl the short one was plump with a pretty face and long dark hair that fell to her breasts she wore a short black skirt with black tights kneehigh black boots and a black vneck sweater that was too big for her the sweater was very softlooking and had no reindeer on it music students alice repeated at sibelius academy jack the tall young woman said did you ever hear of it the boy didnt answer her he kept looking at his mother sibelius alice saidin a way that implied the name hurt her throat the short plump girl with the pretty face looked up the stairs and smiled at jack youre definitely jack she said the tall one came up the stairs two at a time she knelt at jacks feet and framed his face in her long hands which were slightly sticky look at you jack she said her breath smelled like chewing gum a fruit flavor youre a dead ringer for your dad jacks mother came up the stairs with the short girl beside her take your hands off him alice told the tall girl who stood up and backed away from the boy sorry jack the tall girl said what do you want alice asked the music students we told youa tattoo the short girl answered we also wanted to see what jack looked like the tall young woman confessed i hope you dont mind jack the short one said but jack was four how is it possible that he remembered with any accuracy what tall and short truly said isnt it more likely that for daysfor weeks even monthsafter he met these girls he would ask his mother the meaning of that conversation on the stairs in the hotel torni and his mom would tell him what she wanted him to hear it might not be talls and shorts actual words that he remembered but alices unalterable interpretation of william abandoning them there would be times when jack burns felt he was still on those stairsnot only because the elevator was more than temporarily out of service but also because jack would spend years trying to discern the difference between his mothers version of his father and who his father really was jack did remember this when his mom started up the stairs again he had not let go of her hand the music students kept pace with them all the way to their floor jack could tell that his mother was agitated because she stopped at the door to their room and fumbled around in her purse for the key shed forgotten that jack had itthat was part of their routine here he said handing the key to her you could have lost it she told him jack didnt know what to say hed not seen her so distracted look we just wanted to meet jack the tall young woman went on the idea for the tattoo came later the short one said alice let them into the room again it seemed to jack that his mom already knew them inside the room alice turned on all the lights the tall girl knelt at jacks feet once more she might have wanted to take his face in her hands again but she restrained herselfshe just looked at him when you get older jack she said youre going to know a lot of girls why the boy asked be careful what you tell him alice said the short girl with the pretty face and long hair knelt at jacks feet too were sorry the two girls said in chorus jack couldnt tell if they were speaking to him or to his mom alice sat down on the bed and sighed tell me about this tattoo you want to share she said staring at a neutral zone between the two young womenpurposely not looking at either one of them alice must have sensed an aura of wantonness about these brave girls and she knew jack was affected by them the tattoo tall and short wanted to share was another variation of a broken heartthis one torn apart vertically the left side would be tattooed on the heartside breast of the tall young woman the right side would go on the heartside breast of the short one not a very original idea but even jack was learning that there was little originality in the instinct to be tattooed not only were broken hearts fairly common the ways to depict them were limited and the part of the body where a depiction of a broken heart belonged was selfevident in those days a tattoo was still a souvenira keepsake to mark a journey the love of your life a heartbreak a port of call the body was like a photo album the tattoos themselves didnt have to be good photographs indeed they may not have been very artistic or aesthetically pleasing but they werent uglynot intentionally and the old tattoos were always sentimental you didnt mark yourself for life if you werent sentimental how could tattoos be original when what they signified was something ordinary your feelings for your mother the lover who left you the first time you went to sea but these were mostly maritime tattoosclearly sailors were sentimental souls so were these music students tall and short they may have been vulgar but alice didnt seem to hate themand they were old enough to be tattooed even to jack they were noticeably older than ingrid moe the tall ones name was hannele under her fadedreindeer sweater and the cotton turtleneck she wasnt wearing a bra despite jacks precocious interest in breasts what struck him most about hannele was that her armpits were unshaven she was a broadshouldered young woman with breasts not much bigger than ingrid moes and the astonishing hair in her armpits was a darker blond than the hair on her head over her navel like a crumpled top hat the color of a wine stain was a birthmark the shape of florida when alice began with the jonesy roundback hannele pursed her lips and whistled jack had trouble following the tune over the sound of the tattoo machine hannele had placed herself on the window seat with her legs spread wide apart it was a most unladylike position but hannele was wearing blue jeans and she was after all a cellist no doubt she sat that way when she played years later when a naked woman played the cello for jack he would remember hannele and wonder if shed ever performed naked for william jack would again feel ashamed that he might have such a moment in common with his dad he would understand what must have attracted william to hannele she was a brave girl without question she went right on whistling even when alices outline of her halfaheart touched her rib cage while alice was shading hanneles broken heart with the rodgers jack sat on the big bed with the short plump girl her name was ritva she had bigger breasts than hannele and jack was trying to stay awake until it was ritvas turn to get her halfaheart he must have looked sleepy because his mom said why dont you brush your teeth jack and get into your pajamas the boy got up and brushed his teeth in the sink where he was repeatedly told not to drink the water alice kept a pitcher of drinking water on the washstand and jack was instructed to rinse his mouth out with the drinking water after he brushed his teeth he put on his pajamas while hiding behind the open door to the wardrobe closet so that neither ritva nor hannele would see him naked then he got back on the bed beside ritva who pulled the bedcovers down jack lay still with his head on the pillow while ritva tucked him in there was only the sound of the tattoo machine and hanneles faint but brave whistling sweet dreams jack ritva said she kissed him good night isnt that what you say in english she asked alice sweet dreams sometimes alice said jack noticed the truculence in her voice it seemed unfamiliar to him maybe sweet dreams was a phrase william used it could have been something hed said to alice and ritva and hannelebecause hanneles brave whistling stopped for a second as if the pain of the shading needles on her left breast and that side of her rib cage had suddenly become unbearable jack guessed it was the sweet dreams that had hurt her not the tattoo the boy was fighting sleep involuntarily his eyes would close and he would reach out his hand and feel ritvas soft sweater and the fingers of her warm hand closing around his smaller fingers jack might have heard his mother say i dont suppose you know where hes gone he didnt tell us hannele may have answered between whistles hes got you and jack hounding him jack distinctly heard ritva tell his mom i guess thats enough he said hounding did he alice asked i said it ritva told her we say it all the time hannele said wouldnt you agree that jack is his responsibility alice asked them they both agreed that jack was his fathers responsibility but this was one of those helsinki conversations that the boy at best half heard in his sleep jack woke once and saw ritvas pretty face smiling down at him from her expression he knew she must have been imagining his dad in the unformed features of jacks face even today jack occasionally saw that pretty face in his dreamsor when he was falling asleep he never did get to see ritvas plump breastsor learn if her armpits were unshaven like hanneles when he woke again hanneles sleeping face was on the pillow beside him she was wearing the cotton turtleneck but not the ski sweater she must have fallen asleep while she was waiting for alice to be finished with ritvas halfaheart tattoo jack could hear the tattoo machine but his mother blocked the boys view of ritvas breasts and armpits over his moms shoulder jack could see only ritvas face her eyes were tightly closed and she was grimacing in pain hanneles sleeping face was very close to jacks her lips were parted her breath which had lost the fruity scent of her chewing gum was faintly bad her hair gave off a sweetandsour smelllike hot chocolate when its stood around too long and turned bitter in the cup jack still wanted to kiss her he inched his face nearer hers holding his breath go to sleep jack his mom said her back was to him he had no idea how she knew he was awake hanneles eyes opened wide she stared at jack you have eyelashes to die for she said isnt that what you say in english hannele asked alice to die for sometimes alice said ritva choked back a sob under the covers hanneles long fingers lifted jacks pajama top and tickled his stomach even today he sometimes felt those fingers in his dreamsor when he was falling asleep the knock on the hotelroom door was abrupt and loud it woke jack from a dream the room was dark his mother snoring beside him hadnt stirred the boy recognized her snore he knew it was her hand not hanneles on his hip someones at the door mom jack whispered but she didnt hear him the knock came again louder than before occasionally the clientele at the american bar got restless waiting for alice to return to the bar some drunk who wanted a tattoo would come to the room and pound on the door alice always sent the drunks away jack sat up in bed and said in a shrill voice too late for a tattoo i dont want a tattoo a mans angry voice shouted from the hall jack had not seen his mother so startled since the night of the littlest soldier she sat boltupright in bed and clutched jack to her what do you want she cried you want to know about the music man dont you the mans voice answered well i tattooed him i know all about him sami salo alice asked lets make a deal salo said first you open the door just a minute mr salo alice got out of bed and covered her nightgown with a robe she took out her flash her best work and spread it over the bed jack in his pajamas lay adrift in the maritime worlda child on a bed of hearts and flowers ships in full sail and halfnaked girls in grass skirts the fouryearold lay amid snakes and anchors among sailors graves and roses of jericho and his moms version of mans ruin there was her key to my heart and her naked lady from the back side with butterfly wingsthe latter emerging from a tulip the boy lay among her flash as if hed just awakened from a tattoo dream when alice opened the door to sami salo she stepped aside and let him walk past her into her world he was a scratcher as alice had guessed she knew he could never avert his eyes from her superior work the deal is salo started to say then he stopped he scarcely glanced at jackthe flash had seized his attention completely sami salo was a haggardlooking older man with a gaunt soulsearching expression he wore a navyblue watch cap pulled down over his ears and a peacoat of the same color he was sweating from wearing his winter clothes on his walk up four flights of stairs and his breathing was ragged he didnt speak he simply stared at alices best work salos favorite might have been a tossup between alices rose of jericho and her key to my heartthe key held horizontally against the naked ladys breasts the keyhole youknowwhere the tattoo was unique among alices naked ladies in that the lady was not seen from the back side to judge him by his defeated expression sami salo was his own version of mans ruin the deal is alice prompted him salo removed his watch cap as if he were about to bow his head in prayer he unbuttoned his peacoat too but he just stood there he wore a dirtywhite sweater under the peacoat the fadedgray fingers of a skeletons hand reached above the crew neck of the sweater as if holding salo by the throat it was as bad an idea as any tattoo alice had ever seenor so jack concluded from his mothers expression it was a blessing that the rest of the skeleton was covered by the sweater jack and alice didnt see any of sami salos other tattoosnor was salo in a mood to converse the deal is he began again i tell you about the music man and you leave town i dont care where you go im sorry your business is suffering alice told him he accepted her apology with a nod jack was embarrassed for the poor man the boy buried his head under the pillows im sorry if my wife spoke rudely to you at the restaurant salo may have said she doesnt much like having to work nights his wife would have been the opinionated waitress at salve jack guessed with his head under the pillows the fouryearold found that the adult world seemed a nicer place even jack could tell that mr salo was a lot older than his overworked wife who looked young enough to be his daughter their apologies stated there was little more that alice and sami salo needed to say to each other amsterdam the scratcher said when i inked a bit of bach on his backside he said he was going to amsterdam jack and i will leave helsinki as soon as we can arrange our travel alice told him youre a talented lady jack heard salo say he sounded as if he was already in the hall thank you mr salo alice replied closing the door at least amsterdam was a town on their itinerary jack couldnt wait to see tattoo peter and his one leg we mustnt forget st johns church jack his mother said jack had thought they were on their way to the shipping office but he was wrong that was where your father played we should at least see it they were close to the sea it had snowed overnight the branches of the trees drooped with the heavy seaside snow johanneksen kirkko alice told the taxi driver she even knew how to pronounce the name of the church in finnish st johns was hugea redbrick gothic edifice with two towers the twin spires shining a pale green in the sunlight the wooden pews were a dark blond that reminded jack of the hair in hanneles armpits the church bells heralded their arrival according to alice the three bells played the first three notes of handels te deum c sharp e f sharp the former choirgirl whispered the round altarpiece featured a tall thin paintingthe conversion of paul on his way to damascus the organ was a walcker from württemberg built in it had been restored in and had seventyfour registers jack knew that registers were the same as stops he didnt know if the number of registers made a difference in how loud an organ was or how rich it sounded since william burns had been demonized in jacks eyes the boy didnt have a consuming interest in his fathers instrument in helsinki on such a sunny day the light through the stained glass sparkled on the pipes as if the organeven without an organistwas about to burst into sound all by itself but the organist was there to greet them alice must have made an appointment to see him his name was kari vaara and he was a hearty man with wildlooking hair he appeared to have seconds ago stuck his head out the window of a speeding train his actions were marked by the nervous habit of clasping his hands together as if he were about to make a lifealtering confession or fall to his kneesthe suddenly shattered witness to a miracle your father is a very talented musician vaara said almost worshipfully to jack who was speechless the boy wasnt used to hearing his dad praised but talent must be nurtured or it withers his voice sounded like the lower registers of an organ we know about amsterdam alice interjected she appeared fearful that kari vaara was about to reveal a terrible truthsomething in the notaroundjack category not just amsterdam the organist intoned jack looked at the walcker organ half expecting it to issue a refrain hes going to play in the oude kerk the reverence with which vaara spoke was wasted on jack but his mom was glad to know the churchs name the organ there is special i suppose alice said kari vaara took a deep breath as if he were once more preparing to stick his head out the window of that speeding train the organ in the oude kerk is vast he said jack must have scuffed his feet or cleared his throat because vaara again turned his attention to him i told your father that big is not necessarily best but he is a young man who must see for himself yes he has always had to see everything for himself alice chimed in not always a bad thing vaara offered not always a good thing alice countered kari vaara leaned over jack the boy could smell the soap on the organists clasped hands perhaps you have talent for the organ vaara said he unclasped his hands and spread his arms wide as if to embrace the walcker would you like to play over my dead body alice said taking jacks hand they went up the aisle and out of the johanneksen kirkko the sunlight was shimmering on the newfallen snow mrs burns vaara called after them had she told him she was mrs burns they say that in the oude kerk one plays to both tourists and prostitutes not around jack alice said over her shoulder their taxi driver was waiting the shipping office was their next stop i mean only that the church is in the redlight district vaara explained alice stumbled slightly but she regained her balance and squeezed jacks hand there was mention of traveling by ship from helsinki to hamburg and then taking the train from hamburg to amsterdam but that was the long way to go and perhaps alice was afraid she might stay in hamburg her desire to meet and work with herbert hoffmann was that strong maybe they wouldnt have gone back to canada jack might never have attended st hildas and all the rest shed sent hoffmann so many postcards that jack had memorized the address hamburger berg if they had sailed to hamburgif theyd seen st pauli and the reeperbahn and herbert hoffmanns tätowierstube at hamburger bergthey might have stayed but they found passage on a freighter from helsinki to rotterdam in those days freighters frequently had passenger accommodations then they took the train from rotterdam to amsterdam a short trip jack remembered that train ride it was raining some of the fields were flooded it was still winter but there wasnt any snow out the window of the train it looked as if spring would never come alice rested her forehead against the pane isnt the glass cold jack asked it feels good she replied maybe i have a fever jack felt her foreheadshe didnt feel too warm to him she shut her eyes and nodded off across the aisle a businessmantype kept glancing at alice jack stared at the man until he looked away even at four the boy could stare anybody down jack was excited about tattoo peters one leg and he must have been trying to imagine the size of the vast organ in the oude kerk but a question of a different kind popped into his head mom he whispered he had to speak a little louder to wake her from her sleep mom yes my little actor she whispered back she hadnt opened her eyes what is the redlight district alice gazed without seeing out the window of the rushing train when she shut her eyes again the businessman across the aisle sneaked another look at her well alice said with her eyes still closed i guess were going to find out gods holy noise after amsterdam alice was a different womanone whose small measure of selfconfidence and sense of moral worth had been all but obliterated jack must have noticed that his mother had changednot that he would have known why on the zeedijk the northeasternmost street of the redlight district there was a tattoo parlor called de rode draakthe red dragon the tattoo artist in that shop theo rademaker was called tattoo theo the nickname mocked rademaker because in amsterdam he was forever in the shadow of tattoo peter rademakers secondrate reputation didnt discourage william burns whod had tattoo theo etch a cramped fragment from samuel scheidt we all believe in one god in a crescent shape on his coccyx the music was partially obscured by the words wir glauben all an einen gottit was williams first tattoo in amsterdam he was later tattooed by tattoo peter who told him tattoo theos work was amateurish and gave the music man a bach tattoojesu meine freude jesus my joy tattoo peter wouldnt say whereonly that the music and the words were in this case not at war with each other his real name was peter de haan and he was arguably the most famous tattoo artist of his day tattoo peters lost leg was one of the more tantalizing mysteries of jacks childhood it was a gift to the boys imagination that his mom refused to tell him how it happened what chiefly impressed alice was that peter de haan had tattooed herbert hoffmann and the two men were friends tattoo peters shop was in the basement of a house on the st olofssteegthus william was tattooed twice in the redlight district william burns was a man who was meant to be musically marked for life tattoo peter said but alice would be marked for life because of him the basement shop on the st olofssteeg was very warm peter frequently took off his shirt when he tattooed a client he told alice that it gave the customer confidence in him as a tattoo artist jack understood this to mean that the client couldnt help but admire tattoo peters own tattoos in that case alice told peter ill keep my shirt on what jack made of this was perfectly logical since his mom didnt have any tattoos of her own the customer might lose confidence in her altogether peter de haan was a fairskinned bellshaped man with a pleasant cleanshaven face and lustrous slickedback hair he usually wore dark trousers and sat with his one leg facing the entrance to the tattoo parlorthe stump of his missing leg half hidden on a wooden bench or stool he sat with his back very straight he maintained excellent posture sitting down but jack never saw him stand did he use crutches or two canes or like a pirate did he strap on a peg leg did he come and go in a wheelchair jack didnt knowhe never saw peter come or go jack would one day hear that peters son was his apprentice but jack remembered seeing only one other apprentice at tattoo peters besides his mom he was a scary man named jacob bril possibly bril made such an impression on jack that he simply forgot peters son jacob bril had his own tattoo parlor in rotterdam he closed it on the weekends and came to amsterdam where he worked at tattoo peters from noon to midnight every saturday his faithful clientele would line up to see him every fan of brils was a dedicated christian jacob bril was small and wiryan austere skeleton of a manand he gave only religious tattoos of which his favorite was the ascension on brils bony back was a depiction of christ departing this world in the company of angels in brils version heaven was a dark and cloudy place but his angels had splendid wings for the chest jacob bril recommended christs agonyour saviors head bleeding in his crown of thorns christs hands and feet and side were also bleeding according to bril the blood was essential on his own chest in addition to our saviors bloody head jacob bril had a sacred textthe lords prayer on his upper arms and forearms were a virgin mary a christ child and two mary magdalenesone with a halo one without hed saved his stomach for that most frightening figure of lazarus leaving the grave alice liked to say that the lazarus tattoo was responsible for brils indigestion it was reasonable to hope that the two mary magdalenes might predispose bril to forgivenessespecially in regard to those working women in their windows and doorways in the redlight district but bril made his disapproval of the prostitutes plain from where he got off the train at the central station jacob bril could have walked to tattoo peters on the st olofssteeg without once passing a prostitute in fact the most direct route from the train station to the tattoo parlor did not go through the district but bril stayed in a hotel on the dam square the krasnapolsky in those days the krasnapolsky was considered quite a fancy hotel it was certainly too fancy for bril and whether leaving or returning to the krasnapolsky bril made a point of walking every street of the redlight districtboth to and from tattoo peters when he walked jacob brils pace was as quick as his rush to judgment two canals divided the district bril patrolled both banks of the two as well as the side streets in the narrowest alleys where the women in their doorways were close enough to touch bril hurried by at a frenzied pace the women who saw him coming withdrew as he passed jack used to think it was because bril caused a draft one day jack and his mom followed bril from the krasnapolsky they couldnt match the little mans speed jack would have had to run just to keep bril in sight the krasnapolsky was an overfancy hotel for jack and alicenot just for jacob brilbut theyd had a bad experience in a cheaper place de roode leeuw the red lion was on the damrak just opposite a department store where jack once became separated from his mother and managed to get lost for five or ten minutes at the red lion jack was fascinated by a rat he found in the hotels poolroom behind the rack for the pool cues jack discovered that by inserting a cue in one end of the rack and wiggling it he could make the rat run out the other side the red lion was a hotel favored by sales reps a previous guest had left a sizable stash of marijuana in one of jacks bureau drawers jack discovered it while looking for his underwear and used it to replace the bedraggled hay in a crèche his mom had given him at christmastime in copenhagen thus jacks little lord jesus lay in a bed of pot and mary and joseph and various kings and shepherds together with an assortment of other crèche figures were kneedeep in hemp not hay when alice discovered them she was led to the crèche by the smell de roode leeuw was not the hotel for them alice said but jack never saw her throw the marijuana away they moved to the krasnapolsky staying in a hotel above their means was becoming old hat for jack and alice although being in the same hotel with jacob bril would never have been their first choice the rat at the red lion was friendlier than bril was as for trying to follow jacob bril through the redlight district jack and alice tried it only that once not only was bril too fasthe didnt appreciate their company usually when jack and his mother walked through the district to and from tattoo peters they liked to play a game they tried to take a slightly different route each time that way they got to know all the prostitutes most of them were friendly in a short while they knew jacks name they called his mom by her tattoo name daughter alice the few women in their doorways and windows who were unfriendly to jack and alice were conspicuously so most of them were older womento jack some of them looked old enough to be his mothers motherbut a few of the younger women were unfriendly as well one of the younger ones was bold enough to speak to alice this is no place to be with a child she said i have to work too alice told her in those days most of the women in the redlight district were dutchmany of them not from amsterdam if a woman from amsterdam wanted to be a prostitute she might go to the hague women from the hague or from other dutch cities or the country girls came to amsterdam less of a scandal for the family not so much shame this was around the time families came to holland from their native suriname to see a brownskinned woman in the redlight district in was increasingly common and before the surinamese there were the brownskinned girls of a lighter hue from indonesiaa former dutch colony it was one of the darkerbrown women from suriname who gave jack a present what surprised him was that hed never seen her before but she knew his name she was in a window not in the redlight district but on either the korsjespoortsteeg or the bergstraat where jack and his mom went to make some inquiries about his dad jack thought the surinamese woman was a mannequinshe was sitting so still and she was so statuesquebut she suddenly came out on the street and gave him a chocolate the color of her skin ive been saving this for you jack she said the boy was too surprised to speak his mother reproved him for not thanking the woman properly most weekday mornings when jack and his mom walked through the redlight district on their way to tattoo peters not many women were workingthey went to work earlier on the weekends at night of course every red light was on and the district was teeming sometimes the prostitutes who knew and liked jack and alice were too busy to say their names or so much as nod in their direction even before the spring came when the weather was still cool the women were more often in their doorways than their windows they liked to talk to one another they wore high heels and short skirts and blouses or sweaters with low necklines but at least they wore clothes and their friendlinessto jack if not always to his motherenabled alice to mislead her son about the nature of prostitution in those days one saw only men visiting the prostitutes jack observed that the men looked most unhappy to be seen doing so and when the men left they were always in a hurry which stood in sharp contrast to how slowly they had walked in the district and how many times theyd passed a particular prostitutes doorway or window before they finally made up their minds about which woman to visit alice explained that this was because they were unhappy and indecisive men to begin with a prostitute jacks mom told him was a woman who gave advice to men who had difficulty understanding women in generalor one woman such as a wife in particular the reason the men looked ashamed of themselves was that they knew they should really be having such an important and personal conversation with their wives or girlfriends but they were inexplicably unable or unwilling to do so they were blocked alice said women were a mystery to them they could pour out their hearts only to strangers for a price jack didnt know who paid whom until his mom explained that the men did the paying it was an awful job to have to listen to these miserable men his mother said she clearly took pity on the prostitutes so jack did too she had contempt for the men so he also had contempt for them but jack and alices contempt could never measure up to that of jacob bril bril had a palpable scorn for the prostitutes and their customers he was full of contempt for jack and his mom too it was because she was an unwed mother and jack was an illegitimate child alice told her son bril also disapproved of alice because she was a tattoo artist he said that it was not a decent womans business to touch halfnaked men bril himself would not tattoo a womanexcept on her hand or forearm or on her foot or ankle any higher up her leg was too high he said any other part of a womans body was too intimate women seeking religious tattoos on either too high or too intimate a part of their bodies were told to see daughter alice although bril disapproved of her giving religious tattoos she was not religious enough to do them sincerely he said alice did a small pretty cross with roses which young women liked to tuck in their cleavageas if the cross were an overlong necklace with an invisible chain she did a christ on the cross that was shoulderbladesize it lacked some of the agony and much of the blood of brils dying jesus and she did our saviors head in his crown of thorns usually on an upper arm or thigh which bril criticized because he found her christs expression too ecstatic maybe my jesus is already entering heaven alice explained jacob bril dismissed this with a violent gesture he drew his forearm across his chest as if he were about to give alice a whack with the back of his bony hand not in my shop bril tattoo peter told him not around jack alices usual refrain bril looked at the two of them with a venom he normally reserved for the prostitutes jack and alice never saw jacob bril leave tattoo peters which he did every saturday at midnight when the redlight district was overflowing in the relentless pursuit of its principal enterpriseevery girl was working jack would wonder later how long it took bril to get back to the krasnapolsky passing every prostitute in every window and doorway did his pace never slow was there ever a woman who made him stop walking did the fire and brimstone only leave his eyes when bril was asleep or did hell burn even more brightly in his dreams many saturdays because alice disliked sharing tattoo peters otherwise warm shop with jacob bril peter would propose that she take her talents over to the zeedijk and see if she could teach a thing or two to theo rademaker at the red dragon poor tattoo theo peter would say ill bet he could use a break today or a lesson from daughter alice the muchmaligned tattoo theo was not in the category of a scratcher he simply had the misfortune to share the redlight district with a tattoo artist as good as tattoo peter rademaker was by no means as bad as sami salo or trond halvorsenit was judgment that he lacked alice said not ability and alice liked tattoo theos young apprentice robbie de wit it was well known in the neighborhood that robbie doted on her jack and alice skipped jacob brils company whenever they could bril hardly missed them he wanted them gone de rode draak was a welcome change of scenery for jack and his momlots of tourists went there especially on a saturday some of those saturdays if tattoo peter had more clients than he and jacob bril could handle peter was generous enough to send his customers to the red dragoncautioning them to ask for daughter alice rademaker must have been grateful for the extra business though it may have caused him some inner pain to hear a new client request alice tattoo theo liked alice and she liked him for jack and his mother their life had a pattern again their first weeks in the redlight district were not unlike their happiest days in copenhagen with tattoo ole and ladies man madsen like lars robbie de wit made an effort to win alices affection by being nice to jack while alice liked robbie that was as far as it went she shared robbies fondness for bob dylan they both sang along with the dylan songs that drowned out the sound of the tattoo machines in de rode draak rademaker liked dylan too he called dylan by his real name which he always said in the german wayas it would turn out incorrectly shall we listen again to der zimmerman tattoo theo would say winking at jack who was in charge of playing the old albums in german one listens to den zimmerman jack liked the wisp of whiskers on robbie de wits chin which reminded him of ladies man madsens efforts to grow a beard in the same place because jacks crèche figures including the baby jesus still smelled like pot he recognized the sweet scent of marijuana in robbies handrolled cigarettes but the boy didnt keep count of how many times his mother might have taken a toke she said it helped her to follow the tune when she sang along with bob rademaker had worked on a fishing boat one summer off the coast of alaska an eskimo tattooer had given him the tattoo of the seal on his chest and the one of the kodiak bear on his back relatively speaking jack and his mother were happyor so it seemed to jack his mom sent another postcard to mrs wicksteed at the time jack didnt know that mrs wicksteed had sent them money that they continued to stay in hotels above their means was in part mrs wicksteeds idea she was a good old girl all right maybe mrs wicksteed believed that a good hotel was as much a safeguard of alices future as losing her scottish accent the postcard was of one of amsterdams narrow canals of course you couldnt see the prostitutes in their windows or doorways in the picture jack sends his love to lottie alice wrote jack wouldnt remember if there was more to the message he drew a smiling face next to lotties name there was just enough room beside the face for him to write the initial j lottie will know who it is his mom assured him off to toronto went the postcard with jacks happy face but what about that little boy whose capacity for consecutive memory when he was three was comparable to that of a nineyearold what had happened to jacks retention of detail and understanding of linear time which when he was four were equal to an elevenyearolds not in amsterdam where jack imagined he had lived with his mother for a couple of months before they ever set foot in the oude kerk and heard that vast organ in reality of course alice wouldnt have waited a week to go there the oude kerk the old church in the center of the redlight district was probably consecrated in by the bishop of utrecht and is the oldest building in amsterdam the church survived two great firesthe first in the second in and the altars were badly damaged in the iconoclastic fury of in when amsterdam officially became a protestant city the oude kerk was stripped of its roman catholic decoration and renovated to suit the protestant religious service the pulpit dates from the choir screen from rembrandts first wife is buried in the old church and there are five tombs in commemoration of seventeenthcentury dutch sea heroes the organ which kari vaara correctly called vast is also old it was built by christian vater of hamburg germany in it took vater two years to build the huge and beautiful instrument of fortythree stops which went immediately out of tune the moment more than one register was pulled the organs failure was also vastfor eleven years it was out of tune finally a man named müller was assigned the task of dismantling the vater organ to investigate the problem it took him five years to fix it even so the organ in the oude kerk continued to be out of tune most of the time it is tuned before every concert because of the temperature in the old buildingthe oude kerk cannot be heated properly it was cold in the old church that day and jack and his mom sat on the organ bench with the junior organista doughfaced kid who was too young to shave he was a child prodigy apparently alice said she was told all about the youngsters talent by the senior organist jacob venderbos whod been too busy to see her venderbos also played the organ at the westerkerk in amsterdam and at churches in haarlem and delft alice got to talk to his fifteenyearold apprentice instead the young geniuss name was frans donker and he was as afraid of alice as any boy that age could be like andreas breivik he couldnt look at her when he talked as near as jack could tell what his mother learned from the frightened child prodigy was that kari vaara had been wrong to think that his father had been hired to play the organ in the oude kerkhed been hired only to keep it in tune for this ongoing and demanding service william was permitted to practice on the vast instrument it was indeed a special organ frans donker told jack and aliceboth great and difficultand william not only kept it in better tune than anyone could remember his practice sessions were both famous and infamous by now jack was distracted by the smell of baby powder and thoroughly confused i have the greatest respect for williamas an organist young donker was saying i thought he was just an organtuner now alice replied frans donker let her remark pass he solemnly explained that from early morning through the evening the oude kerk was a most active church in addition to the religious services and choir rehearsals various cultural events which were open to the public were scheduled at nightnot only concerts and recitals but also lectures and poetry readings it simply wouldnt do to have someone tuning an organ during the old churchs lengthy working hours so when did he do it alice asked well young donker hesitated maybe he said william wouldnt start the tuning until after midnight most nights he wouldnt begin his practice sessions until two or three in the morning so he was playing to an empty church alice asked well frans donker hesitated again jack was completely bored his mind elsewhere but he thought he heard donker say the oude kerk is a very big church a very reverberant building the reverberation time is five seconds the child prodigy glanced at jack and explained thats the time it takes for the echo of what you play to come back to you oh the boy said he was falling asleep young donker couldnt stop explaining your fathers favorite bach toccatas were written with the effect of a big space in mind space enlarges music forget the music alice interrupted him was he playing to an empty church well if what followed was hard for alice to understand it was way over a fouryearolds head if the reverberation time within the oude kerk was five seconds how long did it take for the echo of the organ in bachs most dramatic workshis d minor toccata for exampleto reach the prostitutes in their rooms on the oudekerksplein the horseshoeshaped street that surrounded the old church six or seven seconds maybe or did the whores hear it in five seconds too outside the church the organ would have been muted but at two or three in the morning when the action in the redlight district was winding down the cold winter air would have carried the sound well beyond the oudekerksplein the women working in the narrowest nastiest alleyin the nearby trompettersteegwould have had no trouble hearing william burns playing his beloved handel or his favorite bach even across the canal on the far side of the oudezijds voorburgwal the prostitutes still standing in their doorways would have heard him at that time of night many of the older prostitutes are ready to go homethey stop working frans donker managed to say with trepidationas if this part of his story might be in notaroundjack territory donker didnt know that jack believed prostitutes were simply tireless advicegivers trying to teach the most pathetic of men what they needed to learn about women there were many older prostitutes working in the redlight district in those dayssome in their sixtiesand a lot of them worked in the groundfloor rooms surrounding the old church the older women in the district might have been more easily moved by church music than their younger counterparts although donker admitted that a few of the younger prostitutes became overnight fans of bach and handel you mean the prostitutes came to hear him play alice asked frans fidgeted on the organ bench he slid to one side then the other on the smooth leather seat theres that babypowder smell again jack was thinking years later the smell of baby powder would remind jack of the prostitutes he could almost see the tired women taking their makeup off and hanging the costumes of their profession in their small closets they didnt wear high heels or short skirts when they went homeor when they came to work in the morning or afternoon their street clothes were blue jeans or old slacks their boots or heavy shoes had no heels to speak of and they usually wore an unflattering but warmlooking coat and a wool hat they didnt look like prostitutes except that it was two or three in the morning and what other sort of woman would be out at that time by herself what was it about the organ music that arrested them and held them captive in the redlight district for an hour or two longer frans donker explained that there would usually be a dozen or more women in the old church and that many of them stayed until william stopped playing this was often as late as four or five in the morning when the oude kerk was very cold william burns had found his audiencehe was playing to prostitutes they certainly appreciated him the boy genius continuedwith the authority that only a child prodigy or a lunatic possesses i occasionally got up at that time to hear him play myself each time i came more women were here hes very goodwilliam knows his bach and handel cold forget the music alice said again just tell me what happened it seems that one of the women took him home with heractually more than one of them did but that wasnt what happened or all that happened this time blame the baby powder for jacks loss of concentration the administration of the oude kerk probably believed it was unsavorythat william should be playing to prostitutes not to mention consorting with them after all it was a church they must have fired him or something like that and the prostitutesa few of the older ones anywaymade a fuss there was a protest amsterdam was always having demonstrations from the krasnapolsky jack and alice had seen their share of demonstrations in the dam square it was the time of the hippies alice was tattooing a lot of peace symbols and often in the genital area of both boys and girls that insipid slogan of the times make love not war surely one or more of the protests they witnessed were antivietnam war demonstrations maybe the prostitutes in the redlight district took williams side and they took him in they saw him as a persecuted artist frans donker said some of them see themselves that way as for where william was now the boy genius looked at jack not at alice when he spoke youd have to ask the prostitutes id start with the older ones alice knew which prostitutes to ask they were mostly but not all the older ones they were the women in the district whod been conspicuously unfriendly thank you for your time alice told the junior organist she got up from the bench and held out her hand to jack dont you want me to play something for you frans donker asked jacks mother was already pulling her son to the narrow stairs they were in a kind of loft at the rear of the old churchs great hall above and hidden from the congregation the towering organ pipes rose for twenty feet or more above them play something william plays if you want to alice told the young organist she had no intention of staying to listen as they were leaving jack saw donker sprinkle the leather bench with baby powder it was baby powder the seat of the prodigys pants was covered with it the powder helped him slide sideways along the bench he couldnt reach from one end of the threetiered keyboard to the other without sliding left to right and back again on the slippery leather a wooden pediment rose over the keyboard the wood was riddled with screw holes where the old brass fittings had fallen or been stripped away the organists only view beyond his music was confined to a panel of stained glass everything surrounding donker was old and worn but none of this mattered when he began to play alice could not escape the oude kerk in time the deep sonority the perfect tone placement the responding antiphony and the resounding echobachs toccata and fugue in d minorhit them hard as they were going down the stairs jack would long remember the wooden handrail on one side of their winding descent what served as a handrail on the other side was a waxed rope the color of burned caramel the rope was as thick as a mans wrist they staggered out of the stairway as if the great sound had made them drunk alice was seeking a hasty exit from the church but she made a wrong turn they found themselves in the center aisle facing the altars now they were surrounded by the enormous noise in the middle of where the congregation normally sat was a bewildered gathering of tourists a tour guide appeared to have been struck mute in midsentencehis mouth open as if the bach were coming from him whatever lecture hed been delivering would have to wait for the toccata and fugue to be finished outside on the oudekerksplein in the failing earlyevening light the prostitutes in their windows and doorways could hear the music too it was evident that they knew the piece donker was playing doubtless theyd listened to bachs toccata and fugue in d minor many times in the earlymorning hours by the prostitutes critical expressions jack and his mother knew that william played this piece better than young frans jack and alice hurried away it was no time to make inquiries of the unfriendly womennot while the music was playing the great sound followed them to the warmoesstraat gods holy noise pursued them past the police station they were more than halfway to tattoo peters on the st olofssteeg before the vast organ was out of earshot was williams career as an organist in decline was he merely tuning organs practicing but not performingor performing only at unsociable hours to an unrefined audience or was it actually a privilege just to hear that vast organ in the oude kerk it was a sound both huge and holy it compelled even prostitutes who are disinclined to do anything without being paid to give themselves over to it absolutelyto just listen also not on their itinerary on november leith suffered its first german air raid no damage was done to the port but alices mother miscarried in an overcrowded airraid shelter it was back then that i should have been born alice always said if alice had been born back then her mother might not have died in childbirth and alice might never have met william burnsor if she met him she would have been as old as he was in which case she claimed i would have been impervious to his charms jack somehow doubted this even as a child if the boy couldnt remember the name of the surinamese prostitute who gave him a chocolate the color of her skin on either the korsjespoortsteeg or the bergstraat he did remember that those two small streets between the singel and the herengracht were some distance from the redlight districtabout a ten or fifteenminute walkand the area was more residential and less seedy as to what rumor of william led alice to make inquiries there it was either blond nel or black lola who told her to consult the bicycle man uncle gerrit black lola was an older white woman whose hair was dyed jetblack and uncle gerrit was a grouchy old man who did the prostitutes shopping on his bicycle he carried a notebook in which the women wrote down what they wanted for lunch or a snack he objected to the girls who gave him too extensive a shopping list and he refused to shop for tampons or condoms if there were a tampon or condom man who did errands for the prostitutes jack and his mom never met him the women teased uncle gerrit incessantly he would stop shopping for a particular prostitute just to punish her for teasing himusually for only a couple of days a rakethin prostitute named saskia was in the habit of asking alice and jack to buy her a sandwich saskia was a ceaselessly ravenous young woman and uncle gerrit was always mad at her she gave jack or his mom the money for a hamandcheese croissant almost every time she saw them when jack and alice passed by again they would give saskia the sandwichprovided she wasnt with a customer because saskia was a popular prostitute jack got to eat a lot of hamandcheese croissants alice didnt mind buying a sandwich for saskia with her own money like many women in the redlight district saskia had a story to tell and alice was a good listenerthat is if you were a woman women with sad stories seemed to know this about alice probably because they could see she was a sad story herself saskia had a twoman story the first man to hurt her was a client who set fire to the poor girl in her room on the bloedstraat he tried to squirt her in the face with lighter fluid but saskia was able to shield her eyes and nose with her right forearm she was badly burned but only from her wrist to her elbow when the wound healed saskia adorned her burnscarred arm with bracelets in the doorway of her room on the bloedstraat saskia would extend the arm into the street and jingle her bracelets it got your attentionyou had to look at her saskia attracted a lot of customers that way she was too thin to be prettyand she never opened her mouth when she smiled at a potential client because her teeth were bad its a good thing prostitutes arent expected to kiss their customers she told jack because no one would want to kiss me then she grinned at the boy showing him her broken and missing teeth maybe not around jack alice cautioned her there was something wildly alluring about saskia with those jingling bracelets all on one armher left arm the unburned one was bare maybe men thought she was a woman who would lose control of herself possibly her aura of a damage more internal than her burned arm attracted them you could see like a flame the hurt in her eyes the second man in saskias twoman story was a client who beat her up because she wouldnt take her bracelets off hed heard about her burn and wanted to see the scar at the time jack assumed this was a man in even more need of advice than the prostitutes usual customers saskia made such a wail that four other women on the bloedstraat and three girls who worked around the corner on the oudezijds achterburgwal heard her and came to her rescue they dragged the man in acute need of advice out on the bloedstraat where they whipped and gouged him with coat hangers and hit him with a plumbers helperall this before one of the women got a clean shot at his head with the metal drain plug of a bidet with which she beat him bloody he was senseless and raving and no doubt still in need of advice when the police came and took him away that was what happened to your teeth jack asked saskia thats right jack she said i show my burn scar only to people i like would you and your mom like to see it of course the boy replied only if were not imposing alice answered youre not imposing at all saskia said she took them into her small room closing the door and the curtains as if jack and his mother were her customers jack was astonished by how little furniture there was in the roomjust a single bed and a night table the lighting was lowonly one lamp with a red glass shade the wardrobe closet was without a door mostly underwear hung there and a whip like a lion tamer would use there was a sink and the kind of white enamel table you might expect to see in a hospital or a doctors office the table was piled high with towels one of which was spread out on the bedin case the men in need of advice were wearing wet clothes jack imagined there was no place to sit except on the bed which was an odd place to give or get advice jack thought but it seemed natural enough to saskia who sat down on the bed and invited jack and alice to sit down beside her one by one she took her bracelets off and handed them to jack in the red glow from the lamp with the glass shade the boy and his mom examined the wrinkled rawlooking surface of saskias scar which resembled a scalded chicken neck go on jackyou can touch it she said he did so reluctantly does it hurt he asked not anymore saskia replied do your teeth hurt the boy inquired not the missing ones jack one by one she let him put her bracelets back on he was careful to do it in the right order biggest to smallest who could refuse to bring that thin hungry girl a sandwich jack despised uncle gerrit the bicycle man for being so mad at saskia that he refused to shop for her but the cranky old prostituteshopper had his reasons hed often parked his bicycle outside the oude kerk in the earlymorning hours he had more than once slipped into a pew in the old church and listened to the elevating music uncle gerrit was a william burns fan maybe saskia wasnt you should talk to femke the bicycle man said to alice i was the one who told william to see her femke knows whats best for the boy while this made no sense to jack he could tell that uncle gerrit was mad at his mother too jack and his mom were standing on the stoofsteeg as the bicycle man pedaled away he turned the corner and pedaled past the casa rosso where they showed porn films and had livesex showsnot that jack had a clue what they were more advicegiving for all he knew the prostitute in the doorway at the end of the stoofsteeg was named els jack thought she was about his mothers age or only a little older she had always been friendly shed grown up on a farm els told jack and his mom that she expected she would one day see her father or her brothers in the redlight district and wouldnt they be surprised to see her in a window or a doorway she would not ask them in she said they were somehow beyond advising jack assumed whos femke jack asked his mom els said ill tell you femkes story maybe not around jack alice said come in and well see if i can tell it in a way that wont offend jack els said as it turned out either els or alice would tell femkes story in a way that totally confused the boy els always wore a platinumblond wig jack had never seen her real hair when she put her big arm around jacks shoulders and pulled his face against her hip he could feel how strong she waslike youd expect a former farm girl to be and els had the bust and the announcing décolletage of an opera singer her bosom preceded her with the authority of a great ships prow when a woman like that says shell tell you a story you better pay attention but jack was instantly distracted to his surprise elss room was very much like saskias once again there was no place to sit except on the bed on which there was a towel spread out and so the three of them sat there alice neednt have been concerned that femkes story was notaroundjack material the boy was mesmerized by the prostitutes room and her gigantic breasts jack couldnt comprehend what els had to say about femke who he thought was a relative newcomer to the advicegiving business confusingly femke was also the wellheeled exwife of an amsterdam lawyer maybe theyd been partners in the same law firmall jack heard was something about a family law practice and then the plot thickened femke had discovered that her husband made frequent visits to the more upscale prostitutes on the korsjespoortsteeg and the bergstraat shed been a faithful wife but she made dutch divorce history in more than the alimony department femke bought a prominent room on the bergstraat on the corner of the herengracht it was unusual for a prostitutes room in that it had a basement window and the door was at the bottom of a small flight of stairs both the doorway and the window were below sidewalk level so that pedestrians looked down at the prostitute who was also visible from a passing car was femke so enraged that she would actually buy a room for prostitution and rent the space to a working prostitutethus eventually making a profit from the sordid enterprise that had wrecked her marriage or did she have something more mischievous in mind that femke herself appeared in the basement window or the doorway on the bergstraat and that a few of her first clients were business associates of her former husbandincluding some gentlemen who had known the couple sociallywas certainly a shock apparently not to femkeshe was aware that she was attractive to most men if not to her exhusband she was met with mixed reviews from her fellow prostitutes on the korsjespoortsteeg and the bergstraat her very public triumph over her former husband was much admired and while it was appreciated that femke had become an activist for prostitutes rightsafter all she was a woman whose convictions which were so bravely on display had to be respectedshe was herself not a real prostitute or so some prostitutes els among them believed femke certainly didnt need the money she could afford to be choosy and she was she turned many clients downa luxury unknown to those women working in the redlight district and the prostitutes in their windows or doorways on the korsjespoortsteeg and the bergstraat furthermore the customers femke turned down were humiliated the firsttimers might have thought that all the prostitutes were as likely to reject them a few of femkes fellow sex workers on the bergstraat claimed that she hurt their business more directly not only was femke the most soughtafter of the prostitutes on the street but when she spurned a clientin full view of her near neighbors in their doorways and windows on the bergstraatthe ashamed man was sure to take his business to another street he didnt want to be in the company of a woman whod seen femke turn him down yet she had her alliesamong the older prostitutes especially and when she discovered those other music lovers assembled in the old church in the wee hours of the morning femke established some fierce friendships was jack wrong to imagine that it might have been an easy transition for both choirgirls and prostitutes to makenamely to love the organist as a natural result of loving his music to judge femke by her revenge against her exhusband one might have thought she would have been more possessive in her attachment to william burns but femke had rejoiced in his music and in his company in her liberation from her former husband shed discovered another kind of lovea kinship with women who sold sex for money and gave it away selectively if more than one of the music lovers in williams audience at the oude kerk had taken him home how many of them had given him their advice for free jack would wonder much later if those redlight women were his fathers greatest conquest or were women who gave advice to men for money inclined to be stingy advicegivers to those rare men they didnt charge to a fouryearold it was a very confusing story then again maybe you had to be a fouryearold to believe it confusing or not that was femkes story more or less as els told italtered as everything is by time and by alices retelling of the story to jack over the ensuing years when the boy and his mother went to see femke in her room on the bergstraat it was clear shed been expecting them femke didnt dress like a prostitute her clothes were more appropriate for a hostess at an elegant dinner party her skin was as golden and flawless as her hair her bosom swelled softly and her hips had a commanding jut she was in every respect a knockoutlike no one jack had seen in a window or a doorway in amsterdam beforeand there emanated from her such a universal disdain that it was easier to believe how many men she turned away than to imagine her ever accepting a customer what a sizable contempt femke must have felt for alice who had ceaselessly chased after a man whod so long ago rejected her femkes evident contempt for children struck jack as immeasurable the boy may have misinterpreted femkes feelings for his mother jack probably thought that femke disliked him he instantly wanted to leave her room which compared to the other two prostitutes rooms hed seen was almost as pretty as femkeit was also lavishly furnished there was no bed just a large leather couch and there were no towels there was even a desk a comfortablelooking leather armchair was in the window corner under a reading lamp and next to a bookcase perhaps femke sat reading in her window not bothering to look at the potential clients passing by to get her attention the men must have had to come down the short flight of stairs and knock on her door or on the window would she then look up from her book annoyed to have had her reading interrupted there were paintings on the wallslandscapes one with a cowand the rug was an oriental as expensivelooking as she was in fact femke was jacks first encounter with the unassailable power of moneyits blindtoeverythingelse arrogance what took you so long she said to alice can we go jack asked his mom he held out his hand to her but she wouldnt take it i know youre in touch with him alice told the prostitute in touch with him femke repeated she moved her hips she wet her lips with her tongue her gestures were as ripe with selfindulgence as a woman stretching in bed in the morning after a good nights sleep her clothes looked as welcoming to her body as a warm bath even standing or sitting in a straightbacked chair her body appeared to loll even sound asleep femke would look like a cat waiting to be stroked hadnt someone said that femke chiefly and safely chose virgins she picked young boys the police insisted that femke require them to show her proof of their age jack would never forget her or how afraid she made him feel virgins alice had explained to jack were inexperienced young menno woman had ever given them advice before that late afternoon in femkes room on the bergstraat was the first time jack felt in need of some advice regarding women but he was too afraid to ask if youre still in touch with him perhaps youll be so kind as to give him a message alice continued do i look kind femke asked can we go jack asked again his mom still wouldnt take his hand jack looked out the window at a passing car there were no potential clients looking in alice was saying something she sounded upset a father should at least know what his son looks like william certainly knows what the boy looks like femke replied it was as if she were saying i think william has seen enough of jack already thats the kind of information or misinformation that can change your life it certainly changed jacks from that day forth hed tried to imagine his father stealing a look at him did william see jack fall through the ice and into the kastelsgraven would the music man have rescued his son if the littlest soldier hadnt come along was william watching jack eat breakfast at the grand hotel in stockholm did his dad see him stuffing his face at that sundaymorning buffet at the hotel bristol in oslo or suspended in the derelict elevator above the american bar at the hotel torni in helsinki and on those saturdays in amsterdam when jack often sat in the window or stood in the doorway of the red dragon on the zeedijk just watching the busy weekend streetthe countless men who roamed the redlight districtwas his father once or twice passing by with the crowd if william knew what his son looked like as femke had said how many times might jack have seen him and not known who he was but how could he not have recognized william burns not that william would have been so bold as to take off his shirt and show jack the music inscribed on his skin but wouldnt there have been something familiar about his father maybe the eyelashes as a few women had pointed out while peering into jacks face that day in femkes room on the bergstraat jack started looking for william burns in a way jack had looked for him ever sinceand on such slim evidence that a woman he thought was a prostitute who may have been lyingwho was unquestionably crueltold him that his dad had seen him alice had contradicted femke on the spot shes lying jack youre the one whos lying to yourself femke replied its a lie to think that william still loves youits a joke to assume that he ever did i know he loved me once alice said if william ever loved you he couldnt bear to see you prostitute yourself femke said it would kill him to see you in a window or a doorway wouldnt it that is if he cared about you of course he cares about me alice cried imagine that you are four and your mother is in a shouting match with a stranger do you really hear the argument arent you trying so hard to understand the last thing that was saidto interpret itthat you miss the next thing that is said and the thing after that isnt that how a fouryearold hears or doesnt hear an adult argument just think of william seeing you in a doorway singing that little hymn or prayer im sure you know femke was saying how does it go breathe on me breath of godhave i got it right femke also knew the tune which she hummed its scottish isnt it she asked anglican actually alice said he taught it to you femke shrugged he taught it to all the whores in the oude kerk he played it they sang it im sure he played it for you and you sang it too i dont need to prove that william loved menot to you alice said to me what do i care femke asked you need to prove it to yourself wouldnt it bother williamif you accepted a customer or two or three or four that is if he ever cared about you not around jack alice said get a babysitter for jack femke told her youve got a few friends in the redlight district havent you thank you for your time alice said only then did she take jacks hand walking from the bergstraat they reentered the redlight district on the oudekerksplein it was early evening just growing dark the organ in the oude kerk wasnt playing but the women were all in their doorwaysas if they knew jack and alice were coming anja was one of the older ones she was on and off in the friendliness department it must have been one of anjas off nights because she was humming the tune to breathe on me breath of god which seemed a little cruel its not much of a tune as a communion prayer sung instead of spoken the words matter more than the tune like many simple things jack thought it was beautiful it was one of his moms favorites they next passed margriet one of the younger girls who always called jack jackie this time she said nothing then came annelies naughty nanda katja angry anouk mistress mies and roos the redhead they were humming the tune of the hymn which alice ignored only old jolanda knew the words breathe on me breath of god she was singing youre not going to do it are you jack asked his mother i dont care if i ever see him the boy lied maybe alice said im the one who wants to see him jack or she might have said hes the one who wants to see you jackie when alice told tattoo peter about femkes idea the onelegged man tried to talk her out of it peter had woody the woodpecker tattooed on his right biceps jack got the impression that even the woodpecker was opposed to the idea of his mom singing a hymn in a prostitutes window or doorway years later he would ask his mother what ever happened to the picture she took of him with tattoo peters woody the woodpecker maybe the photograph didnt turn out was all she said after posing with the woodpecker jack and his mom walked down to the red dragon where robbie de wit rolled alice some joints which she put in her purse perhaps robbie took their picture with tattoo theo jack used to think maybe that photo didnt turn out either they bought a hamandcheese croissant for saskia who was busy with a customer on the bloedstraat so jack ate the sandwich while they walked over to the corner of the stoofsteeg where jack drifted in and out of his moms conversation with els i dont recommend it els was saying to alice but of course you can use my room and ill look after jack from the doorway of elss room jack and his mom couldnt see saskias window or doorway on the bloedstraat they had to cross the canal in order to see if saskia was still busy with her client she was by the time they walked back to elss room els was with a customer of her own jack and alice went back to the bloedstraat and chatted with janneke the prostitute who was saskias nearest neighbor whats with the hymn janneke asked alice or is it some kind of prayer alice just shook her head the three of them stood out on the street waiting for saskias client to slink out the door which he did a few minutes later if he had a tail like a dog it would be between his legs janneke observed i suppose so alice said finally saskia opened her curtains and saw them on the street she waved smiling with her mouth open which was never the way she would smile at a potential customer saskia told alice she could use her room too and thatbetween her and elsjack would be properly looked after i really appreciate it alice told the burned and beaten girl if you ever want a tattoo her voice trailed away saskia couldnt look at her its not the worst thing saskia said to no one in particular alice shook her head again you know what jack saskia asked she seemed eager to change the subject you look like a kid who just ate a hamandcheese croissant you lucky bugger in amsterdam all the prostitutes were registered with the police the women were photographed and the police kept a record of their most personal details some of these were probably irrelevant but if the prostitute had a boyfriend that was relevant because if she was murdered or beaten up it was often the boyfriend who did itusually not a customer there were no minors among the prostitutes in those days and the police were on the friendliest possible terms with the women in the redlight district the police knew almost everything that went on there one morning which felt almost like spring jack and alice went to the warmoesstraat police station with els and saskia a nice policeman named nico oudejans interviewed alice saskia had requested nico both when shed been burned and when shed been beaten up he had been the first street cop to arrive at the scene on the bloedstraat jack may have been disappointed that nico was wearing plainclothes not a uniform but nico was the redlight districts favorite officernot just a familiar cop on the beat but the policeman the prostitutes most trusted he was in his late twenties or early thirties to the boyfriend question alice said noshe didnt have onebut nico was suspicious of her answer then whos the guy youre singing for alice hes a former boyfriend alice said she put her hand on the back of jacks neck hes jacks father we would consider him a boyfriend the policeman politely told her possibly it was els who said its just for an afternoon and part of one night nico im not going to admit any customers alice might have told the nice cop im just going to sit in the window or stand in the doorway and sing if you turn everyone down youre going to make some men angry at you alice nico said it must have been saskia who said one of us will always be nearby when shes using my room ill be watching out for her when shes using elss room els will be hanging around and where will you be jack nico asked hes going to be with me or els saskia replied nico oudejans shook his head i dont like the sound of it alicethis isnt your job i used to sing in a choir alice told him i know how to sing its no place to sing a hymn or say a prayer the policeman said maybe you could come by from time to time saskia suggested to him just in case she draws a crowd shell draw one all right nico said so what els asked a new girl always draws a crowd when a new girl takes a customer inside and closes the curtains the crowd usually goes away nico oudejans said im not going to admit any customers alice might have repeated sometimes its easier than saying no saskia said virgins for examplethey can be nice theyre quick too els told alice not around jack just not too young a virgin alice nico oudejans said i really appreciate it alice told him if you ever want a tattoo she stopped maybe she thought that if she offered him a free tattoo the policeman would construe this as a bribe he was a nice guy nico oudejans his eyes were a robinsegg blue and high on one cheekbone he had a small scar shaped like the letter l out on the warmoesstraat alice thanked els and saskia for helping her get permission from the police to be a prostitute for an afternoon and part of one night i figured it would be easier to talk nico into it than to talk you out of it saskia said saskia always does whats easier els explained the three women laughed they were walking the way dutch girls sometimes do side by side with their arms linked together alice was in the middle els was holding jacks hand the warmoesstraat ran the length of one edge of the redlight district jack and alice were on their way back to the krasnapolsky els and saskia were going to help alice pick out what to wearshe wanted to wear her own clothes she said alice didnt own a skirt as short as the ones saskia wore in her window or doorway on the bloedstraat or a blouse with a neckline as revealing as the ones els wore when she was giving advice on the stoofsteeg it must have been about eleven in the morning when they came to the corner of the sint annenstraat only one prostitute was working way at the end of the street but even at that distance she recognized them the prostitute waved and they waved back because they were looking down the sint annenstraat into the district they didnt see jacob bril coming toward them on the warmoesstraat they were still walking four abreast there was no way bril could get around them he said something sharply in dutcha curse or some form of condemnation saskia snapped back at him even though els and saskia were not dressed for their doorways bril surely recognized them after all hed made quite a comprehensive study of the prostitutes in the neighborhood the three women had to unlink their arms for jacob bril to pass by them it might have been the first time bril had been forced to stop walking in the redlight district of course bril knew aliceshe was standing between the two prostitutes as for the boy bril always appeared to look right through him it was as if he never saw jack in the lords eyes you are the company you keep jacob bril told alice i like the company i keep just fine alice replied what would you know about the lords eyes els asked bril nobody knows what god sees saskia said he sees even the smallest sin bril shouted he remembers every act of fornication most men do els told him saskia shrugged i find i forget it most of the time she said they watched jacob bril scurry down the sint annenstraat as purposefully as a rat the lone prostitute at the far end of the street was no longer in her doorway she must have seen bril coming jacob bril is a good reason for me to be off the street before midnight alice said i cant imagine what hed say if he saw me sitting in a window or heard me singing in a doorway she laughed in that brittle way the kind of laughter jack recognized as a precursor to her tears it was els or saskia who said there are better reasons than bril to be off the street before midnight they came out of the warmoesstraat in the dam square and walked into the krasnapolsky whats fornication jack asked giving advice alice answered good advice mostly saskia said necessary advice anyway els added whats sin jack asked just about everything alice answered theres good sin and bad sin els told jack there is saskia said she looked as confused as jack was i mean good advice and bad advice els explained it seemed to jack that sin was more complicated than fornication entering the hotel room alice said the thing about sin jack is that some people think its very important and other people dont even believe it exists what do you think about it the boy asked alice appeared to trip although jack saw nothing that she could have tripped on she just started to fall but els caught her damn heels alice said but she wasnt wearing heels now listen jack saskia spoke up weve got a job to domaking sure your mom wears the right clothes is important we cant be distracted by a conversation about something as difficult as sin well have that conversation later els assured the boy have it once the singing startshave it without me alice said but els just steered her to the closet saskia was already looking through alices dresser drawers she held up a bra that would have been much too big for her but not nearly big enough for els saskia said something in dutch which made els laugh youre going to be disappointed in my clothes alice told the prostitutes the way jack remembered it his mom tried on every article of clothing in her closet alice was always very modest around jack he never saw his mother naked or half naked and for an hour or more in the krasnapolsky was the first time he saw so much of her in a bra and panties even then alice clasped the sides of her breasts with her upper arms and elbows and crossed her hands on her chest to cover herself jack actually saw more of saskia and els than he did of his mother because the two women surrounded her as they dressed and undressed herthey were full of advice finally a dress was chosen it struck jack as pretty but plain the dress was like his momshe was pretty but plain at least in comparison to how the women looked and dressed in the redlight district it was a sleeveless black dress with a high neckline it fit her closely but it wasnt too tight alice didnt own a pair of genuine high heels but the heels she chose for the occasion were mediumhighor they were high for herand she put on her pearl necklace it had belonged to her mother her father gave it to her on the day she left scotland for nova scotia alice thought they were cultured pearls but she didnt really know the necklace meant a lot to her no matter what kind of pearls they were wont i be cold in a sleeveless dress alice asked saskia and els the women found a fitted black cardigan in the closet that sweater is too small for me alice complained i cant button it up you dont need to button it els told her its just to keep your arms warm you should leave the sweater open and hug your arms around yourself saskia said showing her how to do it if you look like youre a little cold thats sexy i dont want to look sexy alice replied whats sexy jack asked if you look sexy the men think you can give them good advice els explained the two prostitutes were fussing over alices hair and there was still the matter of lipstick to resolveand makeup i dont want lipstick i dont want makeup alice told them but they wouldnt listen to her believe me you want lipstick els told her something dark saskia said and eye shadow i hate eye shadow alice cried you dont want william looking in your eyes and really seeing you do you els asked her i mean supposing for a moment that he actually shows up that quieted alice she let the women make her up jack just watched the transformation his mothers face looked more chiseled her mouth bolder most foreign of all was the darkness shrouding her eyes which made her look as if someone close to her had died and she was keeping the death from jack overall his mom looked a lot older how do i look alice asked you look smashing saskia said there were always a lot of englishmen in the redlight district saskia probably thought that smashing sounded good in english forget a crowdyoure going to draw a mob els told alice but alice didnt necessarily like the sound of that how do you think i look jackie she asked you look very beautiful he told her but not really like my mom this seemed to alarm her you look like alice to me saskia said reassuringly sure you do els told her all we did to her jack was make her more of a secret whats the secret alice asked els means we had to hide you a little saskia said what we hid was the mom in her jack els added because thats just for you to see saskia said rumpling the boys hair ill be fine alice announced she turned away from the mirror and didnt look back the redlight district in amsterdam is smaller than many tourists realize it is such a warren of tiny streetsat peak hours densely populatedthat firsttime visitors get lost in the maze and imagine that the prostitutes in their windows and doorways go on forever in truth you could stroll from one end of the district to the otherfrom the damstraat to the zeedijkin under ten minutes from the area of the old church to saskias room on the bloedstraat or elss room on the stoofsteeg was less than a fiveminute walk on a saturday afternoon word of a new girl in a window or a doorway spread quickly a woman who didnt look like a prostitute singing what sounded like a hymn was dividing her time between a doorway on the stoofsteeg and one on the bloedstraat the story raced through the redlight district like a fire before nightfall the older women working on the oudekerksplein had linked arms and come to hear for themselves how daughter alice could sing anja came with annelies and naughty nanda katja came with angry anouk and mistress mies around suppertime roos the redhead showed up with old jolanda the aging prostitutes said nothing and didnt stay long they had expected alice to make a fool of herself but when a pretty woman has a pretty voice she rarely looks or sounds like a fool to those men prowling the streets alices singing might have seemed as beguiling a comeon as the jingling bracelets on saskias burned arm yet alice rejected all comers she was a woman occupying a prostitutes doorway or sitting in a prostitutes window but she just shook her head to every potential client who expressed an interest in her she occasionally needed to interrupt her hymn and more firmly say no once when she was using elss room alice had to tell a particularly persistent gentleman that she was waiting for her boyfriend and did not want to miss him by being busy with a customer when he showed up saskia supplied a dutch translation and the man finally went away and when she was using saskias room alice was heckled by a bunch of young men she must have turned down one of the boys or all of them and in response to being spurned they had gathered around her doorway and were loudly singing a song of their own alice went inside saskias room and closed the door she sat in the window still singing the words to breathe on me breath of god although no one could hear her els told the boys to move on all but one of them were still arguing with her when nico oudejans suddenly appeared in the bloedstraat when the boys didnt walk away fast enough nico shouted at them and they began to run the one boy who hadnt argued with els was running backwardhe simply couldnt take his eyes off alice nico smiled at jack who waved to his mom in the window she just went on singing ill keep checking on her jackand on you too the policeman said it would have been easier to invite the men inside the room their disappointment in being denied advice ran the gamut from utter incomprehension to anger some would simply look embarrassed and skulk awayothers were baffled or belligerent alice just kept singing she wouldnt even stop long enough to eat a hamandcheese croissant which saskia and jack brought her and not long after dark tattoo theo paid her a visit he had stuffed a basket with a bottle of wine and some fruit and cheese but alice wouldnt accept it she gave rademaker a hug and a kiss then she waved els and jack over to her doorway and gave them the basket naturally they took the food and wine to saskia who was always starving robbie de wit showed up too he looked heartbroken at the sight of alice singing soundlessly in saskias window robbie had brought her a couple of marijuana cigarettes which alice accepted when she left the window for the doorway she would light one of the joints and take a hit from it while she went on singing it would be years before jack made the connectionnamely that it was one of those nights bob dylan could have written a terrific song about around ten oclock that night when the redlight district was very crowded els and saskia and jack accompanied alice on the short walk from saskias room on the bloedstraat to elss room on the stoofsteeg els was carrying jack the boy was half asleep with his head on her shoulder alice didnt sing when she was changing rooms do you think williams ever going to show up she asked i never thought he was going to show up saskia said you should call it a night alice els told her she unlocked the door to her room and alice took up her usual position in the doorway she was about to start the hymn again when she saw femke coming toward her on the stoofsteeg youre not singing femke said hes not coming is he alice asked her both saskia and els started in on femkethey were furious and let her know it jack woke up but he had no idea what they were saying it was all in dutch femke didnt back down to them not a bit els and saskia kept after her jack thought els was going to throw femke down on the cobblestone street but they stopped shouting when alice began to sing jack had never heard her do breathe on me breath of god any better femke looked undone by her voice possibly femke said i didnt think youd actually do it alice just kept singingif anything a little louder but jack was so out of it for all he knew femke might have said i didnt think hed actually accept it as jack understood things his father was playing a piano on a cruise shipor someone was the piano seemed to surprise alice but most organists learn how to play piano firstcertainly william had maybe the surprise was that william wanted to sail to australia and get tattooed by cindy ray alice had switched hymns but she was nonetheless continuing to singheedless of such a small thing as punctuation or the fact that william might already have been on his way to australia the king of love my shepherd is she sang she just kept repeating that line did william hope that australia would be too far away for alice and jack to follow him there jack was falling asleep on elss big soft bosom alice had switched hymns again and showed no sign of stopping sweet sacrament divine she sang repeatedly the purity of alices voice followed femke down the street by the time femke left the stoofsteeg alice had switched back to breathe on me breath of god and jack woke up you can stop now alice saskia said but alice wouldnt stop wheres australia jack asked els he just knew that australia wasnt on their itinerary dont worry jackyoure not going anywhere near australia saskia said its on the other side of the world els told him the boy felt better thinking that his dad might be on the other side of the world yet this wouldnt prevent jack from imagining that his father was somehow watching him from a crowd come on aliceits time to stop saskia said the king of love my shepherd is alice started up again a little tonelessly theyd been so interested in watching femkes departure that they hadnt noticed jacob brils arrival it wasnt even midnight but there was bril on the stoofsteeg and he wasnt walking he stood paralyzed in a religious rage thats a hymn youre singingthats a prayer bril yelled at alice she looked right at him and went ahead with sweet sacrament divine in her state of mind maybe three hymnsor just their titleswere all she could remember blasphemy bril shouted sacrilege saskia said something in dutch to him it didnt sound especially religious els stepped up to bril and shoved him he dropped to one knee but kept himself from falling with the heel of one hand on the cobblestones when he straightened up els shoved him again he managed to stay on his feet but he bounced off the side of the building not around jack els told him calmly she stepped forward to shove him again but bril backed away from her wheres nico when you need him saskia said facetiouslyels didnt appear to need nicos help alice began again with breathe on me breath of god that was when they all saw himthe boy who had not argued with els the one whod run backward out of the bloedstraat he was there because he needed another look at alice this time he was alone els spoke to him in dutch she looked as if she intended to shove him now that bril was retreating leave him alone he was the only nice one alice told els she had finally stopped singing she smiled at the boy who stood helplessly in front of her he looks like he needs advice doesnt he alice asked alice you dont have to saskia said but he looks like he needs advice alice said saskia or i can give it to him els told her i think its my advice he wants alice said you should call it a night alice els repeated would you like to come inside alice asked the boy he didnt look as if he understood english els translated for him and he nodded come on jack saskia said she took his hand i could use a hamandcheese croissant couldnt you the boy in need of advice had an olive complexion and very dark hair cut short he was smallboned with wide staring eyes and features as fine as a girls he had not moved since hed been invited inside the prostitutes roomhe just stood there hed wanted to have another look at alice never imagining that he would get up the nerve to ask her again or even have the opportunity to do sothat is if hed asked her the first time from the look of him hed been too scared probably one or more of his friends the hecklers had asked her els stepped up behind him and pushed him toward alice who took his hand and pulled him inside the room the top of his head barely came to her chin when alice had closed the door and the curtains els joined saskia and jack is he a virgin jack asked them definitely els said remembering what nico oudejans had said to his mom at the police station jack asked is he too young a virgin nobodys too young at this time of night saskia said jack had been napping half the afternoon and nightfirst for an hour or so in elss room and then in saskias and of course in elss arms when she carried him here and therebut now he was exhausted when they got back to saskias room saskia closed her curtains so jack could go to sleep she stood in her doorway guarding him whileevery fifteen or twenty minutesels would walk back to her room on the stoofsteeg to see if alice was still advising the virgin jack managed to stay awake for the first two trips els took i thought els said virgins were quick the boy remarked go to sleep jack saskia said its taking a long time because the virgins english isnt very good your mom probably has to speak very slowly to him oh go to sleep jack much later the sound of whispering woke jack the three women sat on the edge of saskias bed in the glow from the lamp with the red glass shade there was hardly any room on the bed for jack who didnt let them know he was awake his moms string of pearls was broken els and saskia were trying to help alice put her necklace back together the clumsy oaf saskia said thats the trouble with virgins he didnt mean tohed just never taken off a necklace before alice whispered i think theyre cultured pearls is that good or bad you should have kept the necklace on alice els told her he was really very sweethed just never done anything before alice whispered he must have had a lot of money for all that time saskia said oh i didnt charge himthat would have made me a prostitute the three women laughed shhh well wake up jack alice whispered im awake he told them did you give that boy some good advice he asked his mom she gave jack a hug and a kiss while saskia and els went on trying to reassemble her broken necklace yes it was pretty good advice i think alice replied the best advice hell ever get saskia said at least for free els added the three women laughed again youll have to take this damn thing to a jeweler saskia said handing alice the damaged necklace and a bunch of unstrung pearls alice put the loose pearls and the necklace in her purse saskia and els volunteered to walk them back to the krasnapolsky but alice proposed a slight detour she wanted to walk by the oudekerksplein just to show those old prostitutes she was still standing its too latemost of them will have stopped working els told her its worth doing saskia said even if only one woman is working the others will hear about it it must have been two or three in the morning they had just come off the oudekennissteeg when the music hit them it was even louder on the bridge across the old canal that organ in the oude kerk was a holy monster bach jack asked his mother its bach all right alice said but its not your father how do you know els asked femke is such a bitch you should at least have a look and see its bachs fantasy in g major alice said its popular at weddings weddings were not exactly williams cup of tea apparently but saskia and els insisted on having a look at the organist alice wanted to walk around the oudekerksplein before going inside the old church so they did only one prostitute was standing in her doorway listening to the music she was one of the younger onesmargriet youre up late jackie margriet said were all up late els told her they went into the oude kerk two of the older prostitutes were sitting in a pew and one of them naughty nanda appeared to be asleep the other one angry anouk wouldnt look at alice they went to the staircase at the back of the great congregation hall but only saskia and els and jack started up the narrow stairs alice waited for them at the bottom of the staircase hes in australia or sailing to it she said stubbornly just imagine all the ladies hell get to meet on a cruise ship the faint innocent smell of baby powder preceded their view of frans donker the junior organist the sudden appearance of saskia and els startled the boy geniushe stopped playing then donker saw jack standing between the two prostitutes oh i suppose you thought it was your father frans said to jack not really saskia said dont talkjust keep playing els told him the child prodigy had returned to the bach before they reached the bottom of the stairs its that donker kid right alice asked they all nodded he plays like an organtuner alice said bachs fantasy in g major followed them past the trompettersteeg where several of the younger prostitutes were still selling themselves they were nearly to the end of the sint annenstraat when they finally outdistanced the music youre not going to australia are you els may have asked alice no australia is too long and hard a trip for jack alice might have answered its too long and hard a trip for anybody alice saskia said i suppose so was all alice said her speech was uncharacteristically slurred and her expressionfrom the moment jack had awakened to the womens whispers on the bloedstraatwas unfamiliarly dreamy and carefree jack would later assume that this had to do with how many joints shed smoked becauseuntil amsterdamhis mother and marijuana were not on close terms but they were on close terms that saturday night and sunday morning saskia and els walked them back to their hotelnot because the two prostitutes thought the redlight district was unsafe even at that hour but because they didnt want alice to run into jacob bril they knew bril was also staying at the krasnapolsky after the women hugged and kissed jack and alice good night jack and his mom got ready for bed it was the first time jack remembered her using the bathroom ahead of him something amused her in there because she started laughing whats so funny i think i left my underwear in elss room the advicegiving business had clearly distracted herand by the time jack finished brushing his teeth alice had fallen asleep jack turned out the lights in the bedroom and left the bathroom light on with the door ajartheir version of a nightlight he thought it was the first time his mother had fallen asleep before him he got into bed beside her but even asleep his mom was still singing jack was thankful it wasnt a hymn and maybe the marijuana had resurrected alices scottish accent which in the future jack could detect only when she was drunk or stoned as for the song jack had no way of knowing if it was an authentic folk balladsomething his mother had remembered from her girlhoodor more likely a ditty of her own imagination that in her sleep shed put to music why not shed been singing for half a day and night here is the song alice sang in her sleep oh ill never be a kittie or a cookie or a tail the one place worse than dock place is the port o leith jail no ill never be a kittie of one true thing im sure i wont end up on dock place and ill never be a hure hure rhymed with sure of course jack thought it might be a nursery song whicheven in her sleephis mother meant to sing for him jack said their nightly prayeras he always did with his eyes closed he spoke a little louder than usual because his mother was asleep and he had to pray for both of them the day thou gavest lord is ended thank you for it they slept until noon sunday when he asked her whats a hure was it something i said in my sleep she said yes you were singing a hure is like a prostitutean advicegiver jackie how can a person be a kittie or a cookie or a tail jack asked theyre all words for an advicegiver jack oh they were walking handinhand through the redlight district to tattoo peters when the boy asked wheres dock place dock place is nowhere ill ever be was all she would tell him how did tattoo peter lose his leg jack asked for the hundredth time i told youyoull have to ask him maybe on a bicycle the boy said it was midafternoon in the district most of the women were already offering advice all of them greeted jack and alice by nameeven those older prostitutes in the area of the old church alice made a point of walking around the oudekerksplein they passed every window and doorway at a pace half the speed of jacob brils not a soul hummed breathe on me breath of god to them they went to the st olofssteeg to say goodbye to tattoo peter alice youre welcome to come work with me anytime the onelegged man told her keep both your legs jack peter said youll find it easier to get around that way then they walked up the zeedijk to say goodbye to tattoo theo and robbie de wit robbie wanted alice to tattoo him not another broken heart she said ive had enough of hearts torn in two or otherwise robbie settled for her signature on his right upper arm daughter alice rademaker was so impressed by her letterperfect script that he requested one too tattoo theo got his tattoo on his left forearm which he said hed kept bare for something special the lettering ran from the bend at rademakers elbow to the face of his wristwatch so that every time he looked to see what time it was he would be reminded of daughter alice what do you say jack tattoo theo asked shall we listen again to der zimmerman he wasnt german he didnt know der from den not that jack knew german eithernot yet jack picked out a bob dylan album and put it on robbie de wit was soon singing along but it wasnt alices favorite song she just went on tattooing leaving the singing to robbie and bob when your rooster crows at the break of dawn bob and robbie sang look out your window and ill be gone at this point alice was starting the a in alice youre the reason im travlin on bob and robbie crooned dont think twice its all right well it wasnt all rightnot by a long shotbut alice just kept tattooing els took them to the shipping office which was a confusing placethey needed elss help in arranging their passage they would take the train to rotterdam and sail from there to montreal and then make their way back to toronto why toronto saskia asked alice canada isnt your country it is now alice said ill never go back to sunny leithnot for all the whisky in scotland she wouldnt say why too many ghosts maybe besides i know just the school for jack its a good school jack heard her tell saskia and els his mom leaned over him and whispered in his ear and youll be safe with the girls the idea of himself with the st hildas girlsthe older ones especiallygave jack the shivers once again and for the last time in europe he reached for his mothers hand ii the sea of girls safe among the girls it was jacks impression that the older girls at st hildas never liked having boys in their school although the boys couldnt stay past grade four their presenceeven the presence of little boyswas seen as a bad influence according to emma oastler especially on the older girls emma was a menacing girl and an older one the gradesix girls were the oldest students in the junior school they opened and closed the car doors for the little kids at the rosseter road entrance when jack started kindergarten in the fall of the first year st hildas admitted boysemma was in grade six he was five she was twelve some problem at home had caused her to miss a year of school on jacks first day emma opened the car door for hima formative experience jack was already selfconscious about the cara black lincoln town car from a limousine service which mrs wicksteed used for all her driving needs neither mrs wicksteed nor lottie drove and alice never got her drivers license the limo driver was a friendly jamaicana big man named peewee who was nearly as black as the town car he was mrs wicksteeds favorite driver what kid wants to show up for his first day of school in a chauffeured limousine but alice had not done badly by yielding to mrs wicksteeds way of doing things it seemed that the old girl was not only paying jacks tuition at st hildas she was paying for the limo because alice often worked at the chinamans tattoo parlor until late at night lottie got jack up for school and gave him breakfast mrs wicksteed had sufficiently roused herself in time to do the boys necktie albeit a little absentmindedly lottie laid out his other clothes at bedtimeon school mornings she also helped him get dressed on those mornings jack would go into his moms semidark room and kiss her goodbye then lottie would cross the sidewalk with him to the corner of spadina and lowther where peewee would be waiting in the town car to her credit alice had offered to accompany her son on his first day alice mrs wicksteed said if you take jack to school youll make it an occasion for him to cry mrs wicksteed was firmly opposed to creating occasions for jack to cry while doing his necktie one morning she told him you will be teased jack dont make it an occasion to cry cry only when youre physically hurtand in that case cry as loudly as you can but what do i do when i get teased jack asked her mrs wicksteed wore a plumcolored dressing gown over a pair of her late husbands barberpole pajamas she always did the boys tie while sitting at the kitchen table warming her stiff fingers over her first cup of tea her white hair was in curlers and her face glistened with avocado oil be creative she advised him when i get teased be nice lottie suggested be nice twice mrs wicksteed said and the third time jack asked her be creative she said again when the necktie was done mrs wicksteed kissed him on his forehead and on the bridge of his nose then lottie wiped the avocado oil off his face lottie would kiss jack toousually in the front hall before she opened the outside door and led him by the hand to peewee lotties limp which was almost as disturbingly provocative to jack as tattoo peters missing leg was a frequent topic of conversation between jack and his mother why does lottie limp he must have asked his mom a hundred times ask lottie but when he left for his first day of school jack still hadnt summoned the courage to ask his nanny why she limped whats with the ladys limp mon peewee asked him in the limo i dont know why dont you ask her peewee you ask her monyoure the gentleman of the house im just the driver jack burns later thought hed be able to see the intersection of pickthall and hutchings hill road from his gravethe way peewee slowed the town car to a crawl the way the older girls skeptically took for granted the arrival of another rich kid in another limo it was a warm september morning jack was again aware of the girls untucked middy blouses loosely gathered at their throats by those grayandmaroon regimentalstriped ties in two years they would all be wearing buttondown collars with the top button unbuttoned but he would remember best the rebellious posture of their hips the girls never stood stillsometimes with their arms around another girl sometimes with all their weight on one foot while they tapped the other sitting down they bounced one leg on one kneethe crossed leg constantly in motion the extreme shortness of their gray pleated skirts drew jacks attention to their legs and the surprising heaviness of their upper thighs the girls picked at their fingers at their nails at their rings they scratched their eyebrows and their hair they looked under their nails as if for secretsthey seemed to have many secrets among friends there were hand signals and subtle evidence of other sign language at the rosseter road entrance where peewee stopped the town car the gradesix girls struck jack as particularly secretive yet unrestrained at eleven or twelve girls think they look awful they have ceased being children at least in their estimation but they have not yet developed into the young women they will become at that age there are great differences among them some have begun to look and move like young women others have boys bodies and move as if they were shy young men not emma oastler who was twelve going on eighteen when she opened the car door for jack he mistook the faintest trace of a mustache on her upper lip for perspiration the hair on her strong tanned arms had turned blond in the summer sun and her thick darkbrown braid fell over her shoulder and framed one side of her almostpretty face the weight of her braid which reached to her navel served to separate and define her budding breasts maybe a quarter of the gradesix girls had noticeable breasts when jack got out of the limo and stood next to emma he came up to her waist dont trip on your necktie honey pie emma said the boys tie hung down to his knees but until emma warned him he hadnt considered the danger of tripping on it and jacks gray bermuda shorts which hed outgrown were too short to be properor so mrs wicksteed had observed unlike the girls the boys wore short socks emma roughly lifted jacks chin in her hand lets have a look at those eyelashes baby cakesoh my god she exclaimed what i see trouble ahead emma oastler said searching her face jack saw trouble ahead too he also realized his earlier mistakethe mustache up close there was no way you could confuse the softlooking fuzz on emmas upper lip with beads of perspiration at five jack didnt know that young women were sensitive about having mustaches it looked like a neat thing to have naturally he wanted to touch it if your first day of school like your first tattoo is a pilgrim experiencewell here was jacks and touching emma oastlers mustache would certainly prove to be characterforming whats your name emma asked bending closer jack jack what for an agonizing moment her furbearing lip made him forget his last name but more than her mustache made him hesitate he had been christened jack stronach his father had abandoned him without marrying his mother alice saw no reason for either of them to bear williams name but mrs wicksteed disagreed while alice made a point of not being mrs burns mrs wicksteed believed that no child should suffer from illegitimacy at her instigation jacks name was legally changed making him legitimate in name only furthermore mrs wicksteed was an assimilationist in the old girls view a jack burns would be more easily assimilated into canadian culture than a jack stronach no doubt she thought she was doing the boy a favor but jacks hesitation to tell emma oastler his last name had attracted the attention of a teacherthe one they called the gray ghost mrs mcquat was a spectral presence shed mastered the art of the sudden appearance no one ever saw her coming in her previous life she may have been a dead person what else could explain the chill that accompanied her even her breath was cold what have we here mrs mcquat asked jack somebody emma oastler replied he forgot the rest of his name im sure you can inspire him to remember it emma mrs mcquat said although the gray ghost was not asian her eyes were forcibly slanted by how tightly her hair had been pulled back and knotted into a steelgray bun her thin lips looked sealed in contrast to emmas which were usually parted emmas mouth was as open as a flower and on her upper lip her mustache was as fine as powderlike a dusting of pollen on a petal jack tried to hold back his hand his right index finger in particular as quickly as mrs mcquat had appeared shed disappearedor else jack had closed his eyes in an effort to stop himself from touching emmas mustache and hed missed the gray ghosts departure think jack emma oastlers breath was as warm as mrs mcquats was cold your full nameyou can do it jack burns the boy managed to whisper was it his name or his finger that surprised her maybe both the simultaneity of saying his name at the exact same moment he ran his index finger over her downy upper lip was completely unplanned the incredible softness of her lip made him whisper whats your name she seized his index finger and bent it backward he fell to his knees and cried out in pain the gray ghost made another of her signature sudden appearances i said inspire him emmanot hurt him mrs mcquat admonished emma what jack asked the big girl who was breaking his finger emma oastler she said giving his finger an extra twist before she let it go and dont you forget it forgetting emma or her name would be impossible even the pain she caused him seemed naturalas if jack had been born to serve her or shed been born to lead him mrs mcquat may have recognized this in jacks pained expression he would realize only later that the gray ghost had undoubtedly been at st hildas when jacks father was sleeping with a girl in grade eleven and impregnating a girl in grade thirteen why else would she have asked arent you william burnss boy that rekindled emma oastlers interest in jacks eyelashes in a hurry then youre the tattoo ladys kid emma exclaimed yes jack said and to think he had worried that no one would know him another teacher was closely observing the new arrivals and jack recognized her perfect voice as if hed heard it every night in his dreamsmiss caroline wurtz who had cured his mother of her scottish accent not only did she excel in enunciation and diction but the pitch of her voice would have been recognizable anywhereespecially in jacks dreams in edmonton where she was from miss wurtz would have been considered beautifulwithout qualification in a more international city like toronto her fragile prettiness was the perishable kind more likely she may have suffered some disappointment in her personal lifean illusory love or an encounter that had passed too quickly please give my regards to your mom jack miss wurtz said yes thank youi will the boy replied the tattoo lady has a limo emma asked that is mrs wicksteeds car and driver emma miss wurtz said once again the gray ghost was gonemrs mcquat had simply disappeared jack was aware of emmas guiding hand on his shoulder and of his jaw brushing her hip she bent over him and whispered in his ear what she said was not for miss wurtz to hear it must be nice for your mom and you baby cakes jack thought she meant the lincoln town car or peewee but mrs wicksteeds patronage of the tattoo lady and her bastard son was a story that had gained admittance to st hildas before jack entered kindergarten emma oastler was referring to mrs wicksteeds broader role as their patroness the boy also misunderstood what emma said next way to go jack not everyone is lucky enough to be a rentfree boarder thank you jack replied reaching for her hand he was happy to have made a friend on his first day of school since mrs wicksteeds divorced daughter had also referred to jack and his mom as rentfree boarders jack wondered if emmas mom might be divorced maybe women in that situation were particularly sympathetic to a good old girl like mrs wicksteed taking jack and alice under her wing is your mother divorced jack asked emma oastler unfortunately emmas mother had been bitterly divorced for several years and at least one consequence of her divorce had been so spectacularly ugly that she would permanently think of herself as mrs oastler for emma the subject was still as sore as a boil in what jack misinterpreted as a gesture of intimacy and unspoken understanding emma squeezed his hand he was sure she didnt mean to hurt him although her grip was as fierce as the handshake of the frontdesk clerk at the hotel bristol in oslo are you norwegian he asked her but emma was breathing too hard to hear him either in her concerted effort to crush his hand or because she was struggling to control her loathing of what a manhating monster her mother had become in the aftermath of her divorce emmas newly acquired chest was heaving a tear which jack first mistook for a rivulet of sweat had run down her cheek and now clung to her mustachelike a droplet of dew on new moss jacks misgivings about attending st hildas momentarily evaporated what a splendid idea it was to have the gradesix girls serve as guides to the younger children in the junior school on the stone stairs leading to the basement entrance he stumbled but emma not only held him up she hoisted him to her hip and carried him into his first day of school jack threw his arms around her in a flood of gratitude and affection she returned his embrace so ferociously that he feared he might suffocate against her warm throat they say that apparitions appear to those who are near fainting which would explain why jack first mistook the gray ghost for an apparition there was mrs mcquat againjust as emma oastler was about to break his back or asphyxiate him with her twelveyearold bosom let him go emma the gray ghost said jacks shirt was untucked and hung almost to his bare knees though it didnt dangle as low as his tie he was slightly dizzy and gasping for breath help him tuck in his shirt emma the gray ghost said as soon as she spoke she was gonereturned to her world of the spirits kneeling emma was jacks height his gray bermuda shorts were not only too short they were too tight emma had to undo the top button and unzip the boys fly in order to tuck in his shirt under his shorts her hands cupped and squeezed his buttocks as she whispered in his ear nice tushy jack jack had caught his breath sufficiently to pay her a compliment in kind nice mustache he saidthus cementing their friendship for his remaining years at st hildas and beyond jack thought it must be a good school as his mom had said and herein his first exciting meeting with emma oastlerwas probable evidence at least to jack that he would be safe with the girls oh jack emma whispered in his earher incredibly soft upper lip brushing his neck were gonna have such a good time together the arched doorways in the juniorschool corridor made jack burns think of heaven if there were a passageway to heaven jack used to think surely it would have arches like that and the blackandgray triangles on the linoleum floors made him feel that school and the grownup life after it was a game to be playedmaybe a game he hadnt yet been exposed to but a game nonetheless another game was the miniature brokenwindow view of the playground from the secondfloor washroomit was the only boys washroom at st hildas the frostedglass windowpanes were small and framed in blackiron squares one of the panes was broken it remained unrepaired through jacks fourthgrade year and the low urinals in the boys washroom were not quite low enough when he was in kindergarten he needed to stand on tiptoe and aim high there were the infrequent but intimidating appearances in that secondfloor hallway of those older girls who were boarders one could gain access to their residence through the junior school only girls in grade seven and up were admitted to residency and there were no more than one hundred boarders out of the five hundred girls in the middle and senior school st hildas was a city schoolmost of the students lived at home the older girls who were boarders struck jack as much older their detectable sullenness wasnt limited to the daughters of diplomats or the other foreign students nor was their gloom regional in naturethe cousins who were called the nova scotia sluts were as depressed as the girl from british columbia whom emma oastler called the bc bitch the boarders had about them a noticeable air of being banished the boarders choir made the most mournful music in the school sightings of the girls in residency were unusual in the junior school but once in his gradethree year jack was emerging from the boys washroom still zipping up his fly when he saw a couple of gradethirteen girls striding toward hima flash of nail polish kneesocks rolled down to their ankles shapely legs wide hips full breasts jack panicked in his haste his penis got snagged in his zipper naturally he screamed sweet jesus its a boy one of the big girls said ill say it is and hes caught his miserable thing in his zipper the other replied when do they start playing with their things the first girl asked stop screaming she said sharply to jack you havent cut it off have you let me do that the second girl said kneeling beside jack i have a little brotheri know how to handle this you have to handle it the first girl asked she knelt beside jack too let me see itget your hands off the thing the girl with the little brother told jack it hurts jack cried youve just pinched some skinits not even bleeding the girl was at least seventeen or eighteenmaybe nineteen when does it get big the first girl asked it doesnt feel like getting big when its stuck in a zipper meredith it gets big when it feels like it meredith asked the gradethirteen girl held jacks penis in her hand with the thumb and index finger of her other hand she gently tugged at his zipper ow well what do you want me to do the girl whod come to his assistance asked wait for you to grow up youve got ladykiller eyelashes meredith told jack when youre old enough youre going to get your penis stuck in all kinds of places ow now its bleeding the second girl said jack was unstuck but she went on holding his penis in her hand what are you doing amanda meredith asked just watch amanda said she didnt mean for jack to watch without looking he could feel his penis getting bigor at least a little bigger whats your name meredith asked him jack feeling better eh jack amanda asked sweet jesus look at that thing meredith said thats nothing amanda said you can get bigger than that cant you jack he was as big as hed ever been before he was afraid that if he got any bigger he would burst its beginning to hurt again he said thats a different kind of pain jack amanda gave him a friendly squeeze before she let him go better not catch that whopper in your zipper jack meredith warned him she stood up and ruffled his hair maybe youll dream about us jack amanda said the cut on jacks penis healed in a couple of days but those dreams didnt go away miss sinclair jacks kindergarten teacher echoed alices conviction that jack would be safe with the girls this illusion was further advanced by the participation of the gradesix girls in the kindergartners nap time emma oastler was a volunteer along with two other gradesix girlsemmas good friends charlotte barford and wendy holton they were miss sinclairs naptime helpers these older girls were supposed to assist fiveyearolds in falling asleep that they kept the kindergartners awake was closer to the truth miss sinclair was distinguished in jacks memory for her habit of condemning him to nap with three gradesix girls what he remembered best about miss sinclair was her absence the naps began with what emma oastler called a sleepytime story emma was always the storyteller an early indication of her future calling while wendy and charlotte circulated among the children making sure that their rubber mats were comfortably rolled out their blankets snugly wrapped around them and their shoes off emma began her story in the semidark room youve had a bad day and youre very tired emmas stories always began for stories intended to induce sleep they had the opposite effectthe kindergartners were too terrified to nap in an oftrepeated classic among emma oastlers naptime tales miss sinclair lost the entire kindergarten class in the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum in reality jacks first school trip to the royal ontario museum was led by his gradethree teacher miss caroline wurtz miss wurtz was the teacher jack would remember most fondly and not only for her fragile beauty she was an important mentor for him in his early mastery of stage presence another area in which she excelled miss wurtz was a maven in the dramatic arts in the innumerable school plays in which jack performed at st hildas she was usually his director however her talents as a classroom teacher were lacking in comparison to her theatrical gifts control of the gradethree class eluded her offstage out of the fixed glare of the footlightseither in her undisciplined classroom or in the marginally more lawless outside worldmiss caroline wurtz was an easily confused creature bereft of confidence and without an iota of managerial skill on school trips miss wurtz could have been a star in one of emma oastlers sleepytime storiesshe was that inept when she lost control of herself in the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum most of the gradethree kids were already suffering from total recall of emmas classic horror tale that they were then eightyearolds not fiveyearolds hardly mattered the reallife circumstances were frighteningly familiar to the former kindergartners whod first heard of the bat cave from emmas fiction when the announcement on the museum loudspeaker informed them that some of the mammal displays were experiencing a temporary loss of electrical power the children knew this was only the first chapter dont panic the voice on the loudspeaker said while miss wurtz dissolved into sobs the power will be restored in no time the ultraviolet lights in the bat habitat were still on in fact they were the only lights that were on which was exactly the case in emmas story in emmas version inexplicably the defenseless children had no recourse but to crawl into the bat cave and sleep with the bats emma advised them to be aware of a crucial difference between the alleged sucking habits of the vampire bat and those of the giant fruit bat the kids had to keep their eyes tightly closed at all times or the ultraviolet light would somehow blind them and while they slept or only pretended to sleep the children were told to pay close attention to the exact location of the hot moist breath they would certainly feel before long if they felt the breath against their throats that indicated the vampire the kids were instructed to swat the bat away and protect their throats with both hands in emmas own words just go nuts if however the aforementioned hot moist breath was detected in the area of their navelswell that was the area of interest of the despicable giant fruit bat it would heat the childrens stomachs with its breath before licking the salt out of their belly buttons with its raspy tongue while this sensation might be unpleasant the childrens injuries would be slight in the case of a fruit bat the kids were to lie still in the first place the giant fruit bat was too big to swat awayand according to emma fruit bats only became truly dangerous when they were startled but what would a startled fruit bat do jack remembered jimmy bacon asking better not tell him emma charlotte barford said the conclusion to emmas tale of the kindergartners abandonment in the bat habitat was nervewracking when you consider that most of the children were too frightened to fall asleep they surely knew that emma oastler and wendy holton and charlotte barford were breathing on themnot the bats nevertheless the kids responded as instructed the kindergartners having their navels breathed on kept still in the many retellings of the tale jack learned to distinguish the notsosubtle differences between charlottes and wendys and emmas tongues their tongues were not raspy indeed discounting future nightmares the childrens injuries were slight and they responded with appropriate zeal to the neckbreathing tactics of the vampire batin short the kids went nuts covering their throats and screaming while they swatted away time to wake up jack emma or charlotte or wendy always said but he never went to sleep charlotte barford was a big girl a gradesix virtual woman in the mold of emma oastler wendy holton on the other hand was a ferallooking waif if you overlooked the evidence of pubertyrelated troubles in the dark circles under wendys eyesand her swollen bitten lipsshe could have passed for nine her smaller size and childlike physique didnt diminish wendys navellicking capacity her fruitbat imitation was more aggressive than emmas more invasive than charlottes in keeping with her melonsize knees charlotte barfords tongue was too broad and thick to fit in jacks naveleven the tip did miss sinclair ever return to her kindergarten class and find the children refreshed from their naps did she mistake how alert they looked for their being well rested the kids were relieved of course and no doubt looked it that theyd survived another of emma oastlers sleepytime tales both the notfallingasleep part and the always creative manner in which they were woken up gave them thankful expressions another classic among emmas naptime stories and a close rival to her tale of the kindergartners abandonment in the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum was her saga of the squeezed child it was a tale with three different endings but it began as emmas stories always did youve had a bad day and youre very tired jack napped between gordon and caroline french brotherandsister twins who had to be separated because they despised each other another set of twins in miss sinclairs kindergarten class heather and patsy booth were identical girls who couldnt bear to be separated when one of them was sick the other one stayed home to grieveor perhaps to wait her turn to be sick as well when the booth twins napped they overlapped their rubber mats and wrapped themselves in the same blanketpossibly to simulate their former occupancy of the same uterus both sets of twins became agitated but in different ways during the telling of the squeezedchild tale the identical booth girls sucked their shared blanket they emitted a wet humming sound which in turn upset jimmy bacon who commenced to moan the agitation of gordon and caroline french the boygirl twins on either side of jack was more physical in nature and came in unexpected bursts of frenzied seemingly pointless activity under their separate blankets the french twins thumped their heels on their rubber mats their stiff legs drumming out of sync as startling as this was it was more disturbing when they stopped the french twins stopped kicking so abruptly it was as if theyd died of a shared diseasein spite of their enforced separation from each other the three possible conclusions to emma oastlers squeezedchild story had the kindergartners enthralled for three of you emma always said your bad day just got worse sudden heelthumping from the french twins which was quickly followed by their assudden deaths identical blanketsucking sounds intermingled with humming from the booth twins dire moaning from jimmy bacon one of you is spending the night with your divorced dad emma went on he has just passed out from too much sex jack hated this part maureen yap a nervous girl whose father was chinese once interrupted emma by asking what is too much sex nothing youll ever have emma answered dismissively another time when jack asked emma the same question emma said youll know soon enough jack jack shuddered under his blanket he was relying on his flawed understanding of his moms conversation in amsterdam with saskia and els if you looked sexy els had said men thought you could give them good advice sex therefore was related to advicegiving like advice jack guessed sex could be good or bad if the divorced dad in emma oastlers story had passed out from too much sex jack suspected this was the worst kind your dad has had bad girlfriends before emma continued but this one is just a kid a skinny tough kid emma added shes as tough as a stick her fists are as hard as stones and she hates you you get in her way she could have even more sex with your dad if you werent around after your dad passes out she grinds her fists against your templesyou think shes going to crush your head the french twins were flutterkicking as if on cue more blanketsucking humming and moaning meanwhile emma always said one of you has a single mother whos passed out too jack really hated this part too much sex again maureen yap usually cried bad sex jack sometimes asked a bad boyfriend emma informed the kindergartners one of the biggest bad boyfriends in the world when your mother passes out he comes and lies on top of youhe covers your face with his bare stomach how do you breathe grant porter a moron always asked thats the problem emma usually answered maybe you cant unprecedented outofsync heeldrumming from the french twins soggyblanket noises from the booth twins moans approximating suffocation from jimmy bacon but what about your mother who has a girlfriend emma asked jack hated this part most of all she has bigger breasts than all your mothers she has harder breasts than all your dads youngest girlfriends she has bionic breasts emma said like they have bones inside themtheyre that big and hard the very idea of breasts with bones inside them would years later still wake jack burns from a sound sleepnot that any of the kindergartners slept a wink during the squeezedchild saga which of these poor kids are you emma asked every time i dont wanna be anybody maureen yap predictably cried i especially dont want to be trying to breathe with the bad boyfriends big belly on my face grant porter usually made a point of saying not the breasts with bones james turner another moron always yelled sometimes jack mustered the courage to say i think i like the tough skinny girlfriends fists of stone the least but emma oastler and wendy holton and charlotte barford had already made their selections with his eyes tightly closed jack could nonetheless sense them moving into their chosen positions the divorced dads skinny tough girlfriend with the fists of stonewell that was wendy holton she squeezed your temples between her knees her knees were as small and hard as baseballs she could give jack a headache in less than a minuteand the view up her skirt when he dared to look was disappointingly dark and unclear the unthinkable mothers girlfriend with the bionic breasts the breasts with bones inside themthat was charlotte barford with her melonsize knees no breasts ever felt like kneesnot before there were implants anyway as for the view up charlottes skirt jack never looked the imagined consequences of her catching him looking were too intense and the moms bad boyfriend the one who spread his bare belly on your face and made you fight for your last breaththat was emma oastler of course jack first located her belly button with his nose he found a little room to breathe there once when he explored her navel with his tongue emma said boy do you ever not know what youre doing it was only slightly less scary at the actual batcave exhibit while miss caroline wurtz was losing her mind the gradethree children could at least rest assured that only vampire bats and giant fruit bats might approach them no divorced dads bad girlfriendsno single moms bad boyfriends or girlfriendswere hanging out in the bat habitat compared to these sexual predators of the recently divorced what did the kids have to fear from mere bats as for those gradethree children whod not attended kindergarten at st hildas they were initially unfrightened by the power failure in some of the mammal displays at the royal ontario museum theyd had no previous experience in the batcave exhibit to be frightened of but the former kindergartners among them were frightened enough that their terror was infectious that miss wurtz was also afraid was at first unsurprisingshe had a history of coming unglued in the gradethree classroom however in the batcave exhibit miss wurtz could not call upon the gray ghost for help in the environs of the junior school miss wurtz was routinely rescued by the supernaturally sudden appearances of mrs mcquat not in the royal ontario museum with jack and his fellow third graders wailing around her that theyd instantly closed their eyes further disconcerted miss wurtz open your eyes children dont go to sleep not in here miss wurtz cried caroline french with her eyes firmly closed offered the hysterical teacher some excellent advice dont startle the fruit bats miss wurtztheyre only dangerous if theyre startled open your eyes caroline miss wurtz shrieked if the hot moist breath is at your throat thats another matter caroline french went on the what at my throat miss wurtz asked her hands on her neck jacks feelings for miss wurtz were deeply conflicted he was embarrassed for her that she had no mastery of stage presence in a reallife crisis but he believed she was beautiful he secretly loved her she means a vampire bat jack tried to explain to miss wurtz although caroline french detested being interrupted her brother interrupted her frequently youll just frighten miss wurtz jack caroline said crossly miss wurtzif the hot moist breathing is at your throat go nuts just swat it away swat what away miss wurtz wailed but if you feel the breaths on your belly button remain calm gordon french said in seeming contradiction of his hostile twin sister just dont move jack added nothings breathing on my belly button miss wurtz screamed you see jack caroline french said youve made it worse havent you dont panic the voice on the loudspeaker repeated the power will be restored in no time i forget why we have to crawl inside the bat cave jimmy bacon said none of them could remember that part of emma oastlers story nobodys crawling inside the bat cave miss wurtz raved all of you open your eyes jack thought of telling her that the ultraviolet lights would blind them somehow but she seemed too upset for more bad news i feel a fruit bat jack whispered without moving but it was maureen yap she had dropped to her knees and was hyperventilating in close proximity to his navel stop that miss wurtz shouted jimmy bacon was moaning while he rubbed his head against her hip miss wurtz may not have meant to grab jimmy by the throat but jimmy reacted in the vampirebat fashion he went nuts screaming and swatting away miss caroline wurtz screamed too and to think she believed so adamantly in measured restraint onstage that was jacks first school trip at st hildas like much of his juniorschool experience it would have seemed slight without the necessary preparations for the journey ahead which had been provided for him in kindergarten by emma oastlerthe naptime storyteller who had appointed herself his personal girl guide oh what a lucky boy jack was safe among the girls without a doubt not old enough when jack started grade one emma oastler and her companions had moved on to the middle schoolthey were in grade seven less fearsome girls became the gradesix guides of the junior school jack wouldnt remember them sometimes a whole school day but rarely two in a row would pass without his seeing emma who fiercely promised him that she would always keep in touch and jacks occasional sightings of wendy holton and charlotte barford were usually from a safe distance fistsofstone holton as he still thought of wendy breastswithbonesinthem barford as he would forever remember charlotte and her melonsize knees miss wong jacks gradeone teacher had been born in the bahamas during a hurricane nothing noticeably like a tropical storm had remained alive in her although her habit of apologizing for everything might have begun with the hurricane she would never acknowledge by name the particular storm she had been born in which might have led the gradeone children to suspect that the hurricane still flickered somewhere in her subconscious no trace of a storm animated her listless body or gave the slightest urgency to her voice i am sorry to inform you children that the foremost difference between kindergarten and grade one is that we dont nap miss wong announced on opening day naturally her apology was greeted by collective sighs of relief and some spontaneous expressions of gratitudeheelthumping from the french twins identical blanketsucking sounds from the booth girls heartfelt moaning from jimmy bacon that the gradeone response to her nonap announcement did not inspire a storm of curiosity from miss bahamas as the children called miss wong behind her back was further indication of the lifelessness of their new teacher during juniorschool chapel service which was held once a week in lieu of the daily assembly in the great hall maureen yap whispered to jack dont you kind of miss emma oastler and her sleepytime stories there was an instant lump in jacks throat he could neither sing nor make conversation with the yap as the kids called maureen i know how you feel the yap went on but what was the worst of it what do you miss most all of it jack managed to reply we all miss it jack caroline french said we all miss all of it her irritating twin gordon corrected her shove it gordon caroline said i kind of miss the moaning jimmy bacon admitted the booth girls though blanketless made their identical blanketsucking sounds did the gradeone children crave stories of divorced dads passed out from too much sex did they long to be defenseless yet again in the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum did they miss the singlemom stories or the overlarge and oversexed boyfriends and girlfriends or was it emma oastler they missed emma and her friends on the verge of puberty or in pubertys throeswendy fistsofstone holton and charlotte breastswithbonesinthem barford there was a new girl in grade one lucinda fleming she was afflicted with what miss wong called silent rage which took the form of the girl physically hurting herself when miss wong introduced lucindas affliction to the class she spoke of her as if she werent there we must keep an eye on lucinda miss wong told the class lucinda calmly received their stares if you see her with a sharp or dangerouslooking object you should not hesitate to speak to me if she looks as if she is trying to go off by herself somewherewell that could be dangerous for her too forgive me if im wrong but isnt that what we should do lucinda miss wong asked the silent girl its okay with me lucinda said smiling serenely she was tall and thin with paleblue eyes and a habit of rubbing a strand of her ghostly whiteblond hair against her teethas if her hair were dental floss she wore it in a massive ponytail caroline french inquired if this habit was harmful to lucindas hair or teeth carolines point was that teethandhair rubbing was probably an early indication of the silent rage a precursor to more troubling behavior im sorry to disagree but i dont think so caroline miss wong replied youre not trying to hurt yourself with your hair or your teeth are you lucinda miss wong asked not now lucinda mumbled she had a strand of hair in her mouth when she spoke it doesnt look dangerous to me maureen yap said the yap occasionally sucked her hair yeah but its gross said heather booth patsy heathers identical twin said yeah jack thought it was probably a good thing that lucinda fleming was a new girl and had not attended kindergarten at st hildas who knows how emma oastler might have affected lucindas proclivity to silent rage between mouthfuls of hair lucinda told jack that her mother had been impregnated by an alien she said her father was from outer space although he was only six jack surmised that lucindas mom was divorced emma oastlers saga of the squeezed child no matter which ending would have given lucinda fleming a rage to top all her rages jack burns avoided what was called the quad even in the spring when the cherry trees were in bloom the groundfloor rooms for music practice faced the courtyard you could overhear the piano lessons from the quad jack occasionally imagined that his dad was still teaching someone in one of those rooms he hated to hear that music and the white round chandeliers in the dining room reminded him of blank globesof the earth strangely countryless without discernible borders not even indications of land and sea like the world where his father had gone missing william burns might as well have come from outer space jack looked carefully for evidence of lucinda flemings silent rage for the longest time never seeing it he wondered if he would recognize the symptomsif hed had a rage of his own here or there but had somehow not known what it was who were the authorities on rage not miss wong whod clearly managed to lose contact with the hurricane inside her jack wasnt used to seeing so little of his mother he left for school before she got up and was asleep before she came home as for rage what alice had of it might have been expressed in the paininflicting needles with which she marked for life so many peoplemainly men mrs wicksteed who did jacks necktie so patiently but absentmindedly stuck to her benicetwice philosophy without ever imparting to the boy what he should do if he were pressed to be nice a third time that he was instructed to be creative struck jack as a nonspecific form of advice no silent rage or rage of any kind was in evidence there and lottie despite having lost a child had left what amounted to her rage on prince edward islandor so she implied to jack im not an angry person anymore jack lottie said when he asked her what she knew about rage in generaland the silent kind in particular the best thing i can tell you is not to give in to it lottie said jack would later imagine that lottie was one of those women neither young nor old whose sexuality had been fleeting only small traces of her remaining desire were visible in the way you might catch her looking at herself in profile in a mirror glimpses of lotties former attractiveness were apparent to jack only in her most unguarded momentswhen he had a nightmare and roused her from a sound sleep or when she woke him up for school in the morning before shed taken the time to attend to herself short of asking lucinda fleming to talk to him about her silent rage which would have been far too simple and straightforward a solution for any sixyearold boy to conceive of jack worked up his courage and asked emma oastler instead if emma wasnt an authority on rage who was but jack was afraid of emma her cohorts struck him as somewhat safer places to start that was why he worked up his courage to ask emma by asking wendy holton and charlotte barford first he began with wendy only because she was the smaller of the two the junior school got a halfhour head start for lunch how fitting that it was under the blank globes of the dininghall chandeliers those unmarked worlds where jack spoke to wendy how well and for how long he would remember her haunted eyes her chewed lips her unbrushed dirtyblond hairnot forgetting her scraped knees as hard as fists of stone what rage was that jack silent what about it you little creep well what is it exactlywhat is silent rage he asked youre not eating the mystery meat are you wendy asked viewing his plate with disapproval no i would never eat that jack answered he separated the gray meat from the beige potatoes with his fork you wanna see a little rage jack yes i guess so he replied cautiouslynever taking his eyes off her wendy had an unsettling habit of cracking her knuckles by pressing them into her underdeveloped breasts you wanna meet me in the washroom wendy asked the girls washroom im not getting caught with you in the boys washroom you dork jack wanted to think it over but it was hard to think clearly with wendy standing over him at his table the word dork itself unsettled him it seemed so out of place at a mostly allgirls school forgive me for intruding but arent you having any lunch wendy miss wong asked id rather die wendy told her well im certainly sorry to hear that miss wong said you wanna follow me or are you chicken wendy whispered in jacks ear he could feel one of her hard bruised knees against his ribs okay he answered officially jack needed miss wongs permission to leave the dining hall but miss wong was typically in an overapologetic mood having blamed herself for attempting to force lunch on wendy holton when wendy would rather die miss wong he started to say yes of course jack she blurted out im so sorry if ive made you feel selfconscious or that i may have delayed your leaving the table for whatever obvious good reason you have for leaving heavens dont let me hold you up another second ill be right back was all he managed to say im sure you will be jack miss wong said perhaps the faint hurricane inside her had been overcome by her contrition in the girls washroom nearest the dining hall wendy holton took jack into a stall and stood him on the toilet seat she just grabbed him in the armpits and lifted him up standing on the toilet seat he was eyetoeye with her so he wouldnt slip wendy held him by the hips you want to feel rage inner rage jack i said silent silent rage same difference penis breath wendy said now there was a concept that would stay with jack burns for many yearspenis breath what a deeply disturbing concept it was feel this wendy said she took his hands and placed them on her breastson her no breasts to be more precise feel what he asked dont be a dork jackyou know what they are this is rage the boy asked by no stretch of his imagination could he have called what his small hands held breasts im the only girl in grade seven who doesnt have them wendy exclaimed in a smoldering fury well this was rage without a doubt oh thats all you can say she asked im sorry jack quickly said how to apologize was all he had learned from miss wong jack youre just not old enough wendy declared she left him standing precariously on the toilet seat when i knock on the door from the hall three times youll know its safe to come out she told him rage wendy said almost as an afterthought silent rage jack repeated for claritys sake he saw that he should approach charlotte barford a little differently on this subject but how when wendy knocked on the washroom door three times jack exited into the hall miss caroline wurtz looked surprised to see him there was no one else in the corridor jack burns miss wurtz said perfectly as always it disappoints me to see you using the girls washroom jack was disappointed too and said so which seemed to instill in miss wurtz the spirit of forgiveness she liked it when you said you understood how she felt but her recovery from being disappointed was not always so swift jack had higher expectations for what he might learn from charlotte barford charlotte at least had breasts hed observed whatever the source of her rage it was not an underdeveloped bosom unfortunately he hadnt fully prepared how he wanted to approach charlotte barford before charlotte approached him once a week after lunch jack sang in the primary choir they performed mostly in those special servicescanadian thanksgiving christmas remembrance day they did a bangup gaudeamus at easter come ye faithful raise the strain of triumphant gladness jack avoided all eye contact with the organist hed already met a lifetime of organists even though the organist at st hildas was a woman she still reminded him of his talented dad the day jack ran into charlotte barford in the corridor he was humming either fairest lord jesus or joyful joyful we adore theesimilar adorations jack was passing the same girls washroom where wendy holton had forced him to feel her no breasts while imagining her ragehe would remember that washroom to his dying daywhen charlotte barford opened the washroom door with her hands still wet and smelling of disinfectant from that awful liquid soap charlotte pulled him back into the washroom what rage jack she asked pinning him to a sink with one of her big bare knees there it was in the pit of his stomacha socalled breast with bones in it the silent inner kindrage that doesnt go away jack guessed its what you dont know what people wont tell you what you have to wait to find out for yourself charlotte said driving her knee a little deeper all the stuff that makes you angry jack but i dont know if i am angry the boy said sure you are charlotte said your dad is a total doink hes made you and your mom virtual charity cases everyones betting on you jack on me whats the bet that youre gonna be a womanizer like your father whats a womanizer jack asked youll know soon enough squirrel dink she said by the way youre not touching my breasts charlotte whispered biting his earlobe she added not yet jack knew the exit routine he waited in the washroom until charlotte knocked three times on the door from the hall he was surprised this time that miss wurtz wasnt passing by in the corridor at that very momentthere was only charlotte barford walking away her hips had the same involuntary roll to them that he remembered of ingrid moes fullstride departure from the hotel bristol although charlottes skirt was much too short for oslo in the winter there was a lot he didnt knownot just what a womanizer was but what were charity cases and now in addition to penis breath and doink there was squirrel dink to ponder jack could not imagine that this was proper material for his next necktietying conversation with mrs wicksteednot in her earlymorning curlers and avocado oil fortified only by her first cup of teanor did these issues strike the boy as suitable to raise with lottie her earlier hardships her undiscussed limp and the life shed left behind on prince edward island did not predispose lottie to stressful dialogue of any kind and of course he knew what his mothers response would be well discuss this when youre old enough his mom was fond of saying certain subjects were in the same category as getting your first tattoo for which according to alice you also had to be old enough well jack knew someone who was old enough when he was adrift in grade one under the apologetic supervision of the weatherless miss wong emma oastler was in grade seven thirteen going on twentyone no topics were offlimits for conversation with emma there was only the problem of how pissedoff she was jack knew emma would be furious with him for speaking to wendy and charlotte first dont misunderstand the outlaw corridors and washroom thuggerynamely the older girls behavior outside the classroom st hildas was a good school and an especially rigorous oneacademically perhaps the demands of the classroom created an urgency to act up among the older girls they needed to express themselves in opposition to the correct diction and letterperfect enunciation of which miss wurtz was not the only champion among the generally excellent faculty at the school the girls needed a language of their owncorridorspeak or washroom grammar that was why there was a lot of lemmesee stuffall the im gonna dontchawanna gimmethatthingnow crapwhich was the way the older girls talked among themselves or to jack if they ever spoke in this fashion in their respective classrooms the facultynot only miss wurtzwould have instantly reprimanded them not so peewee mrs wicksteeds jamaican driver peewee was in no position to criticize how emma oastler spoke to jack in the backseat of the lincoln town car to begin with both peewee and jack were surprised the first time emma slid into the backseat it was a cold rainy afternoon emma lived in forest hill she usually walked to and from school after schoolin both her middle and her seniorschool yearsemma normally hung out in a restaurant and coffee shop at the corner of spadina and lonsdale with a bunch of her oldergirl friends not this day and it wasnt the cold or the rain you need help with your homework jack emma announced the boy was in grade one he wouldnt have much homework before grade two and he wouldnt really need help with it before grades three and four where are we taking the girl mon peewee asked jack take me home with him emma told the driver weve got a shitload of work to dohavent we jack she sounds like shes the boss mon peewee said jack couldnt argue with that emma had slumped down in the backseat pulling him down beside her im gonna give you a valuable tip jack she whispered im sure there will come a day when youll find it useful to remember this remember what he whispered back if you cant see the drivers eyes in the rearview mirror emma whispered that means the driver cant see you oh at that moment jack couldnt see peewees eyes we have such a lot of ground to cover emma went on whats important for you to remember is this if theres anything you dont understand you ask me wendy holton is a twisted little bitchnever ask wendy charlotte barford is a onespeed blow job waiting to happen youre putting your life and your doink in her hands every time you talk to charlotte remember if theres anything new that occurs to you tell me first like what the boy asked youll know she told him like when you first feel that you want to touch a girl when the feeling is unfuckingstoppable tell me touch a girl where youll know emma repeated oh jack wondered if his wanting to touch emmas mustache was necessary to confess since hed already done it do you feel like touching me jack emma asked go onyou can tell me his head didnt come up to her shoulder not even slumped down in the backseat there was the suddenly strong attraction to lay his head on her chest exactly between her throat and her emerging breasts but her mustache was still the most appealing thing about her and he knew she was sensitive to his touching it okay so thats established emma said so you dont feel like touching me not yet jack was sad the opportunity had been missed and he must have looked it dont be sad jack emma whispered its gonna happen whats going to happen youre gonna be like your dadwere all counting on it youre gonna open your share of doors jack what doors when emma didnt answer him the boy assumed that he had hit upon another item in the notoldenough category whats a womanizer he asked imagining he had changed the subject someone who cant ever have enough women honey piesomeone who wants one woman after another with no rest in between well that wouldnt be me jack thought in the sea of girls in which he found himself he couldnt imagine wanting more in the st hildas chapel in the stained glass behind the altar four womensaints jack assumedwere attending to jesus at st hildas even jesus was surrounded by women there were women everywhere what are charity cases he asked emma at the moment that would be you and your mom jack but what does it mean youre dependent on mrs wicksteeds money jack no tattoo artist makes enough money to send a kid to st hildas here we are miss peewee said as if emma were the sole passenger in the limo peewee pulled the town car to the curb at the corner of spadina and lowther where lottie was standing with most of her weight on one foot looks like the limp is waiting for you baby cakes emma whispered in jacks ear why hello emmamy how youve grown lottie managed to say weve got no time to chat lottie emma said jack is having trouble understanding a few important things im here to help him my goodness lottie said limping after them emma with her long strides led jack to the door i trust the wickweed is napping jack emma whispered well have to be quiettheres no need to wake her up jack had not heard mrs wicksteed called the wickweed before but emma oastlers authority was unquestionable she even knew the back staircase from the kitchen leading to jacks and alices rooms later it was easy enough to understand emma oastlers manhating monster of a divorced mother was a friend of mrs wicksteeds divorced daughterhence their shared perception of jack and his mom as mrs wicksteeds rentfree boarders emmas mom and mrs wicksteeds daughter were old girls too they had graduated from st hildas in the same class they were not much older than alice calling downstairs to lottie who was aimlessly limping around in the kitchen emma said if we need anything like tea or something well come get it dont trouble yourself to climb the stairs lottie try giving your limp a rest in jacks room emma began by pulling back his bedcovers and examining his sheets seemingly disappointed she put the covers loosely back in place listen to me jackheres whatll happen but not for a while one morning youre gonna wake up and find a mess in your sheets what mess youll know oh emma had moved onthrough the bathroom to his mothers roomleaving him to reflect upon the mystery mess alices room smelled like pot although jack never saw her smoke a joint in there in all likelihood the marijuana clung to her clothes he knew she took a toke or two at the chinamans because he could occasionally smell it in her hair emma oastler inhaled appreciatively giving jack a secretive look she seemed to be conducting a survey of the clothes in his moms closet she held up a sweater and examined herself in the closetdoor mirror imagining how the sweater might fit her she held one of alices skirts at her hips shes kind of a hippie your momisnt she jack jack had not thought of his mom as a hippie before but she was kind of a hippie at that time especially to the uniformed girls at st hildas and the everincreasing legion of their divorced mothers alice was most certainly a hippie a hippie was probably the best you could say about an unwed mother who was also a tattoo artist jack burns would learn later that it was no big dealhow a woman could look at an unfamiliar chest of drawers and know at a glance which drawer another woman would use for her underwear emma was only thirteen but she knew she opened alices underwear drawer on her first try emma held up a bra to her developing breasts the bra was too big but even jack could tell that one day it wouldnt be for no reason that he could discern his penis was as stiff as a pencilbut it was only about the size of his mothers pinkie and his mom had small hands show me your hardon honey pie emma said she was still holding up alices bra my what youve got a boner jackfor christs sake lemme see it he knew what a boner was his mom that old hippie called it a woody whatever you called it jack showed emma oastler his penis in his mothers bedroom what probably made it worse was that lottie was limping around in the kitchen below them just as old mrs wicksteed was waking up from her afternoon nap and emma gave his hardon a close but disappointed look jeez jacki dont think youll be ready for quite a while ready for what youll know she said again the kettles boiling lottie cried from the kitchen then shut it off emma hollered downstairs jeez emma said again to jack you better keep an eye on that thing and tell me when it squirts when i pee youre gonna know when its not pee jack oh the point is tell me everything emma said she took his penis in her hand he was anxious remembering how shed bent his index finger dont tell your momyoull just freak her out and dont tell lottieyoull make her limp worse why does lottie limp jack asked emma oastler was such an authority he assumed she would know alas she did she had an epidural go haywire emma explained the baby died anyway it was a real bad deal so you could get a limp from a childbirth that went awry naturally jack thought an epidural was a part of the body a female part in the manner in which hed assumed his moms csection referred to an area of the hospital in halifax where jack was born so he believed that lottie had lost her epidural in childbirth jack must have imagined that an epidural was somehow crucial to the female anatomy possibly it prevented limps years later when he couldnt find epidural in the index of grays anatomy jack would be reminded of his csection mistake that his mother had never had a cesarean would be an even bigger discovery teas brewing lottie called to jack and emma from the kitchen only when he was older would it occur to him that lottie knew emma was a menacing girl have a wet dream for me little guy emma said to jacks penis she was such a good friend she gently helped his penis find its proper place back inside his pants and she was especially careful how she zipped up his fly do penises have dreams jack asked just remember to tell me when your little guy has one emma said his audience of one jacks gradetwo teacher mr malcolmat that time one of only two male teachers at st hildaswas inseparable from his wife whom he daily brought to school for dire reasons she was blind and wheelchairbound and it seemed to soothe her to hear mr malcolm speak he was an excellent teacher patient and kind everyone liked mr malcolm but the entire gradetwo class felt sorry for him his blind and wheelchairbound wife was a horror in a school where so many of the older girls were outwardly cruel and inwardly selfdestructive which was not infrequently blamed on their parents tumultuous divorces the gradetwo kids prayed every day that mr malcolm would divorce his wife had he murdered her the class would have forgiven him if hed killed her in front of them they might have applauded but mr malcolm was ever the peacemaker and his shaving choices were ahead of their time growing bald he had shaved his headnot all that common in the early sand even less common he preferred varying lengths of stubble to an actual beard or to being cleanshaven back then it was a credit to st hildas that they accepted mr malcolms shaved head and his stubbled face not unlike the gradetwo children the administrators of the school had decided not to cause mr malcolm any further harm the blind wife in the wheelchair made everyone take pity on him in the gradetwo classroom the children worked diligently to please him mr malcolm never had to discipline them they disciplined themselves they would do nothing to upset him life had already been unfair enough to mr malcolm emma oastlers assessment of the tragedy was colored by her own intimacy with human cruelty but in her view of the malcolms as a couple emma was probably not wrong mrs malcolm whose name was jane fell off a roof at a church picnic she was high school age at the time a pretty and popular girlsuddenly paralyzed from the waist down according to emma mr malcolm had been a somewhat younger admirer of janes he fell in love with her when she was paralyzed chiefly because she was more available he must have been the kind of uncool guy she would never have dated before the accident emma said but after she fell off the roof wheelchair jane didnt have a lotta choices yet if mr malcolm was her choice even if he was her only choice jane malcolm couldnt have been luckier the blindness was another story that happened to her later when shed been married for many years jane malcolm suffered from earlyonset macular degeneration as mr malcolm explained to the gradetwo class his wife had lost her central vision she could see light she could make out movement and she still had some peripheral vision at the extreme periphery however mrs malcolm experienced a loss of color too the loss of her mind was another matter there was nothing mr malcolm could say to protect the kids or himself from that thus periphery and peripheral were the socalled vocabulary challenges for opening day in grade twoevery day there would be two more as for crazed or delusional or paranoid they were never words on the gradetwo vocabulary list but wheelchair jane was all those things shed been pushed past the edge of reason when mrs malcolm would grind her teeth or suddenly crash her wheelchair into patsy booths desk headon jack often looked at lucinda fleminghalf expecting that jane malcolms visible rage might trigger a silentrage episode in lucinda it was insanity to assault the booth twins separately whenever mrs malcolm attacked patsys desk in her wheelchair patsys twin heather also screamed on occasion mrs malcolm would snap her head from side to side as if to rid herself of her peripheral vision maybe she thought total blindness would be preferable and when one of the second graders would raise a hand in response to one of mr malcolms questions blind jane would assume a headonherknees position in her wheelchairas if a man wielding a knife had appeared in front of her and shed ducked to prevent him from slashing her throat these dramatic moments of mrs malcolm becoming unhinged made grade two a most attentive class while the children listened carefully to mr malcolms every word they kept their eyes firmly fixed on her for not more than three or four seconds not more than twice a week the tiredlooking mr malcolm would be at a loss for words thereupon wheelchair jane would start her journey of repeated collisions she sailed forth up an aislethe wheelchair glancing off the kids desks as she rushed past skinning her knuckles while mr malcolm ran to the nurses office to fetch either the nurse or for more minor injuries a firstaid kit mrs malcolm would be left in the kids tentative care someone held the wheelchair from behind so she couldnt careen out of control the rest of the class stood petrified around her just out of her reach they were instructed to not let her get out of the wheelchair although its doubtful that sevenyearolds could have stopped her fortunately she never tried to escape she flailed about crying out the childrens names which shed memorized in the first week of school maureen yap mrs malcolm would holler here maam maureen would holler back and mrs malcolm would turn her blind eyes in the yaps direction jimmy bacon mrs malcolm would scream jimmy would moan there was nothing wrong with wheelchair janes hearing she looked without seeing in jimmys direction upon hearing him moan jack burns she shouted one day im right here mrs malcolm jack said even in grade two his diction and enunciation were far in advance of his years your father was well spoken too mrs malcolm announced your father is evil she added dont let satan put a curse on you to be like him no mrs malcolm i wont jack may have answered her with the utmost confidence but within the mostly allgirls world of st hildas it was clear to him that he was fighting overwhelming odds the big bet which emma oastler spoke of with a reverence usually reserved for her favorite novels and movies heavily favored the suspected potency of williams genes if womanizing could be passed from father to son it most certainly would be passed to jack in the eyes of almost everyone at st hildas even in what amounted to the severely limited peripheral vision of mrs malcolm jack burns was his fathers sonor about to be you cant blame anyone for being interested jack emma said philosophically its exciting stuffto see how youll turn out clearly mrs malcolm had taken a genetic interest in how jack would turn out too but the worst thing about jane malcolm was how she behaved when her husband returned to the gradetwo classroomwith either the school nurse or the firstaid kit here i amim back jane he always announced did you hear that children mrs malcolm would begin hes come back hes never gone for long and he always comes back please jane mr malcolm would say mr malcolm likes taking care of me wheelchair jane told the class he does everything for meall the things i cant do myself now now jane please mr malcolm would say but she wouldnt let him take her skinned knuckles in his hands slowly at first but with everquickening strikes she slapped his face mr malcolm loves doing everything for me she cried he feeds me he dresses me he washes me jane darling mr malcolm tried to say he wipes me mrs malcolm screamed that was always the end of it before she resorted to whimpers and moans jimmy bacon would commence to moan with her which was soon followed by the remarkable blanketsucking sounds that the booth twins were capable of makingeven without blankets heelthumping from the french twins never lagged far behind and jack would steal a look at lucinda fleming who was usually looking at him her serene smile betrayed nothing of the mysterious rage inside her do you wanna see it her smile seemed to say well im gonna show you her smile promisedbut not yet it was a notyet world jack lived in from kindergarten through grade two pitying mr malcolm was an education in itself but more memorably and more lastingly jacks education was as much in emma oastlers hands as it was in mr malcolms on rainy days or whenever it was snowing emma slid into the backseat of the lincoln town car and instructed peewee as follows just drive us around peewee no peeking in the backseat keep your eyes on the road that okay with you mon peewee always asked jack yes that would be fine peewee thank you for asking the boy replied youre the boss miss peewee would say scrunched down low in the backseat jack and emma chewed gum nonstoptheir breath minty or fruity depending on the flavor emma would let jack undo her braid but she would never let him weave it back together with her braid undone emma had enough hair for both of them to hide their faces under its spell if you get your gum stuck in my hair honey pie im gonna kill you she often saidbut once when jack was laughing about something emma suddenly sounded like his mother dont laugh when youre chewing gumyou could choke there was the puzzling moment when they checked on her training bra as emma disparagingly called it from what jack could tell the instructions the bra had given to her breasts were already working at least her breasts were getting bigger wasnt that the point speaking of growing his penis had made no discernible progress hows the little guy emma would invariably ask and jack would dutifully show her what are you thinking about little guy emma asked his penis once if penises could dream jack didnt know why he was surprised to hear that they could think as well but the little guy had demonstrated no trace of a thought processnot yet after grade two jacks sightings of mr malcolm were limited mainly to the boys washroom where the teacher occasionally went to weep but jack most frequently caught mr malcolm in the act of examining his facial stubbleas if the shadow of his beardinprogress or his mustacheinthemaking were his principal maybe his only vanity sightings of mrs malcolm were also rare usually not more than twice a day one of the girls washrooms would be posted with an out of order sign which meant that mr malcolm was attending to wheelchair jane the girls were instructed to respect their privacy once jack heard the unmistakable sound of mrs malcolm slapping her husband in the washroom the boy tried to hurry in the hall to outrun the sound but he could never outdistance mr malcolms pathetic now now jane which was quickly followed by his jane darling upon which some commonplace clamor in the corridor drowned out the repeated melodrama several gradesix girls were passing naturally they sounded like several dozen in jacks remaining two years at st hildas there were many times when he missed mr malcolm but he did not miss being a witness to the gradetwo teachers perpetual abuse from then on when jack saw people in wheelchairs he felt no less pity for themno less than before he met mrs malcolm jack just felt more pity for the people attending to them the little guy and jack were eight years old when they started grade three even before his penis demonstrated its capacity for having dreams and ideas entirely of its own devising the little guy and jack had begun to live parallel if not altogether separate lives that miss caroline wurtz had a perishable beauty was enhanced by her being petite certainly she was smaller than any of the gradethree mothers and miss wurtz wore a perfume that encouraged the gradethree boys to invent problems with their math miss wurtz would correct a boys math by leaning over his desk where he could inhale her perfume while taking a closer and most desirable look at the fetching birthmark on her right collarbone and the small fishhookshaped scar on the same side of her throat both the birthmark and the scar seemed to inflame themselves whenever miss wurtz was upset in the ultraviolet light of the batcave exhibit jack vividly remembered her scar it was pulsating like a neon strobe how she got it was in the category of jacks imagination close to tattoo peters missing leg and lotties limp although the latter subject was further complicated by the boys mistaken assumption that an epidural was a vital part of the female anatomy that charlotte brontë was miss wurtzs favorite writer and jane eyre her bible was known to everyone in the junior school an annual dramatization of the novel was their principal cultural contribution to the middle and senior grades the older girls might have been more capable of acting out such ambitious materialnot only janes indomitable spirit but also rochesters blindness and religious transformationyet miss wurtz had claimed jane eyre as juniorschool property and in both grades three and four jack was awarded the role of rochester what other boy in the junior school could have memorized the lines dread remorse when you are tempted to err miss eyre remorse is the poison of life jack delivered that line as if he knew what it meant in grade three the first year jack played rochester the gradesix girl who played jane was connie turnbull her brooding rejected presence made her a good choice for an orphan when she said it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity you believed her connie turnbull would never be a tranquil soul of course it was ludicrous when it was necessary for jackasrochester to take connieasjane in his arms and cry never never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable he only came up to her and everyone elses breasts i could bend her with my finger and thumb jack cried to the accompanying laughter and disbelief of the audience connie turnbull looked at him as if to say just try it penis breath but it wasnt only his memorization skills and his diction and enunciation that made jack so captivating as an actor miss wurtz had taught him to take command of the stage how he asked her you have an audience of one jack miss wurtz told the boy your job is to touch one heart whose whose heart do you want it to be miss wurtz asked my moms i think you can touch her heart anytime jack whose heart could old rochester touch anyway wasnt it jane who touched ones heart but that wasnt what miss wurtz meant she meant who would want to watch jack but remain unseen who was the likeliest stranger in the audience whose interest was only in jack who wanted to be impressed by jack while sparing himself the boys scrutiny jacks audience of one was his father of course from the moment he imagined william jack could command every inch of the stage he was oncamera for the rest of his life jack would learn later that an actors job was not complicated but it had two parts whoever you were you made the audience love you then you broke their hearts once jack could imagine his father in the shadows of every audience he could perform anything think about it jack miss wurtz urged him just one heart whose is it my dads what a good place to begin she told the boy both her birthmark and her scar inflaming themselves lets see how that works it worked all righteven in the case of jacks miniature rochester to connie turnbulls bigger stronger jane it worked from the start when rochester says jane you think me i daresay an irreligious dog well jack had them all it was ridiculous but he had connie turnbull too when she took his hand and kissed it her lips were parted she made contact with her teeth and her tongue nice job jack she whispered in his ear connie continued to hold his hand for the duration of the applause he could feel emma oastler hating connie turnbull from the unseen audience emmas jealousy swept onstage like a draft but what jack liked best about the rochester role was the opportunity to be blind doubtless he was drawing on the collisioncourse lunacy of mrs malcolm but playing blind afforded jack another opportunity when he tripped and fell in rehearsals it was miss wurtz who rushed to his aid her ministrations to his injuries which were entirely feigned were why he tripped and fell his peniss first thoughtful reaction was not to connie turnbull frenchkissing his handgod no the little guys first idea of his own was clearly in response to miss caroline wurtz the olderwoman thing which had begun in oslo with ingrid moe would haunt jack burns all his life miss wurtzs hands were not much bigger than a gradethree girls and when she comforted a childsometimes when she just spoke to him or hershe would rest one of her hands on the childs shoulder where he or she could feel her fingers tremble as lightly as the movements of a small agitated bird it was as if her hand or all of miss wurtz were about to take flight not one of the gradethree children would have been surprised if one day miss wurtz had simply flown away she was that delicate she was as fragile as a woman made of feathers hence perishable in another sense but miss wurtz could not manage the gradethree classroom the kids were no more badly behaved than other third graders although roland simpson would later as a teenager spend time in a reform school and ultimately wind up in jail and jimmy bacons penchant for moaning was only a small part of his wretchednessjimmy was no joy to be with on a regular basis he once dressed as a ghost for the gradethree halloween party and wore nothing not even underwear under a bedsheet with holes cut out of it for his eyes jimmy was so badly frightened by one of the gray ghosts sudden appearancesmrs mcquat was the gradefour teacherthat he pooed in his sheet but miss wurtz was so delicate that she might not have been able to manage a kindergarten or her own children did her strength emerge only onstage alices theory about miss wurtz was intuitive but unkind caroline looks like she never got over somebody poor thing jack burns took from miss wurtz a lifelong lesson life was not a stage life was improv miss wurtz had no tolerance for improvisation the children learned their lines speaking them exactly as they were written that jack was born with superior memorization skills was a considerable advantage in the theater that miss wurtz encouraged jack to imagine his audience of one was a gift both she and his missing father gave him but jack was as attentive a student of miss wurtzs failure in the classroom as he was of her instructions for success onstage it was evident to him that one could not succeed as a player in life without developing improvisational skills yes you needed to know your lines but on some occasions you also had to be able to make your lines up for what she could teach him but primarily for what she had failed to master herself miss wurtz captured jacks attention not surprisingly she would live in his memory and remain a part of his life longer than any of the thirdgrade girls jack often dreamed of kissing caroline wurtz at which moments she was never dressed as a schoolteacher in his dreams miss wurtz wore the kind of oldfashioned underwear jack had first seen in lotties mailorder catalogs for reasons that were disturbingly unclear to him this type of underwear was advertised for teens and unmarried women why women wore a different kind of underwear after they were married was and would remain a mystery to jack as for miss wurtzs real attire in the classroom she occasionally wore a creamcolored blouse you could almost see through butbecause it was cold in the gradethree roomshe more often dressed in sweaters which fit her well jacks mother said they were cashmere sweaters which meant that miss wurtz was buying her clothes with something more than a st hildas faculty salary the wurtz has gotta have a boyfriend emma said a rich one or at least one with good tastethat would be my guess jack had repeatedly denied emmas accusation that connie turnbull gave him a boner every time she frenchkissed his handor that when heasrochester took connieasjane in his arms with his head buried in her breasts there was any response from the little guy it hadnt yet occurred to emma that jack had a hardon every minute he spent in close proximity to caroline wurtz whether or not he was in her actual company or she were in various stages of undress in his dreams as for the wurtz as emma called her having a rich boyfriend or one with good tasteor even an exboyfriendjack didnt want such a character to exist lest he invade the boys dreams of miss wurtz in her mailorder corsets and girdles and bras jack didnt dream about the gradethree girls at all not even lucinda fleming whod managedfor more than two yearsto keep her silent rage well hidden and if in his dreams miss wurtz had the faintest trace of a mustache on her extremely narrow upper lipwell that was emma oastlers doing he couldnt control his attraction to emmas upper lip especially in his dreams more and more when the little guy came alive he did so not at jacks bidding but independently any news jack emma would whisper in the backseat of the limo as peewee drove them around and around forest hill not yet jack answered he had guessed correctly that this was the safest thing to say at night after lottie had put him to bed jack often went into his mothers room and climbed into her bed and fell asleep there given their different schedules his mom was almost never there she would come home and crawl into bed long after hed fallen asleep sometimes in her halfsleep she would throw one of her legs over jack which always woke him up there was the smell of cigarette smoke and pot in her hair and the gasolinelike tang of white wine on her breath occasionally they would both be awake and lie whispering in the semidarkness jack didnt know why they whispered it wasnt because lottie or mrs wicksteed could hear them how are you jack im fine how are you were becoming like strangers alice whispered one time jack was disappointed that his mother hadnt seen him act and he said so oh ive seen you act alice said jack meant in jane eyre or in miss wurtzs other exercises in dramatization while the wurtz loved the stage she preferred adapting novels it would occur to jack only later that by choosing to dramatize novels miss wurtz controlled every aspect of every performance there was no playwright to give the children the wrong directions miss wurtz adapted her favorite novels for the theater her way if as actors they were instructed to take command of the stage the wurtz was absolutely in charge of every action they undertookof every word they uttered later jack would realize what wonderful things miss wurtz left out of her adaptations she was in charge of censorship as well when the wurtz adapted tess of the durbervilles she made much more of the maiden chapter than she made of maiden no more more disturbing she cast jack as tess nobody blamed tess as she blamed herself the dramatization began miss wurtz with her perfect diction and enunciation was a big fan of voiceover jack was without a doubt a good choice to play a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience but even in a dressa white gown no lessand even as a milkmaid the boy could take command of the stage phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still miss wurtz read to the audience while angel clare failed to ask jackastess to dance what a wimp angel was jimmy bacon that miserable moaner who pooed in a sheet was the perfect choice to play him for all her bouncing handsome womanliness miss wurtz fatalistically intoned you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks or her ninth sparkle from her eyes and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then all the while jackastess had nothing to do he stood onstage radiating sexless innocence he was prouder of his role as rochester but even as tess he had his momentssexless innocence not least if not best among them what tess says to durberville for example durberville that pig was played by the thuggish charlotte barford whom the wurtz wisely borrowed from the middle school did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel charlotte barford looked as if sheashe had thoroughly enjoyed seducing himasher when jack buried his dead baby in the churchyard he could hear the older girls in the audiencethey were already crying and the tale of tesss undoing had only begun jack spoke hardys narration as if it were dialogue over the babys grave in that shabby corner of gods allotment where he lets the nettles grow jack began while the older girls in the audience imagined that this could be their predicament which miss wurtz if not thomas hardy had cleverly intended and where all unbaptized infants notorious drunkards suicides and others of the conjecturally damned are laid jackastess carried on stimulated by the weeping older girls no fan of improvisation miss wurtz had not permitted jack to skip the conjecturally though hed repeatedly flubbed the word in rehearsals when jack said but you would not dance with me to that wimp jimmybaconasangelclare the hearts of the older girls in the audience were wrenched anew o i hope that is of no illomen for us now jackastess told jimmyasangel while the girls wept afreshbecause with hardy what wasnt an ill omen the girls knew tess was doomed as unalterably as miss wurtz wanted them to know it that was the wurtzs message to the girls be careful anyone can get pregnant every man who isnt a wimp like jimmybaconasangel is a pig like charlottebarfordasdurberville and jackburnsastess got miss wurtzs message across caroline wurtzs juniorschool dramatizations amounted to moral instructions to the middle and seniorschool girls jack was in grade three a dramatization of tess of the durbervilles was incomprehensible to him but the message of the story wasnt for jack at st hildas the most important messages were delivered to the older girls jack was just an actor miss wurtz knew he could handle the lines even if he didnt understand them and in case a total idiot among the older girls might have missed the point all the dramatizations were of novels wherein women were put to the test when jack played hester prynne in the wurtzs adaptation of the scarlet letter he couldnt persuade his mom to come see him as an eightyearold adulteress with the letter a on hisasher chest i hate that story alice whispered to her son in the semidarkness of her bedroom its so unfair ill ask caroline to take some pictures ill look at photographs jack but i dont want to see that story dramatized miss wurtz shrewdly recognized in wendy holtons preternaturally thin cruel bodyin her unyielding knees her fistsofstone hardnessa perfect likeness to the obsessed and vengeful roger chillingworth once again in casting the wurtz robbed the middle school of one of jacks former tormentors the reverend dimmesdale was lamentably miscast although in choosing lucinda fleming who was a head taller than jack was in grade three miss wurtz might have been hoping that lucindas silent rage would select a pivotal moment of dimmesdales guilt in which to erupt onstage and frighten the bejesus out of them all perhaps when dimmesdale cries to hester may god forgive us both we are not hester the worst sinners in the world there is one worse than even the polluted priest that might have worked had lucinda fleming simply lost it at that momenthad she begun to bash her head against the footlights or made some woeful demented effort to strangle herself in the stage curtains but lucinda kept her rage to herself she may have been as tortured as the reverend dimmesdale but she seemed to be saving her longanticipated explosion for an offstage moment jack was convinced it was something she was saving just for him but being onstage with lucindaasdimmesdale was better than being backstage with wendyaschillingworth becauseonce she was out of miss wurtzs sightwendy held jack personally responsible for her being cast as chillingworth in the first place admittedly it was a thankless part therefore the scarlet letter was a bruising production for jack wendy punched him or kneed him in the ribs whenever she could get away with it my goodness alice whispered to her son in the semidarkness she could tell he was sore just by touching him when she turned on the light she said what are those puritans doing to you jack are you wearing the letter a or are they hitting you with it his mother wouldnt come see him throw himself under a train in miss wurtzs rendition of anna karenina either ill ask caroline to take more pictures jack there was no end to the wronged women in caroline wurtzs instructive repertoire and how brilliant was the wurtzs choice of emma oastler for the role of count vronsky emma even had the requisite mustache for the part after schoolin jacks room or just hanging out in the backseat of the town car while peewee stole a look at emmas legsemma controlled their topics of conversation as before jack could not take command of that stage where he and emma were engaged in an improvisational performance of the kind he needed to learn vastly more about this is perfect jackwere having a love affair we are onstage i mean but what are we having here he askedmeaning the backseat of the town car where he lay pinned with one of emmas heavy legs thrown over him much in the impulsive halfasleep manner that his mom occasionally threw a leg over him or on the bed in his room where emma told lottie she was helping jack with his homework and not to bother them hes fallen behind lottie i can help him catch up if i can just get him to listen to me how could he not listen to her in the first place she simply overpowered him on the backseat or on his bed and she knew he couldnt resist her mustache she would brush her silky upper lip against him she ran her mustache over the back of his hand while she imitated connie turnbulls french kiss which she did a better job of than connie or against his cheek or even after shed untucked his shirt over his bare belly pausing to give special consideration to his navel do you ever wash this thing jack its got lint in it you know it was all preludewhether she was pretending she was count vronsky and jack was anna or whether she was herself emma oastler who would never be a minor character not in jacks life everything led up to the end line as miss wurtz was fond of saying hit your end line so that your audience of one remembers it jack say your end line so that no one can forget it okay hows the little guy doing whats he up to jack emma always got around to asking it was a crucial timethey were in rehearsals for anna karenina but had not yet been subjected to miss wurtzs plans for sense and sensibility emma and jack were doing homework on his bed lottie could be heard banging around below them in the kitchen to emmas question regarding what his penis was up to jack answered as he often did not much lets have a look baby cakes he showed her he heard such sorrow in emmas sigh or maybe hed been thinking too much about anna and the train he didnt want to go on disappointing emma forever sometimes it dreams jack began dreams what whos in the dreams jack you are he answered this seemed safer to admit than the miss wurtz part what am i doing in the dreams jack its mainly your mustache he admitted you little pervert you squirrel dink jack and miss wurtz is wearing just her underwear he blurted out im with the wurtz jesus jack its more like miss wurtz is alone with your mustache jack confessed and the underwear whose underwear emma asked he sneaked along the upstairs hall to lotties room and brought emma the latest edition of lotties mailorder catalog you dork jacki wouldnt be caught dead in this stuff ill show you some underwear he had seen her previous training braher present bra was only a little bigger but when emma removed the bra there was a more noticeable shape and substance to her breasts than before and when she took her panties off and held them against the pleats of her skirt the lace that rimmed the waistband was a new experience for jack and the little guy it moved emma said what moved you know what jack they both looked at the little guy who was not as little as before emma leaned over his penis miss wurtz she said shut your eyes jack of course he did as he was told caroline wurtz emma whispered to his penis im gonna bring you some real underwear little guy even with his eyes closed jack knew that the little guy liked this idea i think were finally getting somewhere jack can i undo your braid emma now yes she allowed him to do this never taking her eyes from his penis her hair fell all around his hips he felt it touch his thighs its working baby cakes emma reported you had the right idea kettles boiling lottie called from the kitchen let me be sure i understand you emma said ignoring lottie its basically the wurtz with my mustache and lotties underwear not lottiesits the underwear from her catalog the thought of miss wurtz in lotties underwear was unappealing whose hair emma asked yours i think its long hair anyway good emma said he couldnt see her her hair now undone completely hid her face we seem to be zeroing in on a few priorities zeroing in on what clearly you have a hair thing honey pie and the usual olderwoman thing oh nothing about his olderwoman thing not to mention his mustacheandbraid fixation felt the least bit usual to jack oh my god now were really getting somewhere emma announced she threw back her hair jack had a hardon like hed never seen before if the little guy had stood up any taller he would have cast a shadow all the way to jacks belly buttonlint and all jesus jackwhat are you gonna do with it jack was at a loss do i have to do something with it he asked emma hugged him to her bare breasts his enlarged penis brushed against her scratchy wool skirt jack shifted slightly in the big girls embrace until the little guy was more comfortably touching emmas bare thigh oh jack emma told the boy thats the sweetest thing to sayyoure just too cute for words no of course you dont have to do anything with it one day youll know what you want to do with it thats gonna be some day he touched one of her breasts with his hand she held his face more tightly there the next thing was the little guys idea entirely emma and jack were sitting on his bed hip to hipthey were hugging each otherbut his penis had somehow not lost contact with her thigh and if jack could feel her thigh emma must have been able to feel his penis he was eight she was fifteen when jack swung one of his legs over her far hip he found himself lying on top of her with the little guy in her lapnow touching both her thighs do you know what youre doing jack emma asked of course he didnt her gum was a mint flavor jack could feel her breath on the top of his head maybe the little guy knows she said answering herself jacks arms could not reach around her hips but he held her therehis right hand touching the lace waistband of her panties which emma had spread on top of her skirt show me what the little guy knows baby cakes her tone of voice indicated that she was teasing himthe baby cakes was an affectionate appellation but faintly mocking in the way emma usually said it i dont know what the little guy knows he admitted just as the little guy and jack made an astonishing discovery there was hair between emma oastlers thighs the instant the tip of his penis touched this hairy place jack thought that emma was going to kill him she scissored her legs around his waist and rolled him over onto his back the little guy was all bunched up in her itchy wool skirt emma had some difficulty finding it with her hand with which jack feared she might yank it completely offbut she didnt she just held his penis a little too roughly what was that he asked he was more afraid of the hair he had felt than he was of the way emma held him im not showing you honey pie it would be child molestation it would be what it would freak you out emma said jack could believe it he had no desire to see the hairy place what jack or the little guy strangely wanted was to be there jack was actually afraid of what it might look like i dont want to see it he said quickly emma relaxed her scissorshold around his waist she held his penis a little more gently you got a hair thing all right she told him the tea is going to get too strong lottie hollered from the kitchen then take out the tea bags or the stupid tea ball emma shouted back its getting cold too lottie called to them when emma pulled her panties back on she turned her back on jack conversely she put on her bra and buttoned up her shirt while she faced him it was clear that the little guy had touched a private place but why was there hair there hows the homework going lottie cried she was verging on the kind of hysteria that implied to jack she was reliving the horror of her haywire epidural what kind of life does lottie have emma asked jack but she was looking at his penis the little guy was returning to normal size before their very eyes you gotta watch this guy every second jackits like having your own little miracle or notsolittle miracle emma added oh cute look its like its going away maybe its sad the boy said remember that line jack one day you can use it he couldnt imagine under what circumstances an admission of his peniss sadness would be of any possible use miss wurtz knew a lot about lines somehow jack sensed she would disapprove of this onetoo improvisational maybe in a weeks time emma would bring him one of her divorced moms brasa black one it was more like half a bra jack observed with hard wire rims under the cups which were small but surprisingly aggressivelooking it was what they called a pushup bra emma explained it was about as assertive as a bra could beor so jack imagined whats it want to push your breasts up for he asked my mom has small boobs emma said shes trying to make more out of them but the bra was curious for another reason it smelled strongly of perfume and only slightly less powerfully of sweat emma had snitched it from the laundryit wasnt clean but thats better isnt it she asked why because you can smell her emma declared but i dont know your mom why would i want to smell her just try it baby cakes you never know what the little guy might like boy was that the truth too bad it would take years for jack to find that out it would be a while too before someone told him that the chinamans tattoo shop on the northwest corner of dundas and jarvis was never open late at night the basement tattoo parlor which you entered from the sidewalk on dundas usually closed in the late afternoon jack would forget who told him maybe it was some old ink addict a collector in one of those tattoo shops on queen streetaround the time his mom opened her own shop there queen street in the seventies would never have supported the likes of daughter aliceit was a greasers hangout full of antihippie whiskydrinking whitetshirt people whoever told jack was possibly one of them but it sounded true the chinamans unnamed shop was closed at night or maybe it stayed open a little longer on friday and saturday eveningsthough never past eight or nine so where was sheout late almost every night in jacks years at st hildas he hadnt a clue it was only with hindsight which is never to be wholly trusted that jack concluded his mother might have been trying to break her possessive attachment to her son as he grew older he looked more and more like his dad maybe the more jack resembled william the more alice sought to distance herself from the boy that emma oastler brought him her mothers pushup bra may have had something to do with it it was inevitable that alice would find it jack slept with the stupid bra every nighthe even took it into his moms bed on those nights he slept with her and it was one of those nights when she threw a leg over jack and woke him up this night something woke her up too the mystery bra was mashed between them alice must have felt the hard wire rims under the cups she sat up in bed and turned on the light whats this jack she asked holding up the stinking bra the way she looked at her sonwell he would never forget it it was as if shed discovered emmas mother in the bed between them it was as if shed caught jack in flagrante delicto the little guy in intimate contact with that hairy private place its a pushup bra he explained i know what it isi mean whose alice sniffed the bra and made a face she pulled back the covers and stared at the little guy who was protruding at attention from the boys pajamas start talking jack it belongs to emma oastlers momemma stole it and gave it to me i dont know why i know why alice said jack started to cry his moms visible disgust was withering the little guy was looking withered too stop snivelingdont snivel alice said he needed to blow his nose his mom handed him the bra but jack hesitated go onblow she ordered im going to wash it before i give it back to her anyway oh you can start anytime jack the whole story what games are you playing with emma you better begin there he told her everythingwell maybe not everything possibly not the part about emma baring her breasts probably not every time emma asked to have a look at the little guy certainly not the part about his penis making actual contact with emmas hairy private place but his mother must have had a pretty good idea of what was going on shes fifteen jackyoure eight ill have a little talk with mrs oastler is emma going to get in trouble i sincerely hope so alice said am i in trouble he asked what a look she gave him jack hadnt known what she meant when shed said they were becoming like strangers now he knew his mom looked at him as if he were a stranger youre going to be in trouble soon enough was all she said his father inside him compared to the drama unfolding between jack and emma and what lay ahead between alice and mrs oastler the inability of miss wurtz to manage her gradethree classroom was minor yet there was drama there as well however improvisational lucinda fleming whom jack couldnt see over sat at the desk in front of his she would routinely and deliberately whip his face with her huge ponytail which hung halfway down her back and was as thick as a broom in exasperation jack would respond by grabbing it with both his hands and pulling it he could barely manage to pin the back of her head to the top of his desk jack found he could restrain her there by pressing his chin against her forehead but it hurt nothing appeared to hurt lucinda except her alleged proclivity to hurt herself which jack was beginning to doubt maybe lucinda had despised playing dimmesdale to jackashester or she hated being a head taller than he was possibly she believed that by whipping jack with her ponytail she could make him grow caroline wurtz never saw lucinda lash out at jack with her broom of hair miss wurtz only became aware of the situation after hed pinned lucindas head to his desk please jack miss wurtz would say dont disappoint me in his dreams when the wurtz would say dont disappoint me her tone of voice was deeply seductive not so in the gradethree classroom in reality disappointing miss wurtz was a bad ideashe did not handle it well yet the gradethree children often disappointed her deliberately they resented what a wellorganized tyrant she was in her other capacity as their drama teacher that she couldnt maintain order in the classroom was a weakness they exploited gordon french once released his pet hamster into his hostile twins hair from carolines reaction one might have guessed that the hamster was rabid and bit her but all the stupid hamster did was race around and around her head as if it were running on its incessant wheel miss wurtz perhaps fearful that the hamster would be harmed began to cry crying was the last resort of her disappointment and she resorted to it with tiresome frequency oh i never thought id be this disappointed she would wail oh my feelings are hurt more than i can say but when miss wurtz began to cry the kids stopped paying attention to what she said they were concentrating on what they knew would happen next for which there was no preparing themselves the gray ghosts sudden appearances even when they were anticipated were always startling there was only one door to the gradethree classroom and despite her reputedly supernatural powers mrs mcquat could not pass through walls yet even though the children saw the doorknob turning they could not protect themselves from the shock sometimes the door would swing open but no one would be there they would hear the gray ghosts labored breathing from the hall while jimmy bacon moaned and the two sets of twins sounded their predictable alarms at other times mrs mcquat seemed to leap inside the classroom before the doorknob so much as twitched only roland simpson the classs future criminal purposely closed his eyes roland liked being startled according to mrs wicksteed the gray ghost had lost a lung in the war what war and which lung were unknown to jack mrs mcquat had been a combat nurse and shed been gassed hence her labored breathing the gray ghost was always out of breath gassed where and with what were also a mystery to jack the third graders could have written mrs mcquats dialogue for her upon her unpreventable sudden appearance the gray ghost would address the class as if she were a character in a dramatization caroline wurtz had scripted in her coldasthegrave outofbreath voice mrs mcquat would ask which of you made miss wurtz cry without hesitation the children identified the guilty party they would betray anyone when asked that terrifying question at that moment they had no friends no loyalties because here is the dark heart of what they believed if mrs mcquat had been gassed and lost a lung wasnt it possible that she had died who could say for certain that she wasnt a ghost her skin her hair her clothesgray on gray on gray and why were her hands so cold why did no one ever see her arrive at school or leave why was she always so suddenly there jack would long remember the gray ghost asking gordon french you put a what in your sisters hair gordon answered just a hamster a friendly one it felt like a small dog gordon caroline said gordon knew the drill he stood like a soldier in the aisle beside his desk immobilized by his foreknowledge of what he was about to endure i hope you didnt hurt the hamster caroline mrs mcquat said granting gordon brief reprieve its no fun having one in your hair caroline replied where is the hamster miss wurtz suddenly cried that her first name was also caroline was confusing please find the hamster caroline the gray ghost said but before caroline french could begin to look miss wurtz dropped to all fours and crawled under carolines desk not you dear mrs mcquat said reprovingly all the children had joined miss wurtz on the floor whats its name gordon maureen yap asked the gray ghost was not letting gordon off so easily youll come with me gordon mrs mcquat said pray your hamster isnt lost for it will surely die if its lost the kids watched gordon leave the classroom with the gray ghost everyone knew that mrs mcquat was taking gordon to the chapel often it was empty but even if one of the choirs was practicing she took the offending child to the chapel and left him or her there the child had to kneel on the stone floor in the center aisle next to one of the middle rows of pews and face backward away from the altar you have turned your back on god the gray ghost would tell the child you better hope he isnt looking as gordon would recount it was a bad feeling to have turned his back on god and not know if he was looking after a few minutes gordon felt sure that someone was behind himin the vicinity of the altar or the pulpit perhaps one of the four women attending to jesussaints now ghosts themselveshad stepped out of the stained glass and was about to touch him with her icy hand the gradethree class was interrupted in this fashion so frequently that they often couldnt remember whod been banished to the chapel and had turned his or her back on god mrs mcquat never brought you back from the chapelshe just took you there roland simpson virtually lived in the chapel with his back turned to god time would pass and someoneoften the yapwould ask miss wurtz shouldnt someone check to see if gordon is all right in the chapel oh my goodness miss wurtz would cry how could i have forgotten and someone would be sent to release gordon or roland from the certifiably lonely terror of kneeling in the chapel backward it felt wrong to be looking the wrong way in church like you were really asking for trouble but the third graders were well prepared for fourth grade mrs mcquat of course was the teacher for grade four the only fourth graders who were ever in need of being disciplined in the chapel were new students whod not had the pleasure of witnessing the wurtzs emotional meltdowns the gray ghost had no trouble managing her classroom it was miss wurtzs class that repeatedly called upon mrs mcquats ghostly skills the third graders continued to get in trouble and they often ended up in the chapel facing backward becausedespite their fear of the gray ghostthere was something irresistible about how the wurtz fell apart the kids both loved the way she cried and hated her for it becauseeven in grade threethey understood that it was miss wurtzs weakness that brought mrs mcquats punishment upon them miss wurtzs weakness was not infrequently on display in jacks dreams of her in mrs oastlers pushup brawhich were not thwarted by alice returning the bra to mrs oastler gratefully jack never dreamed about the gray ghost in his young mind this gave further credibility to the theory that mrs mcquat was dead she was however very much alive in the gradethree classroom where her sudden appearances became as commonplace as the wurtz bursting into tears hence when jimmy bacon exposed himself to maureen yapwhen he raised his ghostsheet to demonstrate that indeed he wore no underwear beneath his halloween costumemiss wurtzs feelings were again hurt more than she could say she bitterly expressed how she never thought shed be so completely disappointed and when the gray ghost left jimmy in the chapel facing the wrong way jimmy pooed in his bedsheet like the frightened ghost he was if mrs mcquats sudden appearance had started jimmy pooing his overwhelming conviction that jesus had disappeared from the stained glass above the altar finished the job a poor costume choice jimmy was all the wurtz would say about the beshitted sheet no matter how many times lucinda fleming provoked jack with her ponytail and he pinned her head to the top of his desk it was never that dispute between them that reduced caroline wurtz to tears in all their fights lucinda and jack stopped short of causing miss wurtzs sobs they may have been foolish enough to imagine that they would be spared the gray ghosts sudden appearance but lucinda was led by her ear to the chapel over another issue she erased the answers on roland simpsons math test while roland was turning his back on god in the chapel all the other kids were surprised that lucinda had bothered in all probability the answers on rolands math test were wrong mrs mcquat took jack to the chapel only once but memorably he drove miss wurtz to tears not by grabbing lucinda flemings ponytail and pinning her head to his desk but by kissing her it was miss wurtz jack imagined kissing of course but he kissed lucinda fleming on the back of her neck instead only one person could have prompted him to do such a repugnant thingemma oastler emma was angry at jack for ratting on her to his mother although the return of mrs oastlers bra hardly amounted to a day of reckoning for emma emmas mom was unmoved by alices assertion that emma had molested jack in mrs oastlers opinion it was not possible for a woman or a girl to molest a man or a boy whatever games emma had played with jack hed probably liked them mrs oastler maintained but emma was disciplined in some minor fashion she was grounded she told jack she was to come directly home from school for a month no more cuddling in the backseat baby cakes no more making the little guy stand at attention its only for a month jack reminded her i dont suppose theres anyone in grade three who turns you on emma inquired i mean besides the wurtz jack made the mistake of complaining about lucinda fleminghow she tortured him with her ponytail but he was always the one who got in trouble in her present mood emma probably liked the idea of getting jack in trouble lucinda wants you to kiss her jack she does she doesnt know it but she does shes bigger than i am he pointed out just kiss lucinda jackitll make her your slave i dont want a slave you dont know it but you do emma told him just imagine youre kissing the wurtz the discovery that same week of gordons dead hamster in the chalk box should have forewarned jack talk about an ill omen but he didnt heed it if for what seemed the longest time he didnt dare to kiss lucinda fleming he also couldnt dispel the idea of doing it sitting behind her watching her swish her whip of a ponytail back and forthwell suffice it to say her neck was often exposed and one day when miss wurtz was writing the new vocabulary words on the blackboard jack stood on tiptoe and leaned across his desk andlifting her ponytailkissed lucinda fleming on the back of her neck there was no response from the little guyanother ill omen this one not lost on jack and what bullshit it wasthat the children were ever told to be on their guard for lucindas socalled silent rage there was nothing silent about it lucinda never made a sound when jack pulled her ponytail or pinned her head to the top of his desk but when he kissed her you would have thought shed been bitten by the avenging ghost of gordons dead hamster not even in jacks wildest dreams had miss wurtz in a variety of bras and restraining devices once responded to his kisses with half of lucindas demented energy lucinda fleming screamed until she was red in the face she lay in the aisle beside her desk and kicked her legs and flailed her arms and thrashed her head and ponytail back and forth as if she were being devoured by rats this was a challenge well beyond the wurtzs limited capacity she must have thought that lucinda was warming up for a suicide attempt oh lucinda who has disappointed you so miss wurtz criedor some such idiotic utterance because the wurtz always said something amazingly inappropriate maybe the kids couldnt resist misbehaving just to see what she would say in crafting dramatizations from her beloved novels miss wurtz had an ear for the best linesmany of which she robbed for her own voiceover in introducing jackaselinor in sense and sensibility she set himasher up perfectly jack was the reasonable sister miss wurtz said of elinor in voiceover she had an excellent heart her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught alas in jacks gradefour year miss wurtz would cast him as the immoderate sister marianne whom he detested it was the meddlesome mother mrs dashwood whom he wanted to play but miss wurtz who conveniently overlooked the fact that shed cast jack as blind rochester maidennomore tess aonherbreast hester and underthetrain anna said that he didnt look old enough to be a woman whod had three daughters though miss wurtz seemed at a loss about what to say when something spontaneously just happened she always spoke with authority her diction and enunciation perfect even if what she said revealed a total misunderstanding of the situation this the children found very confusing hence when lucinda fleming suddenly went stiff as a board and began to bang the back of her head on the floor miss wurtz asked the class which of you thoughtless children has caused lucinda such anguish and pain what maureen yap asked lucinda is peeing caroline french observed indeed lucinda lay in a spreading puddleher skirt stained a darker gray in a doomed effort to keep time with the floorthumping of lucindas head the french twins began the alltoorecognizable patter of their heels they were not unlike the rhythm section of a band in need of practice the anticipated blanketsucking sounds of the booth twins were ominously replaced by their identical imitations of gagging they were more like blanketstrangulation sounds yet as accompaniment to the spectacle of lucinda fleming methodically banging her head in a pool of her own urine the sounds were more suitable than anything miss wurtz had to say lucinda is having one of her bad moments children miss wurtz needlessly informed the gradethree class what might we do to make her feel better jimmy bacon of course moaned jack wanted to help but how i just kissed her he tried to explain you what miss wurtz said on the neck jack saw the eyes roll up in lucinda flemings head she appeared to be passing to another world lucinda emitted a strangling sound of her ownas if she meant to comfort the booth twins long separated from their kindergarten blankets even roland simpson destined for reform school and ultimately jail was instantly afraid and for the moment lawabiding and if jimmy bacon had been wearing his bedsheetwell theres no need to spell it out caroline french suddenly looked like a girl with a hundred hamsters rushing through her hair those utter boneheads grant porter and james turner and gordon frenchin fact all the boys in the class roland simpson and jimmy bacon includedwere absolutely disgusted with jack he had kissed lucinda fleming evidently a mentally retarded girl now there was a disgrace to live down perhaps fearful of never being kissed the yap began to cryalthough nowhere near as noticeably as the wurtz had lucinda fleming swallowed her tongue was that the reason for the choking sound she was making now shes bleeding caroline french cried indeed lucinda was bleeding in the area of her mouth but it was not her tongueshe had bitten through her lower lip shes eating herself maureen yap screamed oh jack this disappoints me more than i can say miss wurtz sobbed by the commotion she made you would have thought hed gotten lucinda pregnant clearly his time in the chapel was nigh this was what could come from kissing the urine the blood the impressive pantomime of rigor mortisand to think hed kissed only her neck that was when jimmy bacon fainted the gray ghosts sudden appearance was so spectacular jimmy must have been too frightened to poo none of the children had seen her coming suddenly mrs mcquat was kneeling over lucinda the gray ghost pried lucindas teeth apart thereby rescuing her mangled lower lip mrs mcquat then stuck a book in lucindas mouth bite that lucinda the gray ghost said youve done enough to your lip already jack would remember the book unfortunately his memorization skills couldnt always distinguish between the trivial and the important although edna mae burnhams piano course book two which hed often seen on lucindas desk was not exactly trivial to jack burns he assumed it was a book his dad had used jack was sure william had taught from that very bookhed probably assigned it to someone back in those days when he was fooling around with two girls at st hildas possibly one or both of the girls had been an edna mae burnham reader it was all too much for the yap beginning with the kissing maureen fainted less spectacularly than jimmy it might have been that the gray ghosts sudden appearance especially her kneeling over lucinda made it appear to maureen that mrs mcquat was the angel of death but of course the gray ghost would know how to attend to someone whod bitten through her lip if shed been a combat nurse in whichever war surely shed seen more blood than that miss wurtz naturally could not stop cryingthus the inevitable ensued which of you mrs mcquat began in her breathless way made miss wurtz cry i did jack answered everyone seemed astonished that he had answered for himselfthat simply wasnt done only the gray ghost looked unsurprised that hed spoken up im sorry he added but mrs mcquat turned her attention elsewhere lucinda fleming was on her feet albeit unsteadily blood oozing from her gashed lip her shirt and tie were soaked and then there was the urinelucinda didnt seem to notice it the unnatural serenity of her smile was intact as before you need stitches lucinda the gray ghost was saying take her to the nurses office caroline miss wurtz once more thought that mrs mcquat meant her but caroline french understood that she was the designated helper not you dear the gray ghost told miss wurtz this is your class you stay the booth twins were instructed to accompany maureen yap to the nurses office as well not entirely revived from her swoon maureen looked dizzy jimmy bacon wasnt completely recovered from his fainting spell either he was down on all fours as if he were still searching for gordons deceased hamster grant porter and james turner were assigned the task of taking jimmy to the nurse they were such dolts jack doubted that they knew where the nurses office was as for jack he was surprised by how gently mrs mcquat took hold of his ear her thumb and index finger which pinched his earlobe were icecold but when the gray ghost led him from the classroom he was not in pain and in the corridor where she released his earher cold hand still steering him by the back of his neckthey struck up quite a cordial conversation considering the circumstances and what is miss wurtzs problem this time mrs mcquat whispered hed been afraid that the issue of the kiss itself might come up but he hesitated only a second to lie to the gray ghost was unthinkable i kissed lucinda fleming jack confessed mrs mcquat nodded seemingly unsurprised where she whispered on the back of her neck thats not so bad the gray ghost said i expected much worse there was no one in the chapel where jack regarded the prospect of turning his back on god with the greatest trepidation but mrs mcquat steered him into one of the foremost pews they sat down together facing the altar dont you want me to turn around jack asked not you jack why not i think you need to face the right way the gray ghost said dont you ever turn your back on god jack in your case im sure hes looking he is definitely oh youre only eight jack youre already kissing girls at eight it was just on the neck what you did was nothing but you saw the consequences urination bleeding rigor mortis stitches what should i do mrs mcquat pray she said you should be facing the right way for prayers pray what that you can control your urges the gray ghost said control my what pray for the strength to restrain yourself jack from kissing from worse than that jack from his father inside him mrs mcquat might as well have said when shed added pray for the strength to restrain yourself she hadnt been able to look him in the eyeshe was staring at his lap she meant the little guy and all that he might be up to whatever was worse than kissing jack prayed for the strength to resist it he prayed and prayed excuse me for interrupting your prayers jack but i have a question go ahead he said have you ever done worse than kiss a girl what would be worse something more than kissing perhaps jack prayed that the gray ghost would forgive him if he told her i slept with mrs oastlers bra emma oastler she gave you her bra not emmasit was her moms bra but emma gave it to you yes my mom took it back mercy mrs mcquat said it was a pushup bra he explained further go back to your prayers jack in her ghostly way she leftgenuflecting in the aisle and making the sign of the cross in her kindness to him jack couldnt help but feel that she was more alive than he first thought yet the message mrs mcquat had left with him was as chilling as an admonition from the grave god was watching jack burns if jack turned his back on god he would see and if god was looking so closely at him this was because he was certain jack would err the gray ghost seemed fairly certain of this herself whether the fault lay with his father inside him or with the independence of mind and imagination already exhibited by the little guy jack seemed as predestined for sexual transgression as emma oastler had predicted he prayed and prayed his knees were sore his back was aching moments later he recognized the smell of chewing gum in the pew behind himthis time it was a fruity flavor what are you doing baby cakes emma whispered jack didnt dare turn around praying he answered whats it look like im doing i heard you kissed her jack it took four stitches to close her lip boy have we got our homework cut out for us you cant kiss a girl like shes a steak she bit herself he explained to no avail passion of the moment eh emma asked im praying jack said still not turning around prayers wont help you honey pie homework will thus did emma oastler distract him from his prayers if emma hadnt found him in the chapel he might have followed the gray ghosts instructions to the letter and if hed successfully prayed for the strength to restrain himself which of course meant restraining the little guy toowell who knows what jack burns might have been spared or what he might have spared others not just another rose of jericho years later lucinda fleming would still include jack among the bored recipients of her christmas letter he didnt know why he never kissed her again he hadnt kept in touch emma oastlers theory was that jacks thirdgrade kiss on lucindas neck was her first and bestpossibly her last but given the sheer number of children lucinda fleming would havethey were mentioned by name together with their ages in those repetitive christmas lettersjack would be inclined to refute emmas theory spellbound as he was by lucindas prodigious childbearing jack could conclude only that her husband had been kissing hereven happily and in all likelihood the husband who had spent the better part of his life kissing lucinda fleming had not caused her to bite through her lower lip and pee all over herself looking back jack wouldnt miss lucindaor the rage she saved seemingly just for him it was the gray ghost he would miss mrs mcquat had done her best to help him not become like his father it wasnt her fault that jack didnt pray hard enough or that he lacked the strength to control what the gray ghost called his urges that he turned his back on god was more jacks failure than mrs mcquats or his dads he had a ton of homework in grade four emma genuinely helped him with it jacks other homework his sexual education remained emmas responsibility she was tireless in her role as his selfappointed initiator as his gradefour teacher mrs mcquat stayed after school two days a week to help jack with his math he actually concentrated on the math with the gray ghost there were no distractions no conflicting desires to breathe her in he never dreamed about mrs mcquat in anyones underwear in fact jack should have thanked her for the sympathy she showed himnot only for what she said to him in the chapel but the degree to which she tried to counteract the command caroline wurtz took of the boy whenever she turned him loose onstage or turned him notsoloose as was more often the case with jacks performances under the wurtzs uptight direction he was cast as adam in miss wurtzs cloying rendition of adam bede they kiss each other with a deep joy the stage directions read overlooking the disastrous results of the lucinda fleming kiss which afforded no joy of any kind jack devoted himself to the task given that the wurtz had cast heather booth as dinah the kiss was indeed a daunting one not only did heather make her disturbing blanketsucking sounds when he kissed her but her twin patsy made identical sucking sounds backstage miss wurtz had cast patsy as hetty the woman who betrays adam and what a godawful misinterpretation of adam bede it turned out to be jackasadam eventually marries the identical twin of the woman who cheats on him george eliot must have rolled around in her grave over such a liberty as that and the wurtz was overfond of the passage at the end of chapter following her own inclinations as ever miss wurtz gave the passage to jack as dialogue even though it is actually george eliots narration looking into heather booths lovestruck eyes as he delivered his weighty lines didnt help what greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they are joined for lifeto strengthen each other in all labour to rest on each other in all sorrow to minister to each other in all pain to be one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting jackasadam asked heatherasdinah while she persisted in making barely audible sucking sounds in the back of her throatas if his kiss had made her ill and she were readying herself to vomit jack mrs mcquat said when she saw his performance you must take everything miss wurtz says with a grain of salt a what its an expressionwith a grain of salt means not to take someone or something too seriously oh i wouldnt agree that there is no greater thing for two socalled human souls than to be joined for life frankly i cant think of a comparable horror jack would conclude that mrs mcquat was unhappily marriedor else if her husband had died and she was a widow who still called herself mrs the gray ghost and the late mr mcquat had not enjoyed many silent unspeakable memories at the moment of their last parting naturally he took no end of shit from emma oastler for kissing heather booth with a deep joy in front of the older girls did you use your tongue emma asked him it looked like you frenchkissed her used my tongue how well get to that honey piethe homework is piling up all the math youre doing is causing you to fall behind behind in what it sounded like you were gagging her you dork but the booth twins had made those terrible blanketsucking sounds since kindergartenemma should have remembered that emmas sleepytime stories were the probable origin of the twins making those awful sounds just wait till you get to middlemarch jack the gray ghost consoled him its not only a better novel than adam bede miss wurtz has not yet found a way to trivialize it thus in grade four did he encounter in mrs mcquat a necessary dose of perspective he would regret that she wasnt his mentor for his remaining years in school but jack was indeed fortunate to have her as his teacher in his last year at st hildas perspective is hard to come by caroline wurtz was one of those readers who ransacked a novel for extractable truths moral lessons and pithy witticismswith little concern for the wreck of the novel she left in her wake without the gray ghosts prescription of a grain of salt who knows for how long jack might have misled himself into thinking that hed actually read jane eyre or tess of the durbervillesor the scarlet letter anna karenina sense and sensibility adam bede and middlemarch by grade four he had not read these wonderful bookshed only acted in miss wurtzs purposeful plundering of them of course jack was familiar with the bulletin boards at st hildas where praise of women was rampant there among the usual announcements was some humorless observation of emersons a sufficient measure of civilization is the influence of good women and before jack was cast as dorothea in miss wurtzs dramatization of middlemarch he had seen george eliot quoted among a variety of bulletinboard announcements at the time of course jack thought george eliot was a man possibly a manhating one at least on the evidence of a most popular bulletinboard assertion of mr eliotsor so jack believed a mans mindwhat there is of ithas always the advantage of being masculineas the smallest birchtree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palmand even his ignorance is of a sounder quality what does that mean he used to wonder as dorothea with all her eagerness to know the truths of life jack radiated under miss wurtzs direction very childlike ideas about marriage no kiddinghe was a child pride helps us jackasdorothea prattled and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurtsnot to hurt others once again this was not written as dorotheas dialogue or anyone elses in the novel to miss wurtzs assessment of his talents onstagenamely that there were no boundaries to his possibilities as an actormrs mcquat countered with her own little scrap of truthfulness she had found in the pages of middlemarch in fact the world is full of hopeful analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities the gray ghost whispered george eliot jack asked middlemarch you bet mrs mcquat replied theres more in that book than dramatic homilies jack to miss wurtzs prediction that he would one day be a great actorif and only if he dedicated himself to a precision of character of the demanding kind the wurtz so rigorously taughtthe gray ghost offered another undramatized observation from middlemarch among all forms of mistake prophecy is the most gratuitous the most what what im saying jack is that you must play a more active role in your future than miss wurtz oh dont you see whats wrong with the wurtz baby cakes emma oastler asked whats wrong with her obviously the wurtz is unfulfilled jack emma said i must have been wrong about her having a boyfriend maybe someone in her family bought her nice clothes you dont imagine she has a sex life or ever had one do you only in his dreams jack hoped he had to admit if not to emma that it was confusingnamely how much he was learning from miss wurtz which stood in contrast to how obviously flawed she was like caroline wurtz roaming randomly in a novel jack searched the st hildas bulletin boards for gems of uplifting advice unlike miss wurtz at large in a novel he found little that was useful there kahlil gibran was a favorite of the older girls in those years jack brought one of gibrans baffling recommendations to the gray ghost for a translation let there be spaces in your togetherness and let the winds of the heavens dance between you what does that mean jack asked mrs mcquat poppycock hogwash bunk the gray ghost said what it doesnt mean anything at all jack oh mrs mcquat had taken the quotation from him he watched her crumple it in her cold hand shouldnt i put it back on the bulletin board he asked lets see if mr gibran can find his way back to the bulletin board all by himself the gray ghost said jack trusted her he dared to ask her things he was afraid to ask anyone else there were a growing number of things he wouldnt ask his mother her distancing herself from him was a warning but of what jack wasnt sure he had tired of the whenyoureoldenough answer no matter what the reason for her aloofness lottie was lottie as much as she had mattered to him oncemaybe most of all when hed been in those north sea ports and had missed hernow that he was older lottie didnt hold him chesttochest to compare their beating hearts at his age that was a game jack preferred to play with emma as emma put it you can tell that the most interesting part of lotties life is over and mrs wicksteed was old and growing older when she warmed her increasingly uncooperative fingers over her tea her fingers would dip in and out of the tea with which she occasionally sprinkled jacks shirt and tie shed become an expert at doing a necktie during the years of her late husbands arthritis now i have his affliction jack mrs wicksteed told the boy i ask you does that seem fair the fairness question was one that had occurred to jack in other areas its not fair that i should turn out to be like my father he said frankly to mrs mcquat he was in a phase of being slightly less than frank with emma on this subject do you think its fair jack asked the gray ghost he could see shed really been a combat nursenotwithstanding what truth or lack thereof resided in the story of her having one lung because shed been gassed do you think im going to turn out like him mrs mcquat lets take a walk jack he could tell they were headed for the chapel am i being punished he asked not at all were just going where we can think they sat together in one of the foremost pews facing in the right direction it was a minor distraction that a gradethree boy was kneeling in the center aisle with his back turned on god although the gray ghost had positioned him therehowever long agoshe seemed surprised to see him in the aisle but she quickly ignored him if you turn out to be like your father jack dont blame your father why not barring acts of god youre only a victim if you choose to be one the gray ghost said from the look of the frightened third grader kneeling in the center aisle he clearly thought that mrs mcquat was describing him thank goodness jack never asked emma oastler his next question which he addressed to mrs mcquat in the chapel is it an act of god if you have sex on your mind every minute mercy the gray ghost said taking her eyes from the altar to look at him are you serious every minute he repeated its all i dream about too jack have you talked to your mother about this mrs mcquat asked shell just say im not old enough to talk about it but it seems that you are old enough to be thinking and dreaming about little else maybe it will be better in an allboys school jack said he knew that an allboys school was his mothers next plan for him just up the road from st hildaswithin easy walking distance in factwas upper canada college the ucc boys were always sniffing around the older of the st hildas girls and it was no surprise that mrs wicksteed knew someone at upper canada college or that jack would have good recommendations from his teachers at st hildasat least academically hed already been to ucc for an interview coming from the grayandmaroon standard at st hildas he thought there was entirely too much blue in the school colors at upper canadatheir regimentalstriped ties were navy blue and white if you played a varsity sport the firstteam ties as they were called were a solidblueknit varietynavy blue with square bottoms alice had found it ominous that the jocks were singled out and idolized in this fashion in jacks interview his mother freely offered that her son was not athletic how do you know jack asked her hed never had the opportunity to try trust me jack youre not but he trusted his mother less and less which allboys school are you thinking of the gray ghost asked him upper canada college my mom says ill have a word with your mother jack those ucc boys will eat you alive given his respect for mrs mcquat this was not an encouraging concept jack expressed his concern to emma eat me alive why eat me how its hard to imagine that youre a jock jack so so theyll eat you alive so what the sport of life is gonna be your sport baby cakes the sport of shut up and kiss me honey pie emma said they were scrunched down in the backseat of the town car again it was a fairly recent development that emma could give jack a boner in a matter of secondsor not depending on the little guys unpredictable response emma was in grade ten sixteen going on thirty or forty andto her considerable rageshe had newly acquired braces jack was a little afraid of kissing her not like that emma instructed him am i a baby bird are you feeding me some kind of worm its my tongue he told her i know what it is jack im addressing the more important subject of how it feels it feels like a worm like youre trying to choke me she cradled his head in her lap and looked down at him with impatient affection every year emma got bigger and stronger at the same time jack felt he was barely growing but he had a boner and emma always knew when he had one that little guy is like a coming attraction honey pie a what at the movies a coming attraction oh youre soon to be all over the place jack thats what im saying this girl is just jerking your wire mon peewee said just shut up and drive mon emma said to peewee he was as jack was in her thrall jack would wonder after his mom had returned the pushup bra to mrs oastler what possibly could have transpired between the two mothers that had led to him being left alone with emma again and jack and emma were alone a lot they were even alone for an hour or more at a time in emmas house whether emmas mom was at home or not they were left alone thereno lottie banging around in the kitchen below them screaming some nonsense about tea the oastler house in forest hill was a threestory mansion bequeathed to mrs oastler by her exhusband the alimony settlement had made emma and her mother rich women who scored big in their divorces were treated with immeasurable scorn in the toronto tabloids but mrs oastler would have said it was as good a way to get rich as any emmas mom was a small compact womanas her pushup bra would suggest as emmas mustache would imply her mother was surprisingly hairyat least for a woman and a small woman at that emmas mom would have had a more discernible mustache than her daughter but according to emma mrs oastler frequently had her upper lip waxed she would not have been rash to consider waxing her arms as well but the only other visible preventative measure taken against her hairiness was that she had her sleek black hair cut as short as a boys in an elfish pixie despite her prettiness which was petite in nature jack thought that mrs oastler looked a little like a man yes but an attractive one alice said to her son she thought that emmas mother was very goodlooking and that it was a pity emma took after her father jack never met emmas dad after every winter break from st hildas emma returned to school with a tan her father had taken her to the west indies or mexico that was virtually the only time they spent together emma also spent a month of every summer at a cottage in georgian bay but most of that time she was in the care of a nanny or a housekeeperher dad came to the cottage only on weekends emma never spoke of him that mrs oastler thought emma was too young to have her mustache waxed was a source of contention between mother and daughter its hardly noticeable emmas mom would tell her besides at your age what does it matter and there were other issues between them as one might expect of a divorced woman raising a difficult only childa sixteenyearold daughter who was physically bigger and stronger than her mother and still growing mrs oastler also thought that emma was too young to have a tattooan intolerable hypocrisy in emmas opinion because her mom had recently been tattooed by daughter alice this was news to jack but so was almost everything emma told him whats her tattoo a tattoo where he asked well what a surprise emmas mom had been tattooed to conceal a scar she had a cesarean emma said that old business again jack thought its a scar from her csection emma told him and to think hed once believed this was the ward for difficult births in a hospital in halifax she had a bikini cut emma explained a what a horizontal incision not the vertical kind i still dont get it jack said this necessitated a trip to mrs oastlers bedroom emmas mother was out there emma showed jack a pair of her moms pantiesblack bikini briefs no doubt a fetching match to the pushup bra mrs oastlers scar was called a bikini cut because the incision was below the panty line of the briefs oh and whats the tattoo a stupid rose jack thought not he was pretty sure he knew what kind of rose it was in which case it would have been too big to be completely concealed under the panty line of mrs oastlers bikini briefs a rose of jericho he asked emma it was for once her turn to be uninformed a rose of what this was not the easiest thing for a nineyearold to explain jack made a fist its about this big maybe a little bigger he began yes it is emma said go on jack its a flower with the petals of another flower hidden inside it what other flower there were so many words hed heard and rememberednot that he understood them labia was one vagina anotherthey were like flowers werent they and the other flower hidden in a rose of jericho was like the petals or the labia a woman hada vagina concealed in a rose jack couldnt imagine what a mess he made of this explanation to emma but of course emma knew what he was trying to say you must be kidding jack you have to know what youre looking for in order to see it the boy said dont tell me you know what a vagina looks like honey pie not an actual one jack admitted but he had seen a rose of jerichomany in fact he had examined the petals of that flower hed spotted the lips within the rose as ladies man madsen had called themthe ohsopeculiarbutdiscernible something that made a rose of jericho not quite like any other rose maybe you havent looked closely enough he said to emma who seemed not herselfshe was paralyzed with disbelief i mean at the tattoo emma took jack by the hand and led him back to her bedroom in her other hand emma was still holding her moms bikini briefs it was as if jack burns were destined to bear to his grave the burden of a lifechanging relationship with mrs oastlers underwear emmas bedroom was everything you would expect of that passage from childhood through puberty to concupiscence the neglected teddy bears and other stuffed animals occupied positions of no particular importance on the kingsize bed there was a poster from a beatles concert and one from a robert redford movie it might have been jeremiah johnson because redford had a beard and everywhere on the floor on the bedin one case as if strangling a teddy bearemmas bras and panties were flagrantly displayed the underwear of a womaninprogress which emma clearly was indicated albeit not to jack that emma was in more of a hurry on her journey to womanhood than most girls her age in comparison jack was in no hurry on his journey to becoming a young man he just happened to have met emma oastler who knew his fathers story despite the seven years between them emma was eager to see him catch up to her so you know what a vagina looks like emma was saying as she lay down among her discarded panties and bras and teddy bears i know what one looks like in a rose of jericho jack replied shed not let go of his hand he had no choice but to lie down on the bed beside her so a vagina is familiar to youthe labia the whole business emma was saying as she lifted her short pleated skirt and wriggled out of her panties her moms bikini briefs could never have accommodated emmas hips consistent with the general sloppiness of dress and undress of the older girls at st hildas emma didnt bother to take her panties entirely off she kicked one leg free but left her panties dangling on one ankle where their whiteness stood in contrast to her gray kneesocks which were typically pushed down below midcalf as if the socks were also indications of emmas preference for halfdress or halfundress you have big feet jack observed forget the feet jack youre looking at your first vagina and youre telling me youre not surprised the hair was again a surprisethough not nearly so much as when hed first felt it unseen but the rest of the businesswell he was prepared for it to be complicated the intricate folds the lips as ladies man madsen had called them were of a certain healthiness of pink that no tattoo pigment could imitate yet this ornate door for a vagina was clearly an opening was recognizable from his moms rose of jericho of which jack had seen a hundred having seen emmas he would have no trouble in the future finding that other flower in the rose but for how many nineyearold boys is it no big deal to see your first actual vagina cat got your tongue jack emma said the hairs differenttheres no hair on the tattoo he told her youre saying only the hair is special youre saying youve seen the rest of it its a rose of jericho jack said i would recognize it anywhere its a vagina honey pie but its also a rose of jericho he insisted you just need to take a closer look at your momsat her tattoo i mean maybe the little guy has more of an interest in the real thing than you do jack alas the little guy did not look interested enough to merit emmas approval jesus baby cakes i think theres something wrong at nine going on ten jack simply wasnt old enough the unpredictability of his penisaroused one minute indifferent the nextwasnt half as disappointing to him as it was to emma kiss me emma demanded that sometimes works not this time jack would have admitted that the kiss was more aggressive than usual on emmas part and thatnotwithstanding how shed criticized him for inserting his tongue in her mouth and wiggling it like a wormthe probing use she made of her tongue was beginning to get the little guys attention but at the very moment his pinkie of a penis demonstrated a growing interest which emma might have called promising he snagged his lower lip on a loose wire in emmas newly acquired braces before either of them noticed jack had bled all over emma and himselfand her bed several stuffed animals and the aforementioned bra the one that appeared to be strangling a teddy bear there was blood everywhere more alarming emma and jack were still attached while emma searched her messy bedroom for a hand mirror they were clumsilyin jacks case painfullylinked his lower lip was hooked to her wired teeth and the hand mirror when emma finally found it offered a confusingly reversed view they were caught in the act of failing to disengage his lip from her braces when emmas mom came home and skillfully in a matter of seconds separated them maybe you should get your upper lip waxed emma mrs oastler said did he need stitches jack wanted to know there was every bit as much blood as when lucinda fleming had attempted to eat herself dangerous kissing was not new to jack burns its just a puncture wound emmas mom said pinching his lower lip between her thumb and index finger she didnt seem to mind the blood jack recognized her perfume from his many nights with her pushup bra mrs oastler the instant he remembered her stolen bra spotted her black bikini briefs on emmas bloodstained bed i wish youd play these games with your own underwear emma mrs oastler said by the evidence of emmas white panties with the lace waistband which were still wrapped around emmas left ankle and draped over her left foot it was clear that emma and jack had been playing a game with her underwear as well but mrs oastler took more of an interest in recovering her black bikini briefs youre evidently a precocious boy jack emmas mom said jack knows all about tattoos emma told her he knows all about yours anyway really is that true jack mrs oastler asked if its a rose of jericho i know something about it he said go onshow him emma told her mom im sure jack doesnt need to see another rose of jericho ill bet hes already seen his share mrs oastler said well id like to take a closer look at it myself emma told her mother now that i know what it is maybe later emma mrs oastler said we cant send jack home all covered with blood youve got a vagina above your vagina and you wont let me get a butterfly on my ankle emma screamed ankles hurt jack offered tattoos hurt where theres nothing but bone it seems that jack does know all about tattoos emma you should listen to jack i just want a butterfly emma screamed heres what were going to do jack mrs oastler said ignoring her daughter im going to take you to my bathroom where you can wash up emma can wash up in her bathroom emmas mom took jacks hand and led him down the familiar path to her bedroom which was connected to a large bathroom with walltowall mirrors in her other hand mrs oastler carried her black bikini briefs which she twirled around and around her index finger in the slight breeze made by her swinging panties jack became more aware of her perfume than before she removed his bloodstained shirt and tie and filled her bathroom sink with warm water with a wet washcloth she wiped his face and neck being careful to gently pat his punctured lip which was still bleeding if only a little while jack washed the blood from his hands in the sink mrs oastler rubbed his shoulders with her cool silky hands there wasnt any blood on jacks shoulders but emmas mom seemed almost as comfortable touching him as her daughter was youre going to be a strong boy jacknot very big but strong do you think so he asked i know so mrs oastler said i can tell oh he realized why her hands felt so cool and silky she was rubbing his back and shoulders with her black bikini briefs youre obviously very mature for your age emmas mom continued whereas emma although shes a big girl is somewhat immature in other areas shes not at all at ease with boys her own age for example oh jack said again he was drying his hands with a towel while mrs oastler continued rubbing his back and shoulders with her panties in the mirror he could see her intense serious face framed by her pixie haircut as for you jack you seem quite comfortable around older girls and women he felt somewhat less comfortable when emmas mom ran her silky underwear over the back of his neck and placed her panties on his head like a hatlike a curiously misshapen beret his ears protruded from her bikini briefs where her thighs would normally be what on earth will we tell your mom about your lip she asked before jack could think of an answer mrs oastler said i get the feeling alice isnt quite ready for the idea of you kissing a sixteenyearold so his mom was alice to mrs oastler which was only a mild surprise he should have known a rose of jericho is a fairly lengthy procedure several hours under the best circumstancesand in this case on such an intimate area of the body jack could easily imagine his mom and mrs oastler having quite the conversation lying faceup on a bed or a table for hours at a time having a rose of jericho tattooed a few inches above your vaginawell what subjects wouldnt you feel free to discuss people became fast friends in less than half the time it took to tattoo a rose of jericho alice had spent hours staring at mrs oastlers pubes in such a situation how could they not get to know each other but while alice had apparently gone along with mrs oastler regarding jack and emmas behavior that he had cut his lip in a kissing accident might just nip alices friendship with mrs oastler in the bud in any case it made perfect sense to jack not to tell his mother how hed hurt himself kissing emma you could say it was a staple jack i was trying to separate two pages of paper that had been stapled together and you tried to help me you opened the staple with your teeth why would i use my teeth he asked because youre a kid mrs oastler said she patted her bikini briefs which jack still wore as a hat then she plucked her panties off his head and threw them across the bathroom into an open laundry hamper it was a good shot she had a kind of athletic grace boyish in nature ill find you a tshirt something to wear home tell your mom im sending your shirt and tie to the dry cleaners okay he said emmas mom was in her bedroom opening a drawer jack kept looking at himself barechested in her bathroom mirror above the sinkas if he expected to start growing in some observable fashion mrs oastler came back with a tshirt it was all black like her bikini briefs and with the sleeves for the upper arms cut short and tight the way women liked them emmas mom was so small her tshirt was only a little loose on jack its one of mine of course emmas clothes she added disapprovingly would be too big his lower lip had finally stopped bleeding but it was swollen and you could see the pinprick where the wire from emmas braces had stabbed him mrs oastler gently rubbed some lip gloss over the wound emma walked into the bathroom while her mom was doing this you look like a girl in that tshirt jack emma said well jacks pretty enough to be a girl isnt he mrs oastler asked there was a noticeable measure of shame in emmas resentful expression and slouched posture as if shed taken her mothers point to heart jack may have been pretty enough to be a girl butin her moms estimationemma wasnt were telling jacks mother that he cut himself on a staple he was trying to open a staple with his teeth silly boy i want to see the fucking rose of jericho emma said i want jack to see it too without a word mrs oastler who wore a tightfitting pair of black jeans with a silver belt untucked her longsleeved cotton turtleneck which was also black she unbuckled the belt and wriggled the jeans over her slim hips jack could see only the top half of the rose of jericho above the panty line of her black bikini briefs she hooked her thumbs under the waistband of her panties but before she slid them down she said this jack would be in the category of needlessly upsetting your mommaybe even worse than kissing a sixteenyearold if you know what i mean oh he said as she pulled her bikini briefs down there it was not the rose of jericho jack didnt need to waste a second of his time looking at another one his mom was a pro he assumed that daughter alices rose of jericho was the same every time while emma saw with a gasp the unmistakable other flower within the rose jack took a long careful look at the real thinghis second sighting of an actual vagina in one day emmas pubic hair was as unruly as she was but mrs oastlers pubes were neatly trimmed and if jack ever doubted emmas authoritythat he had an olderwoman thing as she put ithe didnt doubt it now if emmas vagina had left the little guy largely unimpressed what was jack to make of the quantum leap the little guy made in response to emmas mom thats disgusting emma said she meant the tattoo its a rose of jericho like any other jack insisted my mom does a good one while he went on staring at her vagina mrs oastler rumpled his hair and said you bet she does jackyou bet she does emma suddenly hit him so hard that he took a short flight across the bathroom tiles and landed in the vicinity of the laundry hamper jack instinctively put a finger to his lower lip to be sure he wasnt bleeding again you werent looking at the tattoo baby cakes boys will be boys emma mrs oastler told her daughter be nice to jack please dont make him bleed again emma yanked him to his feet by grabbing hold of her moms skimpy tshirt in one of the bathrooms many mirrors jack caught a glimpse of mrs oastler pulling up her bikini briefs and wriggling her hips back into her jeans whats the little guy think of my moms rose of jericho emma asked jack in her vaguely threatening way mrs oastler of course didnt realize that emma was referring to jacks penis she probably assumed that her daughter was being disparaging about the boys smaller size dont bully him emma mrs oastler said its unbecoming as jack was leaving he found it confusing that both emma and her mom kissed him goodbyemrs oastler on his cheek emma on his undamaged upper lip in the category of unnecessarily upsetting his mother jack was determined he would make no mention of his confusion to hernor would he tell her about the rest of his eventful day at the oastler mansion in forest hill jack went to bed that night in mrs oastlers black tshirt although lottie said she liked him better in his own pajamas lottie wrapped an ice cube in a washcloth and held it to his lower lip while she said her prayers over him may the lord protect you jack and may he keep you from harming others lottie always began jack thought the latter was a ridiculous concern why would he ever harm others may the lord keep mrs wicksteed alive a little longer lottie went on may i please be permitted to die in toronto and never go back to prince edward island amen jack usually tried to say at this point hoping that would be the end of it but lottie wasnt finished please lord deliver alice from her inclinations her what you know what jackher tendencies lottie told him her choice of friends oh may god keep your mother from hurting herself not to put too fine a point on it lottie continued and may the lord bless the ground you walk on jack burns so that you are ever mindful of temptation may you become the very model of what a man should be jacknot what most men are amen he said again thats for me to say and for you to say after me lottie always told him oh right thank you mrs wicksteed lottie whispered at the endalmost as if mrs wicksteed were god and lottie had been addressing her from the beginning amen amen she took the ice cube in the washcloth away from his lip which was numb but jack was wide awake and as soon as lottie left he went to his mothers room and got into her bed where he eventually fell asleep jack had many vivid memories of his twovagina day it was impossible to fall asleep right away it was his moms leg across his body that woke him it was the tshirt that woke her alice turned on the light to have a better look why are you wearing leslies shirt jack is emma stealing her moms tshirts now so mrs oastler was leslieanother mild surprise even the tshirt was more familiar to his mom than jack had thought he carefully explained that mrs oastler had given him her tshirt to wear because his clothes were all bloodytheyd been sent off to the dry cleanersand any shirt of emmas would have been too big jack showed his mom his puffy lower lip where he had poked himself with a staple hed tried to undo with his teeth i thought you were smarter than that alice said jack very slowly and even more carefully said that he understood his mom had tattooed mrs oastlerit sounded like a rose of jericho from emmas description he unconvincingly explainedbut the tattoo was in such a private place that emmas mom wouldnt show it to him im surprised she didnt show you alice said i dont need to see another rose of jericho jack went on even to himself he sounded too cavalier whats so special about hers just the place jackits in a special place oh he must have moved his eyes away from hers his mom was such a good liar she was tough to lie to not every woman shaves her pubic hair in quite that way his mother said her what the hair is called pubic hair jack oh you dont have any yet but you will do you shave your pubic hair that way jack asked his mom thats not your business young man she told him but he could see she was crying he didnt say anything lesliemrs oastler to youis a very independent woman alice started to say as if she were beginning to read out loud from a long book shes been through a divorce a bad time but shes very rich shes determined to seize control of everything that happens to her shes a very forceful woman shes kind of smallsmaller than emma anyway jack interjected he had no idea what his mother was struggling to say you want to be careful around mrs oastler jack im pretty careful around emma he ventured yes you should be careful around emma too alice said but you want to be more careful around emmas mom okay its all right that she showed you his mother said im sure you didnt ask to see it emma asked her to show me he said now tell me about your lip jack was learning that adults were better at concealing things than kids were and he was increasingly aware that his mom knew a lot she wasnt telling him mrs wicksteeds health for example jack knew she had arthritis because he could see it for himself and because mrs wicksteed had told him but no one told him she had cancer not until the day she didnt get up in time to do his tieand then lottie told him not his mother maybe his mom had been too busy it might have been the same week shed been tattooing mrs oastler suddenly there was no one in the house who knew how to do a necktie except mrs wicksteed who was dying is she dying of arthritis jack asked lottie no dear she has cancer oh so that was why lottie prayed every night for the lord to keep mrs wicksteed alive a little longer peewee did jacks tie that morning he was a limo driver he did his own tie every morning he tied jacks in a very matteroffact fashion not making half the fuss that mrs wicksteed hadeven before her arthritis mrs wicksteed is dying peewee thats too bad mon whats the lady with the limp going to do then so that was why lottie prayed to be permitted to die in toronto everyone including peewee knew that lottie didnt want to go back to prince edward island maybe everyone had a rose of jericho hidden somewhere jack thought perhaps it wasnt always the kind of tattoo you could see but another kindlike a free tattoo no less a mark for life just one not visible on the skin not your usual mailorder bride out of concern for mrs wicksteed jack asked miss wurtz if he could be excused from jane eyre rehearsals the rest of that week after all hed played rochester before he could do the part blind so to speak but connieturnbullasjane had been replaced with caroline french jack had never embraced a girl his own height carolines hair got in his mouth which he found disagreeable in the throes of that passionate moment when jackasrochester tells carolineasjane that she must think him an irreligious dog caroline nervously thumped her heels backstage jack could imagine her dimwitted twin gordon thumping his heels too and when carolineasjane first took jackasrochesters hand and mashed it to her lips jack was overcome with revulsionboth carolines hand and her mouth were sticky it wasnt only because mrs wicksteed was dying that he wanted to miss a week of rehearsals miss wurtz was reduced to tears all that week jacks mom told him that mrs wicksteed had helped miss wurtz out of a tight spot before whether the socalled tight spot had been the source of the wurtzs tastefully expensive clothesthe boyfriend emma no longer believed injack never learned he was permitted to miss rehearsals caroline french was forced to imagine him in her sticky embrace his availability was of little use to mrs wicksteed who was hospitalized and enduring a battery of tests lottie assured jack that he didnt want to see the old lady that way jacks mother though she told him almost nothing of what she was feeling was noticeably distraught if upon mrs wicksteeds death lottie would soon be on a boat back to prince edward island alice confided to jack in the semidarkness of her bedroom that they would be out on the street jack inquired if in lieu of the street there might be room for them in the chinamans tattoo parlor were not sleeping in the needles again was all his mother would say was their enemy mrs wicksteeds divorced daughter she had never cared for their status as her mothers rentfree boarders but wasnt she alleged to be mrs oastlers friend hadnt she and leslie oastler attended st hildas together now that leslie and alice were friends jack suggested that maybe mrs oastler would speak to mrs wicksteeds daughter on their behalf all alice said was that mrs wicksteeds daughter and leslie oastler werent the best of friends anymore it was only natural that jack turned to the gray ghost for guidance in this troubling time but mrs mcquat knew something she wasnt telling him her strongest recommendation was that they pray together in the chapel which meant only that they prayed together more and when he asked the gray ghost if shed been successful in persuading his mother that he would be eaten alive by those boys at upper canada college mrs mcquats answer was out of character it was not like a former combat nurse to be evasive maybe ucc wouldnt have been so bad jack what did the wouldnt have been mean excuse me mrs mcquat jack started to say youre a bit young to be a boarder jack but there are schoolsmostly in the stateswhere boarding is the norm the what they were in the second pew to the left of the center aislethe altar bathed in a golden light the stainedglass saints administering to jesus what a lucky guy to have four women fussing over him mrs mcquat put her cold hand on jacks far shoulder and pulled him against her she put her dry lips to his temple and gave him the faintest trace of a kiss she gives him a paper kiss jack would read in a screenplay years later and remember this moment in the chapel for a boy in your situation jack maybe a little independence is the best thing a little what talk to your mother jack but having tried to open that door without success he talked to emma oastler instead emma was giving him a tour of her mothers mansion in forest hill they were checking out the guest bedroomsthe guest wing as mrs oastler called it there were three bedrooms each with its own bathroom it was a wing all right honestly emma was saying i cant understand why you and your mom dont just move in here i think its stupid to send you away away where talk to your mom its her idea she thinks you and i are a bad combination she doesnt want you going through puberty in the same house with me going through what its not like wed have to sleep in the same bedroom emma said pushing him down on the biggest of the guestroom beds your mom and mine have the prevailing st hildas mentality girls get to see boys until the boys are nineyearoldsthen the boys disappear disappear where emma was engaged in one of her periodic checks on the progress of his penis which seemed to render her melancholic shed pulled down his pants and underwear and was lying with her heavy head on his bare thigh i have a new theory emma said as if she were speaking exclusively to the little guy maybe you are old enough maybe its me whos not old enoughi mean im not old enough for you disappear where jack asked her again where am i being sent away its an allboys school in maine baby cakes i hear its kind of remote kind of what possibly the little guy likes even older women than i first supposed emma was saying his penis lay still and small in the palm of her hand jack was being sent to maine but the little guy didnt care ive talked to a couple of girls in grade thirteen and one in grade twelve they know everything about penises emma went on maybe they can help help what the problem is that theyre boarders we cant get you into their residence unless youre a girl honey pie jack should have seen it coming how hard was it for him to be a girl he was pretty enough as mrs oastler had observedand in his many onstage performances at st hildas hed been a woman more often than hed been a man much against miss wurtzs wishes hed recently been cast as a woman in the seniorschool production of a mailorder bride in the northwest territoriesa nineteenthcentury melodrama that the wurtz despised jack was the pathetic child bride because of the plays subject matterit was annually performed for the senior school exclusivelyhed needed his mothers permission to accept the part alice in her fashion had acquiesced shed never read the play not growing up in canada alice hadnt been subjected to a mailorder bride in the northwest territories in her girlhoodas almost every canadian woman of alices generation had as almost every canadian girl of emmas generation would be in those daysat st hildas especiallythe senior girls were fed a steady diet of canadian literature miss wurtz was outraged that many novels of international staturethe classics which she adoredwere popularly replaced by can lit as it was called canada had many wonderful writers miss wurtz declaredon those occasions when she was not raving about the socalled classics robertson davies alice munro and margaret atwood were her favorites years later as if she were still arguing with jack about a mailorder bride in the northwest territories miss wurtz would write him and tell him to read alice munros a wilderness stationa terrific story about a mailorder bride the wurtz didnt want jack to assume that the subject matter of mailorder brides had prejudiced her against the annual seniorschool play abigail cooke the playwright whod been an unhappily married woman in the northwest territories was certainly not among canadas better writers she was no alice munro that abigail cookes a mailorder bride in the northwest territories was required reading in the senior school at st hildas was in miss wurtzs view an abomination that the play was performed every year was in her wellenunciated words a theatrical travesty the play was published by a small obscure press that specialized in scholastic books miss wurtz with uncharacteristic vulgarity once referred to the canadian publisher as beaver penis press she immediately apologized to jack for the word penis the play miss wurtz assured jack was beneath his talents as an actor it was nothing short of an invitation to humiliate himself before an audience of older girls much to jacks relief the gray ghost offered him her grainofsalt perspective it was a dreadful play mrs mcquat agreedthe fantasies of an amateur writer and certifiable hysteric in abigail cooke had murdered her allegedly abusive husband and then shot herself her play which was discovered in her attic was published posthumously in the s there were those st hildas old girls mrs wicksteed among them who thought of the author as a feminist ahead of her time mrs mcquat advised jack that the only interesting role was the one hed been offeredthe mailorder bride the gray ghost believed it was an opportunity for jack to express himself more freely by which mrs mcquat meant that miss wurtz would not be the director in the senior school the maven of the dramatic artsand the only other male teacher at st hildas besides mr malcolmwas the mercurial mr ramsey he was what in those days they called a confirmed bachelor only five feet two inches tall with a spadeshaped blond beard and long blond hairlike a child vikingmr ramsey was head and shoulders shorter than many of the girls in the senior school and in some cases ten or fifteen pounds lighter his voice was as highpitched as a girls and his enthusiasm on the girls behalf was both shrill and a model of constancy mr ramsey was an unrestrained advocate of young women and the older girls at st hildas loved him in an allboys environment or even in a coeducational school mr ramsey would have been taunted and mistreated that he was obviously a homosexual was of no concern at st hildas if a student had been so crude as to call him a fairy or a fag or any of the common pejoratives boys use to bully other boys the seniorschool girls would have beaten the culprit to a pulpand rightly so notwithstanding mr ramseys embarrassing fondness for a mailorder bride in the northwest territories he was a refreshing presence for jackhis first truly creative as opposed to restraining director is it the jack burns we dont deserve to be this lucky mr ramsey cried with open arms at the first rehearsal look at him mr ramsey commanded the older girls who had been looking at jack for some time they didnt need mr ramseys encouragement is this not a child bride born to break our hearts is this not the precious innocence and flawless beauty that in darker days led so many a mailorder bride to her brutal fate jack was familiar with fatehed already played tess a mailorder bride in the northwest territories was hardly a tale of the same literary magnitude yet the heroine of the play was as mr ramsey correctly observed a reliable heartbreaker for an audience of pubescent and often hysterical girls in the rugged northwest territories where men are men and women are scarce a pioneer community of fur trappers and ice fishermen sends a sizable amount of money for traveling expenses to a mailorder service called brides back east the poor brides are chosen from among unadoptable orphans in quebec many of them dont speak english some of the girls at the time they set out for the northwest territories to meet their mailorder husbands are prepubescent the play is set in the s its a long hard trip from quebec to the northwest territories it is presumed that most of the girls will be old enough for marriage or more than old enough by the time they arrive besides the fur trappers and ice fishermen arent asking for older girls the plays principal fur trapper jacks future husband mr halliday says in sending for his mailorder bride i want a wife on the younger side you got that in the play four young girls make their way west in the company of a cruel chaperone madame auber who sells one of the girls to a blacksmith in manitoba and another to a cattle rancher in alberta both of these unfortunate brides speak only french madame auber though french herself has nothing but contempt for them of the two girls who make it to the northwest territories one sarah a bilingual stutterer loses her virginity to her mailorder husband on a dog sled thereafter she wanders off in the snow and freezes to death in a blizzard jack plays the other one who makes it darlin jenny who successfully prays for the delay of her first periodher menses as they are called throughout the play she is aware that when she starts bleeding shell be old enough to be mr hallidays brideat least in hallidays crude opinion thus aided only by prayer jenny wills herself not to start it was this plot point that required alices permission for her son to accept the role and necessitated jacks perplexing visit to the nurses office where the school nurse the young miss bell informed him of the facts of lifebut only the facts that pertained to girls menstruation foremost among them having seen his first two vaginas in a single day jack was not surprised to learn that such a complicated place of business was given to periodic bleeding but imagine the consternation this caused him when he mistakenly thought that this was the longawaited event emma oastler expected to find evidence of in his bedsheets to jacks knowledge his penis had not yet squirted it alarmed him to imagine that emma had meant he would squirt blood jacks confusion understandably upset the school nurse miss bell had talked to many girls about their first periods while she was awkward in discussing menstruation with a nineyearold boy she was at least prepared to do so but the area of male nocturnal emissions was way off miss bells map she was aghast that jack could confuse a wet dream with menstrual bleeding but she was at a loss to explain the difference to him in all probability jack you wont even know the first time you ejaculate in your sleep the first time i what miss bell was young and earnest jack left the school nurses office knowing more than he needed to know about menstruation as for the specter of his first wet dream he was in terror a nocturnal emission sounded like something one might encounter at the batcave exhibit in the royal ontario museum if in all probabilityas miss bell had saidjack wouldnt even know the first time he ejaculated in his sleep this meant to the boy that he might bleed to death without ever waking up in the play the most impressive hulk among the gradethirteen girls virginia jarvis was cast as jacks mailorder husband mr halliday ginny jarvis looked like a fur trapper she was both big and womanlyin the manner of emma oastler and charlotte barford but ginny was older she had a more developed mustache on her upper lip than emma had and mrs oastlers pushup bra could never have contained her prior to jacks first rehearsal emma informed him that ginny jarvis was one of the two gradethirteen girls who knew everything about penises the other one was ginnys best friend penny hamilton who was cast as the evil chaperone madame auber penny had lived for a time in montreal and did a killer french accent of the kind everyone in toronto found very funny as for the gradetwelve girl who according to emma also knew everything about penisesthe third boarderthat was pennys younger sister bonnie penny hamilton was a goodlooking girl and she knew it bonnie hamilton had been in an automobile accident innumerable surgeries had failed to correct her limp it was worse than lotties something permanently twisted in her pelvis caused bonnie hamilton to lead with her left foot while dragging her right leg behind her like a sack jack did not find her limp unattractive but bonnie did bonnie hamilton wasnt in a mailorder bride in the northwest territories she refused to be in any plays because of her limp but jack thought bonnie was more beautiful than penny during rehearsals for a mailorder bride in the northwest territories he saw bonnie only when she was sitting down she was the prompter in a folding metal chair with the script open in her lap bonnie held a pencil ready to make note of the errors naturally she didnt limp when she was sitting down in the first rehearsal when ginnyjarvisasmrhalliday asked jackasdarlinjenny if shed started bleedin yet the sheer coarseness of the moment evoked an awkward embarrassed silence from the rest of the cast i know i knowits an unforgivable question but thats the point mr ramsey said jack answered in character he already knew his lines bonnie hamilton didnt need to prompt him what do you mean jenny screams at halliday why should i be bleedin but jenny knows exactly what halliday means halliday grows impatient he cant believe how long its taking for his child bride to become a woman one evening when jackasjenny is singing a nostalgic song on a porch swing ginnyashalliday assaults her clever girl that she is jenny has stolen madame aubers pistola prop mr ramsey borrowed from the upper canada college boys track team it was a starting gun that fired blanks at the end of act two jackasjenny shoots ginnyashalliday with the starting gun heasshe fires two very loud blanks into herashis chest and ginny jarvisa star on the st hildas fieldhockey teamfalls on the stage with an athletic thud act three is jennys trial for hallidays murder her defense is that she was only a child when she was forced to marry the fur trapper and that she is still a virgin the miraclenamely that jenny hasnt yet begun her mensesis disputed by the prosecution jenny refuses to be examined by the communitys only doctor because hes a man the few women in the communityonly two women are on the juryare tolerant of her refusal they despise the male doctor jennys fate appears to be in the hands of a female physician who has been summoned from yellowknife but before the lady doctor arrives jenny is saved by another miracle of her own makingonce again the power of prayer while testifying about shooting mr halliday jenny suddenly stands screams and begins to bleed a prop more creative than the ucc track teams starting gun is employed for the bleeding jack wears a plastic bag filled with water and red food coloring under his dress his wrists are bound together at his waist when he stands he clutches his lower abdomen as if in painbursting the bag of colored water which soaks his dress and hands bloodred darlin jennys piercing scream indicates to the jury that this must be her first period she has been telling the truth she is innocent trial over but jack was able to practice bursting the plastic bagat the time filled with just wateronly once before the first performance he thought that more practice might have helped meanwhile backstage after the dress rehearsal emma oastler penny and bonnie hamilton and ginny jarvis stealthily dressed jack in a school uniform they had scrounged from one of the bigger gradesix girlsa short gray skirt and kneehighs since jack already had makeup ona little rouge some stage lipstick which showed redder than it was in the footlightsit was only necessary to adjust the wig he wore as darlin jenny flanked by penny hamilton and emma with ginny jarvis leading the way and bonnie hamilton accompanied as always by her limp taking a rearguard position jackasagirl marched straightaway to the older girls residence in the afterschool hours their entrance from the second floor of the junior school was unobserved the hamilton sisters shared a room ginny jarvis occupied the room across the hall from them there were no locks on the residence doors but the matron was not inclined to check on the girls until after supperwhen they had to be accounted for and were supposed to be studying jack was invited to lie down on a bed he must have looked anxious because emma bent over him and whispered in his ear dont worry honey pie i wont let anyone touch you but jack was in the presence of girls who were older than emma he was frightened which one of us do you like looking at the best jack ginny jarvis asked by the indifferent way she raised the question ginny seemed resigned to the fact that she wouldnt be the boys first choice penny hamilton was staring at him with an intimidating selfconfidence bonnie hamilton wouldnt look at him she stood at some distance from the bed her left foot forward i think bonnie is beautiful jack said you see ginny asked the assembled girls theres no predicting what turns on men or boys jack could tell hed made penny angry by not choosing her which under the circumstances made him more anxious than before get closer to him bonnie ginny directed let him see more of you bonnie lurched forward left foot first jack was afraid she was going to fall on him but she dropped to her knees beside himcatching her balance with both hands on his chest she still wouldnt look at him she knelt next to him putting her hands on her thighs and staring at her lap ever the prompter it was as if she were waiting for someone to flub a line jack was suddenly shy about looking at her because bonnie wouldnt look at him he could feel ginny jarvis lift his skirt and pull down his underpants at least he assumed it was ginnypenny hamilton seemed too peeved with him to take an interest no one touched him its little all right penny said when ginny had exposed him well see about that ginny replied whats happening jack asked emma nothing baby cakes dont you worry less than nothing penny hamilton said hes frightened this isnt right bonnie hamilton said hes too younghes just a kid she leaned over jack when bonnie looked at him it was in the same way that she scrutinized the text in her capacity as prompteras if his face were the only true map of the unfolding story and bonnie hamilton was the absolute authority on what he might be feeling bonnies limp compelled jack to look at her and imagine her accident it was his first understanding that physical attraction even sexual desire was stimulated by more than the perfection of a body or the beauty of a face he was drawn to bonnies past to everything traumatic that had happened to her before he met her her crippling accident drew jack to her this was worse than what emma had correctly identified as his olderwoman thing he was attracted to how bonnie had been damaged that shed been hurt made her more desirable the thought was so troubling to jack that he began to cry ive had it with penises ginny jarvis was saying maybe its asleep or something penny hamilton suggested dont let them frighten you jack bonnie hamilton said it surprised him that she was the one who looked stricken with fear as if she were a prisoner in the passenger seat and saw the fastapproaching collision seconds before the driver could react to it bonnie pinched her lower lip with her teeth and stared at jack as if she were transfixedas if he were the upcoming accident and even though she saw him coming she couldnt turn away whats wrong he asked her what do you see bonnies eyes welled up with tears dont cry on the kid bonnieyoure the one whos frightening him penny hamilton said somethings working ginny jarvis observed maybe its the crying keep crying see if i care penny told her sister if jack is frightened we should stop emma said i think bonnies frightened penny said with a laugh if bonnie is frightened we should stop jack saidnot that he was aware of what they had started bonnie hamilton looked terrified to him he felt increasingly afraid of whatever was frightening her this is a frightened little boy bonnie hamilton cried im here baby cakes emma said she leaned over jack and kissed him on the mouth he wouldnt remember if she used her tongue his fixation was with her upper lip it must have been her mustache that made jack hold his breath keep kissing him emma ginny jarvis said somethings definitely happening penny hamilton more closely observed it wasnt that he couldnt breathe hed simply stopped he saw a multitude of streaming stars the speckled glow of northern lightsthe aurora borealis that radiant emission beloved by all canadians better let him breathe emma he heard bonnie hamilton say whoa look out ginny jarvis cried his ejaculation caught penny hamilton as she was taking a closer looktoo close as it turned out and to think that no one had touched him you got her smack between the eyes honey pie emma told him later im so proud of you i felt responsible that you were afraid never again are those girls getting anywhere near you jack im taking better care of you from now on at the time bonnie hamiltons eyes were locked onto jacks she couldnt stop staring at the boy what do you see she asked him jack what is it youre the most beautiful of all the girls he told her still gasping for breath hes delirioushe doesnt know what hes saying emma said cruelly but bonnie didnt seem to hear her she just went on looking at jack her sister penny was furiously wiping her forehead with a wad of tissues naturally jack asked to see the blood the what baby cakes he must think hes darlin jenny ginny jarvis said boys are truly sick emma oastler took him by the hand they left the older girls residencetraipsing through the junior school the way theyd come they went to the theater where jack dressed in his own clothes backstage he wanted to practice bursting the blood bag but mr ramsey had gone home for the day jack and emma found peewee sleeping in the town car they went to the house on the corner of lowther and spadina because lottie was spending most of her time at the hospital where she said mrs wicksteed was at deaths door and alice was either at the chinamans or with mrs oastler jack was touched that emma had stood up for him and that shed promised to keep the older girls away from him but for how much longer wasnt he being sent to maine for his fifthgrade year who would keep the older boys away also troubling was emmas discovery that she upon entering grade eleven would become a boarder why jack wondered emma lived at home she could walk to school my mom doesnt want me around was all emma would say she was even more sullen than usual at the prospect of being a boarder they were in jacks bedroom where emma was examining the little guy no signs of wear and tear she said i dont suppose you remember what you were thinking jack could barely remember not breathing but he was wonderingafter his neardeath ejaculationif mrs wicksteed would see that radiant emission of northern lights when she passed away he was also struggling to articulate to emma exactly what had attracted him to bonnie hamiltonnot just the limp but her overall aura of damage of having been hurt jack couldnt quite express it nor could he convey to emma how bonnie had looked at himhow hed recognized that she was smitten although bonnie herself might not have known it jack even tried to talk about it with the gray ghostwithout letting on to her that hed had a neardeath ejaculation in the older girls residence of course this was one of the older girls mrs mcquat asked and she looked at you how like she couldnt look away like she couldnt help herself he said tell me who this was jack bonnie hamilton shes in grade twelve i told you she was older jack when an older girl looks at you like that you just look away what if i cant look away or help myself either mercy mrs mcquat exclaimed thinking she was changing the subject she asked hows it going with the mailorderbride business the blood is the tricky part he said theres blood this year actual blood its red food coloring with waterits just a prop a prop i think i like blood better when i have to imagine it maybe i should have a word with mr ramsey but if the gray ghost ever had a word with mr ramsey nothing of their conversation was reflected in the premiere performance of a mailorder bride in the northwest territories on saturday night the st hildas theater was packed to jacks surprise not only was the wurtz in attendance but the gray ghost sat in the front row beside her maybe mrs mcquat believed that her encouraging presence would serve to mitigate miss wurtzs scathing condemnation of the play more surprising still and also occupying frontrow seats alice had come with mrs oastler and emma lottie jack knew was maintaining her vigil at mrs wicksteeds deathbedotherwise lottie would have been at the theater too and most surprising of all peewee was there he must have overheard emma and jack talking about the play in the backseat of the town car a strikingly beautiful black woman was with him peewee had a wife or girlfriend whoever she was peewees date seemed stunningly overdressed among the divorced moms and dads who were the usual audience for a seniorschool play at st hildas mrs peewee wore a flowery dress with a plunging neckline from jacks backstage perspective her hat resembled a stuffed parrot it was a most impressive audience especially by the juniorschool standards jack was familiar with from miss wurtzs dramatizations but some of the cast suffered from stage fright pennyhamiltonasmadameauber whose french accent was such a hit with torontonians had a fit getting into her evilchaperone costume in retrospect jack would like to think that penny was distracted from the task of dressing herself by her memory of his jism nailing her in the forehead sandra stewart a gradenine girl who was small for her age played sarah the bilingual stuttererwho ended up freezing to death after losing her virginity on a dog sled sandra threw up backstage which prompted mr ramsey to say its just butterflies ginnyjarvisasmrhalliday sweating in her furtrapper costume said that looks like worse than butterflies naturally jack thought that mr ramsey and ginny were referring to the contents of sandras vomit for the first two acts of the play jack kept stealing looks at bonnie hamilton whose eyes not once met his jack caught only a few backstage glimpses of the audience peewee seemed to be enjoying himself mrs peewee had removed the stuffed parrot from her head the wurtz spent much of the evening scowling and muttering to mrs mcquat the gray ghost was in character unreadable most of the time mrs oastler looked boredshe had no doubt seen better theater in her sophisticated life emma fidgeted in her seat shed been to most of the rehearsals and was interested only in what would happen with the blood when jackasdarlinjenny shot ginnyashalliday twice with the starting gun peewee jumped to his feet and pumped both fists in the air miss wurtz knowing the shots were coming had covered her ears alice who hadnt read the play and had only the dimmest idea of its heavyhanded subject looked growingly appalled when the gun went off she flinched as if shed been shot the curtain fell at the end of act two the houselights came up and revealed more of the audience but from backstage jacks attention lingered on the first row peewee was still excited about the shooting emma was chewing gum miss wurtz appeared to be delivering a lengthy critique of the play and no doubt the entire subject of menstruation to a taciturn mrs mcquat alice and mrs oastler were holding hands why were they holding hands jack wondered he knew that this was fairly common among dutch women and other europeans but hed not seen any canadian women holding handssome of the girls at st hildas excluded young women or girls occasionally held hands but not women the age of alice and leslie oastler furthermore emmas mom had kicked off her shoes with one bare foot smaller than emmas she was stroking alices bare calf jack looked uncomprehendingly upon this curious behavior he had not yet made the leap which emma would make before him regarding why his mother and mrs oastler wanted to live alone in such a big house that emma and jack were a bad combination was only part of the reason mr ramsey interrupted jacks scrutiny of the audience from backstageit was time for him to tie the blood bag around the boys waist and for jack to put his trial dress on maybe jack was supposed to resemble joan of arc although despite getting his first period onstage he would fare better than poor joan the dress was a sackcloth sheath as beige as a potato the blood mr ramsey assured him would be most vivid against such a neutral background the clamminess of the plastic bag which flopped against jacks bare abdomen was at first disconcerting under the dress while it wasnt a very big bag mr ramsey worried that it might make jackasjenny look pregnant mr ramsey loosened the knot at the top of the bag to release any excess air this may have precipitated the slow leak which jack didnt notice until he sat down in the witness box to give his testimony he thought he was sweating but the trickle down one leg was blood or water with red food coloringnot sweat given jacks neardeath ejaculation he first feared that his penis was bleeding when he realized that the bag of colored water was leaking he wondered if there would be sufficient blood left in the bag for the allimportant bursting scene after the performance mr ramsey would praise what he called jacks preparation for the standing screaming bleeding extravaganzathe way the boy squirmed in the witness chair as if unbeknownst to him his first period was already starting but it was jenny faltered in her testimony a hesitation mr ramsey later termed brilliantbut one that caused the faithful prompter bonnie hamilton to look up from her lap and regard jackasjenny with the utmost concern jack could read his asyetunspoken lines on her lips he could see that the audience was growing anxious he hoped that no one in the audience could see the trickle of blood but peewee saw it the poor man was not a regular theatergoer hed come out of fondness for jack peewee knew nothing of propsthe gun had taken him totally by surprise and now he saw that jack was bleedingthe strain of the moment or something hemorrhoidal or a stab wound inflicted by one of the older girls backstage jack was only a couple of lines away from his big moment when peewee rose from his seat and pointed at the boy jack you are bleeding mon he cried it was everything the wurtz fearedit was improv jack spontaneously decided to edit his remaining testimony which made bonnie hamilton gasp but he was already bleeding wasnt the blood and his reaction to it his best witness jack jumped to his feet and struck the leaking bag of colored water with both fists the bag had lost more blood than hed realized it was not full enough to burst easily darlin jenny struck herself in the lower abdomen again and again the last time she hit herself a little too hard jackasjenny doubled over at the force of the blow the bag burst with the sound of a tendon snapping the blood exploding under the potatocolored dress jack you are making it worse mon peewee cried but jack was at that moment in his performance when his audience of one took over completely he screamed and screamed he raised his bound wrists above his head his hands dripping blood the blood dripped on his face what was meant to represent a first and longwithheld period suddenly looked like a terminal hemorrhage someone on the jury one of the two women was supposed to say that this clearly had to be jennys first experience with menstruation but jackasjenny didnt hear the line the audience couldnt have heard it either even bonnie the prompter had stopped prompting jack was wailing like a banshee he was being sent away to maine he had managed to ejaculate not only because he was drawn to bonnie hamiltons pain but also because of his enduring infatuation with emma oastlers mustacheand holding his breath while kissing emma had almost killed him mrs wicksteed lay dying lottie was taking the boat back to prince edward island jacks world was changing once again he couldnt stop screaming jackasjenny bled enough for a young woman having her first five periods miss wurtz had on her enraptured face an expression of stunned enlightenment in her literary snobbery shed underestimated both jacks improvisational powers and the theatrical potential of a mailorder bride in the northwest territories the entire cast was frozen backstage sandra stewart vomited again ginny jarvis now the murdered mr halliday said this was all jacks doing emma had stopped chewing her gum with her mouth open even mrs oastler seemed impressed by all the blood and screaming mrs peewee was clutching her hat as if she were strangling the parrot jack barely noticed that peewee had rushed onstage to attend to him he just went on screaming and bleeding jack was only distracted from his audience of one when he looked at his mother it had not been an easy time for alice lately she had recently caught jack under the covers trying to sneak a look at the scar from her csection in the semidarkness of her bedroom jack couldnt see it he explained that he was curious as to whether she had a bikini cut like leslie oastler or if her incision had been the vertical kind its private jackits not your business his mom cried but why had she been so upset about it in the front row at the st hildas theater maybe alice was remembering that awkward momentor the passing of mrs wicksteed or losing lottie or the futuremoving in with mrs oastler among other things even as he went on screaming and bleeding onstage jack realized that his mom like peewee was not much of a theatergoer she may have thought shed seen him act before but this was nothing shed been prepared for her mouth was as open as emmas her hands were fists pressed against her temples her knees were clamped as tightly together as if she were the one who was hemorrhaging and because jack was screaming he couldnt hear her crying he saw the tears flow down her cheeks she cried and cried without restraint she was hysterical jack saw leslie oastler trying to comfort her emma had stopped looking at jack and was staring at alice instead im all right jack said to peewee who had picked him up and was shouting for a doctor its a play peewee mon you have bled enough for both of us peewee said but jack was transfixed by his mother oh jackie jackie she was crying im sorry jackim so sorry im okay mom he tried to tell her but she didnt hear him there was now the applause to contend withit had swelled to a standing ovation even the wurtz was applauding the entire cast was onstage with peewee and jack it was time for their bows but peewee wouldnt put jack down its just water with red food coloring peewee jack whispered in the big mans ear it was a prop im not bleeding shit mon peewee said what am i supposed to do with you then try bowing the boy told him still holding jackasjenny in his arms peewee bowed on monday mr ramsey would inquire if he could ask peewee to be there for the remaining performances but it was not an experience peewee wanted to repeat years later peewee told jack that he never got over it jack saw that the gray ghost had magically materialized at his mothers side faithful combat nurse that she was mrs mcquat was doing her best to calm alice down but not even the gray ghost was effective alices sobs were lost in the uproar but jack could still see her stricken face he could read her lipshis name over and over again and she kept repeating that she was sorry jack had meant to ask her if they were to become mrs oastlers rentfree boardersand on the subject of free had his mom given emmas mom a free tattoo but seeing his mom so dissolved by his performance as darlin jenny jack knew better than to ask without fully understanding his mothers relationship with leslie oastler he guessed that nothing in this world nothing that mattered was ever free despite the applause jack would have begun to scream againhad not the curtain come down and he found himself backstage still in peewees arms peewee had only momentarily viewed the falling curtain as another unscripted calamity once the sea of girls had surrounded them peewee calmed himself and congratulated jack on his performance he finally put the boy down jack burns mr ramsey was calling every mailorder bride in the world is in your debt jack saw that mr ramsey had a camera he was taking a picture of jackasjenny you can shoot me anytime jack ginny jarvis said too loudly in his ear penny hamilton who overheard herand whose unfortunate forehead had been in the way of his neardeath ejaculationsaid yeah jack the odds are that youre not shooting blanks what leave him alone emma oastler said shed managed to make her way backstage and had thrown a protective arm around him also backstage was the haunted face that would stalk jacks future bonnie hamilton was looking at him from a distance as if her heart couldnt bear coming any closer she had stopped prompting but he could still read her trembling lips you see jack whispered in emmas ear you see how bonnies looking at methats what i mean but in the clamor of the moment emma didnt hear himor else she was too preoccupied fending off the older girls you know what baby cakes emma was saying it might not be the worlds worst idea that youre going to an allboys school in maine why there was his makeup to remove and the stage lipsticknot to mention all the blood the director mr ramsey the child viking could not stop bouncing on the balls of his feet just when i was beginning to think that abigail cooke might be a pinch dated he was saying to miss wurtz whod come with tears in her eyes to offer her congratulations emmas old friends wendy holton and charlotte barford had come backstage to join them if i ever had a period like that i think id die wendy told jack charlotte barford kept eyeing him as if he were a neglected hors doeuvre somehow despite his considerable sizenot to mention his lastminute contribution to the productionpeewee had managed to slip away in the happy chaos following the successful opening night jack allowed his mothers visible distress to drift to the back of his mind but if he ever had a conscience at st hildas her name was mrs mcquat not to be outdone by jacks success the gray ghost staged a characteristic sudden appearance that took the boys breath away if hed had any blood left in him he would have started bleeding afresh if his throat werent raw from screaming he would have screamed againonly louder jack was going home with emma our first sleepover honey pie emma had declared shed left the backstage area to go find her mom who was waiting with alice jack was albeit briefly still backstage but miraculously alone even his beloved prompter had slipped away her limp for once unnoticed that was when the gray ghost appeared at his sideher cold hands taking jack by both wrists exactly where theyd been bound together good show jack mrs mcquat breathed on him but you have work to do i dont mean onstage she whispered what work he asked look after your mother jack youll blame yourself if you dont oh look after her how he wanted to ask look after her why but the gray ghost who was almost always in character had disappeared as he would discover again later in his life jack found that it can be a dark and lonely place backstageafter the audience and the rest of the cast have gone in no way was jack burns a mailorder bride but that pivotal and bloodsoaked performance in mr ramseys histrionic production had launched him mrs machado boys as a rule did not attend their class reunions at st hildas you cant really have a class reunion if you dont graduate and the st hildas boys left the school at the end of grade fourwithout ceremony lucinda fleming was a tireless organizer of her class reunions at st hildasjacks graduating class had he been a girl maureen yap whose married name would remain a mystery attended the reunions regularlyeven in her nonreunion years the booth twins were regulars as well they were always together but lucindas christmas letters never mentioned the twins identical blanketsucking sounds jack would wonder if the booths still made them caroline french was a noshow at the reunions if caroline still thumped her heels on occasion she was doing it alone her adversarial twin gordon was killed in a boating accidentnot long after he left st hildas when jack was still in school elsewhere as jack would discover its remarkable how you can miss people you barely kneweven those people you never especially liked jacks last day of school in the spring of was marked by the unusual occasion of both emma oastler and mrs mcquat accompanying him to the lincoln town car which peewee had dutifully parked with the motor running at the rosseter road entrance it had been mrs wicksteeds dying wish that peewee continue to be jacks driver for the duration of the boys time at st hildas emma and jack slipped into the backseat of the town car as if their lives were not about to change peewee was in tears his life was about to changeactually upon mrs wicksteeds death and lotties abrupt departure for prince edward island it already had the gray ghost leaned in the open window her cool hand brushing jacks cheek like a touch of winter in the burgeoning spring you may write to me jack mrs mcquat said in fact i recommend that you do so yes mrs mcquat the boy said peewee was still sobbing when the town car pulled away you better write to me too baby cakes emma was saying you just watch your ass mon peewee blubbered you better grow eyes in the back of your head just to keep watching your ass jack sat in the backseat not talkingmuch as he had on the way to and from mrs wicksteeds funeral all the while his mother kept saying that the summer ahead would be no vacation she said she was dedicating herself to the task of getting jack ready to go away to school you have to learn how to deal with boys jack alice whose estimation of her sons lack of athletic prowess was exaggerated but largely true sought the services of four men she had tattooed to instruct jack in the manly art of selfdefense what form of selfdefense he chose was up to him his mom said three of the tattooed men were russiansone from ukraine and two from belarus they were wrestlers the fourth man was a thai kickboxer an exchampionthe former mr bangkok whose fighting name was krung mr bangkok and the wrestler from ukrainehis name was shevchenko but alice called him chenkowere both older men and bald krung had chevronshaped blades tattooed on both cheeks and chenko had a snarling wolf tattooed on his bald pate when chenko bowed to an opponent there was the unfriendly wolf a ukrainian tattoo i guess alice told jack with evident distaste krungs facial blades were a thai thing alice said both men had broken hearts tattooed on their chests daughter alices workno one had to tell jack that the grungy old gym on bathurst street was marginally more frequented by kickboxers than by wrestlers blacks and asians were the principal clientele but there were a few portuguese and italians the two boys from belarus were young taxi drivers whod been born in minskminskies chenko called them boris ginkevich and pavel markevich were sparsely tattooed but they were serious wrestlers and chenko was their coach and trainer boris and pavel had tattoos where some wrestlers like themhigh on the back between the shoulder blades so that they are visible above a wrestlers singlet boris had the chinese character for luck which jack recognized as one of his moms newer tattoos pavel had a tattoo of a surgical instrument a tenaculum between his shoulder bladesa slender sharppointed hook with a handle as pavel explained to jack a tenaculum was mainly used for grasping and holding arteries the walls of the old gym were brightened by some of daughter alices and the chinamans flashone of the few places in toronto where the chinamans tattoo parlor was advertised even the weighttraining mirrors were outlined with alices broken hearts and her mans ruin was on display in the mens locker room but the gyms decor was dominated by chinese characters and symbols jack recognized the character for longevity and the five bats signifying the socalled five fortunes and there was the chinamans signature scepter the short sword symbolizing everything as you wish jack had told his mom that it was his favorite of the chinamans tattoosshe said forget about it the boy also liked the fingershaped citron known as buddhas hand which either alice or the chinaman had tattooed on krungs thigh in the old gym too there were the chinese characters for deer and the lucky number sixand the peony symbol and a chinese vase and the carp leaping over the dragons gate the socalled dragons gate is a waterfall and the carp leaps upstream over the waterfall by so doing it becomes a dragon this was a fullback tattooit took days sometimes weeks alice said that some people with fullback tattoos felt cold but tattoo ole had argued with her on this point ole claimed that only people with fullbody tattoos felt cold and not all of them did according to alice most fullbodies felt cold there was also a moon goddess in the bathurst street gym and the socalled queen mother of the westin taoist legend she has the power to confer immortality and the chinese character for double happiness which alice refused to tattoo on anyone it was synonymous with marriage which she no longer believed in the old gym itself had once been a rug store the large display windows which faced the bathurst street sidewalk attracted the more curious of passersby in the neighborhood the former mr bangkoks kickboxing classes were famous krung despite the chevrons emblazoned on his cheeks and the buddhas hand on one thigh was a popular teacher there were kickboxing classes for all levels jack was enrolled in a beginner class of course given the boys age and size his only feasible sparring partners were women his mother had put him in mr bangkoks able hands more to the point his able feet so that jack might learn to defend himself from bullies which boys of a certain ageespecially in an allboys schoolare reputed to be but jack once more found himself in a situation where his most dangerous adversaries were older women when the boy asked a jamaican lady with a big bottom if she was acquainted with his friend peewee she said you keep your peewee to yourself mon jack was relieved that she was too big to be his sparring partner he was paired instead with a portuguese woman in her forties mrs machado who informed him that her grown children had moved away leaving her unprotected from the random assaults of her exhusband according to mrs machado she was forced to keep changing the locks on her apartment her exhusband still held her accountable for her wifely duties even though she was no longer his wife because he repeatedly returned to her apartment either to force sex upon her or beat her up mrs machado was learning to fight for not dissimilar motives the women in krungs beginner class were particularly interested in mastering the highgroin kick in jacks case this meant that mrs machado kicked him in the area of his chest and throat in the opinion of the former mr bangkok the highgroin kick was impure yet jack and the women in krungs beginner class had reasons beyond the purity of kickboxing for mastering a highgroin maneuver if he was going to be bullied by older boys jack was not opposed to learning a highgroin kick mrs machado was a challenging sparring partner a short heavyset woman with coarse glossy black hair and pendulous lowslung breasts she blocked most of the boys kicks with her ample thighs or by turning sideways to him and receiving his kicks with her wide hips and as short as she was jack was shorter he was four feet eight inches tall and weighed seventyfive pounds mrs machado was five feet two and weighed onefifty she could kick a lot harder than he could youd be better off wrestling her chenko advised jack you just dont want to end up underneath her chenko respected krung and the more skilled kickboxers in the gym but he had contempt for the women in krungs beginner classmrs machado included she was a hard kicker but she wasnt very agile in chenkos opinion mrs machado could never defend herself from her exhusband by kicking him she would have to cripple him with the first kick if she missed her mark the fight would be over chenko thought that mrs machado would be better off learning to wrestle as for jacks eventual selfdefense chenko believed that the boy would have scant success defending himselfeither kickboxing or wrestlinguntil he grew a few more inches and put on another fifty or seventyfive pounds i dont see that your mom is getting her moneys worth yet chenko told jackthis was when jack and mrs machado had been kicking each other for about a week but wasnt it mrs oastlers money she was getting her moneys worth jack suspected leslie oastler would drive him to the gym on bathurst street before his mother was out of bed in the morning jack was there all day he kickboxed with mrs machado he hopped on one foot for five minutes at a time he stretched and stretchedthe objective being to kick consistently above your height at shoulder level without losing your balance jack rolled out the mats with chenko and disinfected them and wiped them dry he brought clean towels fresh water bottles and oranges cut into quarters to the kickboxers and the wrestlers when the minskies came in the midafternoon jack sat at matside with chenko and watched boris and pavel pummel each other they were both about mrs machados weight but leantwo very tough taxi drivers in their late twenties or early thirties chenko had the worst cauliflower ears but boris and pavel had similar nonecks with little more than scar tissue for eyebrows and the minskies ears were unmatched lumps of doughbarely more recognizable as ears than chenkos the wrestling jack learned was rudimentarymuch of it defensive a russian armtie and front headlock a threequarter nelson and a crossface cradle on top boris had a mean crossbody ride from the feet pavel had a good duckunder a better armdrag and an outstanding anklepick chenko was a highcrotch man but boris and pavel preferred an outside singleleg chenko liked the lateral drop but only if your opponent was close to your height there was no one jacks height in the bathurst street gym in wrestling he had no actual opponenthe just drilled the moves repeatedly with chenko pavel and boris occasionally after mrs machado had landed her best highgroin kicks in the area of jacks chest and throatespecially when shed knocked his wind outhe could persuade her to roll around with him on the wrestling mat she was the wrong height for the lateral drop but jack could anklepick her all day which mrs machado found frustratingand when he managed to get her down on the mat he could keep her down with a crossbody ride she couldnt get away from him to be fair chenko taught mrs machado a snapdown when she snapped jack down on all fours he couldnt get away from her she would just lie on the boy with her seventyfivepound weight advantage breathing heavily ha she would cry when she got him downthe exact same exclamation mrs machado favored when she landed her best highgroin kicks if jack was making any progress in defending himself he had no accurate means of testing it at the end of the day emma would relentlessly attack himon the livingroom couch or rug or in her bedroom or one of the guest bedrooms two of which jack and his mom occupied for the summer now seventeen emma was both taller and heavier than mrs machado emma could destroy jack nothing he had learned worked with her which was a sizable blow to his confidence in midjune mrs oastler sent emma to what she described as a weightmanagement program in california the fat farm emma called it jack never thought of emma as fat but mrs oastler did emmas selfesteem may have been further undermined by alices slim and attractive appearance although alice was by no means as small as leslie oastler it was a twoweek weightloss programpoor emmaduring which time mrs machado was hired to give jack dinner and be his babysitter until his mom and mrs oastler came home usually long after mrs machado had put the boy to bed thus jacks kickboxing sparring partner and occasional wrestling opponent became his nannylotties unlikely replacement at his appointed bedtime mrs machado and jack would spar a littleno full contact no finishing the moves as chenko would have saidand mrs machado would put him to bed with the door to the guestwing hall open and the light at the far end of the corridor left on before he fell asleep jack often heard her talking on the telephone she spoke in portuguesehe assumed to one or another of her grown children who had moved away they must have been living somewhere in toronto given the length of these conversations they were surely local calls not infrequently the calls ended with mrs machado in tears jack would fall asleep to the sound of her crying while she padded barefoot through the beautiful rooms in the downstairs of the oastler mansionher feet occasionally squeaking on the hardwood floors as she pivoted sharply on the ball of one foot while raising her kicking foot above shoulder level at such times jack knew that mrs machado was kicking the shit out of her imagined exhusbandor some other assailant after all he was familiar with the exerciseincluding the sound of the footwork on one of the first warm nights of the summer near the end of june mrs machado was crying and pivoting and kickboxing loudly enough for jack to hear her over the ceiling fan the oastler mansion was airconditioned but not the guest wingjack and his mom had ceiling fans for the warm weather alice had bought jack several pairs of what she called summer pajamasnamely his first boxer shorts they were a little big for him the boy got out of bed in a checkered pair of boxers that hung to his knees fittingly the checks were gray and maroonthe familiar st hildas colors he followed the light to the far end of the guestwing hall and went downstairs to offer what comfort he could to mrs machado jack could see her in the front hall circling the grandfather clock as if the clock were her opponent when she balanced on her left foot he was impressed by the perfect bentknee position of her kicking leg her elevated foot was held at a right angle to her ankle like the flared head of a cobra jack should have said something or at least cleared his throat but mrs machado was concentrating so fiercely that he was afraid he might startle her if he spoke she was also breathing too hard to hear the boys descending footsteps on the stairsher breaths catching on short chokedback sobs tears bathed her face she was sweating her black tank top had become untucked from her powderblue gym shorts and her heavy lowslung breasts swayed as she rocked back and forth on her left foot which krung called the pivot foother strenuously maintained point of balance mrs machado must have seen jacks partial reflection in the glass door of the grandfather clocka halfnaked man her height or a little taller sneaking up on her from behind jack was still two or three steps upstairs from the front hall when she saw him which is why mrs machado misjudged his height and maybe it was just like her exhusband to take off most of his clothes before he attacked her the sharp squeak of her pivot foot froze jack on the stairs her highgroin kick would have made mr bangkok proudnotwithstanding krungs purist disapproval of such kicks because jack was standing on the stairs mrs machados aim was a little lower than he expected her fullcontact kick caught him in the balls ha she cried jack crumpled like a pair of boxer shorts with no one inside them he lay curled in a fetal position in the front hall his testicles which he imagined were suddenly the size of grapefruits felt as if they had risen to the back of his throat oh oh oh mrs machado was crying still hopping on one foot jack wanted to die or at least throw up but neither option for relief was forthcoming i am coming queeckly to the rescue with ice lots of ice mrs machado was calling from the kitchen she then helped him to his feet and half carried him up the stairs a plastic bag full of ice cubes dangled from her mouth jack jackmy poor dahleen jack mrs machado managed to say through her clenched teeth she spread a bath towel on his bed and made him take off his boxers having shown the little guy to emma and her friends jack was more anxious about the ice than he was embarrassed however mrs machado seemed agitated by how small his penis was maybe shed had daughters or if shed had sons perhaps it was long ago when theyd been little boys maybe mrs machado had forgotten the ridiculous size of their balls and penises ees eet smaller she asked in alarm smaller than what smaller than eet was before i keecked you jack quickly took a look himself but everything appeared to be the same his balls ached his penis throbbed and the little guy might have been shrinking at the thought of the ice which mrs machado packed around jacks balls and penis as he lay on his back on the towel its cold it hurts more he told her eet will hurt more for just a few meenutes jack oh how long do you ice it feefteen meenutes that seemed long enough to freeze a penis jack was thinking have you ever iced a penis before he asked mrs machado not thees way she answered his penis was so cold that jack started to cry mrs machado lay down beside him and rocked him in her arms she sang a portuguese song in ten minutes jack was still shivering but his teeth had stopped chattering to make the boy warmer mrs machado stretched out on top of him her breasts felt like a sofa cushion wedged between them i can feel the ice too you know mrs machado told him after a minute or two eets not so bad the pain had subsided his balls were numb and he couldnt feel his penis at all after fifteen minutes mrs machado removed the bag of ice jack was afraid to look at himself in case he had disappeared he listened to mrs machado pouring the ice water and the remaining cubes into the bathroom sink she came back to the bed and sat beside him eets very red she observed i have no feeling i think it died jack told her she gently patted the little guy with the towel i theenk eet will come back to life mrs machado said holding the towel against his penis jack could feel the heat of her hand through the towel she sat in profile to him her coarse glossy black hair was pulled back from her face in an unruly ponytailher fighting hairdo mrs machado called it jack could see that the skin under her chin and on her throat was loose and sagging and her breasts drooped to her thick waist she had never been pretty but when youre ten years old and a woman is holding your penis nothing else matters ha mrs machado said removing the towel meester penis has come back to life with beeg plans the little guy was unused to being treated with such respect mister penis was more familiar with expressions of disappointmenteven disparagement and reproach clearly flattered by mrs machados attention the little guy had more than recovered from the highgroin kick jacks penis rose to the occasion with the stiffening determination of a war hero my goodness meester penis mrs machado exclaimed are you just showing off or ees there something you want of course there is always something penises wantnot that jack at age ten could articulate exactly what his penis wanted but mrs machado must have been a mind reader what ees meester penis theenking she asked the little guy i dont know mrs machado jack answered truthfully when the back of his hand brushed her hip the contact was incidentalbut it was no accident that mrs machado pressed her hip against him pinning jacks hand to his side she reached behind her head and undid her ponytail in one quick motion her hair hiding her face as she leaned over his penis the little guy could feel her breath i theenk i know what meester penis wants mrs machado said jack felt the weight of her breasts on his stomach as she slid his penis into her mouth looking back jack would concede that mister penis had been a bit reckless ever since the corresponding movement of jacks hips was involuntary but his excitement wasnt entirely pleasurable the boy was afraid that mrs machado might swallow him whats happening he asked her perhaps chenko had been wrong to assume that mrs machado wasnt very agile because she shifted her weight and changed her position so suddenly that jack was unable to respond with any movement of his own surely mrs machado was not a magician but jack didnt see her take off her tank top or her braand how she managed to remove her powderblue gym shorts and her panties would remain a mystery to him he got only a glimpse of the huge hairy place between her legsthat is huge in comparison to his earlier sightings of mrs oastlers and emmas places of business and if his mothers tattoo of a rose of jericho was artistically consistentthat is the flower within the rose was always the samejack realized at the moment mrs machado mounted him how the real thing was remarkably different in each case on the irrefutable evidence of these formative examples it would be jack burnss unfortunate fate to believe that every vagina was unique when mrs machado straddled him holding his hips between her thighs he asked again but more urgently whats happening jack would have been more frightened when she guided the little guy inside her had he not been so familiar with those intricate folds of the flower hidden in a rose of jericho at least he knew where he was going the boys remaining fear was that all of him would somehow slip inside mrs machadohe felt that small his hips still suffered the involuntary urge to move but he couldnt move with mrs machados weight on him a rivulet of sweat ran between her breasts which surrounded his face what ees happening my dahleen jack ees that meester penis ees going to cry cry how he managed to ask although his voice was muffled between her breasts tears of joy leetle one mrs machado said jack was familiar with the expression but its application to his penis was alarming i dont want mister penis to cry he said eet ees happening any meenute dahleen dont be afraideet wont hurt but jack was afraid hadnt chenko warned him about ending up underneath her im scared mrs machado he cried eets almost feeneeshed jack he felt something leave him if he had tried to describe the feeling to the gray ghost she would have told him that hed lost his soul something momentous had departed but its departure went almost unnoticedlike childhood jack would imagine for years that this was the moment he turned his back on godwithout meaning to maybe god had slipped away when jack wasnt looking what was that he asked mrs machado who had stopped grinding against him tears of joy eets your first time i theenk not his first time in fact the first time jacks tears of joy had hit penny hamilton in the forehead its my second time the boy told mrs machado but the first time i forgot to breathe this time was better ha mrs machado cried you cant keed me dahleen he didnt try to persuade her when a hundredandfiftypound woman is sitting on you and you weigh only seventyfive pounds you dont argue besides jack was fascinated to watch mrs machado dress herself she did such a leisurely job of it especially when you consider how quickly she had undressed mrs machado continued to sit on him while she put on her bra and tank top finally she had to get off him when she put on her panties and the powderblue gym shorts there was a wet spot on the bed which mrs machado wiped away with the towel she put the towel in the laundry hamper and filled the bathtub only half full instructing jack to wash himselfmister penis in particular jack was aware of a strong unfamiliar smell which went away in the bath what was strange about the smell was that he couldnt decide if he liked it the wet spot was still damp when jack got back in bed but mrs machado had fetched a pair of clean boxers which she told him to put on he lay downnot on the wet spot but near enough to it that he could touch it with his hand the spot was cold and jack felt a chillas if he were kneeling on the stone floor of the chapel with his back turned to god or maybe one of those women attending to jesus in the stained glass above the altar had slipped into bed with him he knew that the stainedglass woman was a saint because she was invisible mrs machado couldnt see her but jack could feel the coldness coming off her unseen body which was as hard as the stone floor of the chapel and as forbidden to touch as the stained glass above the altar where she had come from dont go he whispered to mrs machado eets time to sleep my dahleen please dont go the boy begged her jack was somehow sure that the stainedglass saint was waiting for mrs machado to leave he didnt know what plans the saint had for him he touched the cold damp spot in the bed again but he didnt dare reach beyond it not knowing what he might feel tomorrow well wrestle like crazy mrs machado was saying no more keecking just wrestling im afraid jack told her does eet hurt dahleen does what hurt meester penis no but it feels different he said eet ees different meester penis has a secret what secret what happened to meester penis is our secret dahleen oh had he agreed to share mrs machados secret he felt the saint slip away or maybe it was jack himself who slipped away had the saint turned back into stained glass or was it jacks childhood he felt slip away boa noite mrs machado whispered in portuguese what good night leetle one good night mrs machado from the bedroom doorway she was backlit by the light at the far end of the guestwing hall seeing her squat thick silhouette made jack remember chenkos observation of mrs machados stance as a wrestlernamely that she stood like a bear on its hind legs as if mrs machado might have felt more at home on all fours from the hall as if to remind him of their secret mrs machado whispered one more time boa noite meester penis jack didnt sleep well he had dreams of course was he worried that the stainedglass saint would slip back into his bed while he sleptor more worried that she had turned her back on him as he feared he had turned his back on god jack was aware that his mother and mrs oastler had come home not because he woke up when his mom came into his bedroom and kissed himat least his mom said she came into his room and kissed him every nightbut because the lights in the hall had changed no longer was there a light on at the far end of the corridor but the door to his mothers room was ajar and the light from her bathroom glowed dimly in the hall the light in jacks bathroom was also on and it cast a thin bright line of light under the door jack was aware of his wet dream too because the cold damp area of his bed had driedbut near it was a wetter spot still warm where the little guy had shed a few more tears of joy maybe hed been dreaming about mrs machado he wondered if he would tell emma about his wet dream which emma had anticipated for so long jack burns wondered if he would ever tell anyone about mrs machado he got out of bed and crossed the hall to his mothers room but his mom wasnt there her bed wasnt even turned down jack went looking for his mother in the dark mansion mrs machado must have gone home because the downstairs lights were off the boy wandered from the guest wing into the hallway that led past emmas empty bedroom there was a flickering light it came from under leslie oastlers bedroom door maybe mrs oastler and his mom were watching television jack was thinking he knocked on the door but they didnt hear him or maybe he forgot to knock and just opened the door the tv was offit was a candle on the night table that was flickering he thought at first that mrs oastler was dead her body was arched as if her spine were broken and her head was hanging off the side of the bed so that her face was turned toward jackbut her face was upside down the boy could tell that she didnt see him she was naked and her eyes were wide and staring as if the dim light from the hall had made jack invisibleor else he was the one who was dead and mrs oastler was looking right through him maybe hed died during his wet dream jack imagined it would not have surprised him to learn that the experience with mrs machado had killed himnot just the highgroin kick but all the rest of it alice sat up suddenly and covered her breasts with both hands she was naked too but jack had not seen her in the bed until she moved she sat boltupright with leslie oastlers legs wrapped around her mrs oastler hadnt moved but jack saw that her eyes had regained their focus he was greatly relieved that she saw him i didnt die but i had a dream jack told them go back to your room jackill be right there his mom told him alice was looking for her nightgown which she found tangled in the sheets at the foot of the bed leslie oastler just lay there naked staring at jack in the candlelight the rosered rosepink petals of her rose of jericho looked like two shades of blackblack and blacker jack was in the hall going back to his room when he heard mrs oastler say you shouldnt still be sleeping in the same bed with him alicehes too old i only do it when hes had a bad dream alice told her you do it whenever jack wants to do it mrs oastler said im sorry leslie jack heard his mother say the boy lay in his bed not knowing quite what he should do or say about the wet spot maybe nothing but when his mother got into bed with him it didnt take her long to discover it oh it was that kind of dream she said as if this hardly counted as a nightmare its not blood its not pee the boy elaborated of course it isnt jackits semen jack was thoroughly confused he failed to see how a wet dream could have anything to do with sailors i didnt mean to do it he explained i dont even remember doing it its not your fault jackiea boys wet dreams just happen oh he wanted her to hold him he wanted to snuggle against her the way he used to snuggle against her after bad dreams when he was smaller but when he tried to get closer to her he unintentionally touched her breasts and she pushed him away i think youre too old to be in bed with me she said im not too old jack told her how could he go from being not old enough to being too old in such a hurry he felt like crying but he didnt his mom must have sensed it dont cry jackyoure almost too old to cry she said when you go away to school you cant cry if you cry the boys will tease you why am i going away to school he asked her its better for everyone his mother said under the circumstances its just better what circumstances its just better she repeated its not better for me jack cried she put her arms around him and let him snuggle against her it was the way he used to fall asleep when he was four and they were in europe jack should have told his mom about mrs machado if hed told his mother about mrs machado maybe alice would have realized that he was still not old enoughthat there was nothing too old about him but jack didnt tell her he fell asleep in her arms like the old daysor almost like the old days something about her smell was different his mothers face had a funny odor jack realized it was the same strong smell he had noticed in his bath maybe the odor had come from mrs machado as before it was strange not knowing if he liked the smell even in his sleep the smell persisted how long had leslie oastler been there in jacks bedroom with them just sitting on alices side of the bed when jack woke up and saw her he didnt know at first that it was mrs oastler jack thought it was the stainedglass saint shed come back to claim him maybe that was how a woman saint took possession of you by taking all her clothes off first leslie oastler was naked and she was rubbing alice on that spot between her shoulder blades where boris had a tattoo of the chinese character for luck and pavel had a tattoo of a tenaculum jack must have woken up only a split second before his mom did you should put some clothes on leslie alice was saying i had a dream mrs oastler replied a bad one go back to your room leslieill be right there alice said jack watched mrs oastler leave his room she was awfully proud of her body the boy thought his mother kissed him on the forehead there was that smell again he shut his eyes still trying to decide if he liked it his mom kissed him on his eyelids it was a hard smell to like nevertheless he thought he liked it im sorry jack his mom said he kept his eyes closed and listened to her bare feet padding down the hall after leslie oastler he couldnt wait for emma to get back from the fat farm in california surely emma would help him understand these new and troubling circumstancesto use his mothers word for her relationship with mrs oastler with mrs machado as his regular workout partner jacks wrestling noticeably improvedalthough not as noticeably as hers she was a feisty competitoreven chenko was impressedand she was twice his weight an advantage he couldnt overcome jack still managed to hold her down with a crossbody ride but he had trouble taking her down in the first place she controlled their tieups on the feet to the degree that he couldnt anklepick her anymore an armdrag to an outside singleleg was the only offensive takedown he occasionally got on her and mrs machado was impossible to pin unless he caught her in a crossface cradle she was just too strong for him especially in the area of hand control but jack knew he was getting better mrs machado knew it too and she encouraged him two thirds of the points they scored were hers but she was the one who needed to rest he wasnt the one who got tired wrestling was a weightclass sport chenko kept reminding him if or when he ever got the opportunity to wrestle a kid his own size both boris and pavel agreed that jack would pound him but there was no one jacks size in his life at least not for the remainder of that summer when emma came home from the fat farm shed lost ten poundsbut neither her disposition nor her eating habits had improved they just fucking starved me was how she put it emma still outweighed mrs machado whom emma briefly replaced as jacks nanny emma was in toronto less than a week before she had to leave for her fathers cottage in georgian bay for all of july still in the few nights they were alone together jack could have told emma about mrs machado he didnt it was upsetting enough that he told her about her mom and his about discovering them in bed together what upset jack most was that emma was unsurprised well ive seen them do everything but lick each other she said with disgust its no wonder theyre sending you to fucking maine and making me a goddamn boarder lick what forget it jack theyre lovers okay they like each other in the way girls usually like boys and vice versa oh i dont care what theyre doing emma cried what pisses me off baby cakes is that they wont talk to us about it theyre just getting rid of us instead jack decided that he had a right to be pissed off about the issue of not talking about it too it seemed a further injustice that there were photographs of emma and jack often together all over the oastler house surely these pictures were evidence that they were a family that emma and jack belonged thereyet they were being sent away and if jacks mother wouldnt talk to him about her lover why should he tell his mom about mrs machado it was emma he should have talked to about mrs machadothat is sooner than he did but before jack knew it it was july emma was off in georgian bay and mrs machado was once again his sparringpartner nanny friends for life if what mrs machado did to jack qualified as abuse why didnt he feel abused at the time it wouldnt be long before jack had other relationships that he knew were sexual the things he did and the things that were done to him only then registered as experiences hed previously had with mrs machado but at the time it was happening he had no frame of reference to understand how inappropriate she was with him she sometimes physically hurt him but never intentionally and he was repulsed by her but many timeson occasion simultaneously to being repulsedjack was also attracted to her he was often frightened too or at least jack didnt understand what she was doing to him and whyor what she wanted him to do to her and how he was supposed to do it one thing was certain she cared for him he felt it at the time no later reconstruction of his pliable memory could convince jack that she didnt in her heart adore him in fact however confusingly mrs machado made him feel lovedat a time when his mother was sending him to maine interestingly it was only when jack asked mrs machado about her children that she was ever shorttempered with him he presumed that they had simply grown upthat this was why theyd moved awaybut it was a sore point with her it was mrs machados fondest hope or so she said that mister penis would never be taken advantage of but by whom by willful girls and venal women jack was an adult when he saw his first psychiatrist who told him that many women who sexually molest children believe that they are protecting themthat what the rest of us might call abuse is for these women a form of mothering too weird as a girl jack hadnt yet met would say what he noticed most of all at the time was that he changed overnight from someone who could keep nothing from his mother to someone who was determined to keep everything from her even more than he submitted to having sex with mrs machado he absolutely embraced the secrecy of itmost of all the idea of keeping mrs machado a secret from his mom alice was so involved with leslie oastler which was a parallel pursuit to alice distancing herself from jack that the boy could have kept anything a secret from her that mrs machado was obsessed with doing the laundrynot only jacks sheets and towels and underwear and his workout clothes but also alices and mrs oastlers laundrywas nothing alice or leslie appeared to notice if hed gotten mrs machado pregnantif he actually could haveits doubtful that alice or mrs oastler would have noticed that when emma came home from georgian bay in augustwith her body all tanned and the dark hair on her arms bleached blond by the sunemma noticed that something had changed in him and not only because her mom and jacks were lovers whats wrong with you baby cakes emma asked whats with all the wrestling anyone would think you were fucking mrs machado in retrospect jack would wonder why chenkoor boris or paveldidnt suspect something they certainly observed that many of the women in krungs kickboxing classes were inordinately interested in watching him wrestle with mrs machado and after emma returned from georgian bay she once again became jacks nighttime nanny surely chenko and boris and pavel were aware that he regularly left the gym in mrs machados companyfor an hour or two almost every day in either the late morning or the early afternoon thees ees a growing boy and eets august in the ceety he needs to breathe some fresh air mrs machado announced they went to her apartment which was within walking distance on st claira dirty darkbrown building in which mrs machado barely maintained a sparsely furnished walkup on the third floor there was a partial view of the ravine that ran behind sir winston churchill park and the st clair reservoir and in the buildings small courtyard where the grass had died were an unused jungle gym and swing set and slideas if all the children in mrs machados apartment building had grown up and moved away and no more children had been born to replace them the air was no fresher in mrs machados small apartment than in the bathurst street gym and jack was struck by the absence of family photographs well it was no surprise that pictures of mrs machados exhusband were absentbecause he was alleged to assault her periodically why would she want a picture of him but of her two children there were only two photographsshe had one photo of each boy in the photographs they were both about jacks age although mrs machado said they were born four years apart and they were all grown up now she wouldnt tell jack their present agesas if the numbers themselves were unlucky or she was simply too upset to acknowledge that they were no longer children it was a onebedroom apartment to be kind with only a chest of drawers and a queensize mattress on the floor of the bedroom there was a combination kitchen and dining room with no living roomand not even a hutch or sideboard for dishes there was little evidence of kitchenware which suggested to jack that mrs machado if she ate at all ate out as to how she might have fed her family when shed had a family he had no clue there wasnt even a diningroom table or chairs and there was only one stool at the strikingly uncluttered kitchen counter it looked less like an apartment where mrs machados children had grown up than a place where mrs machado had just recently moved in but they came there only for the purpose of having sex and to have a quick shower jack didnt think to ask her where her children had slept or why she still called herself mrs machado or why the nameplate by the buzzer in the foyer of the building said m machadoas if the mrs were or had permanently become her first name given her exhusbands reported hostility why was she still a mrs at all it was these trysts in her apartment in the lessthanfresh air of august that finally took their toll on jacknot the wrestling he was tired all the time chenko was concerned that he had lost five poundshis mothers response was that jack should drink more milkand his wet dreams which had started that summer suddenly stopped how could he have wet dreams when he was getting laid almost every day jack had other dreams insteadbad ones as leslie oastler might have said moreover he had taken it to heart when his mom told him he was too old to be in bed with her he knew he wasnt welcome to crawl into bed with his mother and mrs oastler and if he couldalbeit only occasionallypersuade his mom to get into his bed with him she wouldnt stay long jack knew that leslie would come and take her away their family dinners which emma spoke of with mounting scorn were an exercise in awkwardness alice couldnt cook mrs oastler didnt like to eat and emma had put back on the weight shed lost in california what did you expect would happen to me in georgian bay emma asked her mom does anyone lose weight eating barbecue for dinner they usually went to a thai place or ordered takeout as emma put it in my mind it always comes down to thai or pizza for gods sake emma mrs oastler would say just have a salad it was over one such gastronomical eventtakeout pizza and saladthat alice and leslie discussed the dilemma of delivering jack to his new school in maine it seemed he had no certain means of getting there nor was it an easy place to get to the boy would fly to boston and take a smaller plane to portland from portland one had to rent a car and drive and alice wasnt a driver mrs oastler could drive but she was ill disposed to go to maine if redding were on the coast id consider it leslie said but redding which was the name of the town and the allboys school was in southwestern maineinland maine not coastal maine there was jack would learn a difference for christs sake ive got my drivers licensei can take him emma said but emma at seventeen was too young to be permitted to rent a car in portlandand even emma agreed that redding was far too long a drive from toronto emma was reading a maine road map in lieu of eating her salad redding is north of welchville she said its south of rumford east of bethel west of livermore falls god it really is nowhere we could hire peewee to go with him and be the driver mrs oastler proposed peewee is a canadian citizen but he was born in jamaica alice pointed out were the americans touchy about foreignborn canadians seeking entry into the united states boris and pavel could drive me jack suggested theyre taxi drivers they were also wrestlers he was thinking he knew he would be safe with them but boris and pavel were not yet canadian citizens they had only recently applied for refugee status chenko couldnt drive a car and krung who drove wildly was a scarylooking thai with chevronshaped blades tattooed on his cheeks given that the war in vietnam had ended only a few years before leslie oastler and alice didnt think that us customs would look welcomingly upon mr bangkok maybe mrs mcquat would take me jack suggested his mother stiffened as if shed been slapped one shouldnt bother teachers in the summer mrs oastler saidmysteriously it seemed to jack he sensed that his mom had other reasons for not considering the gray ghost maybe mrs mcquat had made clear her disapproval of his mothers plans to send jack away miss wurtz jack knew spent part of her summer in edmontonnot that he relished the prospect of the wurtz delivering him to redding the very journey itself would be dramatized of that he had little doubt what about mrs machado alice asked only emma noticed that this caused jack to lose his appetite i doubt she can drive leslie oastler said dismissively that woman is so stupidshe cant put the laundry back in the right drawers dont you like the pizza honey pie jack please finish your milkeven if youre full you have to stop losing weight alice said if you dont want the rest of that pizza ill eat it emma said what about that little faggot your drama teacher mrs oastler asked jack whats his name mr ramsey emma answered hes nicehes a good guy dont call him a faggot he is one dear emmas mom told her im sure hes entirely safe leslie said to alice if hed so much as touched a boy at st hildas someone would have blown the whistle on him what about not bothering teachers in the summer jack asked mr ramsey wouldnt mind mrs oastler said he obviously worships the ground you walk on jack well i dont know alice began you dont know what alice leslie oastler asked its just that he is a homosexual alice replied its not guys who are inclined to mess around with jack emma observed i like mr ramseyhe would be fine jack said if he can see over the steering wheel baby cakes i guess it wouldnt do any harm to ask him alice said maybe mr ramsey wants a tattoo hes a teacher alicehe makes no money leslie told her mr ramsey doesnt need a free tattoo he needs money well alice said when alice and mrs oastler went out to a movie emma was left to do the dishes and put jack to bed emma ate the remaining pizza off everyones plate jack understood why she was hungryshe hadnt touched her salad put on some music honey pie emma liked to sing when she was eating she did her best bob dylan imitation with her mouth full jack put on the album called another side of bob dylanloud the way emma liked itand went upstairs to get ready for bed even with the water running in the bathroom sink when he was brushing his teeth he could hear emma singing along with motorpsycho nightmare it must have put him in a mood when jack undressed he had a look at his penis which was a little red and sorelooking he thought of putting some moisturizer on it but he was afraid the moisturizer would sting he put on a clean pair of summer pajamashis boxer shortsand lay in bed waiting for emma to come kiss him good night jack was thinking that he missed saying prayers with lottie the only prayer he sometimes said by himself was the one he used to say with his mom who had stopped saying prayers with himanother feature of his being too old apparently besides that familiar scottish prayer seemed inappropriategiven his new life with mrs machado the day thou gavest lord is ended thank you for it most nights jack didnt feel like thanking anyone for the day hed had as for lottie shed sent the boy a postcard from prince edward island from the look of the fir trees the gray rocks the darkblue ocean you wouldnt know that anything was wrong no no no it aint me babe emma was singing it aint me youre lookin for babe jack was obsessing about mr ramsey taking him to maine which also put him in a mood he was feeling sorry for himself which is fertile territory for bad dreams the bob dylan album was still playing when he fell asleep he imagined that his mother and mrs oastler had returned from the movie before emma had come upstairs to kiss him good night he was lying there wondering if his mom or emma would kiss him good night first but of course it was a dreamhe was only dreaming that he was lying in bed awake bob dylan was still wailing away or he was wailing away in jacks dream perhaps its the color of the sun cut flatan covrin the crossroads im standing at emma sang along with bob or maybe its the weather or something like thatbut mama you been on my mind there was an understatement someone came into jacks bedroom he opened his eyes to see if it was emma or his mother but it was leslie oastler and she was naked she pulled back the covers and got into bed with him given how small she was there was more room in the bed for her than there ever had been for mrs machadoand mrs oastler smelled better she made a sound in the back of her throat a kind of growlas if she were feral or as if she might bite her long painted nails scratched jacks chest her nails skittered over his stomach her small fast hand shot inside his boxers one of her nails nicked his penis she just happened to scratch him on a spot where the little guy was sore jack must have flinched whats wrongyou dont like me leslie whispered in his ear her small hand closed around his penis he was paralyzed in mrs oastlers clinging embrace no i like youits just that my penis hurts jack tried to say but the words wouldnt come in dreams he was always tonguetiedhe could never speak jack could feel the little guy getting bigger in leslies hand mrs oastlers hand is no bigger than my own he was thinking while the music played it dont even matter to me where youre wakin up tomorrow emma was singing but mama youre just on my mind where mister penis is going it wont hurt anymore mrs oastler whispered in jacks ear but how did leslie know about mister penis the boy wonderedand how did she know his penis hurt when he couldnt even talk what did you say jack tried to ask her but he couldnt hear his own wordsonly mrs oastler repeating herself her voice had changed it was definitely leslie oastlers hard thin body that was grinding against jacks but her voice was mrs machados voiceor a perfect imitation where meester penis ees going eet wont hurt anymore jack was surprised she didnt call him dahleen please dont my penis really hurts please stop jack kept trying to say but if he couldnt hear himself how could mrs oastler hear him he knew it was pointless to think that his mother might hear him or that she would come save him if she did if bob dylan ever stopped singing maybe emma would hear him and come to his rescue jack was thinking he couldnt hear the music anymore but this didnt necessarily mean that bob had shut up the way leslie oastler was breathing in his ear jack couldnt have heard bob dylan if bob had been singing his brains out in the bedroom youre forgetting to breathe again baby cakes jack distinctly heard emma say hed thought it was mrs oastler who was kissing him but it was emma you can keep kissing me but you gotta breathe too i was dreaming he told her youre telling me you were pulling your pecker off honey pieim not surprised it hurts oh better show me the little guy jack emma said lets see whats the matter nothings the matter he told her he was ashamed to let her see the damage jack its me for christs sake im not going to hurt you both the bathroom light and the lamp on the night table were on emma took a good look at mister penis its kind of sorelookingits all chafed she said its what jesus jack youve rubbed yourself raw you gotta leave it alone for a night or two when did this start i havent been rubbing it he told her dont bullshit me baby cakes youve been whacking off so much that the little guy looks positively abused whats whacking off you clearly know what it is jack youve been masturbating what youve been giving yourself a hand job jack i didnt do it to myself he said jack you were doing it to yourself in your dream that was when jack started to cry he wanted emma to believe him but he didnt know how to tell her dont cry honey pie well make it all better how well put some moisturizer on it or something dont worry jack this is what boys dothey beat off i was wrong to think you were too young to be doing it im not doing it jack insisted he had to shout because shed gone across the hall into his mothers bathroom she came back with some moisturizer will it sting he asked her not this kindonly the kind with stuff in it stings what stuff chemicals emma said perfume unnatural shit other stuff she was rubbing the lotion on his penis it didnt hurt but he couldnt stop crying you gotta get hold of yourself honey pie beating off is no big deal im not beating off its mrs machado he told her emma let go of the little guy in a hurry mrs machado is touching you jack she does lots of things jack said she puts mister penis inside her mister penis mrs machado says meester he told emma she puts you inside her where baby cakes in her mouth emma asked before he could answer her in her mouth too he said jack what mrs machado is doing is a crime a what its wrong honey pie i dont mean youyou havent done anything wrong but she has please dont tell my mom the boy said emma put her arms around jack and hugged him honey pie she whispered we have to stop mrs machado from doing this we have to stop her you can stop her jack suggested i bet you could stop her yes i bet i could emma said darkly dont go he begged her he held her as tightly as he could he knew she could hold him much tighter but emma went on holding him as before she rubbed his back between his shoulders and she kissed his eyelids which were still wet from crying and she kissed his ears ive got you baby cakes you just go to sleep jack im not going anywhere he fell into one of those dreamless sleeps so deep he almost didnt wake up for the argument he had a nightmare for christs sake jack heard emma saying i was just holding him until he went to sleep i fell asleep too what do you think i was doing fucking him with all my clothes on you shouldnt be in bed with jack emma mrs oastler was saying you were under the covers not to put too fine a point on it i think its all right i think jack is fine alice was saying oh you think hes fine well im so fucking relieved to hear that emma shouted dont you use that tone of voice with alice emma mrs oastler said jack are you awake emma asked i guess so he said you have any bad dreams you just let me know emma told him you know where to find me thank you jack called after her as she was leaving emma mrs oastler started to say let her go leslie alice said i can tell that nothing happened are you sure youre okay jack leslie asked sure im sure im okay he told her jack looked at his mom as if she were his audience of one although he knew that she wasnt nothing at all has happened he told her miss wurtz would have approved of the boys enunciation to jacks surprise the lie was as simple to say as any line hed ever delivered for the first time lying to his mother was actually easy to do jack could hear mrs oastler going down the hall he heard the door to emmas room slam shut long before leslie got there he knew that his mom and mrs oastler had made emma madder than they made him which was pretty madall things considered jack smiled when his mother kissed him good night he knew which of his smiles his mom liked best and he gave it to her he was tired and upset but somehow he knew he would have a good nights sleep mrs machado would meet her match in emma oastlerof that jack had no doubt the following morning emma woke jack before her mom was up jacks mother was never up in the morning mrs oastler always drove him to the bathurst street gym the boy usually got up and fixed himself a bowl of cereal or a piece of toast and he drank a glass of milk and a glass of orange juiceby which time leslie had come downstairs and made herself some coffee mrs oastler was friendly to jack in the mornings but she wasnt talkative she smoothed the boys hair or patted the back of his neck with her hand and she made him a sandwich for his lunch which also included an apple and some cookiesespecially if leslie wanted to keep the cookies away from emma but on this midaugust morning jack woke up with the ceiling fan going full speed he saw emma stuffing a pair of her shorts and socks and a tshirt into his gym bag where he carried his wrestling gear were getting to the gym early today baby cakes im your new workout partner from now on but i want to go over some moves with wolfhead before we start with chenko jack asked her yeah with wolfhead emma said but why do we have to be early he asked because im a big girl honey pie big girls gotta warm up oh there was already a note on the kitchen table when they padded downstairs in their bare feetthey were trying to be as quiet as they could emma must have written the note the night before im taking jack to the gym or a message to that effect emma and jack walked to forest hill village and had breakfast in a coffee shop on spadina he had a scone with raisins in it and his usual glass of milk and glass of orange juice emma just had coffee and a big bite of jacks scone they cut over to st clair and he pointed out the dirty darkbrown apartment building where mrs machado lived he was a little afraid of how purposefully emma kept walking it wasnt like her to not say anything she seemed so angry that jack thought he should tell her a nice story about mrs machadosomething sympathetic to his shame he basically liked mrs machado he would recognize only later that this was part of the problem mrs machado has to keep changing the locks on her apartment door because her exhusband keeps breaking in jack told emma did you see the new locks emma asked now that jack thought about it he hadnt i cant remember seeing any he said maybe there arent any new locks baby cakes it wasnt the conversation hed had in mind they were at the bathurst street gym so early that krung hadnt yet arrived a couple of pretty good kickboxers were going at each other chenko was sitting on the rolledup wrestling mats drinking his coffee jackie boy he said when he saw emma did you bring your girlfriend im jacks new workout partner emma told him jacks too young to have a girlfriend chenko stood up to shake emmas hand the ukrainian was in his early sixtiesa little thick in the waist but the muscles in his chest and arms were welldefined slabs and he was very light on his feet for a man who weighed oneeighty or oneninety and was only five feet ten this is emma jack said to chenko who bowed his head to her when he shook her hand emma regarded the snarling wolf on chenkos bald pate as if it were a family pet jack had told her all about it you must be fiveeleven emma chenko said fiveelevenandahalf emma told him but im still growing emma and jack helped chenko roll out the mats before they went to their respective locker rooms to change into their workout gear emma didnt have any wrestling shoes just socks ill find you some wrestling shoes emma chenko said youll slip on the mat in those socks i dont slip a whole lot emma told him what does she weigh do you suppose chenko whispered to jackthe ukrainian was finding emma a pair of shoesbut emma heard him i weigh onesixtyfive on a good day she answered on a good day chenko repeated watching her put on the shoes maybe oneseventyfive today emma said youre a little out of jacks weight class emma chenko said ill start with you emma told chenko you look big enough well chenko started to say but emma was out on the mat she was already circling him i suppose you should start by telling me the rules emma said if there are any rules i guess i should know them there are some rules not many chenko began you cant poke your opponent in the eyes thats too bad emma said chenko started with a little hand fightingjust grabbing emmas wrists and controlling her handsbut she got the idea and peeled his fingers off her wrists grabbing his hands and wrists instead thats the way chenko said you seem to have a feeling for hand control you just have to remember to grab a whole fistful of fingers at a time at least three or four no grabbing a thumb or a pinkie by itself and bending it why not emma asked you can break someones finger that way chenko told her its illegal you have to grab a bunch of fingers theres no biting i suppose emma said she sounded disappointed no of course not chenko said and no pulling hair no grasping clothes and no choke holds chenko added show me a choke hold emma said he put her in a front headlock jerking her head down and holding the back of her neck against his chest with his forearm across her throat this is an illegal headlock chenko explained because i dont have your arm too he incorporated one of emmas arms in the headlock this kept chenkos forearm off her throat you headlock someone you have to take his arm too you cant wrap your arm around someones neck and just choke him thats too bad emma repeated chenko showed her a proper stance and a pretty basic kneepick he showed her an underhook and a doubleunderhook and how you get from a collar tieup into a front headlock with the arm chenko made a point of repeating he showed emma a lateral drop he even let her do a lateral drop on him jack could tell that chenko landed a little harder than he expected with all of emmas weight on him youve got good chenko started to say then he stopped he was pointing at the middle of her body hips emma said good hips yes chenko said your hips are the strongest part of your body i always thought so emma replied they were down on the matchenko was showing emma an armbarwhen jack noticed that mrs machado had come out on the mat in her workout gear she was just stretching but he could tell she had her eye on emma who ees the beeg girl dahleen mrs machado asked him jack was as tonguetied as he was in any dream he couldnt speak emma was still rolling around on the mat with chenko mrs machado is molesting jack emma told the ukrainian she made his little penis sore chenko had rolled into a sitting position he was staring at jack and mrs machado emma was already on her feet and walking toward them jack did you tell thees beeg girl our secret mrs machado asked it was no contest chenko would tell boris and pavel later emma poked mrs machado in the eyes in both her eyes mrs machado cried out in pain and covered her face with her hands emma grabbed the pinkie on mrs machados right hand and bent it back breaking it the finger stood up at a right angle from the back of her hand mrs machado screamed as if shed been stabbed emma slapped a collar tieup on mrs machado and snapped her neck forward putting her into an illegal front headlockwithout the arm emma dropped her weight on the back of mrs machados head with emmas forearm across her throat mrs machado couldnt breathe jack realized only then that krung was there the former mr bangkok may have noticed the wrestling because emma and mrs machado had rolled off the mat but emma hadnt let up with her choke hold mrs machado couldnt breathe but her legs were still thrashing whos the new girl krung asked chenko shes a fast learner isnt she chenko said emma had hit three illegal moves in under ten seconds it was hard to imagine a faster learner no wonder she wanted to know the rules arent you going to stop it krung asked the ukrainian in a minute chenko said mrs machado was flat on her belly her legs had almost stopped moving but one foot was feebly kicking she didnt have a highgroin kick left in her i guess this has gone far enough chenko said to jack he knelt beside the wrestlers and put a threequarter nelson on emma you cant believe how i had to crank on her to get her to let go of that headlock he would tell pavel and boris that afternoon when he introduced them to jacks new workout partner mrs machado never said a word by the time the defeated woman left the bathurst street gym which was as soon as she was able to stand up and walk her throat was so sore that she couldnt speak emma did the talking it may have been lost on mrs machado when emma called her not exactly mailorderbride material but she understood what emma meant when emma called herself jacks only workout partner however this registered with mrs machado both krung and chenko were suitably impressedalbeit a trifle afraid for the boy mr bangkok tried to interest emma in a kickboxing class but emma said she would stick to the wrestling i only like kicking something when its on the ground she told krung who ultimately looked relieved even grateful that emma was committed to the mat when pavel and boris came to the gym to wrestle that afternoon emma rolled around with them too jack needed a break by that time he had a mat burn on his cheek and a sore shoulderchenko had shown emma a firemans carry which she had a natural feeling forand jack was nursing his first cauliflower ear when emma saw that pavel and boris had cauliflower ears that were almost as bad as chenkos she insisted that jack get his cauliflower ear fixed it was news to jack that one could fix a cauliflower ear but although chenko and the minskies disapproved of draining cauliflower ears they knew how im sorry baby cakesthis may hurt but it would be criminal to let you grow up with ears like these poor guys youre gonna be too goodlooking to ruin your prospects for the future with dogturd ears jack could tell that chenko and pavel and boris were offended their cauliflower ears were badges of honor not dog turds but emma oastler had made jacks future her business and she was not to be denied a socalled cauliflower ear is caused by fluid when the ear gets rubbed on the mat or against your opponents face it bleeds and swells when the fluid hardens you have a lump where you used to have an indentation the trick is not to let the fluid harden you drain it with a needle and a syringe then you take some gauze dipped in wet plaster and press it into the contours of the ear when the plaster hardens your ear cant swellit cant keep filling with fluid the original shape of the ear is retained its a little uncomfortable chenko forewarned jack its better than a sore penis honey pie even the minskies agreed with emma about that so jack went home with a gauze plaster on one ear and a mat burn oozing on the opposite cheek look at your jackie alice leslie oastler said when they were eating takeout that night those thugs at the bathurst street gym are going to kill him its better than a sore penis jack said not to mention the language those russians are teaching him mrs oastler said jack ill ask you to watch your language his mother said the next night emma had a cauliflower ear jack and emma were pretty proud of their matching gauze plasters hed caught her in a crossface cradle and while he was grinding his right temple against her left ear she kicked out of the cradle and pinned him with a reverse half nelson you cant cradle someone whos built like her not if youre built like you chenko told jack true enough but jack knew that it was good for him to have a workout partner as tough as emma oastler the wrestling turned out to be good for emma too she lost eight pounds in a week jack knew that boris and pavel had impressed herif not their ears at least their diet the minskies were disciplinednot only their workouts but what they ate you could have saved your money by sending me to the bathurst street gym instead of the fucking fat farm emma told her mom ill ask you to watch your language too young lady mrs oastler said penis penis penis jack chanted that about covers it leslie oastler said go to your room jack his mom told him but jack didnt care he wanted to say youre making emma be a miserable boarder and youre sending me to fucking maine and you want us to watch our language instead he said penis penis penis all the way up the stairs thats really mature jack his mother called dont be angry with him alicehes just upset about going away to school jack heard leslie oastler say no shitthats fucking brilliant emma said go to your room emma mrs oastler told her enjoy washing the dishes emma said as she stomped upstairs emma was usually the dishwasher emma and jack were workout partners in more ways than one they had at last become true friendsin part because their mothers were separating them with each mat burn split lip black eye or cauliflower ear that they gave each other emma and jack thoroughly convinced alice and mrs oastler that the contact between themwhatever it waswasnt sexual jack could get up in the middle of the night and go to emmas room and get into bed with heror she could come to his room and get into bed with him their mothers said nothing the summer was almost over anyway what did alice and leslie oastler care if emma and jack beat each other up at the bathurst street gym all day not that jack ever beat up emma but he succeeded with a shot or two its just hormones in emmas case mrs oastler said in alices mind jack was still about the business of learning how to defend himself from boys in two weeks emma had lost twelve poundsand it was clear that she would lose more it wasnt just the workouts her eating habits had changed she liked chenko everything but his ears with the exception of their ears emma liked boris and pavel too when jack lay next to emma in her bed or when she held him in her arms in his it pained him to ask her who she was going to work out withhe meant after he had gone to maine oh i daresay ill find someone else i can beat the shit out of baby cakes jack had learned how to kiss her and keep breathing although the temptation to hold his breath until he fainted was strong and emmas attention to the little guy never wavered true to her word his penis had healed a combination of the moisturizer which emma continued to apply to the little guylong after jack could discern any visible need for itand the welcome cessation of mrs machados attention to his penis which evidently had been excessive do you miss her jack emma asked him one night he had been thinking that he missed some of the things mrs machado did but not that he missed her he felt awkward telling emma about the things he missed jack didnt want her to feel that he was ungrateful to her for saving him from mrs machado but they were true friends and workout partners emma understood him it sounds like you were excited but frightened emma said yes i shudder to think what kind of trouble the little guy can get into in maine emma said what do you mean emma they were in her room emma had a kingsize bed if you didnt count the stuffed animals jack was wearing just his boxers and emma was wearing a tshirt that pavel or boris had given her it was from a wrestling tournament in tbilisi but you had to be able to read georgian to know where it was from more to emmas liking the tshirt was faded and torn and it had old bloodstains on it take off your boxers honey pie emma was removing her tshirt under the covers which created a little chaos among the stuffed animals im going to show you how not to get in trouble jack she took his hand and placed it on his penis use your other hand if you prefer emma told him just do whatevers comfortable comfortable just beat off jack you can do that cant you beat what dont tell me this is your first time honey pie its my first time he admitted well take your timeyoull get the hang of it emma told him you can kiss me or touch me with your other hand just do something jackfor christs sake jack was trying at least he wasnt frightened i think my left hand works better he told her even though im righthanded its not as complicated as a russian armtie emma said we dont have to discuss it he hugged her as hard as he couldshe was so strong so solid when she kissed him jack remembered to breatheat least at the beginning i think its working he said try not to make a mess all over the place baby cakes emma said im just kidding she quickly added it was becoming difficult to kiss her and keep breathingnot to mention talk what exactly are we doing what is this he asked emma this is how you survive maine emma told him but you wont be there he cried you have to imagine me baby cakes or ill send you pictures oh that aurora borealisthose northern lights well if that isnt all over the place i dont know what is emma was saying while jack practiced breathing again just look at this mess i never want to hear you say i dont love you i love you emma the boy blurted out you dont have to make a commitment or anything emma said that youre my best friend is enough of a miracle im going to miss you jack cried shhh dont crytheyll hear you dont give them the satisfaction the what im going to miss you too honey pie she whispered she was putting her tshirt back onmore stuffed animals were getting out of her way in whatever way they couldwhen jack heard his mother in the hall emmas bedroom door was partially open was that you jackie his mom was calling no doubt hed been making unusual sounds both emma and jack knew he hadnt put his boxers back on he didnt even know where they were he hoped they were under the covers his head was on emmas shoulder one of her arms was thrown loosely around his neck the loosely made it not yet a headlock but there was no question that they were snuggled together under the covers when alice came into the room i had a dream jack told his mom i see she said theres more room for him to have a bad dream in my bed than in his emma told alice yes i see that there is alice replied it was that dream about the moat jack said you remember the littlest soldier yes of course alice said it was that one he told her i didnt know you still had that one his mother said all the time he lied more than usual lately i see his mom said well im sorry there were stuffed animals scattered everywhere as if thered been a massacre jack kept hoping his boxers werent lying among them alice started to leave emmas bedroom but she paused in the doorway to the hall and turned back to face them thank you for being such a good friend to jack emma alice said were gonna be friends for life alice emma told her well i hope so alice said good night you two she called softly as she went down the hall good night mom jack called after her good night emma called under the covers her hand found and held the little guy who appeared to have fallen asleep how quickly you forget emma whispered to his penis like old times jack thought as he was falling asleepwithout ascertaining very clearly what had been good about the aforementioned old times and what hadnt it was even a comfort to listen to emma snoring emma had shot a whole roll of photographs of jack with chenko in the bathurst street gym various angles of chenkos wolfhead tattoo jack sitting crosslegged on the wrestling mat beside the old ukrainian chenkos arm around jacks shoulders in what the boy thought of as a fatherly way jack lay listening to emma snoring just visualizing those photographs soon he would be in maine but he was no longer frightened as he drifted away jack believed there was nothing in maine that could scare him jack burns would miss those girls those socalled older women even the ones who had molested him sometimes especially the ones who had molested him he would miss mrs machado toomore than he ever admitted to emma oastler jack even missed the girls who never abused himamong them sandra stewart who had played the bilingual stutterer the vomiter the mailorder bride who gets fucked on a dog sled and wanders off and freezes to death in the snow in a histrionic blizzard how sick was it that he remembered her he would miss each one every major and minor character in his sea of girls those girlsthose women at the timehad made him strong they prepared jack burns for the terra firma and not so firma of the life ahead including his life with boys and men after the sea of girls what pushovers boys were after jacks olderwomen experiences how easy it would be to deal with men iii lucky frost heaves in those hectic last days before jack left for maine his mother devoted herself to sewing name tags on his new clothes mrs oastler had taken him shopping there were no school uniforms at redding no special colors but the boys wore jackets and ties and either khakis or woolflannel trousersnot jeans with leslie oastler choosing his clothes jack would be one of the bestdressed boys at the school alice should have talked to him she should have told jack everything but in lieu of conversation she sewed it made no sense to jack when he was four theyd spent the better part of a year searching those north sea ports for his runaway dad yet in jacks five years at st hildas alice rarely spoke of william at ten jack was increasingly curious about his father that william had been demonized made the boy afraid of himself and who he might become but his mom would not indulge jacks questions about his dad alice was rarely cruel to jack but she could be cold and nothing drew the coldness out of her as predictably as jack asking her about his father alice must have closed the door on that conversation a hundred times when youre old enough she would usually saya doorclosing line if the boy had ever heard one hed once spoken to mrs mcquat about it dont complain about a woman who knows how to keep a secret the gray ghost replied since emma had a list of grievances against her mother jack felt comfortable complaining to emma about his i just want to know what kind of guy he was for christs sake watch your language baby cakes emma and jack had both read the school philosophy handbook that redding sent to new students and their families socalled proper language was a big deal in the student code mr ramsey whod agreed to take jack to maine had eagerly read the school philosophy handbook too hed found the student code very challenging the day before jack and mr ramsey left for maine emma and jack got matching haircuts at a barbershop in forest hill village jacks wasnt so bad although it was shorter than the floppy mops most boys had for haircuts in but short hair on emma was arguably a mistake it wasnt a buzz cut but it was very much a boys haircut which left her neck exposed while shed continued to lose weight emmas neck had gotten noticeably biggerall those neckbridges three or four times a week with a flat twentyfivepound weight on her chest she had a neck like a linebacker and her short haircut served to exaggerate ones unfortunate first impression of her which was that emma oastler had no neck at all from behind she looked like a man jack got the first haircut and then stood beside emmas chair while the barber was cutting her hair your moms going to kill you for this jack told her how emma asked she had a pointemma could have snapped mrs oastler like a popsicle stick not even chenko was tough enough for her as the ukrainian would soon discover after jack went to maine chenko stepped in as emmas workout partner he was in good shape for a man his age and he had twentyfive or thirty pounds on herthis in addition to his considerable experience as a wrestler but jack knew you could get hurt when you were trying too hard not to hurt your opponent in wrestling it was not natural to hold back chenko caught emma leaning on him he was in position to hit her with a lateral drop but he hesitated afraid he might hurt her while he was waiting emma executed a perfect lateral drop on him emma separated chenkos sternum when she landed on his chest that was a slowhealing injury especially for someone in his sixties emmas only recourse was to work out with boris and pavel at least they were young enough to risk getting hurt in the barbershop mirror examining their matching haircuts jack could see in advance that st hildas had been crazy to admit emma as a boarder she had the wrong attitude for it not to mention her hulking shoulders and her seventeeninch neck an inch for every year of your age chenko had told her it would come as no surprise to jack that emma lasted only a year as a boarder at st hildas he was a little surprised she lasted that long to the schools great relief and with mrs oastlers reluctant consent emma moved back home and finished grades twelve and thirteen as a day student she would take over what had been the guest wing moving into alices old bedroom which was across the hall from jacks roomnot that he would get to use his room to any significant degree in the upcoming years alice of course abandoned all pretense and moved into leslie oastlers bedroom according to emma this happened within a week of jacks departure for maine emmas choice to occupy the guest wing was motivated less by her desire to sleep as far away from them as she could than by her irritation that neither her mom nor jacks ever talked about their relationship but talking about things was not alices style and mrs oastler had closed the door on too many conversations with emma to realistically expect her daughter to allow her to open that door again alice had closed the door on too many conversations with jack too when she was ready to talk whenever that might be jack had already decided he wouldnt listen in maine he heard more from emma than from his motherincluding the news about mrs machado shed been arrested in sir winston churchill park for sexually soliciting a minor a tenyearold boy it turned out that her own children had not grown up and moved away at ages eleven and fifteen they lived in another part of toronto with their father whod happily remarried there was a restraining order against mrs machado whod molested her fifteenyearold son when he was ten of course thered been no assaults against mrs machado by her exhusband no need for her to change the locks on her apartment door quite possibly the m in m machado didnt mean mrsat least not anymore and whoever she was her reasons for wanting to learn how to kickbox and wrestle would forever remain unclear alice made no mention to jack of this news although she probably knew about it emma said it was in all the newspapers with pictures and everything maybe alice never imagined that mrs machado might have molested jack more likely she didnt want to think about itor she felt secure in the fiction that had anything been wrong jack would have told her as emma said sarcastically yeah like if anything had been wrong with her she would have told you jack was not as faithful a correspondent to the gray ghost as she was to him mrs mcquat was a wise woman but emma was jacks principal advicegiver now how strange that the boys earlier misunderstanding of prostitutes as advicegivers was not that far off the mark emma was no prostitute but sex and advicegiving were seemingly interchangeable to her jack would also be intermittent in his correspondence with miss wurtz it was more than his mailorderbride role that linked him to mr ramsey the boys first trip to maine in mr ramseys company was so formative an experience that mr ramsey replaced the wurtz as jacks mentor in that allimportant area of the dramatic arts jack didnt stop dreaming of miss wurtz underwear and all but he had come to a crossroads in his life where listening to mr ramsey took center stage and made more sensethis despite the fact that there was often more theatricality than meaning in what mr ramsey had to say as an actor jack would be a hypocrite to love mr ramsey any the less for that as their plane touched down in portland mr ramsey clasped jacks hands in his jack burns he cried so loudly and suddenly that the boy thought the plane was crashing for better or worse you are in maine jack looked anxiously at the swiftly passing tarmac just remember jackno school with a motto like reddings can be all bad let me hear you say it say what your school motto jack had already forgotten it unlike mr ramsey the boy had spotted a militant heartiness in reddings school philosophy handbook the word character was repeated in every imaginable context decency is the norm the handbook had declared maybe that was the motto decency is the norm jack asked mr ramsey well of course it is he replied impatiently but thats not the motto jack burns with your remarkable capacity for memory im surprised at you jack could recall the bit in the handbook about interacting with his fellow students eschew the dwords the handbook had advised while he remembered this unusual command he had enough sense to know it wasnt the school mottothough it might have sufficed they were instructed not to treat their schoolmates in a dismissive or derogatory manner and at the heart of the student code was a character contract signed by every student saying that selfrespect was impossible without an abiding respect for others jack had signed his name but this didnt sound like motto material to him a hint jack its in latin as if that helped the air was clear but still summery in portlandnot as bracing as jack had expected maine to be though it soon would be the airport was as rudimentary as the tarmac labor omnia vincit mr ramsey called to a couple of passing pilots they clearly thought he was insane you havent heard a motto until youve heard jack burns say it he told a surprised stewardess an attractive woman in her thirties labor omnia vincit jack said with authorityputting more emphasis on the vincit tell her what it means jack mr ramsey said but the stewardess ignored him she had eyes only for jack here he was in a foreign countryin maine of all placesand while he couldnt remember his new schools motto or what it meant he could read the mind of a flight attendant she was recognizably olderwoman material to jack all the boy did was smile at her but he knew everything she was thinking its a good thing hes not traveling as an unaccompanied minor the stewardess told mr ramsey never taking her eyes off jack this is jack burns mr ramsey said to her hes got the memory of an elephant but not today labor omnia vincit jack repeated trying to remember the correct translation work mr ramsey started to say but jack cut him off the translation had come back to him work conquers all things the tenyearold told the flight attendant silly mei thought it was love that conquered everything she said no its work jack told her firmly the stewardess sighed ruffling the boys hair she kept looking at jack but she spoke to mr ramsey ill bet you cant count the hearts hes going to break she said it was still light as they drove northnorthwest to redding in the rental car theyd left the ocean behind them in portland after lewiston there wasnt a lot to see west minot was not memorable nor were east sumner and west sumneralthough the absence of a sumner proper got mr ramseys attention maine is not a state at the forefront of intelligently naming townsor so it would seem jack the surrounding wilderness in the approaching sunset was more than a little tinged with desolation earlier mr ramsey had led jack into a rousing conversation on the possible application of mrs wicksteeds benicetwice philosophy to those hostile students the boy might encounter at redding but not now the forlorn landscape prompted even as ebullient a fellow as mr ramsey to speak of the unmentionable jack i am tempted to say this looks like mailorderbride territory jacks heart sank mr ramsey tried to change the subject i would guesswouldnt you jackthat most of the students at redding are boarders i guess so the boy said redding was a private or socalled independent school grades five through eight while mrs oastler could afford jacks tuitionwithout batting an eye as alice had saidthe towns and notowns the lessthanvillages they drove through suggested to mr ramsey and jack that few local families could afford to send their boys to redding the school did offer scholarships though not more than fifteen or twenty percent of the students received any kind of financial aid redding was not generously endowed mr ramsey also shared with jack his betweenthelines interpretation of reddings school philosophy handbook he shrewdly noted the defensiveness or oversensitivity of the handbooks opening sentence first of all not all students who attend redding have problems naturally this suggested to mr ramsey that most or many of the students attending redding did have problems and he speculated out loud to jack about what these problems might be they come from troubled families i suppose or theyve been thrown out of other schools for what jack asked lets just say there arent a lot of boarding schools even in new england that admit students as young as fifth graders as boarders but i suspect that a boy like jack burns will flourish at such a place mr ramsey declared flourish at what lets just say that this is a school that values attitude over aptitude jack i believe it will be to your advantage that you have both jack burns had more attitude than aptitude and mr ramsey knew itbut the good man pressed ahead his enthusiasm on jacks behalf knew only one speed and direction fastforward and it strikes me that socalled characterbased education might be pursued with fewer distractions at a singlesex institutioni mean fewer distractions for a handsome lad like jack burns you mean no girls precisely jack dont even think about girls your objective is to be a hero among your fellow young menor failing that at least look like a hero why be a hero jack asked at an allboys school jack there are heroes and there are foot soldiers its happier to be one of the heroes emma had been right mr ramsey had some difficulty seeing over the steering wheel he was as short as mrs machado and twenty pounds lighter that hed made himself a hero at an allgirls school did not hide from jack the likelihood that mr ramsey had played the role of foot soldier in an earlier life his neatly trimmed spadeshaped beard was the size of a childs sandbox shovel his little feet in what jack guessed were sizesix loafers could barely reach the brake and accelerator pedals where will you spend the night jack asked the thought of mr ramsey driving back to portlandalone in the darkmade the boy afraid for him but mr ramsey was a brave soul his only fears were for jack if theres trouble jack gather a crowd if theres more than one bully go after the toughest one first just be sure you do it publicly why publicly if hes killing you maybe someone in the crowd will stop him oh never be afraid to take a beating jack at the very least its an acting opportunity i see thus they drove through southwestern maine the loneliness of the place was heartstopping when they were almost at the school mr ramsey pulled into a gas station jack was relieved to imagine him driving back to portland with a full tank it was the sort of rural gas station that sold groceriesmostly chips and soda cigarettes and beer a blind dog was panting near the cash register behind which a hefty woman sat on a stool even sitting down she was taller than mr ramsey being a wrestler had made jack an expert at guessing peoples weight this woman weighed over two hundred pounds for better or worse were on our way to redding mr ramsey informed her i could have told you that the big woman said we dont look like were from maine eh mr ramsey guessed the woman didnt smile seems a shame to send a boy away to school before hes even shaving she said nodding in jacks direction well mr ramsey replied there are many difficult circumstances that families find themselves in these days theres not always a choice theres always a choice the woman said stubbornly she reached under the cash register and brought out a handgun which she placed on the counter for example she continued i could blow my brains out hoping someone would find the dog in the morningnot that anyone would take care of a blind dog it might be better to shoot the dog first then blow my brains out what im saying is its never not complicatedbut theres always a choice i see mr ramsey said the big woman saw jack looking at the gun she put it away under the cash register its kind of early tonight to shoot anyone she said winking at the boy thank you for the gas mr ramsey said back in the car he remarked i forgot that everyone is armed in this country it would be cheaper and safer if they all took sleeping pills but i suppose you need a prescription for sleeping pills you dont need a prescription for a gun jack asked apparently not jack but what seems worse to me is that owning a gun must to some degree encourage you to use iteven if only to shoot a blind dog the poor dog jack pointed out listen to me mr ramsey said just as the redding campus rose out of the river mistthe redbrick buildings suggesting the austerity and correctional purpose of a prison which jack thought it might have been before it became a school redding actually had once been maines largest mental asylum a state facility that had lost its funding to the war effort in the forties that there were still bars on the dormitory windows was what gave the place the appearance of a penitentiary jack burns mr ramsey intoned if you ever feel like running away from this place think twice the environment into which you escape might be more hostile than the school itself and quite clearly the citizens have weapons i would be shot down like a blind dog is that what you mean the boy asked well said jack burns mr ramsey cried a most prescient view of the situation and spoken like a leading man jack bore scant resemblance to a leading man when he said a tearful goodbye to mr ramsey in the corridor of his dormitory mr ramsey wept as he bid the boy adieu jacks roommate was a pale longhaired jewish kid from the boston area noah rosen who was kind enough to distract jack from the urge to weep by expressing his considerable indignation that their room had no door only a curtain gave them some measure of privacy from passersby in the hall jack instantly shook noahs hand and expressed his indignation about the curtain too they were engaged in the overpolite exercise of offering each other the choice of the desk with a window view or the best bed which was obviously the one farther from the curtain and the traffic in the corridor when the curtain was flung open without warning and into their room stepped an aggressivelooking older boya seventh or eighth grader jack assumedand this rude fellow asked in a loud voice a question of such offensiveness and hostility that jack almost abandoned mrs wicksteeds benicetwice philosophy which of you faggots has the little fag for a father his name is tom abbott noah told jack i met him in the washroom half an hour ago and he called me a kike hi tom jack said holding out his hand my names jack burns im from toronto that was being nice once jack was thinking but he foresaw that the math could get confusing in a hurry even when he was an adult numbers would be his undoing was that little fag with the blond beard your father tom abbott asked jack actually no hes a friend of the family jack replied hes a former teacher of mine my drama coacha great guy jack turned to noah and said please help me keep count ive been nice twice thats it for nice he walked past tom abbott pushing open the curtain on his way into the hall what did you say faggot abbott asked he followed jack into the corridor you think someone out here is going to help you i dont want any help jack told him just an audience there was a kid who looked like another fifth grader he was sitting on a steamer trunk in the hall his roommate stood in the doorway to their room holding the curtain open hi im jack burnsfrom toronto he told them theres probably going to be a fight if youre interested jack kept his back turned to tom abbott calling to a couple of boys down the hall talk about derogatory how about calling someone a kike how about faggot doesnt that sound derogatory to you jack felt a hand on his shoulder he knew it wasnt noahs when someone touched you from behind there was usually a way they expected you to turn chenko had told jack to turn the opposite wayit caught your opponent a little flatfooted jack turned the opposite way and stepped chesttochest with tom abbott the top of jacks head not quite touching abbotts chin tom abbott had four or five inches and about thirty or forty pounds on jack but abbott was no wrestler he leaned into jack with all his weight jack caught him with an armdrag and abbott dropped down on all fours jack drove abbotts head to his knee and locked up the crossface cradle tom abbott wasnt a third as strong as emma oastler at best he was only two thirds as strong as mrs machado it was as tight a cradle as jack had ever had on anyone before tom abbotts nose was flat against his knee he was breathing like he had a sinus problem that was when jack heard someone say thats a halfway decent crossface cradle whats wrong with it jack asked he couldnt see whod spoken but it had been an older boys voice i could show you how to make it tighter the older boy told jack the surrounding faces of the kids seemed like fifthgrade faces jack had the feeling that the older boy was standing directly behind his head jack knew that tom abbott couldnt talkabbott could barely breathe jack just kept cranking the cradle as hard as he could he waited you can let him up now the boy with the oldersounding voice said you shouldnt call people faggots or kikes jack said its derogatory let him up the older boy said jack let tom abbott go and got to his feet what are you doing in a fifthgrade dorm tom jack had a look at the older boy who was talking jack didnt yet know that the boy was the proctor on their floor but it was evident he was a wrestler he was no taller than fiveeight or fivenine by his build he was in emmas weight class or a little heavier and while his cauliflower ears were mere trifles in comparison to chenkosthey werent even as bad as pavels or borissyou could tell he was proud of them tom abbott still wasnt talking he seemed resigned to his fatenamely that the proctor was going to show jack how he might improve his crossface cradle you want to see tighter the proctor asked jack yes please jack said the proctor put tom abbott in another crossface cradle he stuck one of his knees in abbotts ribs which had the effect of driving toms hips in a diagonally opposed direction from his head and neck not only tighter but more uncomfortable the proctor explained his name was loomiseveryone called him by his last name he was an eighth grader from pennsylvania and hed been wrestling for ten years loomis had some kind of learning disability hed repeated both second and fourth grade he was only a couple of years younger than emma jack didnt know that redding had a wrestling team but it made perfect sense at a school where character countedwhere effort was regarded as more reliable than talent in reddings point system you lost a point for every derogatory or dismissive thing you said to another boy and like a profane word every act of unkindness cost you as well for example tom abbott had three points against himone for calling noah a kike another for calling jack and noah faggots and a third for picking a fight with jack he touched me first jack told loomis who seemed unsurprised tom abbott had another point against him for being an upperclassman in a fifthgrade dorm you needed permission from the proctor on the floor to visit with a younger kid you had a limit of four points against you per month more than four and you were expelledthis was nonnegotiable tom abbott had four points against him on the first day of school he wouldnt last at redding past the second week it was hard to come to redding as an older boy abbott was a transfer student from another school kids admitted in grade five had a better chance of making it through grade eight loomis was a fouryear boy like most of the surviving eighth graders if you did the workboth your homework and your workjob because everyone had a workjob at reddingyou were okay and you had to treat the other kids respectfully you had to be nice from the start a tougher philosophy than being nice twice mrs wicksteed would have respected redding swearing was a halfpoint against you a halfpoint for every word for example it was better to say fuck or shit than fucking shit emma would not have done well at redding they were not all boys with problems but they were all boys who were not welcome to live at home loomiss parents and older sister had been killed in an automobile accident his grandparents had wanted him out of their house before the puberty business started fair enough loomis always said that could have been a motto at redding too though it wasnt as resonant as labor omnia vincit in the wrestling room jack discovered another motto it was printed on the ceiling where you could read it only if you were being pinned no whining the academic expectations of the school were fairly modest the homework was less demanding than it was repetitious a lot of memorization which was okay with jack a duckunder an armdrag an anklepick an outside singlelegas chenko had taught the boy these things were essentially undemanding but they required repetition jack felt right at home at redding and neither miss wurtz nor mr ramsey would have questioned the value of memorization at redding nothing was inspiredeverything was a drill smart boys not that there were many lay low hard work was all that mattered the more you had to overcome the better your efforts were appreciated the headmaster whose main role at the school was fundraising was away a lot his wife reported his whereabouts to the boys at morning meeting mr adkins bless his heart is in cleveland she would say we have a few successful alumni there and mr adkins has already met a needy boy or two so they were needythey didnt mind reddings first purpose mr adkins told them on one of the rare occasions when he was home is to prepare you for a better school than redding once redding showed the boys how to work hard the thinking was another school a better one would educate them jack learned that the least utilitarian thing about redding was those bars on the dormitory windows no one wanted to run away from the schoolthey just longed to be in a better one the wrestling coach mr clum had come to maine from colorado hed wrestled somewhere in the big ten but he made a point of telling the team that hed never been a starter for four years i was a backup to someone better coach clum said every year it was a different guy but he was always better inferiority was their advantage that they believed they were inferior in combination with their zeal for hard work made them formidably tenacious boys coach clum designed a wrestling schedule that purposely overmatched them reddings wrestling team never had a winning season but the boys were unafraid to loseand when they won an occasional match they were elated jack found out only later when he was at a better school that everyone hated to wrestle redding redding boys relished taking a poundingthey were often beaten but rarely pinnedand boy were they nice when you lose tell your opponent how good he is loomis instructed the younger boys on the team when you win tell him youre sorrysay youve been in his situation even if you havent they were competing against a school in bath maine when jack won his first match he was wrestling a strong but clumsy kid whod never seen a crossface cradle before jack was making the cradle tighter the way loomis had shown him when the kid from bath bit him he sank his teeth into jacks forearm drawing blood jack could see the boys face there was no malevolence or awareness of wrongful conduct in the bath wrestlers eyes only fear possibly the kid from bath was afraid of losing especially of being pinnedmore likely he was terrified of being hurt he was fighting for his life the way a captured animal would fight jack let him go the bitewound was obviouswrestlers from both teams solemnly had a look at itand the kid from bath was disqualified for unsportsmanlike behavior which amounted to the same number of points for redding that jack would have won for a fall im sorry jack told the biter ive been in your situation the kid from bath looked humiliated inconsolable loomis was shaking his head what jack asked him you dont say youve been in his situation to a biter jack so there were rules to be learned at redding learning the rules was what made jack feel at home there mrs adkins a virtual widow to her husbands fundraising trips on behalf of the school taught english and served as casting director for the schools weekly drama night she was a severely depressed woman in her fiftiesan unhappylooking washedout blonde her pallor was goldgoinggray a fairturningtoslate complexion her clothes seemed a size too large for her as if she suffered from a disease that was shrinking her her gift for casting was a profoundly restless or roving onecausing her to visit unannounced classes in all manner of subjects mrs adkins would just walk into the classroom and pace among the students while the class continued in as undistracted a fashion as possible pretend im not here she would say to the fifth graders mrs adkins assumed that the older boys already knew to ignore her there might be a note in your school mailbox after her appearance in your class see memrs a in jacks fifth and sixthgrade years he was usually cast as a woman he was by far the prettiest of the boys at redding andfrom the glowing recommendations of miss wurtz and mr ramseymrs adkins knew he had female acting credentials by the time jack was in seventh and eighth grade and he was more than occasionally picked for a male role mrs adkins had dispensed with leaving notes in his mailbox her touch on his shoulder was he knew a seeme touch yes jack slept with herbut not until his eighthgrade year when he was thirteen going on fourteen and the deprivations of a singlesex school had made him nostalgic for his earlier life as a sexually molested child by then mrs adkins had given him threeplus years of the best speaking parts and he was old enough to be attracted to her permanent air of sadness there will be no points against you for this she told jack the first time but he foresaw that after redding the world might hold him accountable to another system for keeping score jack burns would hold mrs adkins as a point against him the nezinscot river ran through redding and most of the year one would have to make a considerable even a ludicrous effort to drown in it but some years after jack left redding mrs adkins managed to drown herself in the nezinscot it would have happened in the springin such measure as there was a spring in maine there was a glimmer of miss wurtzs perishable beauty about mrs adkins in her capacity as casting director for drama night there was also something of the wurtzs eccentricity for dramatization about her the boys did not do entire plays or dramatizations of novels at redding the rehearsals would have taken too much time away from the nutsandbolts business of what was at heart a nononsense school but almost as an echo of the schools mantra to memorization mrs adkins desired to make thespians of them all they were costumed in character and mrs adkins supervised their makeup the womens clothes jack gradually discovered were mrs adkinss castawaysor the unexciting donations of the almost uniformly dowdy faculty wives mrs adkins was one of only two female teachers at the school the weekly drama night at redding consisted of speeches and skits excerpts from short stories or plays recitations of poemsoften only parts of poemsand such challenging feats of memorization as could be found in the monologues of inspired statesmen in fifth grade jack recited anne bradstreets to my dear and loving husband dressed in mrs adkinss prim but faded clothes he managed to convey the hardships of early colonial life and the duties of a puritan housewife which mrs bradstreet had so stoically endured jack was also the ravishingly beautiful ghost the guillotined young woman in washington irvings gothic story adventure of the german student his black dress had been mrs adkinss nightgown oncepossibly at a time when mr adkins had traveled less he was the poisoned beatrice in hawthornes rappaccinis daughter befitting his death in a garden jack wore something summery which mrs adkins remembered wearing to an old friends wedding he was in sixth grade when he did sigh no more ladiesthat little ditty from much ado about nothing shakespeare was a favorite of mrs adkins jack wore one of her pleated skirts when he sang under the greenwood tree from as you like it he would remember her saying why that skirt looks so nice on you jack i just might wear it again on his first drama night as a boy it was a mild surprise thateven thenmrs adkins dressed him in her clothes black slacks a longsleeved white blouse with a ruffled collar jack did o mistress mine from twelfth night and mrs adkins scolded him for saying his end line to hernot to the audience youths a stuff will not endure indeed not mrs adkins seemed to sense that this was so she made jack sing take oh take those lips away from measure for measure his voice had not yet changed but it was changing by the seventh grade jack was getting a little too muscular for mrs adkinss clothes but even when jack was in the eighth grade no boy at redding was a better girl he had pubic hair early but his facial hair came late and his beard would never be heavy he missed emma and faithfully thought of her when he masturbated he couldnt get used to taking showers with boys jack didnt like looking at the other boys penises when he admitted this to mrs adkins she told him to memorize a poem and say it to himself in the shower on those weekends when mr adkins was away jack visited mrs adkins in the headmasters house where she would dress him in her clothesthe ones she was not yet ready to donate to drama night an ivory camisole with a builtin shelf bra a bouclé lace turtleneck a velour cardigan a crinkled silk shirt a satintrimmed wrap sweater for a small woman mrs adkins had big feetjack could wear her beaded jade mules she never touched him first nor did she once need to tell him to touch her while she dressed himoften in the clothes she was wearing at the time which meant that mrs adkins undressed herself firstshe stood so close to him and she smelled so nice that he could not resist touching her the first time he did so she closed her eyes and held her breathcompelling him to touch her more it was a seduction quite the opposite of mrs machados assertive kind yet jack was aware that he had the confidence to touch mrs adkins because mrs machado had shown him how mrs adkins never asked him how at thirteen he knew where to touch her maybe she should have had a daughter jack found himself thinking oncewhen mrs adkins was dressing him in her favorite velvet top for fun she put lemons in the underwire brabeing a smallbreasted woman herself jack would learn much later that mrs adkins and her husband had had a son and lost him the boys death was an underlying reason for the permanent air of sadness that had first attracted jack to mrs adkins although jack didnt know this at the time i love you in my clothes was all she told him having cast jack in his seventhgrade year as mildred douglas in eugene oneills the hairy ape mrs adkins loved him so much as mildred that she perversely cast him the following year as mildreds cantankerous aunt in that his final year at redding when jack was lying in her arms mrs adkins liked to test his memory of cue lines in the dark in the husky voice of the second engineer in the hairy ape she said youll likely rub against oil and dirt it cant be helped rubbing against her jackasmildred replied it doesnt matter i have lots of white dresses all hers every dress he wore on drama night had once been worn by mrs adkins how at home he felt in her clothes except when he was wrestling jack took few trips away from redding since toronto was so far he would generally spend american thanksgiving in bostonactually in nearby cambridgewith his roommate noah jack went back to toronto for christmas and for the misnomered spring break which was in march or aprilwhen it was barely more springlike in toronto than it was in maine it was never spring in maine but as a wrestler he got to see a lot of new england coach clum once took the team as far as new york state to a tournament where even loomis lost it was the only time jack saw loomis lose although loomisin addition to losing his parents and older sisterhad other losses ahead he would be expelled from blair academy for getting a referees underage daughter pregnant loomis gave up an opportunity for a college wrestling scholarship because of it he became a navy seal instead he was stabbed to death somewhere in the philippines while on a perilous undercover mission perhaps or drunk and rowdy in a barin either case his killer was reputed to be a transvestite prostitute but loomis was the model jack aspired to on the redding wrestling team jack was never as good a wrestler as loomis was although in jacks last two years at redding he managed to win more matches than he lost if someone had been taking his picture on drama night jack would have known it but he wouldnt have known if someone was watching or taking pictures when he was wrestlinghe wouldnt have heard the click of the camera shutter or the noise of the crowd when jack was wrestling he even lost sight of his audience of one in a wrestling match either you take command of your opponent or you lose you wrestle in an empty space to an audience of none and after loomis left redding jack was the team leaderfor the first time he had responsibilities he was the leader on the team bus too his teammates were either asleep and fartingor doing their homework with flashlights and farting they were instructed to create a minimum of distractions for the bus driver sometimes jack would tell stories on the way back to redding he told the one about the littlest soldier saving him from the kastelsgraven and the one about putting the bandage on ingrid moes breast after his mom tattooed her there he told the one about saskias bracelets including how horribly one of her customers had burned herbut not the one about his mom breaking her pearl necklace in her efforts to be an advicegiver to that young boy in amsterdam and nothing about mrs machado of course jack bragged that his stepsister emma could beat anyone on the redding wrestling team with the exception of loomis who at that time hadnt yet been kicked out of blair everyone at redding except noah and mrs adkins thought that jacks mother was a famous tattoo artist who lived with a guy named mr oastler who was emmas dad possibly jack told these stories because he missed not only emma but also his mother and mrs oastlereven mrs machado or at least her roughness which was nowhere to be found in the gentler persuasions of mrs adkins maybe he missed mrs machados crudeness too jack also told the story of his greatest onstage triumph to date which was his role in a mailorder bride in the northwest territories this was a dangerous story to tell on the team bus coach clum objected to the word menstruation once when jack used it the coach put down a halfpoint against the boy in his eighthgrade year when jack was cocaptain of the wrestling team they had a lightweight named lambrechta new sixth grader from arizona he had grown up in the desert and had never seen snow before let alone a road sign saying frost heaves he must have had some difficulty reading in the dark and the road signs out the window of the moving bus went by very fast at night because lambrecht asked of no one in particular whats a frost heavy his question hung there in the semidark bus the sleepers and nonstop farters never stirred jack was memorizing matthew arnold at that moment he turned off his flashlight and waited to see if anyone would answer lambrecht we dont have frost heavies in arizona lambrecht continued frost heavies are hard to see at night jack told lambrecht theyre so low to the ground that the headlights dont reflect in their eyes and theyre the color of the road but what are they lambrecht asked those bus rides were pure improv look just dont go out of your dorm at night lambrechtnot at this time of year frost heavies are nocturnal but what do frost heavies do lambrecht asked he was getting agitated in the peculiar way that lightweights express their agitationhis voice was pretty shrill under normal circumstances that must have been what prompted mike heller the teams heavyweight to put an end to jacks game heller was a humorless soul he was a grumpy guy with too much baby fat to be a legitimate heavyweight he never won a match at least not one jack saw for christs sake lambrecht cant you read heller asked the sign says frost heaves not frost heavies you know heaves like heaves in the road fucking potholes you moron thats one and a half points against you mikecorrection make that two coach clum said he was never really asleep a halfpoint for christ a halfpoint for fucking and one full point for moron which you truly are lambrechtbut moron is a derogatory word if i ever heard one damn heller said make that two and a half coach clum said so frost heaves are just bumps in the road lambrecht asked im surprised you dont have frost in arizona jack said in parts of arizona we do lambrecht replied we just dont have the road signsor the heaves i guess jesus lambrecht heller cried thats three heller coach clum said youre not having a very good road trip when does heller ever have a good road trip jack asked he had no points against him for the month he knew he could afford one to jacks surprise coach clum said thats two against you burns it is derogatory of you to call our attention to hellers losing record but its also dismissive of lambrechts intelligence to encourage him to imagine that frost heavies exist that they have eyes and are low to the ground and theyre the color of the fucking road lambrecht interrupted him thats a halfpoint against you lambrecht coach clum said they were somewhere in rhode island or maybe it was massachusetts they were a long way from maine jack knew how he loved those nights he turned his flashlight back on and redirected his thoughts to the task of memorizing dover beachnot a short poem and one with an overlong first stanza the sea is calm tonight jack read aloud thinking it magnanimous of him to change the subject save it for drama night burns coach clum said just memorize it to yourself if you dont mind he wasnt a bad guy coach clum but he never accepted what he presumed was the vanity of jack having his cauliflower ears drained when mike heller called jack a sissy for not wanting to go through the rest of his life with cauliflower ears coach clum not only awarded a point against heller for sissy which was clearly derogatorythe coach made heller get his next cauliflower ear drained does it hurt mike coach clum asked the heavyweight standing over him while the fluid from the damaged ear was being extracted in the training room yeah heller answered it hurts well then the right word for burns wouldnt be sissy would it the coach asked vain maybe coach clum said but not sissy okay burns is vain then heller said wincing right you are mike coach clum said but vain is a point against you too one night on the team bus when coach clum and jack were the only ones awake jack had a somewhat philosophical conversation with him i want to be an actor he told his coach i wouldnt say it was vain for an actor not to want cauliflower ears i would say it was practical hmm coach clum said maybe he wasnt really awake jack thought but coach clum was just thinking it over let me put it to you this way jack he said if it turns out that youre a movie star ill tell everyone that you were one of the most practical wrestlers i ever had the privilege to coach i see jack said and if i dont make it as an actor well making it is the point isnt it jack if you dont turn out to be a movie star ill tell everyone that i never coached a wrestler as vain about his ears as jack burns ill bet you it turns out being a practical decision jack told him whats that jack ill bet you a whole dollar that i make it as an actor the boy said since were the only ones awake coach clum whispered ill pretend i didnt hear that jack it was the school philosophy again as mr ramsey who had read the handbook more carefully than jack could have told him there was no gambling at redding jack shut his eyes and prayed for sleep but coach clum went on whispering in the dark bus memorize this jack the coach whispered if i had to guessguess i say not betyoure going to end up being a starter somewhere you can count on it jack told him that was redding to jacks surprise and emmasnot to mention how shocked alice and mrs oastler werehe loved the place it was what such schools are or can be to some boys you travel to what seems or is a foreign country your troubles may travel with you but nonetheless you fit in jack burns had never fit in before michele maher and others jack did not fit in at exeter where he was admitted on the strength of reddings reputation for building characterwith the additional support in the admissions office of exeters wrestling coach who knew that coach clums boys were grinders jack was a grindera hardnosed kid if little moreand while he was good enough to wrestle on the exeter team he was not at all prepared for how difficult a school phillips exeter academy was that noah rosen was also admitted to exeter noah deserved to be was jacks salvation coach hudson the exeter wrestling coach further intervened on jacks behalf the coach arranged for noah to be jacks roommate and noah helped jack with his homework jacks memorization skills notwithstanding exeter was so academically demanding so intellectually rigorous that his abilities at mere mimicry just couldnt keep up the memorization helped him both as a wrestler and as an actortobe but noah rosen kept him in school jack rewarded noah by sleeping with his older sister who was a college student at radcliffe at the time jack had met leah rosen at one of the thanksgivings he spent with noah and his family in cambridge leah was four years older than noah and jack she was at andover while they were at redding and she entered radcliffe when they began at exeter she was not especially pretty but she had wonderful hair and a gibson girls bosomand she was attractive to jack in what was becoming a familiar olderwoman way noah was his best friend a nonathlete he was nevertheless closer to jack than any of jacks wrestler friends when leah dropped out of radcliffe for a semesternot just to have an abortion but to worry obsessively about itnoah didnt know jack was the father after hed stopped sleeping with leah and was having an affair with a married woman who worked as a dishwasher in the academy kitchenmrs stackpole was a short stout woman with several mercifully faded tattoosjack learned from noah that leah was depressed and seeing a psychiatrist jack still didnt tell him unlike at redding where everyone had a workjob the only workjobs at exeter were done by the scholarship students noah was a scholarship kid at exeter once when noah was sick jack took his workjob in the school dining hall he collected the used trays from the cafeteria and carried them into the kitchen which is how and when he came to know mrs stackpole he visited mrs stackpole midmornings between classes in her small shabby house near the gasworks jack came and went in a hurry because mrs stackpoles husband worked in the gasworks and always ate his lunch at home the lunch a leftover from the previous evenings supper was warming in the oven while mrs stackpole spread a towel on the livingroom couch and she and jack engaged in a combative kind of lovemakingreminiscent of the boys initiation to sex with mrs machado the dishwashers heavy breathing was accompanied by a whistling sound which jack first thought was coming from the husbands mystery lunch perhaps it was about to explode in the oven but mrs stackpole suffered from a deviated nasal septum the result of a broken nose her husband had given her possibly because of an unsavory lunchtime experiencemrs stackpole never explained the circumstances to jack he couldnt imagine that shed ever been attractive nor could he have articulated why he was attracted to her in part for that reasonher glum expressionless face the downturned corners of her sullen mouth her oily skin the bad tattoos and what she referred to as the love handles girdling her thick waistbut the dishwasher was passionate about certain sexual positions wherein mrs adkins had merely sighed or taken some evident pains to endure among these was mrs stackpoles preference for the top position which allowed her to look down on jack while she mounted and rode him youre too goodlookin for a guy she told him once during one such rough ride the husbands lunch sent forth an odor of cauliflower caraway seeds and smoked sausagemaybe kielbasa something too powerful to be contained in the oven anyway strong stufflike mrs stackpole herself jack was thinking i wonder jack said to noah once in their senior year at exeter if older women can look at younger boys and know the ones who are attracted to themeven if no one else is why would you wonder about that noah asked jack then told him almost everythingabout mrs machado too but somewhere maybe from his mother hed learned to be selective about telling the truth he didnt tell noah that hed slept with leah or even about mrs adkins jack knew that noah loved his sister and noah had been awfully fond of mrs adkins jacks mistake was that noah simply told the truth he wasnt at all selective about it noah told leah that jack had an unusual olderwoman thing he told his sister about the dishwasher and about mrs machado too at exeter where his fellow students were absorbing all manner of requisite informationat the highest level of learningjack chiefly learned how one can fuck up a friendship by telling the truth selectively which of course amounts to not telling it it was leah not jack who told noah that shed been pregnant with jacks child she told her brother about the abortion too so when leah dropped out of radcliffe againthis time for goodjack knew he thoroughly deserved to lose noah rosen as a friend jack had spent what felt like a lifetime in childhood but his adolescence passed as quickly and unclearly as those road signs out the window of his wrestling teams bus jack burns had no better understanding of women or what might constitute correct behavior with them than poor lambrecht did of frost heavesor that it was sorrow and boredom that drove mrs adkins and mrs stackpole and leah rosen to sleep with jack when they knew he was nothing but a horny boy when jack graduated from exeter in the spring of noah rosen wouldnt shake his hand for years jack couldnt bear to think of him in essence jack had obliterated noah from his lifeat a time when noah was the warmest presence in it both of noahs parents were academics theorists in earlychildhood education from their appearance and that of their cambridge householdnot to mention noahs scholarship to exeter and leah had gone to andover and radcliffe on scholarshipsjack guessed that there was little money to be made in earlychildhood education a pity because it was inarguably very formative to jack the rosens had a high regard for education at every level it must have devastated them that leah left radcliffe she went to madison wisconsin and got into some trouble there it wasnt drug trouble it was something politicalthe wrong bunch of friends noah implied there was a succession of bad boyfriends noah told jack beginning with you leah rosen ended up dead in chile thats all jack knew at least there wasnt any water involvednot the absurd nezinscot the socalled river that claimed mrs adkins jack hadnt meant these people any harm not mrs stackpole either her body was found in the exeter river below the falls above the falls the river was freshwater and not very deep below the falls the water was brackishthe lower river was tidaland mrs stackpole was discovered in the salt water in the mudflats at low tide the water had receded enough for a golfer to spot the body or maybe it was a rower on the exeter crew distracted by his impending graduation jack couldnt remember in either case the academys former dishwasher was unrecognizable shed been underwater too long shed been strangled the town newspaper said and then dumped in the rivershe hadnt drowned had mrs stackpole told her husband about jack had her husband somehow found out was there someone else she was seeing in addition to jack as so often happened in new hampshire everyone suspected the husband who worked in the gasworks and came home for lunch but he was never charged nor was jack charged except by noah rosenand not even noah accused jack of the actual murder lets just say you probably contributed to it noah said he might have said worse had leah died in chile before mrs stackpole was found in the exeter river but leah was still in madison wisconsin though no doubt she was already in a chile frame of mind in those years away at school jack extended the distance between his mother and himselfa process alice had initiated when jack was still at st hildas but what little he saw of emma was always elevating and their fondness for each other grew he was too youngand too inclined to think of women as noveltiesto acknowledge that he adored emma only emma understood why for four years at exeter which was a coed school jack never really had a girlfriend emma knew he liked older women the exeter girls were just girls when jack was in grade nine when he was fourteen going on fifteen some of the exeter seniors who were seventeen or eighteen attracted him but he was no longer a pretty little boy he was a gawky young teenager in his first two years at exeter the older teenage girls ignored him naturally jack saw something of emma in those yearsand not only over school vacations or for parts of every summer upon her graduation from st hildas emma had gone to mcgill in montreal which mrs oastler who was a fiercely loyal torontonian considered an untoronto or an antitoronto thing to do emma was quickly bored not by mcgill but with the quebecois she was always an excellent student although french wasnt her favorite subject she discovered that she liked french movies better with subtitles it was movies themselves that emma decided she liked she got into nyu where she declared herself a film major her grades had been good at mcgill she was able to transfer all her credits and she loved living in new york when jack began at exeter in the fall of emma was starting her second year of university but her first at nyu on her invitation jack traveled to new york to see her for a weekend that fall it wasnt much of a weekend exeter had a halfday of classes on saturday getting from new hampshire to new york city took the rest of the day and jack was required to be back at the academy by eight oclock sunday night nevertheless he had a thrilling saturday night and sunday morning with emma and her filmmajor friends they went to an allnight cinema that was playing billy wilder movies jack wasnt that familiar with wilder although hed seen some like it hot in toronto with his mother he must have been nine or ten when marilyn monroe sang i wanna be loved by you in that sequined dress jack got a boner and made the mistake of showing it to his mom alices sarcasm toward her sons penis could be brutal she didnt say just like your father but the look she gave jack said it for her in new york the first film emma and her friends and jack saw was five graves to cairo but jack would remember only the beginning that ghost tank transporting dead soldiers through the desert after the tank he forgot everything that happened to franchot tonelargely because emma put her hand in his lap and held his penis for the rest of the movie it was not until years later that jack realized erich von stroheim had been rommel there was more penisholding through the lost weekend during which jack got the idea that ray milland looked like his fatheror like what he imagined his dad might look like if william were drunk jack had fallen asleep on emmas shoulder for the whole of sunset blvd then he woke up and although he had to pee he watched every minute of ace in the hole on sunday morning over breakfast emmas filmmajor friends said jack should have slept through ace in the hole and stayed awake for sunset blvd thats what i love about you honey piedont listen to them emma said jack didnt like her friends very much but being with emma was worth every minute of that long trip he would never be a billy wilder fan although wilder was born in vienna and jack could see what was european about even the most american of his films it was the european filmmakers who first interested jack and it was emma oastler who introduced him to them whether with emma on weekends in new york or with noah on weekends in cambridgewhen they would see all the foreign films in harvard squarejack became a fan of films with subtitles with the exception of westerns he didnt like american movies at all on the subject of not being like his father it would occur to jack that if william had met emma when he was a young man he probably would have had sex with herand from everything shed heard about jacks father emma agreed that she would have submitted to his charms thats one reason you can be happy that we havent had sex emma told jack as to how she felt about not having sex with jack emma didnt say every winter term at exeter jacks weekends were taken up by wrestling emma would often rent a car and come to see his matches she herself had stopped wrestling and was once again struggling with her weight emma was a binge eater but she was a binge weightlifter too she would take up smoking quit smoking start overeating stop and then go kill herself in the gym when the cycle began again emma seemed powerless to interrupt its predictable course what she needed was chenko her favorite workout partner but chenko was not only far away in torontohe was waiting for a hip replacement boris had gone back to belarus a family matter was all pavel who had moved to vancouver would say hed married a woman from british columbiasomeone he met in his cab jacks second year at exeter when he was fifteen going on sixteen emma was twentytwo after the wrestling matches most saturdays emma took jack to the movie theater in durham new hampshire durham was an easy drive from exeter and it was a university town they had an arthouse kind of cinema where they showed both old and current foreign films at exeter they showed only the old ones jack loved fellinis la strada which he saw more than once with emma holding his penis they both believed that chenko could have kicked the crap out of the anthony quinn character but only in those days before chenko needed a new hip jack wasnt as crazy about la dolce vita the marcello mastroianni character was the playboy jack imagined his father to bethe sexseeker jack feared he would become and he didnt like at allmastroianni again fellini won jack burns back with amarcord emma had already seen the film in new york but she made a point of taking jack to durham to see it she wanted to witness his response to the tobacconist with the huge hooters with her hand in jacks lap emma knew the little guys reaction almost before jack knew it hows that for an older woman baby cakes they committed to memory the littleknown name of the actress who played the bigbreasted tobacconist from rimini when emma called jack in his dorm at exeter she would occasionally adopt an italian accent and say to whoever answered the phone pleeze tella jack burnseets maria antonietta beluzzi on da fona more often when emma phoned she just said she was jacks sister jack had stopped calling emma his stepsister he referred to her as his older sister instead no one at exeter was insensitive enough to comment on the lack of a family resemblancewith the exception of ed mccarthy jacks wrestling teammate who was hitandmiss in his attention to details at wrestling practice mccarthy once forgot to wear a jock his penis slipped out of his shorts and lay like a slug on the mat where his workout partner a fellow onehundredandseventysevenpounder stepped on it jack felt like stepping on mccarthys penis the day he made an unkind remark about emma its too bad you got all the good looks in your family burns your sister looks more like a wrestler than you do they were in the locker roomwooden benches metal lockers cement floorsgetting dressed for practice jack underhooked one of mccarthys arms and collared the bigger boys neck with his right hand snapping him forward when mccarthy pulled away his weight shifting to the heel of his right foot jack caught him with a footsweep and mccarthy fell on his bare ass on the cement floorhitting his back on an open locker door and giving his elbow a whack on the bench on his way down jack assumed that mccarthy would get to his feet and beat the shit out of him but mccarthy just sat there i could kick the crap out of you burns he said do it then jack told him even in his senior year jack never once wrestled above onefortyfive after he stopped growing he was fiveeight but only if he stood on his toesand he competed better at onethirtyfive than he did at oneforty jack was one of exeters better wrestlers in his final two years at the academy ed mccarthy would never be better than unexceptional as a wrestler jack might have beaten mccarthy in a wrestling match but not in a fight even a mediocre oneseventysevenpounder can take a halfway decent onethirtyfivepounder and mccarthy knew it he got to his feet rubbing his back and his sore elbow as mr ramsey had advised jack although this time it was unintentional he had an audience you shouldnt call anyones sister ugly ed one of the lightweights said jacks sister is ugly mccarthy replied thats what saved jacknot mccarthys belligerence but his insistence on the word ugly while there were no rules regarding niceness at exeter no points off for saying something derogatory or dismissivein fact the intellectual fashion at the school favored everything negative and derisiveit was true that for a few sentimental souls sisters were sacred especially if they werent goodlooking and with emma who had just missed being pretty there was also the problem with her weight who got all the good looks in your family mccarthy the teams heavyweight asked his name was herman castro he was a scholarship kid from el paso texas and while he was a halfway decent wrestler he might have stolen a few matches by frightening his opponents he was so scarylooking that one was ill advised to use the word ugly within his hearing i wasnt speaking to you herman ed mccarthy said you are now herman castro told him and that was the end of it or it would have been if jack had let it be the end of it his loyalty to emma was fierce ed mccarthy wasnt uglyalthough his penis was especially after that guy had stepped on itbut he wasnt at all handsome either he didnt have a girlfriend till his senior year and the best he could do was a startledlooking girl with red hair and freckles who was only in grade ten the redhead had just turned sixteen mccarthy was eighteen it was almost certainly not a sexual relationship but it was probably the first relationship of any kind for both of them jack toyed with the idea of seducing hercertainly not to have sex with her because she was far too young and startledlooking for him but simply to turn her against mccarthy whod said such cruel things about emma jack found ed mccarthys girlfriend in the cafeteriashe was at the salad bar during wrestling season jack lived on salad he could not weigh in at one hundred and thirtyfour and a half pounds and eat much else he had a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast sometimes with a banana salad for lunch salad for supper occasionally with another banana the redhead with the freckles became even more startledlooking than usual when jack spoke to her is he treating you okay jack asked her name was mollyhe didnt know her last nameand she was staring at him as if she expected some unknown and uncontrollable reaction from her body as if hed just injected one of her veins with a hallucinogenic drug he touched her hand which unbeknownst to her had slipped into the stainlesssteel bin of raw mushrooms where it lay like something severed i mean mccarthy jack said he can be cruel to women and superficial i hope hes not like that with you did he hurt someone you know molly asked she seemed truly frightened of mccarthy i suppose he only hurt my feelingsabout my older sister jack said as he had taught himself to do his eyes welled up with tears all those movies with emma holding his penis had conditioned him to imagine the closeup by then jack had seen anthony quinn in tears maybe half a dozen times if zampanò the strongman could cry so could he jack had not done much acting at exeter he had too much schoolwork to take part in most of the productions chosen by the schools dramatic association the dramat he was neutral to death of a salesman which was the fall play in his ninthgrade year jack knew he was too boyishlooking to play willy loman and too small to be either of willys sons happy or biff he bravely auditioned for the part of linda beating out a bunch of girls in the processtwo seniors who were fourthyear members of the dramat among them but in jacks first experience with dramatic criticism the pean the school yearbook described jacks performance as overly distraught and the exonian the school newspaper stated that linda was miscastresulting in the kind of sexual parody audiences must have been forced to endure in those dark ages when exeter was an allboys school what do they know jack thought try telling linda that shes overly distraught after that when jack realized how hard the academic workload was for him he pretended to be disdainful of what the dramat chose for its plays for the most part this wasnt hard many of the choices reflected the taste of the dated hippie who was the dramatic associations faculty adviser more to the point jack was saving himself for the occasional shakespeare which not even amateurs could seriously harm his fellow thespians in the dramat had resented his female impersonation of linda in death of a salesman they tried to force male roles on him urging him to audition for mister robertsas if the movie hadnt been bad enough talk about dated jack evoked wendy holton id rather die he said this was excellent for his reputation as an actorplaying hardtoget worked and what was the risk he decided to surprise everyone by volunteering for a small role in the teahouse of the august moon jack knew that the part of lotus blossom a geisha girl would cement his hold on any future female role he wanted the part he really desired was in the spring play his penultimate year at the academy jack was lady macbeth of courseand just who was going to give him shit about it another wrestler one senior girl in the dramat rationalized that the part called for a domineering womanhence a more masculine choice might work when the dramat at last thought they had him figured outburns likes shakespeare burns wants to do everything in draghe surprised them one more time jack auditioned for richard iii but only if he could be richard let them fart around with our town till the cows come home jack thought he wanted that football his choice for a humpback behind his neck it was the winter of jacks senior yearwrestling season when he was especially gaunt he would show them a winter of discontent like theyd never seen he would offer his kingdom for a horse and make them believe it which he did jacks tears now fell on mollys hand in the mushrooms his tears fell on the broccoli and on the sliced cucumbers too a radish rolled off his plate he didnt even try to catch it molly led him to one of the cafeteria tables other students made room for them tell me everything molly said clutching his hand her eyes were a diluted washedout blue one of the freckles on her throat looked infected i didnt ask to be born goodlooking jack told her my sister wasnt so luckymy older sister he added as if emmas advanced age were a telltale indication that she would never have a boyfriend in truth emma fooled around a lotmostly with boys who were jacks age or younger she claimed that she didnt have sex with themnot exactly your sister doesnt look like you molly asked jack mccarthy says my sister is ugly he told her naturally i dont see her that wayi love her of course you do molly cried clutching his hand harder she was not only not pretty at sixteen molly was probably as appealing as she would ever be shed never liked looking in a mirrorand she would like it less and less as she grew older jack imagined that her boyfriend had called another girl ugly must have hit too close to home jack had cried enough the overacting had left his salad a little wet another closeup came to mind that of the slightly quivering but stiff upper lip im sorry i brought this up he said theres nothing anyone can do about it i wont bother you again no she said grabbing his wrist as he tried to take his tray and go a raw carrot fell off his plate a little iced tea spilled from his glass jack drank so much iced tea in the wrestling season he was bouncing off the walls his fingers always trembled as if he were riding on a speeding train i better go molly jack said he left her without looking back he knew that she and ed mccarthy were finished he also knew that ed would be having his lunch soon jack wandered back over to the salad bar he was basically starving the prettiest girl in the school was theremichele maher a fellow senior she was a slim honeyblonde with a models glowing skin andin mccarthys crude appraisala couple of high hard ones michele was over fivetenshe had two inches on jack she was in the dramat jack had beaten her out for lady macbeth but shed been a good sport about itone of the few who had despite her good looks everyone liked her she was smart but she was also nice to people shed done the earlyacceptance thing at columbia because she was from new york and wanted to be back in the city so unlike most of the seniors she wasnt thinking about where she might end up in collegeshe already knew jack burns looking lean and mean michele said thats me he told her im a starving heart of darkness wheres your hump dick she asked it was a richard iii jokeeveryone in the dramat kept asking him its in the costume closet and its just a football jack said for maybe the hundredth time why dont you have a girlfriend jack michele asked she was just kidding around or so he thought because i get the feeling youre not available jack told her it was just a line jack was still actinghe didnt mean it he saw at once hed made a mistake but he couldnt think fast enough to correct it all that iced tea on an empty stomach was giving him a buzz michele maher lowered her eyes as if the salad bar had consumed her interest her posture which was generally excellent crumpled for a moment jack was almost as tall as she was hey it was just a line he almost saidhe should have said but michele was faster i had no idea you were interested in me jack i didnt think you were interested in anyone the problem was jack liked her he didnt want to hurt her feelings and the truth is if hed told michele maher he was banging mrs stackpole michele wouldnt have believed him mrs stackpole was so ugly to use mccarthys wordso unfortunatelooking in the world of women even in the world of much older womenthat the dishwasher herself had expressed disbelief that jack burns was banging her why me mrs stackpole had asked him once with all her weight crushing the breath out of him he couldnt speak not that he knew the answer there was an urgency about mrs stackpoles need to be with him boys like jack burns had never even looked at her how could jack have been forthcoming about that to a beauty like michele maher how can anyone not be interested in you michele jack asked maybe if hed made that his end line and walked away it would have been all right but he was too hungry to take a step away from the salad bar when someone grabbed him jack first thought it was michele he hoped it was michele what the fuck did you say to molly asshole mccarthy asked him just the truth jack replied you said my sister is uglyisnt that what you said jack hadnt meant to make michele maher fall for him but she was standing next to him and what could ed mccarthy do jack was a redding boy mccarthy knew that jack could take a beating and what would coach hudson do to mccarthy if he hurt jack and one of the exeter wrestling teams best lightweights missed several matches at the end of the season also herman castro would have kicked the crap out of ed mccarthy if mccarthy had laid a hand on jack jack had made a friend for life of herman castro just by standing up for ugliness ed thinks my older sister emma is ugly jack explained to michele maher he saw that it was hopeless to bring her back she was too far gone already naturally i dont see emma that way because i love her ed mccarthys best moveunder the circumstances perhaps his only movewas to walk away even so jack was a little surprised when mccarthy did so mccarthy had just lost his pathetic girlfriendand the only way for the rest of his life he would ever breathe the same air as the michele mahers of this world was if he were standing beside the likes of jack burns it was the jack burnses of this world who got the michele mahersin jacks case without half trying one weekend in the spring of their senior year michele took jack home with her to new york it was the first time jack felt he was being unfaithful to emma not because he was with michele but because he didnt tell emma he was going to be in the city michele was so pretty jack was afraid it would hurt emmas feelings to meet heror that emma would treat michele badly the whole maher family was beautiful even the dog besides jack rationalized would it really matter to emma if he was in town and didnt tell her emma had graduated from nyu and was a fledgling comedy writer for a latenight new york tv show she hated it shed come to the conclusion that at least in her case the hallway to making movies did not pass through television she wasnt even sure she still wanted to make movies im going to be a writer honey piei mean novels not screenplays i mean literature not journalism when are you going to write hed asked her on the weekends thus jack gave himself the impression that he might disturb emmas writing if he bothered her on a weekend micheles parents had an apartment on park avenue it took up half a building and was bigger than jacks fifthgrade dorm at redding hed not known that people had apartments with fine art that they actually owned he didnt even know that people could privately own fine art maybe that was a particularly canadian underestimation of the power of the private sector or else hed been in maine and new hampshire long enough to have been deprived of his city sensibilities there was a small picasso in the guestroom bathroom it was low on the wall beside the toilet where you could see it best when you were sitting down jack was so impressed by it he almost peed on it when he was standing up for some reason his penis produced an errant stream he thought there was something wrong with his penisa little gonorrhea maybe jack knew it was entirely possible that hed caught the clap from mrs stackpole who knew who else she was fucking or who else her husband was fucking now after almost pissing on the kneehigh picasso jack convinced himself that he had a venereal diseasesomething he might pass on to michele maher not that he imagined michele would have sex with him it was their first time away from exeter together yes he had kissed herbut he hadnt once felt what ed mccarthy crudely called her high hard ones just jacks luckmicheles beautiful parents went off to some blacktie event leaving jack and michele in the vast park avenue apartment with the beautiful dog they began by watching the tv in micheles bedroom after her mom and dad had left theyll be gone all evening michele said jack was prepared to make out but hed never imagined that michele maher was the kind of girl who would go all the wayto use one of alices prehippie expressions i just hope you dont know any girls who go all the way jack was what his mom had said when he was back in toronto in the snow for his last socalled spring break michele maher wasnt the kind of girl who went all the way but she wanted to talk about it perhaps shed been wrong not to do it no i think youve been right jack quickly told her short of telling her that he might have caught the clap from an exeter dishwasher he didnt know what else to do but claim to be an advocate of not going all the way himself it was a john wayne night on one of the tv channels beginning with the fighting kentuckian leading a regiment of kentucky riflemen john wayne wears what looks like an entire raccoon on his head jack liked john wayne but emma had undermined jacks enthusiasm for waynes kind of heroics shed been feeding him a strict diet of truffaut and bergman films jack liked truffaut but he loved bergman it was true that hed been bored by the four hundred blows and had said so emma was so disappointed in him that she stopped holding his penis she picked it up again for shoot the piano player a film jack adored and held it without once letting go through jules and jim while jack imagined that jeanne moreau not emma was holding his penis as for ingmar bergman there was never enough the seventh seal the virgin spring winter light the silencethose were the films that sold jack burns on the movies and made him want to act in films rather than the theater scenes from a marriage face to face autumn sonatathose were the movies that inspired him he couldnt stop imagining his expression in closeup with those bergman women with every line he spoke not neglecting the slightest gesture jack imagined that the camera was so tight on him that his whole face filled the giant screenor just the fingers of his hand making a fist or even the tip of his index finger coming into frame alongside a doorbell not to mention the sex in bergmans filmsoh those older women and to think that jack met all of them while emma oastler held his penis in her hand bibi andersson gunnel lindblom ingrid thulin liv ullmann meanwhile alice hoped that jack didnt know any girls who went all the way what was she thinking whats wrong dick lost your hump michele maher asked it was another richard iii joke jack usually answered no its just deflated he couldnt claim he was distracted by the fighting kentuckian not for a moment michele and jack made out through rio grande too john wayne is at war again this time with the apaches he is also at war with his estranged tempestuous wifemaureen ohara with her hooters but jack had eyes only for michele maher god she was beautiful and nice and smart and funny how he wanted her michele maher wanted him that night too but he refused to have sex with hernotwithstanding that he couldnt take his eyes off her he couldnt stop himself from kissing her touching her holding her he kept repeating her name for years he would wake up saying it michele maher michele maher michele maher jack burns she said halfmocking in her tone richard the humpback also known as third she said lady macbeth she teased him she was the best kisser he would ever encounter hands downnot forgetting that emma oastler could kiss up a storm no one could hold a candle to michele maher in the kissing department why then didnt jack simply tell her the truth that he was afraid he had a dose of gonorrhea that he might have caught the clap from an adulterous dishwasher a woman old enough to be his mother it sounded like the subject of a play the dramat might have chosenor more likely a sequel to a mailorder bride in the northwest territories why didnt jack tell michele that he loved her and that he wanted most of all to protect her from everything he imagined or knew to be bad about himself he should have made up a storygod knows he could act he could have told michele maher that his workout partner had stepped on his penis in the wrestling room a surprisingly common but littlediscussed injury among wrestlers under the circumstances he was simply too sore to have sex with heror so he could have claimed but no jack was such a fool he proposed masturbating with michele maherthis instead of having sex with her its the safest sex there is jack told her while a bloody indian war raged around themthe apaches were whooping and dying john wayne was fighting for his life while jack was committing suicide with michele maher you know we take our clothes off but i just touch myself and you touch yourself he went on digging his grave we keep looking at each other we kisswe just imagine it the way actors do the tears in michele mahers eyes would have broken hearts on the big screen she was a girl who could withstand the tightest closeup oh jack she said all this time ive defended you when people say jack burns is just too weird i always say no he isnt michele jack started to say but he could see it in her eyes he had watched her fall for him now he saw how irreversibly hed lost her the john wayne western on the tv was wreathed with a funereal dustfallen horses dead apaches jack left michele maher alone in her bedroom he was sensitive enough to know that she wanted to be alone the beautiful dog stayed with her in his guest bedroom with its fineart bathroom jack was alone with the kneehigh picasso and his own tv he watched the quiet man by himself john wayne is an irishamerican prizefighter who gives up boxing when he unintentionally kills an opponent in the ring he goes to ireland and falls in love with maureen ohara and her hooters again but maureens brother victor mclaglen is an asshole in what is arguably the longest and least believable fistfight in irelands history wayne has to put up his dukes again in the throes of jacks selfpity he concluded that victor mclaglen would have kicked the crap out of john wayne mclaglen was a pro he fought jack johnson and gave johnson all he could handle wayne wouldnt have lasted a round with mclaglen it was a long largely silent trip back to exeter with michele maher jack made matters worse between them by professing that he loved her he declared that hed only suggested mutual masturbation as an indication of his respect for her ill tell you whats weird about you jack michele started to say but she burst into tears and didnt tell him he was left to finish her thought in his imagination for almost twenty years jack burns would wish he could have that weekend back if i had to guess noah rosen ventured it didnt work out between you and michele because you couldnt stop looking at each other jack was only a week or two away from telling noah about mrs stackpole which led noah to tell his sisterand that would be the end of jacks friendship with noah a painful lossat the time more devastating to jack than losing michele maher but noah would fade michele would persist michele did nothing wrong she was jacks age seventeen going on eighteen but she had the selfrestraint and dignity not to tell her closest friends that jack was a creepor even that he was as weird as some of them thought he was in truth she went on defending him from the weirdness charge herman castro later told jack that michele always spoke well of him even after theyd broken up herman said when i think of the two of you togetherwell i just cant imagine it you both must have felt you were models in a magazine or something herman castro would go on to harvard and harvard medical school he became a doctor of infectious diseases and went back to el paso where he treated mostly aids patients he married a very attractive mexicanamerican woman and they had a bunch of kids from hermans christmas cards jack would be relieved to see that the children took after her herman as much as jack loved him was always hard to look at he was slopeshouldered and jugshaped with a flattened nose and a protruding forehead above his small black closetogether eyes his forehead bulged like a baked potato herman castro was the wrestling teams photographer in those days heavyweights always wrestled last herman took pictures of his teammates wrestling even when he was warming up jack used to think that herman liked to hide his face from view maybe the camera was his shield hey amigo the note on herman castros christmas card traditionally said when i think of your love lifewell i just cant imagine it little did herman know over time jack burns would believe that he lost the love of his life on the night he lost michele maher it would be small consolation to him to imagine that his father at jacks age would have fucked herclap or no clap and he didnt have the clap jack had himself checked at the infirmary when he got back from new york the doctor said it was just some irritation possibly caused by the change in his diet since the end of the wrestling season its not gonorrhea jack asked in disbelief its nothing jack after all hed been screwing a onehundredseventypound dishwasher for months on endsometimes as often as four or five times a week no doubt there was sufficient irritation to make jack piss sideways at a kneehigh picassonot to mention ruin his chances with la belle michele as noah rosen called michele maher michele and jack were in only one class togetherfourthyear german many of the students who took german at the academy imagined that they might become doctors german was said to be a good second language for the study of medicine jack had no such hopehe wasnt strong in the sciences what he liked about german was the word orderthe verbs all lay in wait till the end of the sentence talk about end lines in a german sentence all the action happened at the end german was an actors language jack liked goethe but he loved rilke and in german iv he loved most of all shakespeare in german particularly the love sonnets which the teacher herr richter claimed were better auf deutsch than they were in english michele maher bless her heart disagreed surely herr richter you would not argue that lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows is improved by mutwillige anmut reizend noch im schlimmen ah but michele herr richter intoned surely you would agree that sonst prüft die kluge welt der tränen sinn und höhnt dich um mich wenn ich nicht mehr bin is a considerable improvement on the original would you say it for us in english jack you say it so well lest the wise world should look into your moan jack recited to michele maher and mock you with me after i am gone you see herr richter asked the class its a sizable stretch to make gone rhyme with moan isnt it whereas bin with sinnwell i rest my case jack could not look at michele nor she at him to imagine that his last words to her might be the sizable stretch of trying to make gone rhyme with moanit was too cruel in their last class together michele handed jack a note read it later please was all she said it was something by goethe michele liked goethe better than jack did behandelt die frauen mit nachsicht he knew the line be lenient when handling womankind if hed had the courage to give michele a note jack would have chosen rilke sie lächelte einmal es tat fast weh but michele maher would have said it was too prosaic she smiled once it was almost painful one small measure of pride jack took in his academic efforts at exeter was that he managed to pass four years of german without noah rosens assistance german was the only subject noah couldnt and didnt help him with quite understandably as a jew noah felt that german was the language of his peoples executioners and he refused to learn a word of it noah couldnt help jack with the sats either there jack was on his own there aptitude was a far superior tool to attitude jacks effort notwithstanding his talent lagged behind that of his exeter classmates he had the lowest sat scores in the class of actors dont do multiple choice was the way jack put it to herman castro why not herman asked actors dont guess jack replied actors do have choices but they know what they are if you dont know the answer you dont guess if you dont mind my saying so jack thats a pretty stupid approach to a multiplechoice examination because of his miserable sat scores jack wouldnt be joining herman castro and noah rosen at harvard he wouldnt be attending any of the socalled better colleges or universities his mother begged him to return to toronto and go to university there but he didnt want to go back to toronto having initiated the distance between them alice suddenly wanted jack to be close to her again he wanted nothing to do with her jack was way over the lesbian thing as emma called itemma was way over it too they no longer cared that alice and mrs oastler were an item in fact both emma and jack were pleased even proud that their mothers were still together so many couples werent still together both the couples theyd known among their friends and the parents of so many of their friends but jack couldnt forget that hed been sent away from torontoand from canada his country for eight years hed been living in the united states his fellow students for the most part were americans and the films that made him want to be an actor in the movies were european jack applied to and was accepted at the university of new hampshire emma was all over him for christs sake baby cakes you shouldnt choose unh because of how much you like the local movie theater but hed made his decision he liked durham and that movie theater which was never the same jack would admit when emma oastler wasnt sitting beside him holding his penis that trip to the north sea with his mother had formed jack burns st hildas had established what emma would correctly call his olderwoman thing and the school had given him some pretty basic acting techniquesalso a belief in himself that he could be convincing even as a girl redding had taught him how to work hard mrs adkins had drawn him to her sadness and at exeter hed discovered that he was not an intellectual but he had learned how to read and write at the time jack didnt know how rare and useful this knowledge wasno more than he could have defined the vulnerability mrs stackpole had exposed in him the female faculty at exeter struck jack as sexually unapproachable in that olderwoman way whether jack was right or wrong in that assumption they were certainly not as approachable as mrs stackpoleher crude suggestive urgency had captivated him redding was a wilderness where women went and became weary or at least wearylooking at exeter on the other hand there were some attractive faculty wives who captured the boys attentionif only at the fantasy level jack wouldnt have dreamed of approaching a single one of them they all looked too happy least approachable of them all was madame delacorte a french fox who worked in the library and whose husband taught in the department of romance languages romance was not what madame delacorte brought to mind there wasnt a boy at exeter who could look her in the eyenor was there a boy who ever visited the library without searching longingly for her madame delacorte looked as if shed just been laid but wanted more much more yet somehow the first sweaty encounter had not mussed her hair madame delacorte was as commanding a presence as jeanne moreau in jules and jim not even her husband could approach her without stuttering and he was from paris jack was cramming for his history final in the library one spring night he had a favorite carrel on the second floor of the stacks hed burned his bridges with noah rosen and michele maher and he was feeling resigned about his next four years in durham new hampshire emma oastler was moving to iowa city shed sent some of her writing to iowa and had been admitted to the writers workshop there jack had never heard of the place he knew only that iowa was in the midwest and that he would miss emma you can come visit me honey pie im sure they have movie theaters there despite all the writers they probably have the movie theaters to purposely drive the writers crazy in this context jack wasnt worried about his history finalhe was just a little depressed when madame delacorte came to his carrel hed been plowing through a bunch of books he was supposed to have read already hed made a pile of the ones he was finished with among them was a dusty tome about roman law which madame delacorte said someone had been looking for she wanted him to return the book to the stacks on the third floor the classics were kept thereall the greek and latin okay jack said to madame delacorte he could never look at her above her slender waist her waist alone was enough to undo him he went off to the third floor with the book about roman law come right back jack madame delacorte called after him i dont want to be responsible for distracting you as if she or jack had any control of that it seemed that as usual there was no one in the stacks on the third floor jack quickly found where the book belonged butabove the moldy bindings in the next aislea pair of disembodied eyes regarded him michele maher isnt the girl for you the voice that went with the eyes said youre already goodlooking what do you need a goodlooking girl for you need something else something real another dishwasher jack wondered but he recognized the voice and the diluted washedout blue of the eyes it was molly whateverhernamewas ed mccarthys exgirlfriend penis mccarthy as herman castro lessthanlovingly called him hi molly jack said he came around into her aisle and stood next to her i should be your girlfriend molly told him i know you love your sister and shes ugly well im ugly too youre not ugly molly yes i am she said she was demented clearly she also had a cold the rims of her nostrils were red and her nose was running molly whateverhernamewas leaned back against the stacks and closed her eyes take me she whispered jack didnt know whether to laugh or cry he did neither on an impulse largely meant to do her minimal harm he fell to his knees and lifted her skirt he pushed his face into her panties with both his hands on her buttocks he pulled the waistband of her panties down jack burns actually licked a tenthgrade girl a sixteenyearold in the stacks on the third floor of the exeter library from mrs machado and mrs stackpole he knew exactly how to do it the difference was this time he initiated it he could feel mollys fingers in his hair she was pulling his head into her he could feel her slumping against the stacks as she came on his facenot ones usual library experience and the worst of it was that he didnt know her last name he couldnt even write her a letter of explanation jack left her standing in the stacks or barely standing unlike michele maher molly was short enough that he could kiss her on her foreheadas if she were a little girl when he left her with nothing to say for himself except that he had to cram for a history final it seemed to him that her knees were buckling jack found a drinking fountain in which he washed his face when he returned to his carrel on the second floor he was aware hed been away for what may have struck madame delacorte as a long timenot to mention that hed suffered a major distraction maybe he was a little wildeyed or there was something in the aftermath of impromptu cunnilingus that caught madame delacortes eye my word jack burns she said what on earth have you been reading not roman law clearly the lilt in her voice was more mischievous than scientific was madame delacorte flirting with him he finally got up the nerve to look at her but madame delacorte was as unreadable as jacks future he knew only that the rest of his life had begun and that he would begin it without michele maherhis first maybe his last true love enter claudia exit mrs mcquat jack burns saw his college years through a telescope the way you do when the object of your desire is not of the momentthe way you do when youre biding your time the university of new hampshire was like a layover in an airporta stop on jacks journey elsewhere he got good grades the kind he never could have gotten at exeterhe even graduated cum laudebut he was detached the whole time in the student theater jack got every part he auditioned for but there werent many he wanted and he saw all the foreign films that came to durham in those years sometimes but not usually by himself if he took a girl with him she had to be someone who would hold his penis there were only a couple of girls like that it was most often claudia who was a theater major there was also a japanese girl named midori she was in one of jacks lifedrawing classes he was the only male model for all of the lifedrawing classes as mr ramsey would have said it was an acting opportunityand jack got paid for it modeling for life drawing was not an occasion when he thought so fixedly of his audience of one as miss wurtz had instructed him rather it was an exercise in imagining the closeups he was preparing for he hoped there would be many modeling for life drawing was an exercise in mindovermatter too because jack willed himself not to get an erection what was more tricky but he got pretty good at it was allowing a hardon to start and then stopping it it might have been that exercise that made a moviegoer out of midori set us free o god from the bondage of our sins lottie used to pray but jack had stopped hearing from lottie even by postcard he never learned what happened to her on prince edward islandmaybe nothing emma had taught jack how to driveillegally in keeping with her nature but at least jack got his drivers license at the earliest opportunity he didnt own a car hence he developed a possessive fondness for claudias volvo he liked claudia but he loved her car claudia was an aspiring actressshe and jack were in several student plays togetherand her willingness as a penisholder was for the most part unshakable yes he had sex with her too which made the penisholding less strange albeit arguably less exciting than with emma claudia also drove jack where he wanted to go and once he had his license she was generous about lending him her volvo jack drove to exeter a few times a week just to work out with the wrestling team and run on the sloped wooden track in the indoor cage he had no interest in wrestling in college it had never been the competition that mattered to him hed wanted to stay in halfway decent shape and to be able to protect himself and he owed the sport a debt he didnt mind repaying he made himself an extra coach in the exeter wrestling room mostly demonstrating moves and holds for the wrestlers who were beginnersmuch as chenko pavel and boris had done for him as a child and coach clum and coach hudson later on unlike coach clum coach hudson hadnt looked down on jacks habit of having his cauliflower ears drained in the training room unlike coach clum coach hudson was a goodlooking guy he understood why jack might not want to look like a wrestler for the rest of his life especially if he wanted to be an actor given what i hope will be my career wouldnt you say it is practical of me to have my cauliflower ears drained jack asked him very practical coach hudson replied there was another wrestling coach at exeter in those years coach shapiro taught russian at the academy later he would be made dean of students once when jack brought claudia with him to the wrestling room she sat sullenly on the mat with her back against the padded walljust watching the wrestlers with hostile womanly suspicion as if she might any second pull out a gun and shoot one of them there was something vaguely dangerous about claudiaa secret she kept to herself perhaps or her plans for a future she wouldnt disclose or was she like jack always acting coach shapiro remarked that jacks friend was both arrestingly beautiful and slaviclooking jack knew that claudia was attractive although every womans claim to beauty was diminished in his minds eye by the incomparable michele maher but he hadnt thought of claudia as particularly slaviclooking on the other hand coach shapiro was a russian scholar he obviously knew what he was talking about he knew his wrestling too coach shapiro and jack had a few of chenkos old tricks in common this amounted to jacks male company in his years in durhamthose wrestling coaches at his old school and the younger of those exeter wrestlers who were just learning how jack was in his second year at unh before he was forced to choose between his slaviclooking beauty claudia and his conquest from life drawinghis personal jewel of the orient midori with whom he had first seen kurosawas yojimbo an exciting film to see with a japanese girl holding your penis in her hand jack must have been in the united states long enough to have succumbed to american materialism because he chose claudianot only because she had a car she also had her own apartment it was offcampus in newmarketmore or less between durham and exeter and because claudia was an actress she and jack were interested in the same kind of summer jobs summer stock everyone called it claudia used to say that the phrase reminded her of cows new england had uncounted summerstock theaters some better than others and while graduate students were more often hired for the paying jobsthese were people in mfa theater programs for the most partsome gifted undergraduates could find internships and some including claudia and jack were even paid claudia liked the theater better than jack did she knew jack wanted to be a movie actor but films failed to impress her she once told jack that she would have walked out of most of the movies she saw with him except that she was holding his penis in her hand claudia was heavybreasted and selfconscious about her hips but her creamysmooth skin and her prominent jaw and cheekbones gave her a face made for closeups she should have liked movies better than she did because the camera would have loved hernot least her eyes which were a yellowish brown like polished wood but claudia believed she would be hopelessly fat before she was thirty then only the theater will have me and only because i can act in march of their sophomore year claudia and jack drove halfway across the country in her volvo to spend their spring vacation with emma jack had decided to take claudia to toronto the following fall and emma thought she and jack should prepare poor claudia for the eventual meeting with alice and mrs oastler jack wasnt taking claudia to toronto solely for the purpose of meeting his mother although such a meeting was to be expected his mom knew they lived together naturally both alice and leslie oastler were eager to meet claudia jacks principal reason for going to toronto was to take claudia to the film festival and attempt to pass her off as a russian actress who didnt speak a word of english he was looking at the trip as what mr ramsey would have called an acting opportunity for both of them also claudia and jack were a little desperate for some city time which is what living in new hampshire did to people to jacks surprise emma liked claudia maybe because claudia also struggled with her weight though claudia was beautiful her selfdeprecating view of herself won emma over completely quite possibly emma also knew that claudia and jack wouldnt last jack was less certain than emma that claudias view of herself was selfdeprecating her criticism of her body may also have been an acting opportunity because claudia had no lack of confidence in her attractiveness to mennor could she have failed to notice jacks appreciation of her full figure and claudia had overheard jack saying to emma on the phone that the road trip to iowa in the spring was first and foremost a motel opportunity just what did you mean by that claudia had asked him when he hung up the phone youre the kind of girl who makes me think about finding a motel hed told her he wasnt acting but claudia may have been acting when she repliedthat was what was a little dangerous or unknowable about her with you i wouldnt need a motel jack with you i could do it standing up they had tried it that wayboth of them conscious at first of how they might have looked to an audience but in the end they gave themselves over to the moment at least jack did with claudia he could never be sure there were indeed motel opportunities on their trip to the midwest and back and jack was also pleased that unlike new england iowa had a real spring the surrounding farmlands were lush emma and three other graduate students in the writers workshop were renting a farmhouse a few miles from iowa city the other students had gone home for the holiday so emma and claudia and jack had the farm to themselves they drove into town to eat almost every nightemma was no cook emma wanted claudia to understand the lesbian thing between jacks mom and hers which emma said was actually not a lesbian thing its not jack asked surprised theyre not normal lesbians baby cakestheyre nothing at all like lesbians except that they sleep together and live together they sound a little like lesbians claudia ventured you gotta understand their relationship in context emma explained jacks mom feels that her life with men began and ended with jacks dad my mom simply hates my dadand other men by association before my mom and jacks mom met each other they had any number of bad boyfriendsthe kind of boyfriends who are in the selffulfillingprophecy category if you know what i mean yes i know claudia said you think men are assholes so you pick an asshole for a boyfriend i know the type that way emma went on when your boyfriend dumps you or you dump him you dont have to change your mind about what assholes men are yes exactly claudia agreed jack didnt say anything it was news to him that his mother had had any number of bad boyfriends before she met mrs oastler and it struck him that emma and claudia might have been describing emmas love lifewhat little he knew of it thered been a lot of boyfriends most of them onenight standsall of them bad in emmas estimation yet shed never experienced the slightest difficulty in getting over any of them most of them young in jacks opinionat least the ones hed met in an effort to change the subject albeit slightly jack asked emma a question about his mother that had been on his mind for years it was easier to ask the question with a third party present out of respect for claudia jack hoped that emma might hold back a little something in her answer i dont know about your mom emma he began but i would be surprised if my mother wasnt still interested in menin young men anyway if only occasionally i wouldnt absolutely trust my mom around young men either honey pie but i know your mom is still interested in menin young men especially jack wasnt surprised but this was the first confirmation hed had and recalling one of emmas sleepytime tales jack wondered if the bad boyfriend in the squeezedchild saga might have been an exboyfriend of mrs oastlerssomeone whod turned emma off older men or even men her own age as for alice she had left the chinaman and moved into her own tattoo shop on queen street when alice opened her shop which was called daughter alice she got in on the ground floor of a trend no doubt leslie oastler had helped her buy the building jack thought in later years queen street would be too trendy to stand with stores with cute names and an overabundance of bistros daughter alice was located west of that where queen street began to get a little seedyand in emmas opinion a lot chinese from the moment alice moved in her clientele was way youngto use emmas description but jack never knew if the young people came because of his mom or because queen street was full of young people most of the time emma said it was chiefly young men who went to daughter alice occasionally they went with their girlfriends who got tattooed too but jack already knew that young men liked his mother and that she was attracted to them emma also said that leslie oastler was not a queen street person mrs oastler didnt much care for the atmosphere or the clientele in daughter alice but after all her years as someones apprentice alice loved working for herself the tattoo parlor was always full people were happy to wait their turn or just watch alice work she had her flash on the walls nobody elses she had her notebooks full of her stencils which her customers could look through while they waited she made tea and coffee and always had music playing she had tropical fish in brightly lit aquariums shed even arranged some of her flash underwater with the fish so that the fish appeared to be swimming in a tattoo world that shop is a happening emma told claudia jack knew that but the emphasis on the young men had escaped himor he just hadnt wanted to think about it the thought of his mother with boys his age or younger was disturbing jack was much happier imagining his mom in leslie oastlers arms where shed looked safe to himif not exactly happy and what do you suppose your mom thinks of my moms young men if there are any jack asked emma for the most part emma said she stopped herself and then resumed speaking more to claudia than to jack for the most part i think my mom is glad jacks mom isnt a man it was always hard for jack to dispute emmas authority especially on the subject of his mother and mrs oastler since when hed gone off to redding emma had spent more time with their moms than jack had toronto wasnt his city not anymore all hed really known of toronto was mrs wicksteeds old house on spadina and lowther and the st hildas area of forest hill well okaythere was the bathurst street gym and what little he could see of the ravine near sir winston churchill park from mrs machados apartment on st clair but jack had never known downtown toronto very well especially not that area of jarvis and dundas where the chinamans tattoo parlor wasand he was a virtual stranger to queen street west and his moms happening as emma called it at daughter alice between emma and jack emma was the true torontonianeven when she was in iowa city and later when she was living in los angeles alice had finally tattooed emma jack couldnt imagine the negotiations this had entailed not only with his mother but with mrs oastler the butterfly emma had once wanted was replaced by her latest hearts desire a smaller version of alices famous rose of jericho dont give me any shit about it emma told jack she had said to her mom if youd let me get a stupid butterfly on my ankle when i wanted one you wouldnt be faced with a vagina today the problem was that emma didnt want to conceal the vagina this was no flower hidden in a rosethis was just the petals of that most recognizable flower granted it was small but it was clearly a vagina oh jack thoughtto have been a fly on the wall for these motherdaughter discussions alice had smoothed the way for the tattoo to happen its a question of where it is emma alice said i refuse to tattoo a vagina on your ankle naturally emma was way beyond as she put it wanting a tattoo on her ankleand alice would no longer put a tattoo on a womans coccyx shed read in a tattoo magazine that an anesthesiologist wouldnt give you an epidural if you were tattooed there possibly this had something to do with the ink getting into the spinal column although the danger of that happening sounded unlikely what if you have a child and you need an epidural alice asked emma im not ever going to have children alice emma told her you dont know that alice replied yeah i know that alice im not giving you a vagina on your coccyx emma even emma had to admit that her coccyx would have been a confusing place for a vagina alice finally agreed to put the tattoo on emmas hip just below the panty line that way emma could see it without looking in a mirror and she could see it in a mirror as well which hip alice asked her emma considered this but not for long my right one she replied according to emma the tattoo was already a vaginainprogress when alice asked her why the right hip i generally sleep on my left side emma told her if im sleeping with a guy i want to be sure he can see the vaginathe tattoo i mean emma said she appreciated alices thoughtful reply although she had to wait for it jack could imagine this exactly his mother never taking her foot off the footswitch the needles in the tattoo machine going nonstop the flow of ink and pain as steady as hard rain at first emma was vague about the music that was playing at the time it might have been mr tambourine man she said though i know that evenins empire has returned into sand vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping my weariness amazes me im branded on my feet i have no one to meet and the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming there were the usual creepy guys hanging around the tattoo parlor as emma remembered her experience jack felt certain these guys would have had more than a passing interest in the expanse of emmas hip that was exposed not to mention her tattooinprogress come to think of it it was dylan but it was just like a woman emma suddenly recalled jack could imagine this too ah you fake just like a woman yes you do you make love just like a woman yes you do then you ache just like a woman but you break just like a little girl let me be sure i understand you emma alice said after a lengthy pause if youre sleeping with a guy you want him to be able to see this tattooeven when youre asleep he may forget me but hell remember my tattoo emma said lucky fella alice said it seemed to emma that alice was keeping time to bob dylan with the footswitch as she tattooed on my moms a bitch but youre gonna love alice emma told claudia everyone loves alice i used to jack said he walked outside to have a look at the iowa farmland it was stretched out flat as far as he could seenothing like the treedense hills of maine and new hampshire emma followed him outside okay so i liednot quite everyone loves your mother emma said i used to jack said again lets go see a movie baby cakes lets take claudia to the picture show sure jack said if hed had half a brain he might have anticipated the problem inherent in watching a movie with emma and claudia it was most unlike him not to remember the movie he even remembered bad movies but from the moment jack sat down in the theater with claudia seated to his left and emma to his right the problemnamely which of them would hold his penispresented itself any thoughts he might have had about the film vanished emma who was lefthanded put her hand in jacks lap first she had no sooner unzipped his fly than claudia who was righthanded made contact with his penis which emma already held in her hand no heads turned the three of them stared unblinkingly at the screen claudia politely withdrew her hand but no farther than the inside of jacks left thigh emma in a conciliatory gesture prodded his penis in claudias direction until the tip touched the back of claudias hand claudia put her hand back in his lap holding both his penis and emmas hand watching the film in this fashion gave jack a twohour erection after the movie they went out and drank some beer jack didnt really like to drink emma bought the beer but either claudia or jack could have no one ever carded claudia although she was only nineteen she looked like an older woman not a college student and ever since jack had seen yojimbo no one had carded him he was nineteen almost twenty but hed adopted toshiro mifunes disapproving scowl and he used a fair amount of gel in his hair emma approved of the look the scowl especially but claudia occasionally complained about his shaving only every third day it was toshiro mifunes indignation that jack chose to imitateparticularly in the beginning of yojimbo when the samurai comes to town and sees the dog trot by with a human hand in its mouth jack loved that outraged look mifune gives the dog emma had too much to drink and jack drove her car back to the farmhouse with emma and claudia holding hands and making out in the backseat if you were back here honey pie wed make out with you too emma said jack was used to emmas lawlessness her willingness to bend the rules but claudias seeming complicity unnerved him though emma was complicatedand she could be difficultit was claudia jack couldnt figure out like him she seemed to be biding her time she held herself back she seemed detached she was always a little hard to read or was claudia merely holding a mirror up to jack stymieing him in the same ways he stymied her back at the farmhouse after emma had passed out claudia helped jack carry emma to her bedroom where they undressed her and put her to bed emma was already snoring but this failed to distract claudia and jack they couldnt help noticing the perfect vagina tattooed on emmas right hip exactly what is your relationship with emma claudia asked i dont really know jack replied honestly boy ill say you dont claudia said laughing when they were in bed claudia asked him when did the penisholding start i mean with emma i know when it started with me jack pretended not to remember exactly when i was eight or nine he said emma would have been fifteen or sixteen or maybe it was a little earlier i might have been seven emma was maybe fourteen claudia went on holding his penis not saying anything when he was almost asleep she asked him do you have any idea how weird that is jack michele maher had made him sensitive to his alleged weirdnessas in too weird jack harbored no illusion that claudia had mistaken him for the love of her life surely claudia was too smart to imagine for a moment that jack thought she was the love of his life but it hurt him that claudia thought he was weird too weird jack asked her that depends jack he didnt like this game depends on what he knew she wanted him to ask her but he wouldnt askhe already knew the answer he held her breasts he nuzzled her neck but just as his penis was coming to life in her hand claudia let it go why doesnt emma want to have children she asked well jack burns was an actorhe knew a loaded question when he heard one maybe she doesnt think shell be a good mother jack ventured still holding claudias breasts the question was really about him of course why didnt he want children because if he turned out to be like his father he would leave he had told claudia once he didnt want to be the kind of father who left but this answer hadnt satisfied claudia jack was well aware she wanted to have children as an actress claudia hated her body that she had a body designed to have children was the only positive thing she ever said about herself she said this as if she meant it too to jack it didnt sound like an act clearly in her mind the kind of father jack would turn out to be was jacks problem it depends on whether or not you want children jack claudia said jack let go of her breasts and rolled over turning his back to her in the bed claudia rolled toward him wrapping her arm around his waist and once more holding his penis we dont graduate from college for another two years jack pointed out to her i dont mean i want children now jack hed already told claudia that he never wanted children not till the day i discover that my dad has been a loving father to a child or children he didnt leave that was how jack had put it to her was it any wonder claudia held herself back from him yet they had fun togetherin summer stock especially the previous summer theyd done romeo and juliet in a playhouse in the berkshires the older veteran actors got all the main parts claudia was juliets understudy the dull flatchested robot they cast as juliet never missed a nights performancenot even a matinee jack had wanted to be romeoor failing that mercutiobut because hed been a wrestler and looked confrontational they made him tybalt that cocky asshole claudia was always taking their picture maybe she thought that if there were sufficient photographic evidence of them as a couple they might stay together she had a camera with a delayedshutter mechanism she would set the timer and then run to get in the photo the obsessive picturetaking sometimes made jack wonder if claudia just might have mistaken him for the love of her life after their visit to emma claudia and jack did a garcía lorca playthe house of bernarda albaat a summer playhouse in connecticut the setting was spain claudia and jack both played women jack had eaten some bad clams and was foodpoisoned for one evening performance there was no intermission the director who was also a woman told him to suck it up and wear a longer skirt his understudy had a yeast infection and the director was more sympathetic to her ailment than she was to jacks there were nine women in the cast plus jack he had terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea in the grip of an alarmingly explosive episode he flinched so violently that one of his falsies slipped out of his bra he managed to trap it against his ribs with his elbow claudia later told him that he looked as if he were mocking the moment of the playwrights assassination in the spanish civil war jack was thankful garcía lorca was not alive to suffer through his performance what a learning experience mr ramsey responded when jack wrote him about the long night of the bad clams miss wurtz would have been proud of him never had he concentrated with such pinpoint accuracy on his audience of one he could almost see his father in the audience it was the perfect play for william jack was thinkingall women claudia and jack were both understudies that summer in cabaret their first musical he was the understudy to the emcee a brit who told jack pointedly on opening night not to get his hopes up hed never been sick a day in his life jacks heart wasnt in the emcee role anyway he would have been a better sally bowles than the woman who was cast as sallyeven better than claudia who was her understudy but it would have been too aggressive a moment in their relationshiphad jack auditioned for the sally bowles character and beaten out claudia for the part they spent a month singing tomorrow belongs to me and maybe this time to each otherin the privacy of their boudoir where all understudies shine but he and claudia were cast as kit kat girls in cabaret so they got to strut their stuff to an audience given the scant costume not to mention the periodberlin jack was a somewhat transparent transvestite but the audience loved him claudia said she was jealous because he looked hotter than she did you better be careful jack claudia warned him it was the summer they were both twenty if you get any better in drag no ones going to cast you as a guy anymore under the circumstances jack thought it was better not to tell her how badly he had wanted the sally bowles part how well he would remember that summer in connecticut when sally bowles and the kit kat girls sang dont tell mama and mein herr jack was looking right at the audience he saw their faces they were staring at him the transvestite kit kat girlnot at sally they couldnt take their eyes off him every man in that audience made his skin crawl both claudia and jack were good enough students to skip a few classes in order to attend the film festival in toronto that september their teachers permitted them to write about the movies they saw in place of the work they would missjacks first and last adventure in film criticism except at small dinner parties when he took claudia to daughter alice to meet his mother for the first time jack was questioning claudias claim that she had seen raul julia coming out of a mens room at the park plaza alice immediately took claudias side jack knew that film festivals were full of such real or imagined sightings but he wanted his mom and claudia to like each other he held his tongue alice was tattooing a small scorpion on a young womans abdomen the scorpions narrow segmented tail was curled up over its back the venomous stinger at the tip of the tail was directly under the girls navel the arachnids pincers were poised above her pubic hair the young woman was obviously disturbedshe would be a handful under the best of circumstances jack thought although he held his tongue about that too he could see that claudia was enthralled with the atmosphere of the tattoo parlor he didnt want to be the voice of disbelief about either the raul julia sighting or the forbidding location of the scorpion tattoo the film festival was good for daughter alices business alice told them shed been tattooing a guy who was a diehard moviegoer when she saw glenn close walk by on the queen street sidewalk jack seriously doubted it he didnt think queen and palmerston was a glenn close part of town but all he said was im surprised glenn didnt stop in for a rose of jericho claudia who was instantly fond of aliceas emma had said she would bewas angry at jack for what she called his disrespectful tone of voice this created some tension between claudia and jack and they had different reactions to my beautiful laundrette which alice and mrs oastler and claudia loved jack didnt hate the film all he said was i was expecting the laundrette to be a beautiful woman that would be a laundress dear his mom said i thought the word for the place was a launderette not a laundrette jack said god youre picky claudia told him talk about a disrespectful tone of voice he said and jack was less than thrilled to see desert hearts which even leslie oastler described as a lesbian love storyshed been dying to see it alice visibly less so the film drew a crowd of women holding hands claudia who wouldnt hold jacks penis at any film they attended with alice and mrs oastler wouldnt even hold his hand at desert hearts it was as if claudia were contemplating her own trip to reno without him maybe claudia imagined discovering herself with helen shaver or something all jack said was the characters are a little sketchy this was enough to turn all three women against him he was homophobic he was threatened by lesbians i like helen shaver he kept saying but this didnt save him the festival marked the beginning of an asian boom some guy hitting on claudia told her at a screening party jack thought it was cool to say nothing he just kept his hand on claudias ass in a clearly nonplatonic way when claudia went to the womens room jack gave the asianboom asshole his toshiro mifune scowl the guy slunk away alice and leslie lit into jack about being too possessive they loved claudia they told him no woman likes to be touched in publicnot to the degree that jack touched claudia they said this advice from the couple whod held hands and played footsie during jacks groundbreaking performance in a mailorder bride in the northwest territories jack had had it with going to the movies and the parties with his mother and mrs oastler that night in bed he complained to claudia about it they were staying in emmas room the beds biggeras you know dear his mom had reminded him claudia thought that alice and leslie were a cute couple its obvious that they adore you claudia said perhaps jack lacked the perspective to see this he decided to take claudia to st hildasnot only so she could see his old school which had been so formative of his olderwoman thing but also to meet his favorite teachers what a mistake all the girls looked preternaturally young of course they didclaudia and jack were twentyyearolds jack took claudia first to meet mr malcolm who always left school in a hurrywheeling mrs malcolm in her wheelchair ahead of him wheelchair jane who couldnt see claudia reached out and touched claudias hips her waist even her breasts a blind womans audacity is like no others maybe following in his fathers footsteps isnt he she asked her husband jack was still trying to explain this reference to claudia when they encountered mr ramsey emerging from the boys washroom jack burns he cried zipping up his fly patron saint of mailorder brides this reference jack realized would take somewhat longer to explain claudia seemed unnerved by her close proximity to a man so small who never stopped bouncing on the balls of his feet mr ramsey insisted on bringing them to his afterschool drama rehearsal of the day the seniorschool girls were doing the diary of anne frank which jack knew brought bitter memories to claudia in junior high school she had auditioned for the part of the doomed girl but she had already looked too old her boobs were too bigeven then mr ramsey presented jack to the girls as the best male st hildas actor in memorydespite the fact that his reputation rested on his female roles claudia was introduced as jacks actress friend theyre here for the film festival mr ramsey exclaimed which led the starstruck girls to imagine that claudia and jack were promoting a new movie mr ramsey made it seem as if they were upandcoming names in the industry jack was reminded of his irritation with claudia for refusing to let him pass her off as a famous russian film star of the notenglishspeaking variety her courage was not of the improvisational kindwithout lines she was lost and not only did she always seem older than she was she was also inclined to lie about her age im in my early thirties and thats all i want to say about it she would say it was a good line but it was bullshitby ten years and counting the st hildas girls looked forlorn jack burns was very much an object of their keenest desire but he was with this voluptuous woman who made them feel sexually retarded to make matters worse mr ramsey wanted claudia and jack to perform something jack had written him that he and claudia had been in plays together against jacks better judgment he let claudia persuade him to sing a kit kat girl number mein herr was claudias choice not jacks it was a little raunchy for st hildas he told her later in retrospect in the context of the play the girls were rehearsing the insensitivity of claudia and jack singing a song from that sleazy nazi nightclub in berlin took jacks breath away and to make mein herr more confounding they both sang it as if they were sally bowles causing claudia finally to realize how much jack had wanted her part when they finished the lascivious song mr ramsey was a virtual pogo stick of enthusiasm the poor girls swooned or died of envy and embarrassment claudia said that she and jack should let them all get back to the diary of anne frank but mr ramsey was pained to let them go he wanted to know what they thought of the festival and the films they had seen have you seen the godard hail mary or something mr ramsey said the pope has condemned it jack has condemned it without seeing it claudia said he hates godard jack tried to look friendlier than toshiro mifune if only for the sake of the mortified girls the young girl cast as anne frank was pushed forward to meet them claudia seemed fixated on her flat chest jack observed that the poor girl was terrified of them as if they represented a blatant contradiction of anne franks most memorable observation which claudia knew by heart and recited without a hint of sarcasm on the spot its really a wonder that i havent dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out yet i keep them because in spite of everything i still believe that people are really good at heart marvelous mr ramsey cried a trifle deadpan for anne perhaps but marvelous we have to go claudia told him mercifully the girls were all looking at jack as if claudia had been holding his penis in front of them claudia was looking at jack as if not even godards hail mary could be as excruciatingly boring as this journey through time on his old stomping grounds jack was actually tempted to see the godard film because the catholics were up in arms about it and had threatened to protest the toronto screening but claudia didnt like godard any better than he did hail mary was an update of christs birth this time to a virgin gasstation attendant and her cabdriver boyfriend it was in this disturbed frame of mindclaudia hating jack for bringing her to his old school jack wishing that he had not come or that hed come alonethat the sudden appearance of the gray ghost startled claudia and jack just as jack was about to show claudia the chapel claudia made such an immediate impression on mrs mcquat that jacks former fourthgrade teacher ushered them both up the center aisle and into the foremost pew where she insisted they sit down at least she didnt make them kneel claudia was not religious and later told jack she was offended by the stainedglass images of those servile women attending to jesus mrs mcquat held claudias hand and jacks she asked them in a low whisper when they were going to be married that claudia and jack were still students was a point lost on the gray ghost whod heard a rumor spreading like a forest fire through the girls at st hildasnamely that jack burns had been seen at the film festival in the company of an american movie star apparently claudia hed brought her to st hildas to show her the chapel the rumor was that jack wanted to be married in the chapel of his old school where hed had such a formative experience we havent really made any plans jack said not knowing how else to answer mrs mcquats question im never going to marry jack claudia told the gray ghost im not marrying anybody who doesnt want to have children mercy mrs mcquat exclaimed why wouldnt you want to have children jack you know he answered he says its all about his father claudia told her youre not still worrying youll turn out like him are you jack the gray ghost asked its a reasonable suspicion he said nonsense mrs mcquat cried do you know what i think she asked claudia patting her hand i think its just an excuse not to marry anybody thats what i think too claudia said jack felt like jesus in the stained glass everywhere he went in toronto women were ganging up on him he must have looked like he wanted to leave because the gray ghost took hold of his wrist in that notuncertain way of hers you arent leaving without seeing miss wurtz are you she asked him mercy shell be crushed if she learns you were here and you didnt see her oh you should take caroline to the film festival jack mrs mcquat went on shes too timid to go to the movies by herself the gray ghost was always the voice of jacks conscience later he would be ashamed that he never told her how much she meant to him or even what a good teacher she was mrs mcquat would die in the st hildas chapelafter having disciplined one of miss wurtzs misbehaving third graders whom shed faced away from the altar with his back turned to god mrs mcquat dropped dead in the center aisle a passageway she had made her own with her back turned to god and with only gods eyes and those of the third grader who was being punished to see her fall that poor kidtalk about a formative experience miss wurtz must have come running as soon as she heardcrying all the way jack didnt go to the gray ghosts funeral he learned she had died only after the funeral when his mother told him something about mrs mcquat that he was surprised he hadnt guessed she was no mrs anybody no one had ever married her like miss wurtz she was a miss mcquatfor life but something in her combatnurse nature refused to acknowledge that she was unmarried which in those days obdurately implied you were unloved jack used to wonder why the gray ghost had trusted his mom with this secret they werent friends then he remembered mrs mcquat telling him not to complain about a woman who knew how to keep a secretmeaning alice meaning herself as well it was only a mild shock to discover that the gray ghost had been a miss instead of a mrs in retrospect jack wouldnt have been surprised to learn that mrs mcquatas she preferred to be calledhad been a man alice and mrs oastler attended the gray ghosts funeral which was in the st hildas chapel being a st hildas old girl leslie was informed of all the school news as for alice she told jack she went out of nostalgia which he would remember thinking at the time was an uncharacteristic word for her to usenot to mention an uncharacteristic feeling for her to have alice was vague about who else was in attendance caroline of course she didnt mean caroline frenchshe meant miss wurtz the other caroline didnt attend and jack knew that her twin gordon was absent gordon was deadthe aforementioned boating accident had precluded his attendance jack asked his mother if shed been aware of blanketsucking sounds or moaning during the funeral by his moms puzzled response he knew that the booth twins and jimmy bacon had skipped the event or theyd been out of town lucinda fleming with or without her mysterious rage made no reference to the gray ghosts passing in her annual christmas letter if lucinda had gone to the funeral jack was sure she would have told everyone about it and he knew roland simpson wasnt thereroland was already in jail the faculty who were in attendance are easily imagined miss wong mourning in broken bits and pieces as if the hurricane she was born in showed itself only in squallsor only at funerals mr malcolm guiding his wife in her wheelchair the poor man was forever trying to steer wheelchair jane around the looming obstacles of her madness mr ramsey too restless to sit in a pew would have been bouncing on the balls of his feet at the back of the chapel and miss wurtzmy goodness how she must have cried caroline was overcome alice told jack he could see miss wurtz overcome as clearly as if she were still leaning over his incorrect math and he were still breathing her in in jacks dreams the wurtzs mailorder bra and panties were always properly in placeno matter how overcome she was yet how could miss wurtz have gone on being the st hildas gradethree teacher how could she have managed her classroom without the gray ghost there to bail her out it was leslie oastler who told jack that upon mrs mcquats death miss wurtz became a better teacher finally miss wurtz had to learn how but at the gray ghosts funeral there was no stopping the wurtz she cried and cried without hope of rescue miss wurtz must have cried until all her tears were gone and thenone breakthrough day in her gradethree classroomshe never cried again jack thought caroline wurtz must still be saying in her nightly prayers god bless you mrs mcquat as jack occasionally remembered to say in his although not as oftenand never as ferventlyas he used to say without cease michele maher michele maher michele maher claudia who would haunt him jack would never entirely forgive the gray ghost for suggesting that he and claudia take miss wurtz to the film festival in toronto in the fall of the wurtz was in her forties at the timenot that much older than alice in years but noticeably older in appearance and stamina possibly she had always been too thin too fragile but now what was most wurtzlike about her was a gauntness jack associated with illness miss wurtz was still beautiful in her damaged way but she not only looked a little unhealthy she seemed ashamed of something although jack couldnt imagine what she had ever done to be ashamed of perhaps thered been a longago scandalsomething so fleeting that it was barely remembered by others although the memory of it was alive and throbbing in the wurtz her appearance seemed contrary to her restrained even abstemious character because what caroline wurtz most resembled was an actress of a bygone eraa oncefamous woman whod become overlooked at least this was the impression caroline made at the film festival where claudia and jack took her to the premiere of paul schraders mishima remind me who mishima is miss wurtz said as they approached the theater the everpersistent photographers who often snapped pictures of claudiabecause claudia was such a babe and the photographers had convinced themselves that she must be someoneturned their attention to miss wurtz instead she was overdressed for the filmfestival crowd like a woman who found herself at a rock concert when shed thought she was going to an opera jack was wearing black jeans and a black linen jacket with a white tshirt an la look in claudias estimation though shed never been to los angeles the younger photographers especially assumed that caroline wurtz was someonepossibly someone whod made her last movie before any of them had been born youd have thought she was joan crawford claudia said later claudia was poured into a shimmery dress with spaghetti straps but she was a good sport about the photographers being all over the wurtz goodness miss wurtz whispered they must think youre already famous jack it was sweet how she believed the fuss was about him im completely convinced you soon will be the wurtz added squeezing his hand and you too dear she said to claudia who squeezed her hand back i thought she was dead an older man said jack didnt catch the name of the actress from yesteryear for whom miss wurtz had been mistaken is mishima a dancer caroline asked no a writer jack started to say but claudia cut him off he was a writer claudia corrected him and an actor a director and a militarist nutcase which jack didnt have time to say they were swept inside the theater where they were ushered to the reserved seatsall because of the prevailing conviction that caroline wurtz was not a thirdgrade teacher but a movie star jack heard the word european probably in reference to miss wurtzs dress which was a palepeach color and might have fit her onceperhaps in edmonton now it appeared that the wurtz was diminished by the dress which would have been more suitable for a prom than a premiere the dress was something mrs adkins might have donated for drama night at redding yet it had a gauzy quality like underwear which reminded jack of the mailorder lingerie he had dressed miss wurtz inif only in his imagination mishima is japanese jack was trying to explain he was claudia interjected hes no longer japanese caroline asked they couldnt answer her before the movie begana stylish piece of work wherein the scenes from mishimas life shot in black and white were intercut with color dramatizations of his fictional work jack had never cared much about mishima as a writer but he liked him as a lunatic his ritualistic suicide in was the films dramatic conclusion throughout the movie miss wurtz held jacks hand this gave him a hardon which claudia noticed claudia would not hold his penis or venture anywhere near his lap she sat with her arms folded on her considerable bosom and never flinched at mishimas selfdisemboweling which caused caroline to dig her nails into jacks wrist in the flickering light from the movie screen he regarded the small fishhookshaped scar on her throat above her fetching birthmark in her preternatural thinness miss wurtz had a visible pulse in her throatan actual heartbeat in close proximity to her scar this was a pounding that could only be quieted by a kiss jack thoughtnot that he would have dared to kiss the wurtz not even if claudia hadnt been there goodness caroline exclaimed as they were leaving the theater she was as breathless as mrs mcquat as desirable as mrs adkins that was certainly ambitious it was about four oclock in the afternoon when they exited into the mob of catholic protesters whod come to the wrong theater the protesters were there on their knees chanting to an endless hail mary that repeated itself over a ghetto blaster jack knew in an instant that the kneeling catholics thought they were emerging from a screening of godards hail mary the catholics had come to protest mishima by mistake not only was miss wurtz unprepared for the spectacle she didnt understand that the protests were in error naturally the suicide has upset themim not surprised she told claudia and jack i once knew why catholics make such a fuss about suicide but ive forgotten they were all in a knot about graham greenes the heart of the matter as i remember but i think they got themselves all worked up over the power and the glory and the end of the affair too claudia and jack just looked at each other what was the point of even mentioning the godard film to caroline a tv journalist wanted to interview her which miss wurtz seemed to think was perfectly normal what do you think of all this the journalist asked jacks former gradethree teacher the film the controversy i thought the film was quite a drama the wurtz declared it was overlong and at times hard to grasp and not always as satisfying as it was engaging the cinematography was beautiful and the musicwell whether one likes it or not it was sweeping this was more than the journalist had bargained for he was clearly more interested in the kneeling catholics and the ceaseless hail mary on the ghetto blaster than he was in the mishima movie but the controversy he started to say trying to steer miss wurtz to the fracas of the moment as journalists do oh who cares about that caroline said dismissively if the catholics want to flagellate themselves over a suicide let them i remember when they had a hissy fit about fish on fridays it would be on the six oclock news alice and leslie oastler were watching television and there was miss wurtz holding forth in her palepeach dressclaudia and jack on either side of her it was almost as much fun as passing claudia off as a russian film star and caroline was thoroughly enjoying herself though she wasnt in on the joke the moviegoers meaning the mishima crowd were in no mood to be greeted by kneeling catholics and hail marynot with mishimas disembowelment fresh on their minds nor would mishima have been amused jack thought at least when he was disemboweling himself he looked like a pretty serious guy claudia and jack took miss wurtz to a party they had no trouble crashing parties the bouncers wouldnt have kept claudia out of a mens room if shed wanted to go into one claudia said they got into parties because jack looked like a movie star but claudia was the reason with miss wurtz in tow it was clear they got in because of her in fact they were leaving one such party when a young man approached caroline in a fawning fashion hed snatched a flower from a vase on the bar and pressed it into her hand i love your work he told her disappearing into the crowd i freely admit i dont remember him at all miss wurtz told jack i cant be expected to recognize every gradethree boy i ever taught she said to claudia they were not all as memorable as jack claudia and jack were quite certain that the young man had not been referring to carolines teaching career but how to explain all this to the wurtzwell why would claudia or jack have bothered in the lineup of limos outside a restaurant jack recognized an old friend among the drivers peewee he cried the big jamaican got out of his limo and embraced jack on the sidewalk lifting him off his feet that was when the hail mary protesters must have assumed that jack was the cabdriver boyfriend in the godard filmthe joseph characterwhich made claudia in their demented eyes the pregnant gasstation attendant who was an updated version of the virgin mary god knows who they thought miss wurtz was jack burns you are already a star mon peewee exclaimed hugging him so hard that he couldnt breathe the catholics crawling around on their knees were an unsettling experience for claudia and caroline was fed up with their zealotry oh why dont you go home and read his books miss wurtz told one of the kneelers she was a young woman whose face was streaked with grime and tears jack could see her thinking christ was a writer the other catholics kept repeating the infuriating hail mary quick get in the car jack peewee said he was already holding the door open for claudia and caroline its mrs wicksteeds driver deardont be alarmed miss wurtz told claudia as if mrs wicksteed were still in need of a driver but claudia was having her legs held at the thighs by a kneeling catholic let her go you craven imbecile caroline told the catholic dont you get it he killed himself because he wanted his life to merge with his art miss wurtz meant mishima of course but the catholic who reluctantly released claudia thought that caroline was talking about christ he was an indignantlooking manbald middleagedin a longsleeved white dress shirt of a thin seethrough material with a pen that had leaked in his breast pocket he looked like a deranged incometax auditor peewee managed to get claudia into the car but miss wurtz was facing down the mob of kneelers the man was japanese and he wanted to off himself she told them in a huff just get over it to a one the catholics looked as if no number of repetitions of hail mary could redeem such a slur on the unfortunate christ as this jesus was japanese jack put an arm around carolines slender waist as if she were his dance partner miss wurtz theyre all insane he whispered in her ear get in the car my goodnessyouve become so worldly jack she told him stooping to get into the backseat of the limo claudia caught her by the hand and pulled her inside peewee shoved jack inside after her closing the door one of the protesters had wrapped her arms around peewees knees but when he began to walk with her dragging her to the driversside door of the limo she thought better of it and let him go jack had no idea which actual movie star had peewee for a limo driver that eveningpeewee claimed that he couldnt rememberbut peewee drove miss wurtz home first then claudia and jack jack had never known where the wurtz lived but he was unsurprised when peewee stopped the limo at a large house on russell hill road which was within walking distance of st hildas jack was somewhat surprised when miss wurtz asked peewee to drive around to the back entrance where an outside staircase led to her small rented apartment where had the money for carolines oncefashionable clothes come from if it had been family money from edmonton it must have been spent had she ever had a suitor or a secret lover with good taste if thered ever been a welltodo exboyfriendor more improbably an exhusbandhe was long gone clearly miss wurtz would not let jack accompany her up the stairs to her modest rooms possibly she did not think it proper to bring a young man to her apartment yet she allowed claudia to go with her jack sat in the limo with peewee and watched them turn on some lights later when jack pressed claudia to describe the wurtzs apartment claudia became irritated i didnt snoop around she said shes an older womanshe has too much stuff things she should have thrown away outofdate magazines junk like that a tv i didnt see one but i wasnt looking photographs any pictures of men jesus jack have you got the hots for her or something claudia asked they lay in emmas bedbereft of the stuffed animals which either emma or mrs oastler had disposed of jack couldnt remember a single one of themnor could he dispel from his memory that emma had taught him how to masturbate as he lay in her arms in the very same bed given claudias bitchy mood jack decided to spare her that detail the parties and intrigues of the film festival notwithstanding claudia and jack spent the lions share of their time in toronto at daughter aliceat least claudia did jack frequently escaped the tattoo parlor preferring the clientele in the nearby salvation army store to many of his mothers devotees aberdeen bill had been a maritime manlike charlie snow and sailor jerry like tattoo ole and tattoo peter and doc forest they were alices mentors but the tattoo world had changed while daughter alice still did the occasional mans ruin or the broken heart that sustains a sailor for long months at sea a new vulgarity exhibited itself on the skin of young men seeking to be marked for life gone was the romance of those north sea portsand the steady sound of his moms tattoo machine which had lulled jack to sleep as a child gone were those brave girls in the hotel torni ritva whose breasts he never saw and hanneles unshaven armpits and her striking birthmarkthat crumpled top hat over her navel the color of a wine stain the shape of florida jack had once been so bold as to march up to anyone and ask do you have a tattoo in the restaurant of the hotel bristol hed told that beautiful girl i have the room and the equipment if you have the time and to think it was his idea for his mom to offer the littlest soldier a free tattoo in his sleep jack heard the vast organ in the oude kerk playing to the prostitutes at night even awake if he shut his eyes he could feel the thick waxed rope and the smooth wooden handrail on the other side of the old churchs twisting stairs but especially in claudias company the tattoo culture on display at daughter alice made jack ashamed of his mothers art and many of her customers the seeming lowlifes of queen street filled him with foreboding the old maritime tattoos the sentiments of sailors collecting souvenirs on their bodies had been replaced by tasteless displays of hostility and violence and evil the skinheads with their biker insigniaskulls spurting blood flames licking the corners of the skeletons eye sockets there were naked writhing women who would have made tattoo ole blush even ladies man madsen might have looked away more than an inverted eyebrow indicated their pubic hair and there was all the tribal memorabilia claudia was fascinated by some pimply kid from kitchener ontario getting a full mokothe maori facial tattoo on her hip which she proudly bared for claudia the kids emaciated girlfriend had a koruthose spirals like the head of a fern jack took claudia aside and said to her generally speaking attractive people dont get tattooed but this wasnt strictly true jack was speaking too generally his dislike of the scene at daughter alice caused him to overstate his case no sooner had he spoken than a gay bodybuilder appeared he must have been a fashion model he gave claudia the most cursory onceover and flirted shamelessly with jack i just stopped in for a little alteration alice the bodybuilder said smiling at jack but if i knew in advance when your handsome son was going to be here i would come by and be altered every day his name was edgar alice and claudia thought he was charming and amusing but jack made a point of looking away tattooed on one of the bodybuilders shoulder blades was the photographic likeness of the cowboy clint eastwood with his signature thin cigar on edgars other shoulder blade was the tattoo in need of alteringan evidently satanic rendition of christs crucifixion in which jesus is chained in figurefour fashion to a motorcycle wheel the alteration edgar required was some indication that christ had been roughed upa scratch and a drop of blood on one cheek perhaps or a wound in the area of the rib cage maybe both alice said you dont think that would be too vulgar edgar asked its your tattoo edgar alice replied possibly it was claudias love of all things theatrical that enamored her to daughter alices world to jack if edgar wasnt ugly his tattoos wereand edgar himself was certainly vulgar to jack almost everything at daughter alice was uglier than ugly and the ugliness was intentionalyour skin not merely marked for life but maimed youre just a snob claudia told him well yes and no the tattoo world which had not once frightened jack when he was four terrified him at twenty here was jack burns affecting toshiro mifunes scowlthe samurais condemning look at a dog trotting past with a human hand in its mouthwhile the tattoo scene at daughter alice reflected far worse behavior than that dogs once upon a time the maritime world had been the gateway to all that was foreign and new but this was no longer true now tattoos were druginducedpsychedelic gibberish and hallucinogenic horror the new tattoos radiated sexual anarchy they worshiped death may you stay forever young bob dylan sang and alice had more than sung along with bob shed embraced this philosophy without realizing that the young people around her were not the hippies and flower children of her day of course there were the collectors the sad ink addicts with their bodiesinprogressthe old crazies like william burns on the road to discovering the fullbody chillbut jack chiefly detested his generation now in their late teens or early twenties he hated the piercedlip guyssometimes with pierced eyelids and tongues he loathed the girls with their pierced nipples and navelseven their labia the people jacks age who hung out at daughter alice were certifiable freaks and losers but alice made them tea and coffee and she played her favorite music for them some of them brought their own music which was harsher than hers daughter alice was a hangout not everyone was there to get a tattoo but you had to have been tattooed to feel comfortable hanging around there jack saw krung oncehe stopped in for a cup of tea the bathurst street gym was gone it had become a healthfood store gym rats always gotta find a new ship jackie krung said he sized up claudia with a lingering glance he told jack that he thought she had the hips to be a formidable kickboxer another day chenko came by he walked with a cane but jack was happy to see him and wished hed stayed longer even with the cane chenko was more protection to alice than she had most of the time chenko was courteous to claudia but he made no mention to jack of her potential as a wrestler he would never get over emma chenko said sadlymeaning more than the fact that his separated sternum had not entirely recovered from her lateral drop the lost kids with no money came to daughter alice and watched alice work they were trying to find the cash and making up their minds about which tattoo they would get next the old ink addicts dropped in to show themselves off some of them appeared to be rationing what remained of their bodies because they had little skin left for another tattoo it drove jack crazy that claudia called them romantics the saddest cases alice said are the almost fullbodies but were they almost cold jack wondered he couldnt look at them without imagining his dad did william burns have any skin left for that one last note jack could have predicted that claudia would get a tattoo but he pretended to be surprised when she announced her decision just dont get one where it will show onstage he said there was a movable curtain alice rolled around on casters like those enclosures for hospital beds in recovery rooms this curtain sealed off the customer who was being intimately tattooed claudia wanted her tattoo high upon the inside of her right thigh where she chose the chinamans signature scepter it was jacks personal favorite claudia knew symbolizing everything as you wish forget about it his mom had told him when hed said it was the best of the tattoos shed learned from the chinaman but alice raised no objection to giving one to claudia when jack was at redding hed briefly benefited from the exotic impression he gave his fellow schoolboys of his motherthe famous tattoo artist as if if she werent famous there could be little that was exotic about her profession now his mom was famousin her small queen street wayand jack was embarrassed by daughter alice and the general seediness the depraved fringe that tattooing represented to him but what else could his mother have done she had tried to protect jack from the tattoo world shed made it clear that he wasnt welcome at the chinamans and it hadnt been alices fault that jack became her virtual apprentice when she tattooed her way through those north sea ports in search of williamexcepting those nights when ladies man lars tucked the boy into bed in copenhagen now ironically at the same time alice seemed to be proud of her workand of being her own boss in her own shopjack was growing ashamed of her claudia was right to criticize jack for this but claudia hadnt been there in those years when his mother was turning her back on him jack made matters worse by objecting to his moms apprentice observing claudias tattooinprogress what was the curtain for if this guy was permitted to see the scepter the tattoo almost touched claudias pubes he was a young guy from new zealand alices kiwi boy mrs oastler called him leslie didnt like him nor did he appeal to jack he was from wellington and he taught alice some maori stuff like her other young apprentices he wouldnt stay longa couple of months at most then another apprentice would come he was always someone who could teach her one or two things while she had much more to teach him that was how the tattoo business worked that part hadnt changed well before the end of the s because of aids every knowledgeable tattoo artist in canada and the united states was wearing rubber gloves jack could never get used to his mom in those gloves her shop was not an especially sanitarylooking place yet here she was with her hands resembling a doctors or a nurses when everything went right tattooing wasnt exactly blood work but at daughter alice some things stayed the same the pigment in those little paper cups the many uses of vaseline the strangely dental sound the needles made in the electric machine the smell of penetrated skinand the coffee and the tea and the honey in that sticky jar and over it all bob still howlingstill complaining about this or that prophesying doom or the next new thing like the pigment of a tattoo alice said bob dylan gets under your skin while claudia was getting her scepter alice was playing its all over now baby blue gritting her teeth claudia probably didnt notice to jack a part of her mystery was that claudia had not let bob or anyone else get under her skin some pothead was putting honey in his coffee maybe he thought it was tea his head was bobbing up and down like one of those distracting dashboard toys he was from somewhere in the maritimes he told jackas if the exact city or town had disowned him or hed banished it from what was left of his drugged memory he had a tattoo of a greenandred lobster on one forearm the creature looked half cookedtherefore inadvisable to eat bob wailed away yonder stands your orphan with his gun crying like a fire in the sun the sign in the queen street window that advertised daughter alice was painted wood as cheerful as sunny leith where the sun never shines alice said of the colorful sign it had a seaside feeling to it as if daughter alice were the name of a ship or a port of call daughter alice is a maritime name alice always saidcoming as it did from copenhagen and tattoo ole all your seasick sailors they are rowing home bob dylan sang or theyre rowing here jack thought he went to have a look at claudia behind the curtain she smiled at him clenching her fists to her sides the scepter is a buddhist symbol alice was saying softly while the tattoo needles danced on claudias thigh and she winced in pain jack knew that the inner side of limbs hurt more than the outer the shape of the scepter is modeled on the magic fungus of immortality alice went on a mushroom of immortality what next jack turned away the rubber gloves really bothered him he preferred to watch the pothead from the maritimes the guy looked as if he were getting high on the honey in his coffee this was the trip to toronto that would convince jack burns it would never be his true home forget the dead youve left they will not follow you bob sangas always with the utmost authority bob got a lot right but he was wrong about that as jack would discover everything followed you the scepter high on her inner thigh made lovemaking uncomfortable for claudia during their remaining days in toronto but jack was increasingly aware of claudia holding him in disfavor even without the new tattoo claudia might have been disinclined to make love to him that they were sleeping in emmas bed didnt help they left toronto before the film festivals closing night jack could tell that claudia was disheartened the pettiness of their bickering had worn them both down and her new tattoo chafed when she walked with mrs oastlers permission claudia had borrowed one of emmas skirts it was way too big for her but she could walk in it with her legs wide apart as if she were wearing a diaper looking back jack found the retrospective material at the film festival more interesting than most of the featured competition the one movie that claudia and jack had seen alone was fassbinders the marriage of maria braun jack loved that film hanna schygulla is the soldiers wife who makes such a success of herself in postwar germany there are worse things than watching hanna schygulla while a woman holds your penis the problem was although this was the first and only occasion at the film festival when claudia held his penis jack had seen the marriage of maria braun with emma when he was fourteen they were in the cinema in durham it was his first year at exeter the comparison was disconcerting and it was a premonition of a lifechanging experience jack realized that he liked the way emma held his penis better than he liked the way anyone else held it of course he still had hopes for michele maher one day is it me or hanna claudia had whispered in his ear noting the little guys enthusiastic response but jack knew it was neither claudia nor fräulein schygulla who provoked such an uplifting of the little guys spirits it was his memory of emma holding his penis when he was all of fourteen jack knew from that moment in the marriage of maria braun that he and claudia were merely marking time they were just going through the paces like a married couple who knew the divorce was pending his parting of the ways with claudia had been set in motion by that trip to iowa to visit emma the previous spring the children conversation as claudia called it they had continued on a downward path at the toronto film festival and when they drove back from toronto things got even worse they went home a different route than theyd come it wasnt the best way to go but it was a boring drive no matter how you did it they drove to kingston ontario and crossed the st lawrence at gananoque the bridge took them into new york state at alexandria bay at us customs jack presented his student visa and his canadian passport claudia handed the customs guy her american passport jack was driving the volvo claudias new tattoo was bothering her she didnt want to drive she was still wearing emmas overlarge skirt which mrs oastler had insisted she take with her emma will be several sizes too big for it the next time shes home anyway leslie had said pessimistically you look better in it than emma does claudiaeven though its enormous on you for most of the ride claudia sat with the skirt pulled up to her waistairing the chinese scepter which she kept rubbing with moisturizer her skin was a little red around the edges of the tattoo and she was tired of hearing that the inner skin of limbs is tender when jack stopped the car at the border crossing claudia properly lowered emmas skirt the customs agent looked them over we were visiting my mother who lives in toronto jack told him unasked we saw some movies at the film festival are you bringing anything back from canada the customs agent inquired nope claudia said not even some canadian beer the guy asked claudia he smiled at her she was fantasticlooking really i dont usually drink beer and jack is always watching his weight claudia told him so youve got nothing to declare the customs agent asked jack more sternly jack didnt know what got into him i just felt like fooling around he would tell claudia later but there was more to it than that it was a closeup opportunityjack gave the guy his furtive look he did furtive pretty well it was a look hed acquired from observing certain kinds of dogs especially craven and sneaky dogs well jack started to say interrupting himself by looking furtively at claudia we dont have to declare the chinese scepter do we he asked her oh what a look she gave him the what the customs agent said a royal mace or sometimes its a staffin this case a short sword jack went on its a ceremonial emblem of authority its chinese the guy asked is it very old yes veryits buddhist actually jack told him i better have a look at it the customs agent said its a tattoo claudia told him i dont have to declare a tattoo do i why had jack done this to her he loved claudiawell he liked her anyway jack had not seen claudia look so disappointed in him since she discovered the photographs of emma naked these were the old photos emma sent to him when he was regularly beating off at redding they were photos of emma at seventeen charlotte barford had taken them claudia made jack throw them away but he kept one let me be sure its just a tattoo the customs guy said to claudia ive never seen a chinese scepter do you have a female colleague claudia asked the guy she can see it its in a rather intimate location jack pointed out just a minute the customs agent said he left them sitting in the car and went off to find a female colleague there was a building with what looked like offices where the agent momentarily disappeared you are so immature jack claudia said he remembered that evening in the oastler mansion when his mom had made a similar point penis penis penis jack started to say but he stopped the customs guy was returning with a stout black woman claudia got out of the car and went into the office building with the female customs agent while jack waited in the car what did you do that for the customs guy asked him we havent been getting along lately jack admitted well thisll really help the guy said when claudia came back to the car she gave jack her violated look and they drove on for those first few miles when they were back in the united states jack felt exhilarated without knowing why canada was jacks homeland his country of origin yet he was elated to be back in america where he felt more at home why was that he wondered wasnt he canadian was it jacks rejection of his mother and her tattoo world that made him turn his back on his native land claudia wouldnt speak to him for about three hundred miles she had once again hiked emmas skirt to her waist exposing the tattoo of the chinese scepter on her right inner thigh where jack could see it with a downcast sideways glance at her lap it was one of very few tattoos he ever saw that he was tempted to get himself but not on his inner thigh he was thinking about where on his body he might one day get a tattoo of that very same chinese scepter when claudia finally spoke by that time they were in vermontabout a hundred miles from where they were going in new hampshire when claudia saw jack glance at her crotchat her brandnew chinese scepter specificallyshe said i got the damn tattoo for you you know i know jack said i like it i really do claudia knew that he liked the tattoo and the special place she put it im sorry about what i did at the border jack told her i really am im over it jack it took a while but im over it im sorrier about other things she said oh is that all you can say im sorry he repeated its not just that youll never have children she told him youll go on blaming your fathers genes for the fact that youll never stay with the same womannot for long anyway it was jacks turn to say nothing for the next hundred miles and to make a point of not responding to someone is another acting opportunity jack soon would make a point of not responding to the gray ghost too a letter came from her not long after he and claudia were back in new hampshire the gray ghost made merely a passing reference to claudias extraordinary beautymrs mcquat also referred to claudia as his reluctant bride but neither claudia herself nor jacks reluctance to have children was the true subject of the gray ghosts letter mrs mcquat was writing to remind him that he must pay closer attention to his mother whom she felt certain he was neglecting dont neglect her jack the gray ghost said well hadnt she told him before jack threw her letter away without answering it later when he learned that mrs mcquat had died he wondered if hed had a premonition of her death not only would he not pay closer attention to his mother by not answering the gray ghosts letter it was as if hed sensed that mrs mcquat was already dyinga deathinprogress so to speakand that when she was gone the voice of jacks conscience would leave him too they were just a few miles outside durham not far from claudias apartment in newmarket before claudia broke the silence god damn you jack she said after i die im going to haunt youi promise you i willi might even haunt you before i die well jack burns was an actorhe should have known an end line when he heard one he should have committed claudias warning to memory more deeply than he did two canadians in the city of angels despite their growing estrangement jack and claudia would live together their final two years at unh it was more than inertia that bound them they were actorsintraining learning the tricks of concealment by what they managed to hide of themselves they instructed each other they became keen but sullen observers of their innermost secrets their hidden characters the summer following their toronto trip they again did summer stock this time at a playhouse on cape cod the artistic director was a gay guy whom jack liked a lot bruno litkins was a tall graceful man who swooped onstage waving his long arms he looked like a heron making an exaggerated if misguided effort to teach other smaller birds to fly to bruno litkins a musical based on a play or a novel was something to be tampered withto be reinvented in a shockingly different way with each new production the original text might be sacred to bruno but once someone had made a musical out of the material there were no limits regarding how the story and the characters could be altered further announcing auditions for the hunchback of notre damein which claudia had her heart set on the role of the beautiful gypsy girl esmeraldabruno litkins said that his esmeralda was a beautiful transvestite who would liberate the reluctant homosexuality that flickered in the heart of captain phoebus like a flame in need of air esmeralda the gypsy drag queen of paris would wrestle the gay captain out of his closet she was the oxygen captain phoebus needed in order to awaken his homosexual self the wicked father frollo who first imagines he is in love with esmeralda ultimately wants her to be put to deathnot only because esmeralda doesnt love him but because esmeralda is a guy father frollo is a french homophobe quasimodo who also falls in love with esmeralda is in the end relieved that esmeralda is in love with captain phoebus its a better story bruno litkins told the shocked ensemble because quasimodo isnt sad to give up esmeralda to the soldier his hunchback notwithstanding quasimodo is straight what would victor hugo say claudia asked poor claudia saw that her cherished role was gone at least onstage jack burns was born to be a transvestite esmeralda keep the audience guessing bruno litkins flapping his long arms liked to say is esmeralda a woman is she a man make them guess there was of course another beautiful gypsy girl in the playquasimodos murdered mother who has a brief but moving part and there were other plays in that cape cod summer seasonnot all of them musicals that opened themselves to new gay interpretations claudia would have bigger and better roles she was the eponymous salomé in bruno litkinss production of the oscar wilde playbruno revered wilde and wouldnt change a purple word hed written claudia was one hot salomé her absurd dance of the seven veils was wildes fault not claudiasalthough the chinese scepter on her inner right thigh required a lot of makeup to conceal without the makeup the scepter might have been confusing to the audiencepossibly mistaken for a birthmark or a wound jack had the smaller part in salométhe prophet jokanaan good old john the baptist whose decapitated head salomé kisses that was some kiss jack was kneeling under a table with a hole cut in the top for his head the tablecloth hid not only his hardon but all the rest of him yet the damage to his relationship with claudia had already been done not even that kiss could undo their drifting apart the gay version of the hunchback of notre dame merely served to further the distance between them in retrospect jack didnt blame claudia for her onenight stand with the handsome actor who played the gay captain phoebus but he blamed her at the time jack knew that claudia had every right to repay him for cheating on her with a tango teacher that previous spring claudias luck was bad the actor who played captain phoebus gave her and jack the clap jack would never have found out about the affair otherwise unless claudia eventually told himand given her unrepentant lies about her age jack had no reason to think that she ever would have let him in on her little secret it was the captains gonorrhea that gave her away naturally jack pretended it was much more painful than it was dropping to his knees and screaming upon every act of urinationwhile claudia called from the bedroom im sorry im sorry im sorry in brunos brilliantly choreographed scene where jackasthetransvestiteesmeralda reveals to captain phoebus that he is below the waist a man jack is singing his heart out to the captain while phoebus both acquiesces and retreats the captain is attracted to jack but the idiot still thinks jack is a girlhence his reluctance jack seizes one of the captains hands and holds it to one of his falsies phoebus looks underwhelmed jack seizes the captains other hand and holds it to his crotch phoebus gives the audience an astonished look while jack whispers in his ear then they both sing the song bruno litkins wrote for his gay version of the hunchback of notre damesame as me babe to the tune of dylans it aint me babe jack knew his bob he sang it well but the night of the performance after jack learned he had gonorrheaand claudia confessed where it came fromjack had something real to whisper in captain phoebuss ear while he held the captains hand against his pecker thanks for the clap babe jack whispered it was quite a good look phoebus gave the audience every nightit usually brought the house down such a look of recognitionesmeralda has a penis of course the audience already knows jackasesmeralda had earlier shown father frollo thinking it would make frollo stop hitting on himnever realizing that frollo is such an overreactor that hell insist on having esmeralda hanged but that memorable night captain phoebus held esmeraldas penis and jackasesmeralda thanked phoebus for giving him the clap was a showstopper for the handsome soldier the look he gave the audience that night interrupted the performance for a full minute or more the audience spontaneously rose as one and gave captain phoebus a standing ovation maybe take a little something off the look phoebus bruno litkins told the actor after that performance jack just gave the captain his best esmeraldaasatransvestite smile phoebus knew jack could kick the crap out of him if he wanted to in truth jack was grateful to captain phoebus for making claudia feel guilty phoebus had made jack feel a little less guilty about the fact that he and claudia were drifting apart the summer following their graduation from the university of new hampshire claudia and jack finally went their separate ways she was going the graduatestudent routean mfa theater program at one of the big ten universities jack would make a point of forgetting which one it seemed sensible for them to apply to different summerstock playhouses that summer claudia was at a shakespeare festival in new jersey jack did a beauty and the beast and a peter pan and wendy at a childrens theater workshop in cambridge massachusetts he might have been feeling nostalgic about his lost friend noah rosenor noahs more irrevocably lost sister leahbut jack fondly recalled those foreign films in the movie theaters around harvard square a summer of subtitlesand audiences of children and their young motherssomehow suited him claudia saidand if these werent truly her last spoken words to him they were the last words he would rememberwhat do you want to perform for children for you dont want any jack played the beast to an olderwoman belle she was also one of the founders of the childrens theater workshop and shed hired him yes he slept with herthey had a summerlong affair not a day longer she was way too old to play wendy to jacks peter pan but she was a reasonably youthfullooking mrs darlingwendys mom imagine peter pan screwing wendys mother if only for a summer jack needed to go to graduate school to continue to be a student or else get a real jobhence a green cardif he didnt want to go back to canada and he didnt emma once again would save him shed been out of iowa for two years living in los angeles and writing her first novel which sounded like a contradiction in terms who went to la to write a novel but being an outsider had always suited emma shed found a job reading scripts at one of the studios like jack she was still a canadian citizen and had only a canadian passport but emma also had a green card the scriptreading job was more the result of her year as a comedy writer for new york television than it was anything shed prepared herself to do at the iowa writers workshop she was writing her novel which emma said was to be her revenge on the time shed wasted as a film majorand all the while she was as she put it working for the enemy and getting paid for it why didnt he come live with her emma asked jack shed find him a job in the movie business there are some goodlooking guys out here baby cakesits tougher competition than youd have in toronto but there arent that many goodlooking guys who can act as well as you so that was jacks plan to the extent that he had one hed had it with the theaterand no wonder when you consider the preponderance of musicals it was fine with him if his last onstage performance was as peter pan taking wendy darling and her brothers off to neverlandwhile in the wee hours of the morning long after the curtain fell he was banging wendys mom mrs darling what would j m barrie say claudia might have asked had she known it made jack sad to think about her the thing about los angeles jack would learn is that its unimpressed by youno matter who you are eventually the city tells you your comeuppance will come exclusivity fades but jack burns wasnt moving in exclusive circles when he first went to lahe wasnt famous yet in the fall of when he moved in with emma the nearest landmark representing the sundry entertainments that the future held in store was that garish playground of possibilities the santa monica pier all that jack and emma really cared about was that they were bathed in the warm pacific air it didnt matter that they were breathing in an ocean spiked with smog they were living together againnot in toronto and not with their mothers emma who was twentynine looked considerably older her struggles with her weight were apparent to anyone who knew her but a different interior battle had been more costly to her her shifting ambitions were at war with her obdurate determination that emma was a restless soul was obvious but not even jack not even emma was aware that something was seriously wrong with her numbers were never jacks strong suit living with emma in la he couldnt remember how much their rent was or what day of the month they were supposed to pay it your math sucks honey pie but what do you need to know math for youre gonna be an actor at st hildas jack had needed miss wurtz bending over himas if breathing her in were a substitute for learning his numbers and while its true that mrs mcquat had helped him even more than miss wurtz he had never mastered math mrs adkins had assisted him with his algebra at reddingshe whod dressed him in her old clothes she whod made love to him with such a morbid air of resignation it was as if mrs adkins were undressing to drown herself in the nezinscot or at least practicing for that loneliest of moments in her future you shouldnt trust yourself to count past ten noah rosen had once cautioned jack mr warren jacks faculty adviser at exeter had been more kind but no less pessimistic i would advise you jack never to rely on your numerical evaluation of a situation jack burns would live in los angeles for sixteen years he liked all the driving he and emma first shared one half of a rateaten duplex in venice it was on windward avenue downwind of a sushi place on the corner of windward and mainmore to the point downwind of the restaurants dumpster hama sushi was good emma and jack ate there a lot the fish was really freshless fresh alas was whatever ended up in the dumpster jacks first girlfriend in la was a waitress he met at hama sushi she shared an overused house with some other girls on one of those small streets off ocean front walkeighteenth nineteenth or twentieth avenue he could never remember the number he went one night to the wrong house possibly on the wrong avenue there were a bunch of girls who welcomed him inside when he pushed the buzzer but his waitress friend was not among them by the time jack realized it was the wrong bunch of girls hed met someone who interested him more than the sushi waitress numbers once again had misled him you oughta carry a calculator emma told him or at least write everything down he liked venicethe beach the gyms the underlying grubbiness of it after emma had a bad experience at golds gymshed met a bodybuilder there who had beaten her upshe got jack and herself a membership at world gym she said she liked the gorilla on the world gym tshirts and tank tops a big gorilla standing on the planet earth the size of a beach ball with a barbell in his hairy handsthe barbell had to weigh three or four hundred pounds not that this was a credible explanation for why the bar was bending the world gym tank tops were cut low they had a scoop neck and a lot of space under the arms they werent made for women to wearat least not the ones emma bought which were all in workoutgray with dayglo orange lettering the tank tops showed a lot of cleavage and emmas breasts would occasionally fall out at the sides but she only got the world gym tank tops to wear as nightshirts or when she was writing emma and jack had their own bedrooms in the duplex but most nights when they didnt have dates they slept in the same bednot really doing anything emma would hold jacks penis until one of them fell asleepthat is if they even went to bed at the same time which they didnt often jack would occasionally hold her breasts nothing more he never once masturbated in the bed when she was there emma and jack had had their one time they seemed to know this without discussing it she had taught him how to beat off shed even invited him to imagine her when he did it but this was entirely for jacks selfpreservation in prep school especially at redding and although shed sent him photographs of herself nakedand unbeknownst to emma jack still had one of themit was their mutual understanding in los angeles that they were more than friends and certainly a little different from other brothers and sisters but they were not lovers the penisholding notwithstandingand no matter how many times they were undressed in each others company without seeming to think twice about it emma met another bodybuilderthis one at world gymand he didnt beat her up he worked as a waiter at stans which was on the corner of rose and main stans was one of those places that wouldnt last long in venice the waiters werent as brash as they were in a new york steakhouse like smith wollensky and for steaks and chops and maine lobsters which was all they served the white tablecloths seemed out of place yet the waiters wore white dress shirts with their sleeves rolled up and no ties and those starched white aprons that made them look like butchers whod not yet made contact with any meat its hard to feel superior in a steakhouse but the waiters at stans there were no waitresses took naturally to superiority it was as if theyd been born in those starched white apronsremarkably without a drop of blood being shed in the process the waiter emma knew who worked at stans had a name like giorgio or guido he could benchpress three hundred pounds emma managed to persuade him that jack was an experienced waiter and giorgio or guido reluctantly introduced jack to donald the maître d at stansa headwaiter of intimidating snottiness admittedly jack had had no experience as a waiter but emma had skillfully revised mr ramseys written recommendation of jacks training as an actor which repeatedly cited his vast potential the studio in west hollywood where every morning emma turned in her notes and picked up an armload of new screenplaysshe read and critiqued three or four scripts a dayhad lots of fancy copying equipment with which emma slickly executed mr ramseys edited recommendation of jack the word actor was replaced with waiter and the names of certain plays or dramatizations even the musicals were presented to the clueless american reader as the names of trendy toronto restaurants in which mr ramsey extolled the virtue of jacks performancean oftrepeated word which emma left unaltered except she sometimes changed it to a verb hence jack had performed superbly at an alleged bistro called mailorder bride there was another restaurant called northwest territories and at what was probably a french place durbervilles and at several restaurants of note in the northeastern united states among them the restaurant of notre dame and peter and wendysnot to mention what must have been a spanish eatery bernarda alba mr ramseys letterheadnamely that of st hildaswhich stated he was chairman of english and drama had been tweaked to identify him as chairman of the hotel and restaurant of that oddly religioussounding name mr ramseys opening sentence described st hildas he meant of course the school as one of torontos best but donald was an imperious pricka headwaiter from hell when im recommending a hotel with a good restaurant in toronto i always recommend the four seasons he told jack he then challenged jack to take a minute or two to memorize the specials if you give me ten minutes i can memorize the whole menu jack told him but donald didnt give him the chance the maître d later told giorgio or guido that jacks attitude had offended him he had sized up jack as a hick from toronto via new hampshireor so he said to giorgio or guido jack had already decided he didnt want the waiter jobnot in such a selfimportant steakhouse but when donald offered him an opportunity in the restaurants valetparking department jack accepted he was a good driver it wasnt that emma thought the job was beneath him her objection was political you cant be a parking valet baby cakes english is your first language youre taking a job from some unfortunate illegal alien but giorgio or guido looked relieved he didnt want jack to be a fellow waiter at stans hed had enough difficulty accepting jack as emmas roommate no matter how many times emma had told him that she and jack didnt have sex together jack wondered what giorgio or guidos problem was how could you benchpress three hundred pounds and be that insecure jack didnt last long as a parking valet he was fired from the job his first nightin fact he never got to park his first car it was a silver audi with gunmetalgray leather seats and the guy who flipped jack the keys was a young arty type who appeared to have been quarreling with his young arty wifeor his girlfriend jack had thought before hed driven less than a block and the little girl sat up in the backseat her face which was streaked with tears was perfectly framed in the rearview mirror she was maybe four at the most five years old and she wasnt sitting in a booster seat evidently the backseat was her bed for the evening because she was wearing pajamas and clutching both a blanket and a teddy bear to her chest jack saw a pillow propped against the armrest on the passenger side of the backseat the booster seat was on the floor kicked out of the way are you parking in a garage or outdoors the little girl asked him wiping her nose on the sleeve of her pajamas you cant stay in the car jack told her he stopped the audi and put on the hazard blinkers she had scared the shit out of him and his heart was pounding im not well enough behaved to eat in a grownup restaurant the little girl said jack didnt know what to do maybe the young arty couple had been arguing about leaving the little girl in the backseat but he thought not the girl had the look of a valetparking veteran i like the garages better than parking on the street she explained it will be dark soon the little girl observed jack drove down main to windward where a gang of rowdiesnoisy singles though it was early in the eveningwere crowding the entrance to hama sushi waiting for tables he left the audi running at the curb and rang the buzzer to the half of the ratty duplex he shared with emma then he went back to the car and waited beside it the little girl was never out of his sight is this where were parking she asked im not leaving you alone not anywhere he told her emma opened the door and came out on the sidewalk she was wearing one of her world gym tank tops and nothing else because she looked more than usually pissed off jack guessed shed been writing her novel nice car honey pie does it come with the kid jack explained the situation while the little girl observed them from the backseat shed probably never seen anyone quite like emma in her world gym tank top i told youyou shouldnt be parking cars emma said she kept looking at the little girl im not babysitter material jack i usually sleep on the floor if i think anyone can see me sleeping on the backseat the little girl said the usually made up jacks mind for himthat and what emma said before she walked back inside to continue what must have been one of the angrier passages in her novelinprogress nothing good can come of this job baby cakes jack put the little girl in the middle of the backseat and fastened a seat belt around her because he couldnt figure out how the stupid booster seat worked its probably hard to understand if you dont have children the little girl told him forgivingly her name was lucy im almost five she said when jack returned to the corner of rose and main he pulled up at the curb in front of stans his fellow valet parkers looked surprised to see him qué pasa roberto asked when jack handed him the keys better not park the audi just yet jack told him taking lucy into the restaurant she wanted to bring her blanket and her teddy bear but not the pillow which was okay with jack the asshole maître d donald was standing at his desk as if it were a pulpit and the book of reservations a bible lucy seeing all the people wanted jack to pick her up which he did now were going to get in trouble the child whispered in his ear youre going to be fine lucy jack told her im the one whos going to get in trouble youre already in trouble burns donald said but jack walked past him into the restaurant lucy spotted her parents before jack did it was still early a soft light outside the tables werent full yet maybe the tables were never full at stans lucys mother got up from her chair and met them halfway to her table is something wrong she asked jack what a question and women not only claudia gave jack a hard time when he said he wasnt ready to be a parent you forgot something jack said to the young arty mom you left lucy in the car the woman just stared at him but lucy held out her arms and her mother took her from jackteddy bear and blanket and all jack hoped that would be the end of it but donald the headwaiter from hell wouldnt let him leave there is no st hildas hotel or restaurant in toronto he hissed there is no mailorder bride so youre from toronto jack interrupted him the way donald had said tronto had given him away jack should have known donald was another undiscovered canadian working as a waiter in la naturally the young arty husband and bad father wouldnt let jack leave stans without giving him his two cents worth im gonna get you fired pretty boy the guy said its a good job to lose jack told him making note of the line giorgio or guido was hovering around to the extent that a bodybuilder who can benchpress three hundred pounds can hover you better get outta here jack he was saying im trying to get out of here jack said he was abreast of the reservation desk when he spotted the telephone it occurred to him to call and report a clear case of child neglect but he thought better of it jack didnt know the license plate of the silver audi he would have to write it down if he wanted to remember itdamn numbers again but the bad father was too angry to let jack go he stepped in front of jack and blocked his way he was a mediumtall young man and his chin was level to jacks eyes jack waited for the guy to touch him when he grabbed jacks shoulders jack stepped back a little and the young man pulled jack toward him jack let him pull headbutting him in the lips jack didnt butt him all that hard but the guy was a big bleeder im calling nineoneone the second im home jack said to giorgio or guido tell donald donald says youre fired jack the bodybuilder said its a good job to lose jack repeated he knew that line would have legs out on the sidewalk roberto was still holding the keys to the silver audi thats when jack remembered he had the parking chit in his shirt pocket hed already written down the licenseplate numbers youll have to write out a new chit for the audi he told roberto no problem roberto said jack walked along main to windward it was a nice evening only now growing dark when youve grown up in toronto maine and new hampshire when isnt it a nice evening in la emma was writing away when jack got home but she overheard his call what did you do with the kid she asked him after hed hung up gave her to her parents whats that on your forehead emma asked a little ketchup maybeive been in a food fight its blood baby cakesi can see the teethmarks you shouldve seen the fuckers lips he told her ha emma said shades of mrs machadothat exclamation always gave jack the shivers they went out to hama sushi you could talk about anything at hama sushiit was so noisy jack really liked the place but it was partly what emma called leau de dumpster her montreal french that eventually drove them away from their windward avenue duplex so what did you learn from your brief experience as a parking valet honey pie i got one good line out of it jack said what convinced emma that jack should be a waiter at american pacific a restaurant in santa monica not far from the beach was neither the location nor the menu she went there on a date one night and liked what the waiters were wearingblue oxford cloth buttondown shirts with solid burgundy ties khakis with darkbrown belts and darkbrown loafers its very exeter baby cakesyoull fit right in i stole a dinner menu for you just think of it as an acting opportunity as mr ramsey would say emma meant that memorizing the menu was an acting opportunity it took jack the better part of a morning counting the salads and other starters together with the main courses there were about twenty items jack then called mr ramsey in toronto and alerted him to the modifications emma had made in mr ramseys recommendation for jack just in case someone phoned mr ramsey to verify jacks credentials as a waiter jack wanted his beloved mentor to know that mailorder bride was supposed to be a fabulous bistro you have to make reservations a month in advance mr ramsey responded with his usual enthusiasm jack burns i know youll go far maybe jack thoughtif only as a waiter jack showed up that afternoon at american pacific it still sounded more like a railroad than a restaurant to him but the maître d a handsome fellow named carlos was a welcome sight jack knew at once that carlos was no canadian when carlos looked at jacks letter of recommendation he nodded as if hed eaten at mailorder bride many times the specials were on a blackboard by the bar ill bet you can memorize them in a heartbeat carlos said ive already memorized the menu jack told him you want to hear it that got the attention of the other waitstaff it was only about fivethirty in the afternoonno customers as yetbut jack had his audience he skipped the veal chop with the gorgonzola mashed potatoes just to make them think hed forgotten somethingonly to surprise them by mentioning the veal chop at the end of his recitation he forgot nothing hed already dressed as if he had the job and he knew hed nailed the audition carlos didnt ask him to recite the specials it was to be the first in a long line of auditions for jacknot counting the aborted one with donaldbut all of jacks other auditions would be as an actor instead of a waiter he was at american pacific until he no longer needed a job waiting tables emma had arranged for jacks head shots with a photographer she knew they were ridiculously expensive emma carried them around with her at the studio in west hollywood she occasionally met an agent or a casting director but she was more likely to meet someone important on a date or in any of several restaurants in west hollywood and beverly hills some young hotshot at creative artists wanted to bang emma in the worst way there wasnt an agent at caa who would represent a nobody like jack burns but the guy told emma he would negotiate a contract for jackif jack managed to get an acting job just how jack might do that without an agent wasnt made clear emma took advantage of the young agents lust and brought him one night to american pacific his name was lawrence not larry he told jack with an arched eyebrow not much came of that meeting but lawrence made a few calls on jacks behalf these were calls to other agents not at caa but on lawrences personal blistor more likely his clist someone whose name jack confused with rottweiler the dog told him that his recommendations and college acting experiences were basically worthless ditto the summer stock rottweiler said except for bruno litkins bruno had a hollywood connection casting directors occasionally consulted him on roles related to transvestism or transvestitism rottweiler said whatever the fuck you call it jacks toe in the door albeit an odd one was that he had found favor with bruno litkins for his creation of the gay transvestite esmeralda in brunos transformation of the hunchback of notre dame not what id call supermarketable rottweiler informed jack not that jack was at all sure he wanted to be marketed exclusively for roles related to transvestism or transvestitism another of the agents on lawrences b or clist sent jack to an audition for a movie in van nuys the place looked like a private home but doubled as a film set when the woman who did hair or makeup told jack the name of the movie muffy the vampire hooker jack thought it was a joke he didnt understand the situation until the producer introduced herself and asked to see his penis small schlongs need not apply she said her name was milly she was wearing a slategray pinstriped pantsuit very businesswomanbanker chic which stood in seeming contradiction to her oldfashioned pearl necklaceof a kind worn by ladies who belong to bridge clubs her hair was hugea silverblond bubble like a motorcycle helmet sans insignia jack said thered been a misunderstanding and started to leave you might as well show me your schlong milly said its a free opportunity to find out if you measure up that got the attention of a bodybuildertype with a ponytail and a busty young woman who looked like a vampire they were sitting on a couch watching a movie on a vcr it was footage of themselves probably from muffy the vampire hooker a long unvarying blow job in the throes of which the eponymous muffy occasionally bared her vampiric canines one would hope that when she was moved to bite the bodybuilder and suck his blood she would do so in his throat jack saw that muffy did not have the bloodsucking canines inserted while she watched the movie on the couch she was innocently chewing gum the guy with the ponytail paused the blow job on the vcr and the three of them had a look at jacks penis while this was not specifically the film career jack sought most men are curious to know how their penises compare after all here was a panel of experts its okay buddy the bodybuilder told jack cut the crap hank milly said yeah hank muffy the vampire hooker said hank went back to the couch and started up the blow job on the vcr again his dick looks fine to me hank said its cute muffy told jack but in this business cute doesnt quite cut it forget quite milly said she was in her fifties maybe sixtya former porn star one of the cameramen had told jack but the cameraman must have been kidding except for the big hair milly reminded jack of noah rosens mother its cute and it doesnt matta how big it is muffy whispered in jacks ear she went back to the couch and plopped down next to hank it doesnt cut it period and it does matter how big it is milly said it doesnt matter if its cute thank you jack told them zipping up hank the big guy getting the endless blow job from muffy on the vcr followed jack to the car there was nothing cute about hanks schlong which jack had noticed was enormous dont be discouraged hank said just eat healthy id stick to lowfat lowsodium lowcarb stuff if i were you hank are you ready milly was screaming from inside the house this job isnt for everyone hank admitted to jack theres a lotta pressure he had a high nasal voicea mismatch with his hulking presence hank muffy called she was standing in the open doorway of the house baring her teeth in a broadmouthed grin she had inserted the bloodsucking canines muffy was ready for the next shot whatever it was coming hank called back to her it might have worked out differently if id met mildreds sister he said but i met milly first she has a sister jack asked myra ascheim is legit hank said mildred is the pornproducer side of the ascheim family jack saw that mildred ascheim had joined muffy the vampire hooker in the doorway stop stalling hank milly yelled what is myra ascheim legit at jack asked shes some kind of agent hank told him she used to represent val kilmer or maybe it was michael j foxlots of people like that anyway its all about who you meet out here he added hank was walking back to the house like a man about to have nonstop sex with a vampire hooker he looked less than thrilled good luck jack called to him ill look for you on the big screen hank said pointing skywardas if the big screen in both their minds lay in a heavenly direction good luck little schlong milly called to jack hank stopped and walked back to jack for a minute if you ever meet myra dont tell her youve met mildred he warned jack that would be the kiss of death its not as if i actually auditioned jack said this was an audition kid ill look for you hank said again jack would look for him too although he didnt tell hank that at the time his porn name was hank longa big handsome guy no stranger to a weight room always with minimal dialogue no doubt because of his high nasal voice jack would see him in fifteen or twenty adult movies after their first meetingfor the most part nothing memorable by title or plot jack could have recognized hanks penis all by itselfemma could have too they watched hank long movies together after jacks notexactlyanaudition in van nuys never go to van nuys he told emma when he got home there are a lot of guys with huge schlongs out there like that would really keep me away emma said somewhat ambiguously jack told her the whole storyhow his penis in mildred ascheims estimation didnt cut it how he was cute according to muffy the vampire hooker but not in a league with hank long i wouldnt say you were tiny baby cakes but ive seen bigger more than millys smallschlong assessment emmas bluntness left jack a little crestfallen for christs sake youre not trying to be a porn star emma said trying to cheer him up she called lawrence at caa immediately beginning the conversation by telling him she would never fuck him lets get that out of the way was how emma put it do you have any other brilliant ideas about which agents jack should see emma covered the mouthpiece of the telephone and turned to jack he says no she reported ask him if he knows myra ascheim jack said emma got a quick answer to her question over the phone lawrence says shes a hasbeen honey pie shes been let go by everyone she doesnt even have an assistant anymore she sounds like a good place to start jack said ask lawrence if hell make a calljust one call emma asked the bastard lawrence says myra doesnt even have an office she sounds perfect for me jack said emma conveyed jacks feelings to lawrence over the phone he says not to mention myras sister emma told jack i know jack said its myra not mildred i know i know that night there were three messages on the answering machine when jack got back from american pacific he was anxious that one of the messages might have been from a housewife hed been banging in benedict canyon the woman was insane she claimed that from her bedroom she could see part of the estate on cielo drive where sharon tate had been murdered but jack couldnt see it when the santa anas were blowing she said she could hear the screams and moans of ms tate and the other victimsas if the murders were ongoing she called jack frequently often to reschedule their rendezvous usually the postponement had something to do with her husband or one of her children but the last time the family dog had been to blame the unfortunate animal had eaten something it shouldnt have the complications were so severe that the vet had promised to make a house call emma said that jack should learn to read between the linesclearly the housewife was also sleeping with the vet emma loved listening to all the reasons the benedict canyon woman found not to sleep with jack or at least to postpone the illicit act but emma had been writing shed not answered the phone that night she and jack listened to the answering machine together after jack came home both lawrence and rottweiler said they had called myra ascheim and told her she should meet jack theyd given her his phone number the third message was from myra her voice was alarmingly like her sisters jack first thought it was mildred calling to further abuse his small schlong theres two people both assholes who say i should meet you myra ascheims message began so where the fuck are you jack burns that was the messagenot very elegant and she didnt even leave her name jack knew it was myra only because hed met milly and recognized the sisterly voice it was a voice with more brooklyn in it than la emma must have noticed the despondency in jacks expression when he replayed the three messages again and again that some word from the insane housewife in benedict canyon was not among the messages appeared to pain him only emma knew jack well enough to guess that although he was relieved to let the relationship slip away he missed the womans madness emma oastlers first novel was called the slushpile reader which was almost entirely based on emmas jobnot that slushpile reader was her jobs official title with an uncustomary dignity as if her job were a pinnacle of the profession the studio called emma a first readera part of the process also called screenplay development emma read not only unsolicited manuscripts she read the scripts submitted by agents who were less than name brands and the occasional script by a marquee screenwriter whose agent had recently jerked the studio around very few screenplays were eventually producedand most of those had more important first readers than emma but emma would eventually read those scripts too what bothered emma about her job was not how many screenplays she had to read or even how badly written most of them were emmas principal gripe was with the studio execsthey read her notes but not the screenplays emma discovered that for the majority of scripts she read she was the only reader this inclined her to be overgenerous in her notes even in the case of bad screenplays she didnt want to be the sole reason a film wasnt produced even though emmas foremost complaint about many of the movies she saw was that they should never have been made in the first place but why would a studio hire a script reader especially for the slush pile if the studio execs wanted to read a bunch of bad screenplays jack asked her it seemed perfectly natural to him that in most cases a first reader meant an only reader not to emma she was both indignant and unreasonable about it the execs should still read them even if theyre bad she insisted but they hired you emma so they wouldnt have to read all the junk someone wrote that junk baby cakes it took hours and hours emma surely exaggerated what she called wasting her time as a film major what was the point of learning to appreciate good films emma argued the way the movie industry worked had nothing to do with film as an art form jack thought that emmas motive for revenge was misguided it was the machinations of the movie industry that had wasted her time not her having been a film major emma insisted that the studio execs were responsible for making many terrible movies that should never have been made therefore to make some small measure of atonement for their crimes they should read their fair share of bad screenplays jack argued that emma should have been more upset about what happened in that rare case of an unknown screenwriter who wrote a script the studio execs actually read and liked on only two occasions had emma loved an unsolicited screenplay both times shed managed to persuade the execs to read it in each case they promptly bought the rights and offered the screenwriter a fee to write a second draft they rejected the second draft paid off the screenwriter and hired an established writer to reconstruct the story in all the usual conventional ways whatever quality had been good enough to catch emmas attention in the original script was lost but the studio now owned and continued to develop what they called the property this didnt upset emma at all its the writers faultthe writer caved to the money thats what the damn writers do you want to maintain control of your screenplay you take no money up frontyou dont even let the fuckers buy you lunch honey pie but what if the writer needs the money jack asked the writer probably needs lunch then the writer should get a day job emma said arguing with emma drove jack crazy it also worried him about emmas novelthat the writing would descend to a level of autobiographical complaining that it would be an unimagined story without an iota of invention full of rantings and accusatory anecdotes hed heard before that the main character of the slushpile reader was a young canadian womana newcomer to la whod gone to school back east and had emmas jobdid not jack thought bode well but it turned out that emma had invented a character who seemed most unlike herself shed actually imagined a story one that was far more interesting than her own and sentence by sentence she wrote wellshed taken the necessary pains to revise herself furthermore emma had envisioned a heroic characterone capable of touchingly unselfish gesturesnotwithstanding that emma was generally too cynical to be heroic herself the main character of the slushpile reader the eponymous reader is not a cynic on the contrary michele maher of all names is a purehearted optimist with an indestructibly sunny disposition michele maherthat is emmas characteris such a good girl that her purity survives her most degrading experiences and she has a few unlike emma michele is a preternaturally thin young woman who has to force herself to eat she haunts gyms and healthfood stores gagging on protein powder and popping all the dietary supplements that bodybuilders use but she never manages to put on a pound despite all her weightlifting she looks like a wire michele maher has the body and metabolism of a twelveyearold boy also unlike emma michele is consciencestricken by the bad scripts she reads the worst most selfdeluded screenwriters break her heart michele wants to help them be better writers to that futile end she writes them encouraging letters on the studio letterhead these letters are very different in content and tone from the notes michele submits to the studio execs in those notes she is critical in the extreme in short michele does her job well she tells her bosses all the reasons why they shouldnt waste their time reading this crap but to the rockbottom writers themselves michele maher is an angel of hope she always finds something positive to say about their most abhorrent excrescences in the first chapter of the slushpile reader michele writes a warm enthusiastic letter to a heavily tattooed bodybuilder and porn star named miguel santiago his porn name is jimmy in his pathetic screenplay which is the story of his life santiago describes himself as a porn star who hates his work the only way santiago can have sex on command is to imagine he is a young james stewart falling in love with margaret sullavan in the shopworn angel or submitting to the sentimental bliss of domestic life with donna reed in its a wonderful life santiago manages to stay the course through such epics as bored housewives and keep it up inc by imagining he is the one and only jimmy stewart in these blackandwhite soapopera masterpieces theres no story we see miguel santiago lifting weights and getting tattooed we see him memorizing lines from the shopworn angel and its a wonderful life and of course we see him performing as the other jimmy in her notes to the studio execs michele maher states that such a film is not makableeasily a third of it would be a porn movie but in her letter to miguel santiago michele calls his screenplay a bittersweet memoir and her letter takes a personal turn she asks miguel where he works out santiago of course imagines that michele maher is a studio execnot a slushpile reader little does he know that she goes to the video store and rents all four of the bored housewives movies in one of her more selfdegrading moments michele masturbates to keep it up inc sexually repressed she goes to the gym where miguel santiago alias jimmy trains just to watch him work out in this respect michele maher is like emma she has a thing for bodybuildertypes but unlike emma michele doesnt usually act on her cravings and what bodybuilder would ever hit on michele shes built like a pencil what makes the slushpile reader moving is that miguel santiago is a dimwitted but genuinely nice guy when michele maher gets up the nerve to introduce herself to him she confesses shes no execshes just a first reader who felt sorry for him they begin a relationship that one reviewer of the slushpile reader would call la dysfunctionalthis was in praise of the novel which generally got terrific reviews more noir than noir said the new york times miguel and michele end up living togetherwithin breathing distance of a sushi dumpster in venice jack knew where that came from they dont have sex his schlong is too big for micheleit hurts she just holds it jack knew where that came from tooif not the too big part over time out of his growing and abiding love for her miguel introduces michele to other bodybuilders he knows at the gym hes seen them in the shower so he knows whos got the small schlongs michele sleeps with them a muted pleasure as she puts it to miguel holding his pornmovie penis with mixed emotions she tells him shes happy as for miguel santiagoaka jimmy the penile phenomenonhe gets all the sex he wants or needs at his day job which he stoically endures he accepts his relationship with michele for what it is michele sleeps with the occasional small schlong but she always goes home to miguel and they lie in bed together she holding his huge unacceptable penisthe two of them not saying anythingwhile they watch waterloo bridge on the vcr the remake with vivien leigh and robert taylor its miguels kind of movie a real tearjerker at the end of emmas novel michele maher and miguel santiago are still living together michele doesnt write letters of encouragement to bad screenwriters anymore she restricts her comments to the notes she gives the studio execs who never read the screenplays she reads the worst scripts still break her heart but she doesnt talk about her day when she comes home to miguel naturally he doesnt talk about his they consume some protein powder and dietary supplements and they go to the gym he says he likes it when she sleeps in a world gym tank topher small almost nonexistent breasts are easy to touch under the angry gorilla holding the bending barbell there are worse relationships in la emma writes it was a line quoted in a lot of her reviews and a pretty good setup to the novels last sentence if you or your partner is in a bad movie or in any number of bad movieseven if youre perpetually in the act of rewriting the same bad moviethere are worse things to be ashamed of jack liked the novels first sentence better either there are no coincidences in this town or everything in this town is a coincidence take the message on the answering machine from myra ascheim for example jack didnt know that emma already knew who mildred ascheim was not to mention that emma had been watching porn films day and nightresearch for the slushpile reader she later called itand this was before he happened to meet hank long on the set of muffy the vampire hooker and jack and emma started watching hank long movies together jack told emma that he couldnt read about miguel santiago without seeing hank long in the part but emma objected to his premature conclusion that her novel would one day be a film spare me the movie talk baby cakes was how she put it youre getting ahead of yourself jack first read the slushpile reader while the manuscript was still making the rounds of new york literary agents emma had decided she was more american than canadian and she wanted to sell the us rights before she even showed the novel to a toronto publishernotwithstanding that charlotte breastswithbonesinthem barford her old pal from st hildas was a young upandcomer in canadian publishing did you have to call her michele maher jack asked emma i adored michele maher i worshiped her i will always worship her you never even met her emma you kept her away from me jack besides michele is a very positive characterin the book i mean michele is a very positive character in real life jack protested youve given her the body of a twelveyearold boy youve made her this pathetic creature whos enslaved to bodybuilders its just a name emma said youre overreacting naturally jack was sensitive about the smallschlong business toothat part about sleeping with a guy with a small penis being a muted pleasure its a novel honey piea work of fiction dont you know how to read a novel youve been holding my penis for years emma i didnt know you were making a size assessment its a novel emma repeated youre taking it too personally youve missed the point about penises jack what point is that when theyre too big it hurts baby cakes i mean it hurts if the woman is too small jack thought about it he hadnt known that a woman could be too small too big maybe but not too small did emma mean that a muted pleasure was preferable to pain was that the point then he saw that emma was crying i liked the novel he told her i didnt mean that i didnt like it you dont get it emma said jack thought she was talking about the slushpile reader which he believed hed understood fairly well i get it emma he said it may not be exactly my cup of teai mean its hardly an oldfashioned novel with a complicated plot and a complex cast of characters it may be a little contemporary for my tastea psychological study of a relationship more than a narrative and a dysfunctional relationship at that but i liked iti really did i thought the tone of voice was consistenta kind of sarcastic understatement i guess youd call it there was a deadpan voice in the more emotional scenes which i particularly liked and the relationship imperfect though it is is better than no relationship i get that they dont have sex they cant have sex butfor different reasonsnot having sex is almost a relief for them oh shut the fuck up emma said she was still crying what dont i get he asked its not the novel you dont getits me she cried im too small jack emma said softly even notverybig guys hurt me jack was completely surprised emma was such a big girl such a strong young woman and she was always battling her weight she was much taller and heavier than jack how was it possible that she was too small have you seen a doctor he asked a gynecologistyes several they say im not too small its all in my mind apparently the pain is in your mind he asked her no thats not where the pain is she said emmas condition had an uncomfortablesounding name vaginismus emma explained was a conditioned response often a spasm of the perineal muscles occurred if there was any stimulation of the area in some women even the anticipation of vaginal insertion could result in muscle spasm you want to avoid penetration jack asked emma its involuntary honey pie i cant help itits chronic theres no treatment emma laughed shed tried hypnosisan attempt to retrain the muscles to relax instead of involuntarily contracting but even the psychiatrist had forewarned her that this worked with only a small percentage of sufferers and it hadnt worked with emma on the advice of a toronto gynecologist emma had experimented with a treatment known as systematic desensitizationor the qtip method as her los angeles gynecologist disparagingly called it by inserting something as narrow as a qtipand when this was accomplished progressively inserting slightly larger objects stop jack told her he didnt want to know all the treatments shed tried has anything worked he asked emma the only thing that worked and this didnt work every time was the absolute cooperation of a partner i have to be on top baby cakes and the guy cant move at all if he makes even one move i get a spasm emma had to be in complete control all the moves were her moves only that worked it went without saying that such a willing partner was hard to find jack was thinking many things most of them unutterable how emmas attraction to bodybuilders wasnt the best idea how her longstanding interest in boys much younger than herself made more sense and he remembered how adamant emma was about not having children no doubt the vaginismus was a reasona more compelling one than fearing shed be a bad mother or like her mother it would have been insensitive to ask her if shed inquired about a surgical solution to her problem emma felt squeamish in a doctors office she dreaded everything medical most of all surgery besides it didnt sound as if there was a surgical solution to vaginismusnot if it was all in her mind jack didnt have the heart to tell emma that she should consider revising the slushpile reader he thought that the vaginismus would make a better story than all the smallschlong bigschlong businessnot to mention the unlikelihood of the michele maher character having a vagina that was too small but he understood that emmas fiction was a purer choicea fable of acceptance and as close as emma could allow herself to approach her problem a life in the top position a lifetime looking for the unmoving partner it seemed too cruel or would this method eventually train her perineal muscles to relax what causes vaginismus jack asked but emma might not have heard him or she was distracted maybe she didnt know what caused itmaybe nothing didor else she didnt want to discuss it further they took off their clothes and went to bed emma held his penis jack got very hardunusually hard it seemed to himbut all emma said was youre not really all that small jack smallish i would say if i were you honey pie i wouldnt worry about it emma didnt exactly say shed seen smallerhed only heard her say shed seen biggerbut jack didnt press her it was enough that she held his penis he was awfully fond of the way she held it we should move emma said sleepily maybe roommates arent the best readers jack ventured to say touching her breasts i didnt mean we should stop living together jack i meant im sick of venice that struck jack as too bad but he didnt say anything he would miss veniceeven leau de dumpster from hama sushi he had grown fond of world gym anddespite emmas bad experiencehe occasionally went to golds though jack burns was no bodybuilder in both gyms when he wanted to use the free weights he did his lifting at the womens end of the weight room youre going to be a strong boy jacknot very big but strong leslie oastler had told him do you think so hed asked her i know so mrs oastler had said i can tell jack lay there remembering that with his smallish penis as hard as a diamond in emmas big strong hand jack had small hands like his mother he lay there thinking how strange it was that he hadnt thought of his mom in months maybe jack didnt like to think of her because he believed he more and more reminded her of his father and while it wasnt his physical resemblance to his dad that bothered jack surely any resemblance he bore to william would have been upsetting to alice jack just got the feeling that his mother didnt like him jack was also wondering where he and emma might move hed once mentioned the palisades to emma it was like a village you could walk everywhere but emma said the palisades was swarming with childrenit was in her view a place where formerly sane people went to breed jack guessed that they wouldnt be moving there clearly beverly hills was too expensive for them besides it was too far away from the beach emma said she liked to see the ocean every daynot that she ever set foot on the beach malibu maybe jack was thinking or santa monica but given emmas revelation that sex hurt herquite possibly it hurt her most of the timeit would have been insensitive of jack to pursue a conversation about where they might move save it for another time he thought say it in latin for me he said to emma she knew what he meantit was the epigraph shed set at the beginning of her novel she went around saying it like a litany but until now jack had not realized she meant them nihil facimus sed id bene facimus emma whispered holding his penis like no one before or since we do nothing but we do it well jack said in english holding her breasts it was the fall of rain man would be the years topgrossing film and would clean up at the academy awards jacks favorite film that year was a fish called wanda he would have killed to have had kevin klines part for which kline would win an oscar for best actor in a supporting role jack burns was twentythree emma oastler was thirty boy were their lives about to change jack met myra ascheim at a breakfast place on montana shortly after he and emma had moved to a rental in santa monica emma who bought all jacks clothes dressed him for his meeting a coffeecolored longsleeved shirtuntucked with the top two buttons unbuttonedmediumtan chinos and the darkbrown loafers he wore as a waiter his hair was a little long with more gel in it than usual and he hadnt shaved for two daysall of which was entirely emmas decision she said he was almost feminine when he was cleanshaven but three days growth made him too toshiro mifune the shirt was linen emma liked the wrinkles jack was reminded of mrs oastler buying his clothes for reddinglater for exeterand he commented to emma that he felt remiss for never thanking her mother emma was spreading the gel through his hair with her hands a little roughly and she paid my tuition at both schools jack added your mom must think im ungrateful please dont thank her honey pie why not he asked just dont emma said yanking his hair it was evident that no one had dressed myra ascheim as attentively as leslie oastler and emma had dressed jack he first mistook myra for a homeless person whod wandered east on montana from that narrow strip of park on the pacific side of ocean avenue she was smoking a cigarette on the sidewalk in front of the marmalade caféa woman in her late sixties maybe seventy wearing dirty running shoes baggy gray sweatpants and a fadedpink unlaundered sweatshirt with her lank dirtywhite hairin a ponytail that protruded from an anaheim angels baseball cap from which the halo had fallen off the letter amyra bore no resemblance to her younger and far more stylish sister mildred she even toted an overstuffed shopping bag in which she carried an old raincoat jack walked right by her it wasnt until myra spoke to him that he recognized her and then it was only because she had millys pornproducer voice you should lose the stubble she said and go easy on the gel in your hair you look like youve been sleeping under a car ms ascheim he asked what a bright boy you are jack burns and dont listen to lawrenceyoure not too pretty lawrence said i was too pretty jack asked holding the door for her lawrence is a fink and a liar you cant be too pretty in this town myra ascheim said or too successful the issue of how successful or not myra ascheim had ever been was never made clear to jackor to his knowledge to anyone else no one had either corroborated or repudiated the hollywood legends attached to myra all of them stories about who she used to be was she once an agent whom icm wooed away from william morris or did caa woo her away from icm was she eventually fired from all three agencies or did she go off on her own of her own volition did she once represent julia roberts was it sharon stone she was supposed to have discovered or was that demi moore and was myra truly the first person to refer to demi as gimme moore jack later ran into lawrence at the bar of raffles lermitagenot jacks favorite hotel in beverly hills but a watering hole lawrence loved lawrence told jack that demi moores nickname of gimme was his idea not myras but myra was rightlawrence was a fink and a liar and whether or not myra ascheim ever represented julia roberts myra had maintained her contacts with casting directorsalmost all of whom liked her even if myra no longer represented anyone casting directors still returned her calls bob bookman who was emmas agent at caa before he became jacks told jack a story about myras identifying baseball cap she wasnt an anaheim fanshe didnt even like baseball she liked the a on the hat but she detested the halo its an alist hat but im no angel she liked to say according to bob bookman myra bought an angels cap every year and removed the halo with a pair of fingernail clippers i saw her do it over lunch bookman said myra snipped off the halo while she was waiting for her cobb salad the cobb salad made the story ring true aside from breakfast a cobb salad was all jack ever saw myra eat alan hergottwho became jacks entertainment lawyersaid that myra always left the same message on his answering machine call me back or ill sue your pants off that sounded like myra in this town you get tired of hearing something you already know alan told jack youre supposed to sound or at least look interested but you know more about the story than the guy whos telling you the story does myras different she always knows something you dont know true or notit doesnt matter in hollywood there were as many myra ascheim stories as there were stories about milton berles penis and to think that jack burns met her because his schlong was small or smallishand only because he met her pornproducer sister milly first in fact if it hadnt been for lawrence jack might never have met the ascheim sisters and he met lawrence only because the fink wanted to bang emma knowing emma she probably had an instinct that steered her away from lawrencemaybe his schlong was all wrong for her or she knew that lawrence would never relinquish the top position actually im no longer an agent myra told jack over their breakfast at marmalade they were sitting at a kind of picnic tablecommunal dining in santa monica my sister and i have created a talentmanagement company this information confused jack given his limited albeit specific knowledge of the other ascheim but he would make a point of never trying to grasp how the industry worked from the beginning jack burns realized that his job was getting a job he already knew how to be an actor a man had spread a newspaper over one end of the picnic table he sat on the bench beside jack muttering as if he bore a lifelong grudge against the news at the other end of the table nearer to myra than to jack was a family of foura young harried couple with two quarreling children like rottweiler myra ascheim had plucked bruno litkins from jacks résumé the gay heron as jack had called bruno was the only marketable name among jacks earliest supporters i dont suppose you are a transvestiteyou just know how to look like one myra said i just know how to look like one jack concurred ill let you know jack when i sense a surfeit of transsexual roles the children at myras end of the table were bothering her a little boy maybe six or seven had ordered the oatmeal with sliced bananas then he picked all the bananas out he wanted some of his older sisters bacon instead but she wouldnt give him any if you wanted bacon you should have ordered it the childrens mother kept telling him you can have my bananas the boy told his sister but the bacon was not negotiablenot for bananas looktheres a lesson here myra said crossly to the little boy you want her bacon but youve got nothing she wants thats not how you make a deal in the movie business jack was learning meeting people was an audition you didnt even have to know which part you were auditioning for you just picked a part and played it any part jack looked at the little girl who had the bacon she was nine or ten she had three strips of bacon she was his audience of one for the moment but jack was auditioning for myra ascheim and myra knew it in blade runner rutger hauer plays the blond androidthe last to die he holds harrison fords life in his hands but rutger is dying hed rather have someone to talk to than die alone ive seen things you people wouldnt believe rutger hauer says that was the moment jack had in mind that was the tone of voice jack adopted when he spoke to the girl about her bacon i have a younger brother jackasrutgerhauer began he was always asking me for my stuffhe wanted my bacon just like your brother wants yours maybe i should have given him the bacon at least one strip why the girl asked i was in a motorcycle accident jack said when he touched his side he winced his sudden intake of breath made the little boy squish one of his banana slices the handlebars went in herethey went right through me not while were eating myra ascheim said but the children and jackasrutgerhauer ignored her i thought i was going to be okayi lost only one kidney jack explained we have two he told the little boy you have to have at least one whats wrong with the one youve got the little girl asked jack shrugged then winced again after the handlebars apparently it hurt to shrug too he was thinking of the way rutger hauer says all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain jack said my one remaining kidney is failing time to die myra ascheim said with a shrug those are rutger hauers last words in blade runner myra obviously knew the movie too of course i could ask my brother for one of his kidneys jack went on only a brothers bodypart would work inside meonly a brothers or a sisters and i dont have a sister so ask your brother the girl said excitedly i suppose i better ask him jack agreed but you see the problem i never gave him my baconnot even one strip whats a kidney the boy asked his sister carefully placed a strip of bacon beside his bananaless bowl of oatmeal heretake this she told him you dont need a kidney ill let you know jack when i sense a surfeit of rutger hauer roles was all myra ascheim said but jack knew hed nailed the audition the girl sat watching her brother eat the bacon jack could tell she was still thinking about the accident can i see the scar from the handlebars she asked not while were eating myra said again jack had been so focused on his audience of one hed not noticed when the man with the newspaper had left in any performance even a good one somebody always walks out but after breakfast out on montana myra was critical of jacks audition you lost the newspaper guy he didnt buy the handlebars not for a minute the girl was my audience jack said the girl and you the girl was an easy audience myra told him you kind of lost me with the handlebars too oh lose the ohits a meaningless exclamation jack jack realized that he wasnt sure what a talentmanagement company did or how what myra did was different from what an agent did dont i need an agent he asked her let me find you a movie first myra said a movie and a director the best time to get an agent is when you dont really need one jack would often think how his career and his life might have turned out differently if myra ascheim had found a different movie from the one she found for himor at least a different director but he knew that one thing you were powerless to change was your first break and you could never calculate the influence of that initial experience on what happened to you next every young actor imagines there is a special parta groove in which he or she is a perfect fit welljacks advice to young actors would be hope you never get the perfect part the groove that myra ascheim found for jack burns his first film became a rut principiis obsta mr ramsey would write to him quoting ovid beware the beginnings two candles burning ultimately jack burns owed his success to william wild bill vanvleck who was also called the mad dutchman and the remake monsterthe latter for his deplorable habit of stealing his stories from classics of the european cinema and crassly reinventing them for american movie audiences hence the brilliant knife in the water roman polanskis first feature film which was made in poland in was remade by vanvleck in as my last hitchhikerabout a couple with a troubled relationship who go off for a weekend of skiing not sailing and pick up a transvestite hitchhiker jack burns was born to be that crossdressing hitchhiker william vanvleck was both a screenwriter and a director variety once wrote that the remake monster never knew a film or a gender he couldnt change for the worse but if wild bill was a ripoff artist he had a survivors abundance of common sense he stole only good stuff and vanvleck brought a european kinkiness if not art to american sex and violencealways with a lavishness of deceit or duplicity that bill and many movie audiences loved for example there was a section of route between empire and winter park coloradoa steep road with lots of sturns it climbed over berthoud pass in the winter they closed the road when they blasted avalanches and you could see backcountry skiers and snowboarders hitching rides to wherever they parked their cars in the opening shot of my last hitchhiker we see a pretty female skier wearing a backpack her skis over her shoulder shes hitching a ride on route as everyone would find out its not a real girlits jack burns and he looks fantastic the reason jack got the part was not only that he had the bruno litkins transvestiteesmeralda connection the mad dutchman also liked the idea of the hitchhiker being an unknown the couple in the car take a good look at jackasagirl almost anyone would keep driving the woman says the man brakes stopping the car my last hitchhiker he says i promise you promised before ethan she tells him it was a pretty girl the last time too as jack is putting his skis on the roof rack of their car they take a closer look at him ethan stares at the pretty girls breasts the wife or girlfriend is more interested in jacks dark shoulderlength hair when jack gets into the backseat ethan adjusts the rearview mirror so he can see the hitchhiker better the woman notices this with mounting irritation hiim jack he tells them taking off the wig and wiping the mauve lip gloss off his lips with the back of his ski glove you probably thought i was a girl right the woman turns to watch jack put the wig in his backpack jack unzips his parka which fits him like a glove and removes to ethans horror his breasts putting the falsies in his backpack with the wig granted its a bmovieinspiring a cult of followersbut its a great opening hiim nicole the woman in the front seat says to jack shes suddenly all smiles justine dunn played nicole it was her last movie before her disfiguring careerending car crashthat famous fivecar smashup where wilshire boulevard tangles with the in the movie when ethan sees that jack is a guy he tells him to get out of the car you picked him up ethan give the guy a ride nicole says i didnt pick up a guy ethan tells her jack is looking over his shoulder out the rear window at the sturn behind them this isnt a very safe place to stop he says get out of the car ethan shouts a quick cut to the inside of a black van navigating the sturn some stoned snowboarders are passing a joint around nicoles lineif he gets out ethan im getting out with himplays as voiceover back on ethan and nicole in their stopped car he prevents her from undoing her seat belt the hitchhiker has already taken his skis off the roof rack he taps on the passengerside window which nicole lowers suddenly allguy jack says im sorry for the trouble but i catch more rides as a girl then he steps back from the car here comes the black van the van skids past the stopped car in a fourwheel driftone of the stoned snowboarders frantically giving ethan and nicole and jack the finger ethan and nicole are visibly shaken by the nearcollision but jack never even flinches the movie went downhill from there when they showed film clips from my last hitchhiker they always showed those first two closeups of jack when the film was released jack was twentyfour justine was twelve years olderan attractive older woman to jacks transvestite hitchhiker they have one really hot scene later in the movie jackasagirl is in the womens room at a skiresort restaurant fussing with his makeup in the mirror justineasnicole comes out of a stall straightening her dress they both look pretty good but justine is thirtysix and its no secret who looks better what ride are you trying to catch now she asks jack its called dinner he replies do you buy your own lift tickets she asks skiing is an expensive sport jack says with a shrug i try not to buy my own dinner justine is looking jack over when she says and what do you do after dinner i talk him out of it he tells her what do you do after dinner at this point in the film justineasnicole is still with ethanand shes not happy about it i try to talk him out of it she admits a little sadly thats when jack kisses her on the lips its disturbingly unclear if hes kissing her as a woman or as a man but what does it matter my last hitchhiker would wind up being a favorite of justine dunn fans after she was so tragically disfigured and disappeared from the big screen justine gathered an army of fans crazies for the most partthe kind of moviegoers who made heroes out of people killed or maimed in stupid accidents as for jack it was the start of something he felt powerless to stop as an exwrestler he knew how to lose weight and how to keep the pounds offhe had kept himself small he was a lightweight a former onethirtyfivepounder he had a leanandmean look as michele maher the real one had observed androgyny seems to suit you jack myra ascheim would tell him after wild bill vanvleck had made jack an aberrant sex symbola sexy guy who was if not to every taste arguably more sexy as a girl jacks role as the transvestite hitchhiker was three years before jaye davidsons debut as dil in the crying gameand though neil jordan was a firstrate writer and director and everyone knew wild bill vanvleck was not jack burns did it before jaye davidson did granted it was not a role jack could count on growing old in hollywood didnt exactly have a plethora of parts for foxy but graying mrs doubtfires nevertheless it was a good start jack wasnt as famous as emma whose first novel had been a new york times bestseller for fifteen weeks before my last hitchhiker opened in select theaters and emma was far more famous in toronto where there was no one more famous than a naturalborn canadian who made it big in the united states but to hear jacks mother talk not to mention mr ramsey you would have thought that jack burns had eclipsed jeff bridges as a transvestite anyway and was even bigger box office than harrison ford my last hitchhiker was an awful movie but jacks two closeups caught onthe parody on saturday night live didnt hurtand the candlelight vigil outside the ucla medical center where justine dunn lay in a coma from her awesome wreck made a talkshow celebrity out of wild bill vanvleck who spoke glowingly of jack burns of course he did myra ascheim had committed jack to making another movie with the mad dutchman by singing jacks praises for what had been less than a supportingactor role wild bill was promoting his next film which alas would not achieve the cultclassic status of my last hitchhiker although jack was the male and female lead in this one his second bmovie for the remake monster there was no justine dunn counterpartno celebrity actor or actress who suffered a welltimed car crash and lasting careerending disfigurement no unmerited publicity in other words meanwhile before his followup appearance as a crossdresser in another vanvleck remake jack was the beneficiary of emmas publicity for the slushpile reader which was considerable a people magazine piece in which emma referred to jack as her roommate included photographs of them looking cozy togetherthese in addition to that familiar movie still of jack transforming himself from a woman to a man the telltale smudge of palepurple lip gloss lending to that corner of his pretty mouth the wanton look of someone whos been roughly kissed its platonic love emma was quoted as saying were just roommates in another interview emma said i like taking pictures of jack hes so photogenic this was published with a photograph of jack asleep maybe only alice and mrs oastler believed that emma and jack werent lovers and jack knew that leslie had her doubts lawrence that fink had his doubts too emma told jack that she ran into lawrence having lunch at mortons lawrence had lost his job at caa but not to hear him tell it he bullshitted emma about starting his own talentmanagement company and wanting to be unencumbered like myra ascheim whom hed so confidently called a hasbeen lawrence was unencumbered at lunch emma observed he was just a liar who was out of a job mortonsthe enduring and expensive celebrity hangout on melrose in west hollywoodwas not a place where you wanted to be eating lunch alone no deals were going down for lawrence emma concluded maybe thats why he got a little crude with her do you still claim youre not banging your boyfriend he asked meaning jack does jack go on dates as a girl emma knew she could kick the crap out of him but she let it pass youre such a loser lawrence was all she said it was sufficiently gratifying to her that lawrence didnt seem to know he was in one of the least prestigious booths emma had resigned from her studio job as a script reader a couple of months before the slushpile reader was published screenplay development just isnt for me shed told them but one of the studio execs got hold of a set of her galleys there was a kind of code in hollywood too vague and virulently denied to be a rule you were not supposed to call an asshole an asshole not in writing it was the dim understanding of this studio exec that emma had violated the code to punish her the exec copied emmas script notes and distributed them to the rejected writers agents but the punishment backfired once you start making copies everyone sees them the execs at other studios read emmas notes after all many of the screenplays in question were still making the rounds a few of those scripts were now films in production a couple were in postproduction meaning theyd miraculously been shot and one had recently been released to tepid reviews naturally the reviews werent as insightful or wellwritten as emmas notes on an earlier draft of the screenplay even the rejected writers agents liked emmas notestwo of them offered her a job a celebrity talkshow host at an la radio station asked emmas permission to read some of her script notes on the air sure emma said everyone else has read them more publicity for the slushpile readernot that emma needed it this didnt win emma many friends among screenwriters but what really insulted the industry was that emma said she wasnt interested in writing a screenplay herselfespecially not an adaptation of the slushpile reader in the novel shed already made the point that the story was one third porn film no one would attempt to make a serious movie out of that material to virtually assure herself that no one would emma entangled the film rights to her novel with the kind of approvals never granted to writersnot to first novelists anyway she again asserted that she had no interest in adapting the slushpile reader herself yet she insisted on retaining script approval should anyone else be enough of a fool to write a screenplay and she insisted on having cast approval and director approvaleven final cut the slushpile reader couldnt be made as a movie under those outrageous terms when emma showed up at all the usual placesshe took jack with her more and moreit was widely assumed that she was doing research for another hollywood novel but jack didnt know at the time that this was the case he thought she just liked to eat and drink but emma saw herself as a specter sent to remind the studio execs that there was such a thing as a script reader who could write in the movie business they were already speaking admiringly of the slushpile reader as not makable which could be quite a compliment in the industryprovided you didnt make a habit of it jack worried about emma she had bought the house theyd been renting in santa monica for no good reason the move from venice had irritated her she said she didnt want to move again but if the house in santa monica was no prize to rent it was just plain stupid to buy it it was a twostory threebedroom house on the downhill end of entrada drivenear where entrada ran into the pacific coast highway you could hear the drone of traffic on the pch over the airconditioning furthermore as if emma and jack were permanently drawn to the perfume of restaurant dumpsters the driveway of the house intersected the alley behind an italian restaurant it wasnt sushi they smelledit was more like old eggplant parmigiana but they were living on entrada drive when emmas first novel was published and she became what she called with no small amount of pride a selfsupporting novelist her revenge on having wasted her time as a film major was complete she had made it in the industrys hometown by writing of all things a novel staying in the house on entrada even buying the stupid place was another way of thumbing her nose at the industry emma had come to la as an outsider it meant a lot to her to stay an outsider im not moving to beverly hills baby cakes yeah wellwe sure do a lot of eating there jack reminded her it was a lot of latenight eating for the most part jack didnt drink so he was always the driver emma could drink a bottle of red wine by herselfusually before she finished her dinner she had a special fondness for kate mantilini in beverly hills kate mantilini is quite a distance to travel for a steak sandwich and mashed potatoes jack complained he didnt eat bread not to mention mashed potatoes but emma loved to eat at the long bar that ran the length of the restaurant the industry crowd all knew her and asked her how the new novel was coming its coming was all emma would say have you met my roommate jack burns he was the chick in my last hitchhikeri mean the hot one i was the hitchhiker jack would explain despite myra ascheim telling him to lose the stubble he was usually growing a little something on his faceanything that might mitigate his androgynous first impression monday nights emma and jack went to dan tanas in west hollywood you could watch monday night football on the tv at the bar yet the waiters wore tuxedos there was a mostly hip hollywood crowdpeople in the biz or trying to be but in the curious company of assorted gangsters and hookers there were redvinyl booths and redandwhitecheckered tablecloths and the items on the menu were named for filmindustry celebs youre gonna have a lamb loin named after you one day honey pie emma would tell jack she usually ordered the lew wasserman veal chop after wasserman died jack felt funny about eating thereas if the veal chop in his name were a piece of lew himself emma also liked the steak à la diller but jack ate lightoften just a salad he was back on iced tea bigtime as during his days cutting weight as a wrestler with a halfgallon of tea on an empty stomach jack could dance all night emma liked latenight music too she was crazy about a place in west hollywood on sunset boulevardcoconut teaszer it was a bit sleazylots of rock n roll and fast sweaty dancing very young kids went there emma would occasionally pick up a boy and bring him home jack made an effort not to watch them making out in the backseat listen she would always say to the kid you gotta do exactly what i tell you jack tried not to listen he also tried not to imagine emma in the top position he didnt like to think about her vaginismus but he would remember the night he found her in tears in the bathroomdoubled over in pain he said he wouldnt move she was crying he promised he wouldntthe little fucker the mornings after emma brought home some kid from coconut teaszer were the only ones when she wouldnt get up early to write her next hollywood novel number two as she would refer to itas if that were the title emma was disciplined even driven but the pressure was off shed published her first novel and seemed confident that someone would publish the second to a lesser degree the pressure was off jack too that he had made his first film with william vanvleckand worse was under contract to make another movie with himdidnt impress anyone at caa or at icm or the william morris agency perhaps when jack was free of any future obligation to wild bill one of those agencies would consider representing him but for now myra ascheim was looking after himhe was instructed to call myra his manager when jack quit his job at american pacific there were no hard feelings hed slept with only two of the waitresses and one of them had quit before he did even working for the remake monster beat being a waiter emma wanted jack to read her fan mail before he showed it to her she had no tolerance for anything negative jack was under orders to throw the criticism away and dont show me the death threats jackjust send them to the fbi there werent any death threats most of emmas mail was positive the worst of it in jacks opinion was how many of her readers insisted on telling emma their life stories it was amazing how many dysfunctional people wanted her to write about them emma read jacks fan mail before he saw it but he read all of his mail eventuallygood and bad he didnt get a twentieth of the mail emma received and most of his was both vaguely and not so vaguely insinuating letters always with photographs from transsexualschicks with dicks according to emmaand letters from gay men inquiring if jack was gay there was only the occasional letter from a young womanusually but not always stating that she hoped he was straight jack was more interested in emmas mail than he was in his because he kept thinking that michele maher would write to herdemanding to know why emma had used her name but there was no letter from michele maher about the slushpile reader it killed jack that he knew nothing about michele worse he imagined she had seen my last hitchhiker and found his performance as a transvestite to be resounding confirmation that he was too weird just wait till michele sees the next one baby cakestalk about too weird theyd both read vanvlecks screenplay which had prompted even emma to say words fail me it was a magical but unknown movie that wild bill had ripped off this time hed stolen a little gem from a fellow dutchman peter van engen who died of aids shortly after his first and only feature film was made called lieve anne frank in english dear anne frank as you might begin a letter to the dead girl it won a prize at some film festival in the netherlandsand it was dubbed for distribution in germany but nowhere else outside holland almost no one saw it yet william vanvleck had seen it and hed traduced lieve anne frank to such a degree that poor peter van engen couldnt possibly have recognized his own movienot even from the allseeing perspective of his grave lieve anne frank the voiceover begins it is the voice of a young jewish girl living in amsterdam today she is about the same age anne frank was when anne was caught by the nazis and taken to the death camp emma and jack saw the original dutch film in william vanvlecks home screening room the remake monster had an ugly mansion on loma vista drive in beverly hills wild bill liked whippets they ran free in the mansion slipping and falling on the hardwood floors vanvleck had his own chef and his own gardenera surinamese couple a childsize woman with a similarly miniature husband dear anne frank wild bill translated for emma and jack he had a smokers cough i believe that you live in me and that i have been born to serve you rachel is her name weekdays after school and on weekends she works as a tour guide in the anne frank houseprinsengracht the house is open as a museum every day of the year except yom kippur the anne frank house is beautiful in a sad way rachel says to the cameraas if we the audience were tourists and rachel our guide we see samples of annes handwriting facsimiles from her diary and many photographs rachel has cut her hair to look as much like anne as she can she despises contemporary fashion and dresses herself whenever possible in clothes anne might have worn we see rachel shopping in flea markets and secondhand clothing stores we see her at night hiding from her parents in her bedroom imitating poses and expressions we recognize from photographs of anne they could have gotten away rachel keeps repeating her father otto could have stolen a boat he could have steered a course from the prinsengracht the canal to the amstela river broader than the canal not to the sea of course but somewhere safe i know they could have gotten away by this point in the film nothing had really happened but emma was already in tears you seeits good isnt it vanvleck kept asking isnt it great rachel is obsessed with the idea that she is anne frank come back to life she believes she can rewrite history on yom kippur when the anne frank house is closed rachel unlocks the door and lets herself inside she dresses herself as annetransforms herself actually because the likeness is more than a little creepyand the next morning when the tourists are waiting to get in rachelasanne simply walks out of the anne frank house as if she were anne frank some of the tourists scream believing shes a ghost others follow her taking her picture she goes to the canal the prinsengracht where her father otto is waiting with a boat absurdly its a kind of gondolamore suited to venice than to amsterdamand otto is a most unlikely unitalianlooking gondolier anne boards the boat waving to her admirers theres a beautiful shot from the golden crown of the westerkerk of the boat passing on the prinsengrachtcrowds of wellwishers run to the bridges waving theres a shot of the little boat entering the broader water of the amstel more crowds more cameras clicking how the fantasy dies is almost entirely done with soundthe sound of soldiers boots on the cobblestone streets the sound of the boots on the stairs of the anne frank house which we see is empty some furniture has been tipped over annes writing has been scattered here and there she hasnt escaped emma was bawling her eyes out as jack sat there in that tasteless mansion on loma vista drive the sound of the mad dutchmans whippets dashing everywhere was somehow intercut in jacks mind with the sound of the storm troopers boots he couldnt imagine what a mess wild bill vanvleck was going to make of dear anne frank as it turned out the remake monsters screenplay would leave emma and jack depressed for days i think ill go to the gym jack told emma when he first read it after she said words fail me emma took a deep breath and announced she was going back to work i should have known when we saw the movie emma told jack later there was no way you were gonna be anne frank but that day they read the remake which was their first understanding of what would become of dear anne frank all jack could do was go to the gym and punish his body all emma could do was go back to work on her next hollywood novel the mad dutchmans screenplay was godawful being successful had made emma even more of a workaholic she usually got up with the rushhour traffic on the pch and drank several cups of strong coffee sometimes with her eyes closed but always with the music playingsomething too loud and metallic for jacks taste although it was a welcome change from the generally uninspired music out on the highway emma wrote all morningthe coffee was what she called her appetite suppressant of choice when she was famished she drove herself out to lunch she didnt drink at lunch although she was a big eaterboth at lunch and at her latenight dinners she liked le dome on sunset strip it had a stodgy old hollywood feeling but it was still a happening place for executives and agents and entertainment lawyers emma also liked spago in west hollywoodthe original spago up the hill on sunset boulevard and while it was too expensive even for the most successful of first novelists emma needed a weekly fix of the palm on santa monica boulevard where she said there were more agents than steaks and lobsters she was burning the candle at both ends because shed go to the gym after lunch and lift weights most of the afternoon after the weightlifting when she said she had digested she would do a hundred or more crunches for her abs nothing aerobic dancing and whatever sex she could manage in the top position were emmas aerobics it was a lot for a big girl to put her body through and jack didnt like to think of her drivingnot even in the daytime when she hadnt been drinking emma was a fast driver but the speed was only a small part of what bothered jack emma loved sunset boulevard even in toronto as a schoolgirl at st hildas she used to dream of driving on sunset boulevard emma tried to drive everywhere on sunsetout to beverly hills and west hollywood and hollywood all on sunset it was when she was driving back to santa monica that jack worried about her he knew shed had a big lunch and had crazily worked it off or not in the gym he worried about the curves on sunset and when emma took that left on chautauqua just before the palisades it was a steep twisting downhill to the pch you had to get into the farleft lane and make what amounted to a uturn on west channel it would be late afternoon rushhour traffic and emma was drained from her workout in the gymtwo or three litersize bottles of evian later with the traffic barreling down chautauqua into that last long curve emma would be three quarters of the way through the turn before she could see the ocean jack knew emma even her driving she wouldnt be watching the carsnot when she could see that first dazzlingblue glint of the pacific she was after all a toronto girl la affected you in direct proportion to where you came from there were no views of the pacific in toronto jack would wait in the entrada house for emma to come home then she would write that was when jack went to the gym he never told her he occasionally went to golds it was a good time to work out mostly the nondrinkers and a few noneaters were there jack met some pretty pumped women doing free weights but the ones on the cardiovascular machines were the ultraskinny girls and at dinnertime many of the skinny girls were anorexics one girlshe spent an hour every night on the stairclimbertold jack she was on an allsmoothie diet hows your energy he asked her berries teaspoon of honey nonfat yogurtevery third day a banana just put everything in the blender she told him your body doesnt need anything else she fell off the treadmill one night and just lay there one of the yoga instructors speculated that her colon had collapsed on itself jack would remember a bunch of bodybuilders standing outside the gym when they saw the ambulance they waved it down with their towels jack was on his usual dietmostly proteins maybe a little light on the carbs for all the time he spent on the cardiovascular machines he was taking it easy with the free weights nothing heavy just lots of reps he wasnt trying to bulk up his job meaning getting onethe next role and the role after thatdepended on his staying lean and mean jack was lightheaded with hunger by the time he left the gym every night when he went back to get emma and they drove out again to eatand his stomach was falling in on itself every morning you could say that jack was burning the candle at both ends toobut not like emma one night when she was wolfing down her mashed potatoes at kate mantilini emma noticed that jack hadnt finished his salad hed stopped eating and was watching her eat his expression was one of concern not disgust but jack should have known that emma would have found his disgust more acceptable are you thinking im gonna die young she asked him no he said too quickly well i am she told him if my appetite doesnt kill me the vaginismus will the vaginismus cant kill you can it jack asked her but emmas mouth was full she just shrugged and went on eating money shots batman and lethal weapon were among the topgrossing movies of but the oscar for best picture would go to driving miss daisy jacks second film with william vanvleck was called the tour guide it wouldnt win any awards the anne frank house has been reinvented in las vegas a tacky shrine to a dead rocknroll star clearly modeled on a prettier janis joplinthat would be jackdraws morbid fans of the late sexpot who earlier in the movie chokes to death on her own vomit following a drunken binge the dead singers name is melody her group pure innocence gets its start in the beatnik haunts of venice and north beach in the early s they abandon their folkjazzblues roots for psychedelic rock finding an audience and a home for themselves among the flower children in san francisco in everything in a william vanvleck remake was stolen from something else pure innocence and melodys leap to fame coincides with when janis joplin started singing with big brother and the holding company melodys first hit single you cant handle my heart like it was somethin else sounds suspiciously like big mama thorntons ball and chain jack didnt sing it half badly jackasmelody promptly dumps pure innocence and goes solo by melodys albums have gone gold and platinum and tripleplatinum she returns to being a blues singer with her last hit single bad bill is gone an ode to an abusive exboyfriendthe former lead guitarist in pure innocence whom the tabloids allege melody once tried to kill by lacing his favorite marijuana lasagna with rat poison that bad bill is gone sounded like me and bobby mcgee couldnt be a coincidence jackasmelody dies passedout drunk and choking on hisasher puke in a las vegas hotel room following a concert therehence the shrine to melodys short life and intense fame opens as yet another rocknroll museum this one at the mandalay bay end of the strip the crass display of melodys lessthaninnocent underwear is out of place and easy to overlook among those casinos and hotels on the strip but the mad dutchman had always wanted to make a movie in las vegas and the tour guide was it certainly wild bill could have found a better singer for melody but maybe not a hotter girl you were hot baby cakes emma told jack your singing lacked a little something but you were hotill give you that jack wasnt bad as the guy eitherthe eponymous tour guide himself lets keep it simple wild bill vanvleck told jack lets call the tour guide jack jackasjack is a devoted fan of pure innocence in the groups shortlived melody years jack is still in college when melody splits from the group he has only recently graduated when the singer dies his adoration of melody is deeper than the afterherdeath kind in the film jack appears to be dancing when he walksbad bill is gone or you cant handle my heart like it was somethin else is pounding in his head the sleazy manager of the melody museum as the shameless shrine is called hires jackasjack as a tour guide but jack is disapproving of some of the displays which he sees as exploiting melodynot that the slut singer didnt do plenty to exploit herself her collected musical instruments are innocent as are the photos of her tours and the music itself but there are compromising photographsof melody consorting with the lead guitarist who beat her of melody drunk and passed out on various motelroom beds and there are her clothes especially her intimate apparel no one should see or paw over her underwear jack believes jack also disapproves of the collection of empty wine bottles some of the dates on the labels indicate that melody died before the wines were bottled the manager a precursor of the harvey keitel character in holy smoke tells jack that the wine bottles are for atmosphere as for the displayed underwear a pink thong among othersthese items are essential just as rachel imagines that anne frank could have gotten away jack convinces himself that melody didnt have to die if only hed been around and had known her he could have saved her jack believes that the shrine to melody is a betrayal of her the seedier of her collected things are mocking her one night when the melody museum is closed jack lets himself inhe has a key he brings a couple of empty suitcases and packs up the items he considers too intimate or too damaging to melodys reputation the latter apparently is sacred only to him two cops in a patrol car see lights in the closed building and investigate but jackasjack has transformed himself into jackasmelody dressed as the dead singer he carries the suitcases past the stunned policemenout onto the vegas strip not every guy can get away with emeraldgreen spangles on black spandex it is the mad dutchmans sole directorial touch of genius until the scene when jackasmelody walks out of the melody museum toting the suitcases the audience has never seen the strip at night in its garish neon splendor inexplicably the cops let jackasmelody go do they think hes melodys ghost they dont look frightened do they know hes a guy in drag they dont look as if they care or do the copslike jack like the audiencerecognize that the melody museum is a twisted place do they think the shrine ought to be robbed wild bill vanvleck doesnt explain its the image the remake monster cares aboutjackasmelody walking up the strip in emeraldgreen heels and that hot dress lugging those obviously heavy bags as jack is leaving disappearing into the nightreborn as melody maybe or just looking for an affordable hotelthe sleazy manager sees himasher walking away jack looks so perfect that the manager doesnt try to intervene he merely shouts youre fired jackyou bitch in melodys voice jack says its a good job to lose jack burnss contribution to vanvlecks godawful scripthe was right about that line having legs the tour guide was by no means the worst movie of the year or of the following year which produced teenage mutant ninja turtles and die hard and the shot of jack burns in drag when hes saying its a good job to losewell everyone would remember that the film may have been forgettable but not that shotnot that line at the academy awards billy crystal was the host he was good but he may have been a bit too fast with one of his jokes it was a pretty knowing audience at the shrine civic auditorium but most of them missed the joke not jack who was watching the show on tv he got it but thats because it was his line billy crystal was talking about the possibility of being replaced as the host of the academy awards the audience groaned in protest at the very idea most of them then missed billy saying in a pointedly feminine way its a good job to lose that was when emma and jack knew he had made it shit did you hear that baby cakes they were in mrs oastlers houseemma and jack were back in toronto visiting their mothersbut alice and leslie were whispering to each other in the kitchen they missed billy crystals homage to jacks famous end line in the tour guide and they would go to bed before dances with wolves won the oscar for best picture jack had not only heard billy crystals joke he was genuinely impressed by billys imitation of jackasmelody christ he said no more mad dutchman honey pie emma said i cant wait for your next movie jack and emma were on the couch in the grand living room of what he used to think of as the oastler mansion that was before hed seen some of those real mansions in beverly hills if jack looked over emmas shoulder he could see the foyer at the foot of the main staircase where mrs machado had landed her highgroin kick with such devastating results emma had sold her second novel for big bucks shed taken the manuscript to bob bookman at caa before she submitted it to her publisher she had no intention of making the film rights unsalable this time bookman got her a movie deal before the novel was published which was just the way emma wanted it called normal and nice emmas second hollywood novel was about what happens to a young couple from iowa who go to hollywood to fulfill their dreams of becoming movie stars the husband johnny gives up his dream before his wife carol gives up hers johnny is too thinskinned to make it as an actor a couple of rough auditions and he packs it in besides hes a real clean livera nondrinker an overall straight arrow with boyish charm and a spotless driving record johnny gets a job as a limo driver soon hes driving a stretch given emmas knack for irony johnny ends up driving movie stars his lingering desire for the actors imagined life is reflected by his ponytail johnnys sole emblem of rebellion among limo drivers his ponytail is neat and clean and not very long emma describes johnny as attractive in a delicate almost feminine way long hair suits him johnny feels fortunate that the limousine company lets him keep the ponytail his wife carol isnt so lucky she goes to work for an escort servicemuch to johnnys shame but with his reluctant approval carol tries one service after another in alphabetical orderabsolutely gorgeous beautiful beyond belief and so on johnny draws the line at have you been a bad boy but it doesnt matter as carol discovers theyre all alike whether at instant escorts or irresistible temptations whats expected of her is the samenamely everything at one escort service carol might last a week or a month or less than a day it all depends on how long it takes for her to meet what emma calls an irregular customer once carol starts refusing to do what a client wants her days at that particular escort service are numbered not unlike the slushpile reader normal and nice reveals emmas sympathy for damaged deeply compromised relationships that somehow work carol and johnny never stop loving each other what holds them together is their absolute unshakable agreement concerning what constitutes normal and nice behavior carol does outcalls only she always phones johnny and tells him where shes goingnot just the hotel but the customers name and room numberand she calls johnny again when she gets to the room and when shes safely out but irregular requests are commonplace carol loses her job at one service after another finally johnny has a suggestion carol should have her own listing in the yellow pages the best thing carol ever has to say about a client is that he was nice nice means normalhence carol calls her escort service normal and nice emma writes she might have attracted more customers with a service called maternity leave who calls an escort service for normal and nice johnny starts pimping for carol he has some regular limo clients people johnny feels he knowsmovie stars among them youre probably not interested johnny says to the outwardly nicer of the gentlemen he drives around in his stretch but if youre ever tempted to call an escort service i know one particularly nice womannormal and nice if thats what you like nothing irregular if you know what i mean the first time johnny says this to a famous actor it is heartbreaking the reader already knows that instead of becoming a movie star johnny is driving them now carol is fucking them it seems that only older men are interested most of them arent movie stars either theyre character actorsvillains in the great westerns now with ravaged faces and unsteady on their feet old cowboys with chronic lowerback pain as children carol and johnny had seen these classic westerns they were the movies that made them want to leave iowa and go to hollywood in the first place at home in their half of a tacky duplex in marina del reyclose enough to hear and smell the la airportcarol and johnny play dressup games their roles reversed she puts her blond hair in a ponytail and dresses in his white shirt and black tie this prompts johnny to buy carol a mans black suit one that fits her she dresses as a limo driver then undresses for him johnny lets carol dress him in her clothes she later buys him his own bra with falsies and a dress that fits him she brushes out his shoulderlength hair and makes him uplipstick eye shadow the works he rings the doorbell and she lets himasher in he pretends to be the escort arriving in a strangers hotel room this is their only opportunity to acttogether in the same movie emma writes a veteran cowboy actor is in town to promote his new filmwhat emma calls a nouvelle western lester billings was born lester magruder in billings montana hes an actual cowboy and nouvelle westerns offend him its a sore point with lester that westerns have become so rare that young actors dont know how to ride and shoot anymore in the socalled western that lester is promoting there are no good guys no bad guys everyone is an antihero a french western lester calls it johnny sends carol to lesters hotel roomafter lester confesses to a hankering for a nice normal woman but lester really is a cowboy he climbs on carol there was nothing too irregularat first she assures johnny then while theyre proceeding in the regular way lester puts a gun to his head its a colt only one chamber of the revolver is loaded lester calls this cowboy roulette either i die in the saddle or i live to ride another day he hollers as lester pulls the trigger carol wonders how many girls in la escort services have heard the click of that hammer striking an empty chamber while lester lived to ride another day not this time its lesters day to die in the saddle in the midafternoon there arent many guests in the peninsula beverly hills to hear the gunshot besides the hotel doesnt cater to an especially youthful crowd maybe the guests in nearby rooms are napping or hard of hearing emma describes the peninsula as being sort of like the four seasons but with a few more hookers and businessmen because the hotel is adjacent to caa possibly an agent hears lester billings blow his brains out but nobody else and what would an agent care about a gunshot carol calls johnny she knows that no one noticed her crossing the lobby and getting on the elevator but what if someone sees her leave she is understandably distraught she believes that she looks like a hooker she doesnt really carol has always dressed like a studio exec having lunch in keeping with normal and nice she doesnt look like a call girl johnny saves her he comes to lesters hotel room with the requisite changes of clothes for carol and himself the limo drivers suit for carol together with the dress and bra and falsies carol bought for him by the time carol has applied his makeup and brushed out his shoulderlength hair johnny looks a lot more like a prostitute than carol ever has he tells her where the limo is parked its not farnor is it parked within sight of the entrance to the peninsula he says hell come find her when johnnyasahooker leaves the peninsula he makes sure hes noticed johnny has used a little bottle of bourbon from the minibar in lesters hotel room as a mouthwash he struts up to the front desk where heasshe seizes a young clerk by his coat lapels and breathes in his face theres something you should know johnnyasahooker says in a husky voice lester billings has checked out im afraid hes really left his room a mess then johnnyasahooker releases the young man and sways through the lobby leaving the hotel he and carol drive home to marina del rey where they change into their regular clothes at the end of the novel theyve stopped for the night in a motel room off interstate somewhere in the midwest theyre on their way back to iowa to find normal jobs and live a nice life carol is pregnant maternity leave as an escort service might have been wildly successful but carol wants no part of the businessnot anymoreand johnny is through with driving movie stars in the motel room off the interstate theres an old lester billings movie on the tvan authentic western lester is a cattle rustler he dies in the saddle shot dead on his horse normal and nice turned out to be a better movie than a novel and emma knew it would be the film was already in production while the novel was still on the new york times bestseller list many book reviewers complained that the novel was written with the future screenplay in mind naturally emma wrote the screenplay too among film critics there was some speculation that she might have written it before she wrote the novel emma wouldnt say jack didnt know the details of the deal she made with bob bookman at caa but while bookman didnt normally represent actors he agreed to represent jack whether it was in writingor something that was said over lunch or in a phone callit was understood that emma and jack were attached to the movie that would be made from normal and nice emma would write the script and jack would be johnny of course emma had jack in mind for the part from the beginninga sympathetic crossdresser and this time his shoulderlength hair would be real not a wig mary kendall played carolas innocent an escort as youd ever see jake prairie dog rawlings played lester billingshis first role in a long time and his only screen appearance not in a western when mary kendall and jack are holding hands in that interstate motel room just watching tv they have no dialogue in the same scene in the novel watching lester billings get shot carol says i wonder how many times he got killed in his career enough so he wasnt afraid of it johnny says but emma thought it was better if they didnt say anything in the film its more of a movie momentto just see them watching the old cowboy die their dreams to be movie stars have died too something of that is visible in carols and johnnys resigned expressions that green or bluegray light from the television screen flickers on their faces but jack would have liked to say the line enough so he wasnt afraid of it maybe youll get to use it later emma told him but not this time this time im the writer emma was more than that she was the architect of jacks future in film the reason he would make the leap from wild bill vanvleck to moreorless mainstream of course jack burns was still best known in drag but suddenly he was serious it was quite a surprise when jack was nominated for an academy award he hadnt thought of the crossdressing limo driver as being that sympathetic a part it was no surprise that jack wouldnt win that year it was mary kendalls first oscar nomination too and she wouldnt win either but they were both nominated which was more than theyd ever imagined the silence of the lambs would win best picture and jodie foster and anthony hopkins best actress and best actor respectivelyit was their year emma wasnt nominated screenwriters were nominated by screenwriters emmas famous script notes still rankled emma went to the oscars as jacks date which made it fun they generally agreed who the assholes were identifying the assholes was an important activity at an event like that billy crystal again the host made a joke about the evening being delayedbecause jack burns is still changing his bra emma had a very noticeable hickey on her throat jack had given it to her at her request she hadnt gone out with anyone in a long time she thought she was ugly and she hated her oscar dress at least make it look like someones kissing me honey pie mrs oastler spotted emmas hickey on tv in toronto couldnt you have put a little concealer on it leslie asked emma it was march the first time mrs oastler and alice stayed up to watch the entire academy awards show although jack told them not to bother he knew anthony hopkins was going to win best actor but leslie and alice stayed up to watch jack not win anyway they always showed a film clip of the nominated actors jack knew the shot he wanted them to use for him its his face at the wheel of the limojackasjohnny glances once in the rearview mirror at his wife carol whos all alone in the long backseat of the stretch carol is trying to put her hair and lipstick in order shes looking a little messy from a hotelroom groping by an overeager tourist at the beverly wilshire jacks eyes go briefly to the rearview mirror then back to the road its a look between stoic and noir he was proud of that closeup but with marketing theres no such thing as too obvious the film clip they showed instead was the callgirl shot jackasahooker is breathing bourbon into the face of the frontdesk clerk at the peninsula beverly hills theres something you should know jackasahooker tells the clerk in that husky voice lester billings has checked out im afraid hes really left his room a mess the money shot myra ascheim called it when emma and jack ran into her at the oscar party at mortons it had taken ages to get in the limos were backed up on robertson as far as they could see jack was unfamiliar with the phrase the money shot he repeated hes canadian myra explained jack saw that she was sitting with her sister mildred two tough old broads in a power booth emma would say later in a porn film milly ascheim explained without looking at jack the money shot is the maleejaculation moment you dont get it you got nothin either the guy delivers the goods or he cant whats it called when you dont deliver or you cant emma asked the porn producer crabs in ice water milly said you gotta deliver the money shot the equivalent of that shot of you as a hooker jack myra said condescendingly perhaps she was peeved with him because he hadnt recognized her she wasnt wearing her baseball cap i get it jack told the ascheim sisters he was anxious to leave emma was holding his hand jack could tell she wanted to leave too the two tough old broads were looking her over and it wasnt a friendly assessment it doesnt matter that you didnt win jack myra continued staring at emma it only matters when you win milly corrected her well we gotta gotheres another party emma said a younger one nice hickey mildred ascheim told emma thanks emma said jack gave it to meits a real doozy mildred shifted her examining gaze to jack hes cute isnt he myra asked her sister you can see what all the fuss is about jack could tell that milly ascheim was thinking over the word cute in her world jack knew cute didnt cut it i think hes cuter as a girl mildred ascheim said she was scrutinizing emma again ignoring jack he thought that milly was weighing whether or not to expose him that was when myra said youre just jealous milly because i met jack first uhohhere it comes jack thought but mildred ascheim surprised him she gave jack a withering look just to let him know she remembered how small his schlong was yet she didnt give him away it was not a reassuring lookon the contrary milly wanted jack to know that she hadnt forgotten a single disappointing detail of his audition in van nuys this just wasnt the time for her to bear witness for christs sake myra its oscar night milly told her sister we oughta let these kids enjoy it yeah we gotta go emma said again thank you jack told mildred ascheim milly was looking at emma once more she just waved to jack with the back of her hand he anticipated that milly would say something as he and emma were walking away a parting shot so long small schlongor words to that effect but milly held her tongue mark my words mildredjack burns has a world of money shots ahead of him jack heard myra ascheim say maybe milly said i still say hes cuter as a girl dont let those old bitches bother you baby cakes emma told him when they were back in their limousine they were drifting in a sea of limos jack didnt know or care which party they were going to next he always let emma be in charge after a night like that jack would have expected to hear from everyone he ever kneweven though he lost maybe especially because he lost but not that many people reached out to him caroline wurtz called alice though please tell jack i think he should have won miss wurtz said imagine giving an oscar to someone for eating people when jack and emma got back to their place in santa monica mr ramseys was the first message on the answering machine jack burns he cried that was all it was enough jacks old wrestling friends contacted him more slowly coach clum from redding wrote you made the right call jack cauliflower ears wouldnt have worked on a girl coach hudson and coach shapiro sent jack their congratulations too hudson said he hoped that jack wasnt taking any of those female hormones and that jacks boobs hadnt been implantsjust falsies shapiro was curious to know what had become of the slaviclooking beauty whose name he had forgotten hed been hoping to catch a glimpse of her at the academy awards coach shapiro meant claudia of course jack didnt hear from her not a word from noah rosen eithernot that jack expected to hear from him and not a sound from michele maher who had vanished without a peep herman castro thought shed gone to medical school but after that hed lost track of her naturally jack heard from herman but it was just a note way to go amigoyou got to the finals yes it felt like thathe had gotten to the finals and lost no contest there was no telling if or when he might get there again maybe the oscar opportunity had been a oneshot deal both terminator judgment day and the naked gun the smell of fear did much bigger box office than normal and nice but that little film and the academy award nomination gave jack burns a face that was recognized everywhere as a man or as a woman maybe as a man without a doubt jack hadnt as yet tried going anywhere as a womanexcept in the movies he was a celebrity now emma seemed determined that he take the utmost advantage of his fame to that end she persuaded jack to say he was writing somethingthough of course he wasnt keep it nonspecific baby cakes just say youre always writing this amounted to a conversationstopper in many of jacks interviews it sounded vaguely sinister as if the alleged something he was always writing were an exposé but of what it makes you more mysterious emma told him it adds to your noir thing did she mean that being a writer somehow enhanced his sexually ambiguous reputation as an actor some interviewers only wanted to talk about what jack was writing it drove them crazy that he wouldnt say for this reason alone it seemed worth repeating im not interested in settling down getting married having kidsnot right now he would usually begin nows the time to concentrate on my work you mean your acting well sure and my writing what are you writing something im just always writing even his mother wanted to know what jack was writing not a memoir i hope alice said laughing nervously leslie oastler regarded jack with regretas if if shed known he was going to become a writer she wouldnt have shown him her rose of jericho emma said her mom never stopped asking her if shed read any of jacks writing emma thought her lie was very funny not jack he didnt see the point of it when myra ascheim diedjack read her obituary in variety no one called himbob bookman said that jack didnt need a talent manager anyway having an agent at caa would suffice jack already had an agent and an entertainment lawyeralan hergott you need a money manager not a talent manager alan told him because he wanted to support his mother jack found a money manager in buffalo new yorkwillard saperston coming from buffalo willard had connections in toronto jack was getting killed by canadian taxes for starters willard told him that he had to become an american citizen which jack did he also became an investor in daughter alice that way his mom wouldnt pay taxes up the wazoo for every us dollar he gave her it crossed jacks mind that his mom might just sell daughter alice and stop being a tattoo artist it also occurred to him that if his moms relationship with mrs oastler was based on leslies financial support which hed once thought it was alice might leave leslie but jacks mother felt at home in the tattoo worldit was her one area of expertiseand whatever jack had once believed were alices reasons for moving in with mrs oastler hed been wrong to think that his mother wasnt leslies willing partner they were a couple who would go the distance as tattoo ole had first indicated jacks mother was daughter alice she was both an old hippie and a maritimer and shed lived up to her tattoo name jack might have spent more time in toronto if he could have made peace with thatthat and the fact that his missing father would never be a topic of conversation between him and his mom that jack burns was the son of a tattoo artist and that hed never known his fatherwell anyone could imagine how these things would figure in various interviews and profiles of the successful young actor the movie media never tired of an exotic childhood nor did entertainment journalists release their grip on every bone of dysfunction in a celebritys life in the words of one reporter jack had a tattooed past the latter observation was made all the more intriguing by the fact that neither jack nor his mom was tattooed canadian television always asked to interview jack and his mother in daughter alice and soon after the american media published a picture of jack with this or that dateexcept for emma they were never canadians and emma also for tax purposes had become an american citizenthere would be someone from cbctv in daughter alice asking alice if she knew the woman jack was seeing and if the relationship was serious oh i dont bug jack about his personal life alice would say with the unhurried insouciance of the perpetually stoned bob dylan would be yowling away in the background and jack doesnt bug me about mine jack met a meat heiress in new york samantha was an older woman she liked dressing jack in her clothes not to go outhe never once went out as a woman in new york and he wasnt with samantha very long he had a fling with an older woman in london tooemmas english publisher corinna was fascinated that jack was writing something naturally he never told her what it was for a publisher she had very sexy clothes but jack wasnt with her for long either both of these older women were jealous of his enduring relationship with emma and jack felt he wasted too much time flying from london and new york to la emma basically refused to leave their crappy house on entrada and jack missed her too much when he was away besides by not moving from santa monica emma and jack could afford to buy a really good car they bought a silver audi with gunmetalgray leather seats the same model jack had once driven as a parking valet in his brief employment at stans emma understood the symbolism of it just so long as it doesnt come with a kid in the backseat baby cakes having a car like that made jack glad he didnt drinknot that he drove appreciably faster according to emma jack was as irritatingly slow and overcareful a driver as ever but emma wasnt slow or overcareful it might have been safer to buy a house in beverly hills jack used to tell her he meant that emma might have done less driving so they went out and they came home or notand of course they met people jack was never with someone for more than a month or two at most there was no one emma was withnot for more than a night like the pretty boys she met dancing at coconut teaszer jack kept his hair long almost shoulderlength which made his occasional crossdressing more naturalif only in the privacy of a boudoir as a guy he still favored a little stubble he stayed lean and mean because that was his job jacks roles didnt always require him to transform himself from a man to a woman but the potential remained obdurately a part of his characteran element of his noir thing as emma called it onscreen jack was with just about everyone elisabeth shue before she did leaving las vegas cameron diaz in a stupid chick flick drew barrymore in a stephen king screamer he was nicole kidmans slowly dying husbandit took three quarters of the film for jack to die nicole kidman was much taller than jack burns but that wasnt evident from the movie in which jack never got out of bed jack was the guy julia roberts wisely didnt marry he told the lie that made meg ryan leave him he suffered as a smitten waiter the one who spilled the vichyssoise down gwyneth paltrows back bruce willis kicked the crap out of him denzel washington arrested him and jack was albeit briefly a bond girlthe one who was killed by a poisonous dart from a cigarette lighter when deduced jack was a guy myra ascheim had been right a world of money shots lay ahead of him if jack had to pick a favorite it would be that bit with jessica lee the almost crossdressing moment some critic in the new yorker called it jessica is a beautiful heiress jack is a thief and hes just slept with her shes taking a shower while jack is alone in her bedroom taking inventory of her assets theres pricey stuff everywhere hes just wandering around her bedroom in his boxer shorts while we hear jessica singing in the shower when jack comes to her wardrobe closet he is enraptured by her clothes its an inside jokejack burns fingering through a closet full of womens clothes not even the jewelry has attracted this much attention from the thief in his boxers its clear that jack loves her clothes hes so mesmerized that he doesnt hear the shower shut off jessica has stopped singing when the bathroom door opens and jessica is standing there in that terrycloth robeher wet hair wrapped in a towelher image is reflected in the mirror on the wardrobecloset door its a great shot jessica appears to be standing beside jack when he holds up her dress to his halfnaked body and takes a look at himself and at her in the mirror he is one cool thief boy ill bet this looks great on you jack says to jessica lee in the film jessicas character is completely taken in because thats the story shes in love with the thief but they had to shoot that scene ten times jessica herself wasnt taken in the first time she saw jack burns holding up a dress to his body jessica turned pale it wasnt in the script she saw something she didnt likesomething about jack it took her ten takes to get over whatever it was she saw it took jack a few takes too what was it what did you see he asked her later i dont know what it was jack jessica said you just gave me the willies jessica lees willies notwithstanding the final take was a keeper in any retrospective of jack burns his collected film clips there was that one of him and jessica in the mirror hes holding up the dress and saying boy ill bet this looks great on you shes in the doorway to the bathroom smiling that smile jessicas smile is wide enough to fall into big enough to consume you but jack could never see that clip without remembering the first look she gave him jessica wasnt smiling the first time and she wasnt acting moments like that made jack even more of an outsider when you know youve spooked someone you learn to be careful what emma called jacks noir thing was a bit creepy bankable yes but likable jack burns had found a closeup all his own it was more disquieting than toshiro mifunes scowl jack couldnt really see himself only his effect on others was it a sexually disturbing look yes definitely was it more threatening than noir wellit was beyond mischievous anyway its unpredictable honey piethats your look thats just acting he told her thats just keeping my audience of one on his toes jack thought no thats you baby cakes youre unpredictable thats whats scary about you jack im not scary he insisted jack thought that emma was the scary one he would remember where they were when emma said he was scary they were on sunset boulevard in the silver audi jack was driving they were in hollywoodchâteau marmont territory where john belushi diedand jack was trying to figure out what it was that had scared jessica lee maybe the dress was all wrong for me he said to emma i wish i could just forget about it boy am i sick of the bar marmont was all emma said because jack was famous he was always admitted to the bar marmont which was adjacent to the hotel it was big and noisy a scenelots of fake boobs and aspiring talent managers very trendy ultra young there were usually about thirty people outside being denied entrance on this particular night lawrence was among them emma looked the other way but lawrence caught jacks wrist youre not a girl tonight youre just a guy how disappointing to your fans lawrence cried emma caught him in the nuts with her knee then she and jack went inside together lawrence was lying in a fetal way his knees drawn up to his chest in a kind of birthing positionnot that anything was forthcoming jack would remember thinking that if hed kneed lawrence in the balls there would have been a lawsuit but emma could get away with it thats why he thought she was the scary one the château marmontthe hotel itselfwas another story jack didnt go to that lobby to be with a crowd but he often saw actors having meetings there jack would have a bunch of meetings in that lobbythe lobby was really a bar he preferred to have his meetings when he could choose in the bar at the four seasons hotel in beverly hills in jacks opinion this was where the classiest meetings happened he was convinced that famous ghosts would one day haunt the four seasons in beverly hillsactors whose meetings went awry but for jack it was the only place where he felt like an insider for the most part like emma he was still an outsider they were notoriously uncool the us wasnt their country la wasnt their town not that they were canadians either toronto didnt feel like home redding had been the first and last place jack had fit in somehow he and emma knew they would never fit in in la it wasnt a matter of being famous that was only what other people saw with the money theyd made emma and jack could have moved from entrada but jack was more and more persuaded by emmas determination to remain an outsider for them los angeles was a working town whatever else they were emma and jack were workers la was their job being seenbeing spottedwas part of the job part of jacks anyway emma didnt care who saw her in their own way they were gods emma and jackuncool canadian gods in the city of angels and like the gods they were remote they didnt see themselves all that clearly typical of the movie business they registered their performances by how they were received but in his heart jack burns knew that donald that prick maître d at stans had been right donald had seen through him jack was a hick from toronto via new hampshire yes he was a us citizen and a legal resident of santa monica california but jack wasnt truly living anywherehe was just biding his time at least he knew how to do that hed done it before with claudia naturally jack was making a ton of money yet jack knew that wasnt all there was or all that he was supposed to be jack was in torontounwillingly as usual emma wasnt with him though she generally spent more time there than he did being a writer was such a big deal in canada life is a call sheet emma wrote in the slushpile reader youre supposed to show up when they tell you but thats the only rule hanging out with his mom in daughter alice jack started arguing with her about tattoo conventions there never used to be tattoo conventions but lately alice had been going to one every month shed attended one in tokyo and another in madrid but mostly she went to the conventions in the united states they were everywhere the rare times alice came to los angeles were usually in the fall and not exclusively to visit jack not so coincidentally that was the time of the annual inkslingers ballthe la tattoo and bodypiercing convention it was allegedly the worlds largest they held it in the hollywood palladium on sunset boulevard a former swingera dance hall the new york tattoo convention where daughter alice was also a regular was held in the roseland ballroom on west fiftysecond streetthat one was in the spring the one in atlanta was also in the spring there was even one in mainein february despite her promises jacks mom never once came to maine to visit him at redding but she wouldnt miss the mad hatters tea party in portland alice went to the hell city tattoo festivalthis being in columbus ohio in a hyatt regency hotel that one was in june if jack remembered correctly he thought his mom liked philadelphia the best she had a photograph of herself with crazy philadelphia eddie he always wore a yellow sports jacket and had his hair so stiff with gel that it stood up like a roosters comb wherever the convention wasdallas or dublin the socalled meeting of the marked in pittsburgh the annual mans ruin in decatur illinoisdaughter alice went she had been to boston and to hamburg germany to her great disappointment herbert hoffmann had retired but she met robert gorlt in hamburg hes sixnine and played basketball in canada she told jack tattoo artists from all over the world came to these conventions from tahiti cyprus samoa from thailand and mexico and from paris berlin and miami they even came from oklahoma where tattooing was illegal there was nowhere alice wouldnt go to meet with her colleaguesincluding some sheraton in the meadowlands and it was always the same people who went if its always the same weirdos why go jack asked his mother why go again and again because we are the same weirdos jack because we are what we do we dont change for christs sake mom do you have any idea what sort of shit can happen to you in a hyatt regency in columbus ohio or in a fucking sheraton in the meadowlands if miss wurtz could hear you jack his mother said if poor lottie or mrs wicksteedmay she rest in peacecould hear you its so sad whats happened to your language is it california or the movie business thats done this to you done what to me maybe its emma alice said its living with that foulmouthed girli know it is its for christs sake this and fucking that to hear you talk youd think that shit were an allpurpose noun and you used to speak so well you once knew how to talk you enunciated perfectly she had a point but it was just like alice to change the subject here jack was trying to impress upon hera middleaged womanthat these tattoo conventions were freak shows and his mother got all in a knot about his language the conventions were absolutely terrifying the fullbody wackos turned up they had contests exconvicts were tattooedprison tattoos were a genre as distinctive as biker tattoos strippers were tattooed not to mention porn stars jacks research meaning countless hank long films had taught him that just who did daughter alice think these conventions were for jack had seen those angry voodoo dolls and the slashed heart with the dagger in itthe latter inscribed no regretat riley baxters tabu tattoo in west la on baxters business card under one such voodoo doll it said disposable needles alices waist had thickened but shed not lost her pretty smile her hair once an amber or maplesyrup color was streaked with gray but her skin was surprisingly unwrinkled and her choice in clothing took noticeable advantage of her full breasts she liked dresses with an empire waist and usually a scoop or square neckline at her age she wore an underwire brashe liked red or fuchsia that day in daughter alice she wore a peasantstyle dress with a neckline that dropped from the apex of her shoulders her bra straps were showing but they usually were jack thought that she liked her bra straps to show although she never wore a dress or blouse with a revealing décolletage my cleavage alice liked to say is nobodys business strange jack used to thinkhow his mom wanted everyone to know she had good breasts but she never bared even a little bit of them and what was a woman who wouldnt bare her breasts doing at tattoo conventions mom jack tried to say but she was fussing with a pot of tea shed turned her back on him and the women jack do you know any nice girls or have i just not met them nice like claudia she was nice whats happened to claudia i dont know mom what about that unfortunate young woman who had an entrylevel job at the william morris agency she had the strangest lisp didnt she gwen somebody he said that was all he remembered about gwenshe lisped maybe she was still at william morris maybe not gwen is long gone is she his mom asked do you still take honey in your tea dear yes gwen is long gone no i dont take honeyi never have actresses waitresses office girls meat heiressesnot to mention the hangerson his mom continued the what do you call them groupies i dont know any groupies mom there are more groupies in your world than there are in mine what on earth do you mean dear at the tattoo conventions there must be he said you should go to a tattoo convention jack then you wouldnt be so afraid i took you to the inkslingers ball he reminded her yes but you wouldnt go inside the palladium she said there was a motorcycle gang outside the palladium you said it was bad enough to see a bunch of fake boobs at nightyou werent going to hang around a bunch of fake boobs in broad daylight thats exactly what you said honestly your language mom that brit you were with in londonshe was as old as i am alice cried jack watched her put honey in his tea the door to queen street opened and a little bell tinkled as if daughter alice were a shop selling lace doilies or birthday cards the girl who came in was suffering some kind of inflammation from her latest piercing an object that looked like a cufflink made her lower lip stick out she had a ball and chain attached to one eyebrow which was shaved but only her lower lip was inflamed what can i do for you dear alice asked her i just made some tea would you like some yeah i guess the girl said i dont usually do tea but thats okay jack fix the young lady some tea please his mother said the girl was eighteenmaybe twenty tops her dark hair was dirty she was wearing jeans and a grateful dead tshirt shit you look kinda like jack burns she told jack except you look like a normal guy alice had put some music onbob of course jack is my son alice told the pierced girl this is jack burns oh wow the girl said ill bet youve been with a lot of women eh not too many he told her do you take honey in your tea yeah sure she said she kept touching her sorelooking lower lip with the tip of her tongue what sort of tattoo are you interested in dear alice asked her there was a sign in the window of daughter alice no piercing the girl had to have come for a tattoo the girl unzipped her jeans and hooked her thumbs under the waistband of her panties exposing a fringe of pubic hair above which a honeybee hovered the bees body was no bigger than the topmost joint of jacks little finger its translucent wings were a blur of yellow the little bees body was a darker shade of gold gold is a tricky pigment alice saidperhaps admiringly jack couldnt tell i take a bright yellow and mix it with brick red or you can use what they call english vermilionsame as mercuric sulfide i mix that with molasses jack was pretty sure this was three quarters fabrication alice would never tell just anyone how she made her pigmentsespecially a nonprofessional molasses the girl said i cut it with a little witch hazel alice told her its tricky to get a good gold jack believed that the witchhazel part was true the girl was looking at her honeybee with new eyes i got the bee in winnipeg she told them at tattoos for the individual i suppose alice said yeah do you know those guys the girl asked sure i know them you cant exactly get lost in winnipeg so you want a flower for the bee she asked the girl yeah but i cant decide what kinda flower the girl said jack was edging toward the door he thought hed take his chances out on queen street a fan or a lunatic would probably recognize him but jack burns didnt need to see someone get another tattoo where are you off to jack alice asked not looking at him she was laying out her flash of flower choices to show the honeybee girl you dont hafta go the girl said to jack you can watchno matter where she puts it that depends alice told her ill see you back at home jack said to his mom ill take you and leslie out to dinner both alice and the girl looked disappointed that jack was leaving bob dylan was yowling away idiot wind jack would always remember that song jack wasnt thinking about the girl he was trying to decipher more exactly the look of disappointment on his mothers face what is it about me that bothers you jack wanted to ask her but not with the honeybee girl there someones got it in for me bob complained every time jack came to toronto he felt that way they say i shot a man named gray and took his wife to italy bob sang away she inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me jack sang the next line out loud with bobnever taking his eyes off his mother i cant help it if im lucky he sangbecause that was the principal ingredient in the look his mom was giving him she thought hed been lucky so far jackso far alice called after him as he stepped out on queen street and closed the door to daughter alice iv sleeping in the needles billy rainbow jack was on a press junket in new york following miramaxs marching orders as emma put it the only thing memorable about this particular interview was not the opening question itself which hed been asked a hundred times before but the sheer clumsiness of how the journalist worded the questionthat and the fact that emma called in the middle of his oftrepeated answer and it was the last time jack would hear her voice his interviewer a matronly woman with a baffling accent was the same journalist from the hollywood foreign press who in a previous press junket had asked jack if he was modeling his appearance on that of a young martin sheen in apocalypse now she was drinking a diet coke and smoking a mentholated cigarette her artificially sweetened breath wafting over him like smoke from a fire in a mint factory captain willard has short hair jack had answered her that previous time capeetan who the martin sheen character in apocalypse nowcaptain willard hed said im not a hundred percent sure about his rank i didnt meana hees hair the journalist had said im not consciously modeling myself on a young martin sheen jack had told her im not trying to kill marlon brando either you meana young marlon brando the lady from the hollywood foreign press had asked him in the movie you mentioned he had explained to her slowly the young martin sheen character is sent to kill marlon brandoremember not a young marlon brando either forget eet shed said letsa move on this time her question was breathtaking in its awkwardness but she had at last moved on from martin sheen are you a person whowa though not a homosexual psychologically identifies weeth the opposite sexsa i meana weeth weemen am i a transvestite do you mean yes no buta you are always dressing as a woomanor you seem to be theenking about eet i meana dressing as a wooman even whena you are dressed as a man im not thinking about dressing as a woman right now jack told her its just something i occasionally do in a movieyou know when im acting are you writing about eet about dressing as a woman yes no his cell phone rang ordinarily he didnt answer his phone in the middle of an interview but jack could see that the call was from emma and shed been depressed lately emma was losing the fight with her weight every morning since hed been away emma called to tell him what she weighed it was almost lunchtime in new york but jack knew that emma was just getting up in la hed told her that he was being interviewed around the clockemma knew very well what press junkets were for in mild exasperation jack handed his cell phone to the lady from the hollywood foreign press this woman wont leave me alone he said to his interviewer try telling her im in the middle of an interview see how far you get if nothing else jack hoped this might interrupt the chain of thought that the journalist from the hollywood foreign press was pursuing he already knew that his interviewer would have no luck interrupting emma from her train of thought helloa the woman who thought he looked like a young martin sheen said it suddenly sounded like emma was speaking italianof course jack recognized her spiel pleeze tella jack burnseets maria antonietta beluzzi on da fona ima sorry jack burns ees in the meedle of an interview the lady from the hollywood foreign press said tell heem i meesa holding hees peenis emma said eets a ms beluzzi his interviewer said handing him back his cell phone eet sounds urgent so what do you weigh this morning jack asked emma two hundred and fucking five emma wailedloudly enough for the journalist to hear her you have to go on a diet emma he told her for what had to be the hundredth time jack burns was thirtytwo in emma was thirtynine he had a better metabolism than she had and hed always watched what he ate but now that jack was in his thirties even he had to be more strict with his diet emma didnt understand dieting her one bottle of red wine a night had become two she had pasta for lunch here she was pushing forty and her favorite food was still gorgonzola mashed potatoes jack kept telling her she could spend all day on the ab machine at the four seasons in beverly hillsshe could be benchpressing her own weightand not work off those kinds of carbs jack could see that the journalist from the hollywood foreign press was writing everything downincluding as he would later read in her interview the two hundred and fucking five she even spelled maria antonietta beluzzi correctly naturally it turned out that the journalist was italian emma jack started to say he calls her emma and brutally tells her to go on a diet the lady from the hollywood foreign press would write fuck you and your diet jack emma said sharply on the phone i want you to know ive taken good care of you in my will then she hung up youra girlfriend his interviewer asked i meana one of them kind of jack replied ees ms beluzzi an actress shes a voluptuous tobacconist he said although the journalist didnt write this down voluptuous would somehow make it into her interviewbut in reference to emma i supposeza you have or havea had many girlfriends jacks interviewer said nobody serious he said for what had to be the hundredth timewith apologies to michele maher jack was tired hed had too many interviews with too many prying and insinuating journalists but that was no excuse he shouldnt have lost control of this interview he shouldnt have so recklessly even deliberately allowed this lady from the hollywood foreign press to imagine anything she might want to imaginebut he did of course it wasnt the interview that would bother him such things arent truly damaging not for long but that emmas last words to jack were about her willwell that would hurt him forever by the time the interview was published emma would be deadand the italian journalist from the hollywood foreign press had figured out that he couldnt have been having a relationship with maria antonietta beluzzi the bigbreasted tobacconist in fellinis amarcord ms beluzzi would be old enough to be jacks grandmother it had to have been emma oastler jack was talking to the journalist wrotehe and emma who were just roommates were known to be living togetherand anyone whod seen the famous author recently knew at a glance she was overweight if not that she weighed as much as two hundred and five pounds in this context jacks use of the word voluptuous appeared to mock emma for becoming so fat besides the italian lady concluded emma was said to have been depressed that her third novelafter many years it was still only a workinprogresswas growing too long how long is it all the journalists would ask jack after emmas death but by then he had learned the hard way to be more careful with the press that trip to new york jack was staying at the mark he had registered in the name of billy rainbowthe character he played in the soontobereleased film he was promoting at the press junket he usually registered in hotels in the name of the character he was playing in his most recent notyetreleased movie that way the jack burns fans couldnt find him they werent all exactly fans some of the chicks with dicks had taken offense that jack repeatedly denied he was a transsexual or a transvestite in almost every interview jack said he was a crossdresser only occasionallyand only in the movies real transsexuals and transvestites were offended they said that jack was merely acting wellof course he was so jack was registered at the mark as billy rainbow the front desk screened all his calls jack always told his mom where he was stayingand who he was this timeand of course emma knew and his agent bob bookman and his lawyer alan hergott and the publicist for whichever studio was making his most recent movie in this case erica steinberg from miramax naturally harvey weinstein knew too if you were making a miramax movie harvey knew where you were staying and under what name at the time jack was sleeping with the wellknown cellist mimi lederer so she knew where he was staying too in fact he was in bed with herasleep at the markwhen emma died that night after dinner mimi had brought her cello back to his hotel room shed played two solos naked for him it had been awkward at dinner because mimi wouldnt check her cello the big instrument in its case occupied a third chair at their table mimi would look at it from time to time as if she expected the cello to say something jack didnt tell mimi that hed met another cellist when he was a little boyhannele a music student at sibelius academy and one of two of his fathers girlfriends in helsinki hannele had shared a tattoo with her friend ritva hannele got the vertical left side of a heart torn in two it was tattooed on her heartside breast and hanneles armpits were unshavenjack would always remember that when mimi lederer was playing for jack in his hotel room at the mark it made him shudder to remember how hannele had sat for her tattoolike mimi maybe like all female cellists with her legs spread apart that was when jack wondered if hannele had ever played naked for his dad which again caused him to wonder if he was like william the way william was with women especially jack would remember what mimi lederer played for him that night at the mark when emma was still alivea cello solo part of something from a mozart trio jack had made a point of learning as little as he could about classical music because it reminded him of organ music or church music which reminded him of his derelict dad divertimentoe flat major mimi lederer whispered to him before she began to play like hannele maybe like all female cellists mimi was tall with long arms and small breasts naturally jack wondered if your breasts got in the way when you were playing a cello the second piece mimi played naked for him was part of something from a beethoven string quartet razumovsky opus fiftynine mimi murmured to him number one just the names of pieces of classical music made jacks teeth ache why couldnt composers think of better titles but it was wonderful to witness mimi lederers control of that big instrument she so confidently straddled they were still asleep when the phone rang it was way too early in the morning for it to be emmathat was jacks first thought toronto like new york was on eastern time that was the second idea to pop into his head he saw it was a little after six in the morningtoo early for it to be his mother either or so jack thought erica steinberg was both too nice and too tactful to call him this early in the morning and erica knew that jack was sleeping with mimi lederererica knew everything jack thought maybe it was harvey weinstein on the phone he would call you when he wanted to hed called jack early in the morning before maybe jack had said something in one of his interviews that he shouldnt have said mimi lederer and jack had to get up early anywayalthough not quite this early jack had another day to go on the press junket and mimi was teaching a class at juilliard then she had to catch a plane mimi was a member of some trio or quartet they had a concert in minneapolis or maybe it was cleveland jack didnt remember it must be room service mimi said its probably about your breakfast order i told you last night jackyou should order a normal breakfast mimi had made an issue of jacks breakfast orderhis breakfast manifesto shed called it the roomservice staff at the mark as in most new york hotels was struggling with english as a second language jack should have just checked what he wanted for breakfast mimi had said he should not have written a thesis on the little card they hung on the door but you have to be specific about a softboiled egg jack had arguedand how complicated is it to understand nonfat yogurt or no yogurt its harvey weinstein jack told mimi finally picking up the telephone yes he said into the mouthpiece its your mother mr rainbow the young man at the front desk said in the movie billy rainbow doesnt have a mother but jack said please put her through where is she he was wondering according to mimi lederer he was still half asleep thered been a tattoo convention in santa rosa had his mom come to see him in los angeles on her way to it or on her way home from it shed been on her way home jack dimly recalledshed told him all about the convention it had been at the flamingo hotel or maybe it was the pink flamingo shed said something about a blues bandpossibly the wine drinkin roosters shed told jack everything about everyone who was there by his mothers own admission it had been a threeday party tattoo artists party like underage drinkers alice was a wreck on her way back from santa rosa how could jack have forgotten her telling him about captain dons swordswallowing act or suzy ming the contortionist writhing her way into indelible memoryif not exactly art so his mom wasnt calling from santa rosa paris perhapsthat would explain the earliness of her call it was the middle of the day in paris maybe alice had miscalculated the time difference but hadnt she come home from paris too yes jack rememberedshe had she told him shed met up with uncle pauly and little vinnie myers among other tattoo artists it hadnt been a convention not exactly it had been about planning a mondial du tatouage in paris the whole thing had probably been tintins idea he was the best tattoo artist in paris in alices view stéphane chaudesaigues from avignon would surely have been there and filip leu from lausannemaybe even roonui from mooréa french polynesia theyd all stayed at some hotel in the redlight district just down the street from the moulin rouge alice had told jack le tribal act a bodypiercing group had provided one memorable evenings entertainment theyd hoisted some fairly remarkable household items with their nipples and penises and other pierced parts but this was weeks maybe months ago jacks mother was calling from toronto where it was as early in the morning as it was in new york jack really must have been out of it oh jackie im sorryim so sorry his mother cried into the phone mom are you in toronto of course im in toronto dear she said with sudden indignation oh jackieits so awful maybe shed passed out drunk or stoned at daughter alice shed just woken upafter a night of sleeping in the needles jack imagined or one of her colleagues in the tattoo world had died one of the oldtimers maybe a maritime man was eternally sleeping in the needles her old pal sailor jerry possiblyher friend from halifax and fellow apprentice to charlie snow it makes me sick to have to tell you dear alice said it crossed jacks mind that leslie oastler had left herfor another woman momjust tell me what it is for christs sake its emmaemmas gone jack shes gone gone where mom but he knew the second he said itthe telephone suddenly cold against his ear jack saw that dazzlingblue glint of the pacific the way you see it for the first timeturning off sunset boulevard barreling down chautauqua below you depending on the time of day the deadslow or lightningfast lanes of the pacific coast highway sometimes a sea of cars always a tongue of concretethe last barrier between you and the fabulous west coast ocean gone how jack asked his mother he didnt realize he was sitting up in bed and shiveringnot until mimi lederer held him from behind the way she held her cello she wrapped her long arms around him her long legs wide apart gripped his hips leslies already left for the airport alice went on as if she hadnt heard him i should have gone with her but you know leslieshe wasnt even crying momwhat happened to emma oh nonot emma mimi lederer cried she was draped over jack like a shroud he felt her lips brush the back of his neck jackyoure not alone his mother said of course im not alone what happened to emma mom it looks like you should have been with her jack mom emma was dancing alice began she met a boy dancing leslie told me the name of the place oh its awful something like coconut squeezer teaszer not squeezer momcoconut teaszer emma took the boy home with her alice said jack knew that if emma had brought some kid from coconut teaszer back to their dump on entrada drive she hadnt died dancing what did emma die of mom oh its awful alice said again they said it was a heart attack but she was a young woman who said whos they jack asked the policethey called here but how could she have had a heart attack jack in emmas case he could imagine iteven at thirtynineconsidering the food the wine the weightlifting and the occasional kid from coconut teaszer but emma didnt do drugs thered been more kids from coconut teaszer lately both emma and jack had thought the kids were safer than the bodybuilders there will probably be an autopsy jack told his mother an autopsyif it was just a heart attack alice asked youre not supposed to have a heart attack at thirtynine mom the boy was underage alice whispered the police wont release his name who cares about his name jack said thered been more and more kids who looked underage to him poor emma had died fucking a minor from coconut teaszer as for the kid himself jack could only imagine that it must have been a traumatizing experience he knew that emma liked the top position and that she would have told the boy not to move maybe hed moved if the boy had been a virginand emma would have picked him only if he looked smallwhat would it have been like to have a twohundredandfivepound woman die on you your first time the boy called the police his mother went on she was still whispering oh jack was emma in the habit of sometimes was all he said you must meet leslie in los angeles jack she shouldnt have to go through this alone i know leslie shell break down eventually jack couldnt imagine it but he was uncomfortable with the idea of mrs oastler alone in the entrada drive house what kind of stuff would emma have left lying around the notion of leslie discovering emmas collection of porn films wasnt as disturbing as the thought of her reading emmas writingwhatever emma hadnt finished or what she didnt want published jack had not seen a word of emmas workinprogressher third novel which was reportedly growing too long ill leave new york as soon as i can mom if leslie calls tell her ill be in la before dark he knew that erica steinberg was a good soul jack assumed she would release him from his interviews at the press junket everyone who knew jack knew that emma had been part of his family as it turned out miramax arranged everything for himincluding the car to the airport erica got him his ticket she even offered to fly with him it wasnt necessary for her to come with him jack told her but he appreciated the offer there was another call to jacks room at the mark that morning mimi lederer had been rightroom service was confused by his breakfast order although hed stopped shivering mimi had gone on holding him as if he were her cello until the phone rang that second time i dont give a rats ass about the yogurt mimi heard jack say into the phone any kind of yogurt will do are you okay jack mimi asked emmas dead he snapped at her i guess i can worry about the fucking yogurt another day are you acting she asked him i mean even now are you still acting jack didnt know what she meant but she was covering herself with the bedsheet as if he were a total stranger to her whats wrong he asked whats wrong with you jack they were both sitting up in bed and jack could see himself in the mirror above the dresser there was nothing wrong with him but that was the problem jack didnt look as if his best friend had died on the contrary he looked as if nothing had happened to him his face was a clean slatemore noir than noir the new york times might have said jack couldnt stop staring at himselfthat was a problem too mimi lederer said later that she couldnt stand the sight of him not at that moment youre not in a movie jack mimi started to say but jack looked at her as if he really were billy rainbow why arent you crying mimi lederer asked him jack couldnt answer her and he was good at tears when his part called for crying he would usually start when he heard the ad say quiet please rolling the cameraman would say jacks eyes were already watering away speed said the sound guyjacks face would be bathed in tears when the director even wild bill vanvleck said actionwell jack could cry oncamera like nobodys business his eyes would well with tears just reading a script but that morning at the mark jack was as toughguy noir as hed ever beenon film or off he was as deadpan as emma when she wrote life is a call sheet youre supposed to show up when they tell you but thats the only rule that was what jack burns was doinghe was going to la just to show up he would probably hold mrs oastlers hand because he was supposed tothose were just the rules jesus jack mimi lederer started to say then she stopped jack realized as if hed missed something shed said that she was getting dressed if you didnt love emma you never loved anyone mimi was saying she was the person closest to you jack can you love anyone if you didnt love her i think not that was the last jack saw of mimi lederer and he liked mimihe really did but she didnt like him anymore after that morning at the mark mimi said when she left that she didnt know who he was but the scary thing was that jack didnt know who he was as an actor he could be anybody onscreen the world had seen jack burns cryas a man and as a woman hed made his mascara run many timesanything for a movie yet jack couldnt cry for emma he didnt shed a single tear that morning at the mark it was still pretty early when he left the hotel for the airport the frontdesk clerk was a young man jack hadnt seen beforeprobably the same young man whod put through alices call of course the clerk knew it was the jack burnseveryone did but as jack was leaving the clerk called outhis voice full of the utmost sincerity of the kind that young people express when they genuinely want to please you have a nice day mr rainbow as it turned out jack had been wrong to envision emmas death as a heart attack which typically has some familiar symptoms antecedent to deathlike sweating shortness of breath lightheadedness and chest pains but emma oastler died of a heart condition called long qt syndrome an inherited disease it affects the sodium and potassium channels in the heart this in turn leads to abnormalities in the hearts electrical system emma died of a sudden arrhythmiaventricular fibrillation her doctor told jack her heart suddenly stopped pumping emma died before she was even aware of not feeling well with long qt syndrome often sudden death is the first indication of a problem in sixty percent of patients a resting ekg would indicate an abnormality which would alert a doctor to the possibility of the condition but the other forty percent would have completely normal examinationsunless exercise ekgs were used emmas doctor told jack that emma had never had one her doctor went on to tell him that a fatal episode could be triggered by a loud noise extreme emotion exertion or an electrolyte imbalancewhich in turn could be caused by drinking alcohol or having sex the boy from coconut teaszerwhose name would never be made publicsaid that emma had collapsed on him so spontaneously that hed thought it was simply the way she liked to have sex which he was having for the first time hed done exactly what emma had told him to do he hadnt moved he was probably too afraid to move after hed managed to extricate himself from emmas last embrace the kid called the police given the genetic nature of the syndrome emmas surviving family would eventually be screened for it leslie oastler was the sole survivor and she showed no signs of the abnormality her exhusband emmas father had died several years earlierapparently in his sleep what a pisser as leslie would put it jack arrived home before he had time to prepare himself for mrs oastler on the plane hed been thinking about emmanot leslie hed been considering his lack of emotion if that was the right word for what he lacked leslie oastler was all over jack like a storm i know leslie alice had said shell break down eventually but mrs oastlers grief was not yet evidentonly her anger leslie greeted him at the door where the fuck is emmas novel jack i mean the new one i dont know where emmas novel is leslie wheres your novel jack or whatever the fuck it is that youre supposed to be writingyou dont even have a computer i dont work at home he answered this was not exactly a lieregarding the writing part of his life jack didnt work anywhere you dont even have a typewriter mrs oastler said do you write in longhand yes i happen to like writing by hand leslie this wasnt exactly a lie either what writing he didshopping lists script notes autographswas always in longhand mrs oastler had been all through emmas computer she had searched for emmas novel under every name she could think of nothing on emmas computer had a name that contained the word novel or the number three or the word third there was nothing resembling a title of a workinprogress either the boy from coconut teaszer must have been very believable because the police never treated the house on entrada as a crime scene and because emma was a famous authornot that the boy even knew she was a writerboth the police and emmas doctor had concluded their business promptly and without making much of a mess mrs oastler on the other hand had ransacked the house whatever damage had been done by emma spontaneously dying on top of the kid from coconut teaszer was minimal in comparison to leslies frenzied searching which resembled a druginduced burglarydrawers and closets flung wide open clothes strewn about shed found a couple of pairs of jacks boxers in emmas bedroom and a pair of emmas panties and two of her bras under jacks bed shed found emmas cache of porn films too did you watch them together mrs oastler asked sometimesfor research jack said bullshit we should get out of here leslielet me take you to dinner jack was trying to imagine what else mrs oastler might have discovered in her search were you fucking each other or not she asked him absolutely not he told her not once why not mrs oastler asked jack had no good answer to that question he said nothing you slept together but you didnt do itis that the way it was jack he nodded like the script reader and the porn star in emmas depressing novel leslie asked kind of was all he could say jack didnt want to give mrs oastler the impression that he was too big for emma which would imply they had tried but leslie had come to her own conclusionsat least in regard to how emma had handled her vaginismus top position young boys she could boss around usually jack had been right to ask emma if her vaginismus had a causeof course it did not that emma could ever have told him shed been sexually abused when she was nine or tenone of her mothers bad boyfriends had done it he would be mrs oastlers last boyfriend emma had been so traumatized that shed missed a year of school some problem at home was all jack remembered hearing about it hed assumed that this had something to do with leslies divorce mrs oastlers final boyfriend gave new meaning to emmas saga of the squeezed child at twelve perhaps this had been her first attempt to fictionalize her personal grievances of course there were any number of traumatic visits to doctors offices beginning with emmas first gynecological examination leslie told jack and she hated her fathernaturally he was a doctor jack didnt know that emmas dad had been a doctor whenever emma or her mother mentioned him the word asshole was dominant the word doctor if jack had ever heard it had been drummed out of his memory by asshole let me take you to dinner leslie jack repeated lets go someplace emma liked i hate to eat mrs oastler reminded him well i usually have just a salad jack said lets go somewhere and have a salad which one of you liked the japanese condoms leslie asked shed even found jacks kimono microthins those are mine he told her they have great salads at one pico his old bosscarlos from american pacificwas now working as a waiter there jack called and asked carlos for a table with a view of the ocean and the promenade there were a lot of messages on the answering machine but mrs oastler assured jack they were not worth listening toshed already done so condolences from friendseven wild bill vanvleck had called the mad dutchman hadnt made a movie in years jack had worried that he might be dead the only thing even mildly interesting leslie said was the call from alan hergottinforming jack that hed been named literary executor in emmas will alan was also emmas lawyer and bob bookman their agent had called it was important bookman said that he and jack meet with alan to discuss emmas will jack had only recently learnedfrom his last unpleasant conversation with emmathat she had a will and that shed supposedly taken good care of him in it ill bet shes left you everything mrs oastler remarked with an encompassing wave of her thin armindicating the ransacked ruin of the wretched house on entrada drive lucky you while leslie had a shower and changed her clothes jack played the messages on the answering machine at low volume both bob bookman and alan hergott made him think that his role as literary executor was a bigger deal than he might be anticipating their voices had an unexpected urgency which mrs oastler had missed or chosen to ignore leslie had changed into a sexy backless dress with a haltertype neckline only nine years older than alice mrs oastler had just turned sixty but she was so sleek and unwrinkled that she looked ten years youngerand she knew it her dark boyish pixie was dyed to its roots her small breasts didnt droop her small bottom looked firm only the veins on the backs of her hands betrayed her and her hands were never at restas if to deny you a lingering look at them leslie announced that emmas bedroom had the ambience of a crime scene and that she wouldnt sleep there jack offered her his bedroom or the guest room but mrs oastler told him that she had reserved a room for them at shutters after all they were going to eat at the restaurant there we might as well spend the night she said we he asked her i shouldnt be left alone she told him if you slept with emma and didnt do it i guess you can sleep with me and not do it too jack he put her small carryon bag in the backseat of the audi and drove her to shutters the sun had set but a fadedpink glow served as a backlight to the santa monica pier the lights on the ferris wheel were on on the promenade below one pico people on rollerblades swept past incessantly leslie drank a bottle of red wine with her salad jack had about a gallon of iced tea with his i wonder what youre the literary executor of mrs oastler remarked carlos had told him while shed gone off to register in the hotel that leslie was the bestlooking date hed seen jack with in a long time her novel maybe jack said in which case what would you do with it jack maybe emma wanted me to decide if it was fit to publish or not he replied it doesnt exist jack there is no third novel it wasnt her novel that was growing too longit was the period of time in which shed written nothing leslie said emma told you that he asked because it suddenly sounded true mrs oastler shrugged emma never told me anything jack did she talk to you not about her third novel he admitted there is no third novel leslie repeated it turned out that mrs oastler had called alan hergott alan said something vague to her the proceedings were of a literary nature in fact emma had specified that her mother be excluded from the process even the reading of the will was a private matter alan told mrs oastler only bob bookman and jack were allowed to hear what emma wanted done with her estate but are you guessing or do you know theres no third novelnot even a workinprogress jack asked leslie im only guessing mrs oastler admitted with emma i was always guessing me too he said surprisingly mrs oastler held his hand he looked at her pretty faceher bright dark eyes her thinlipped mouth with that seductive smile her perfectly straight little noseand wondered how a creature of emmas outsize dimensions could ever have come forth from such a lean taut body what mrs oastler said surprised him emmas death was not your fault jack you were the only person she cared about she told me once that taking care of you was all that mattered to her she never told me that he admitted it would have been a good time to cry but he still couldnt and if in his mothers estimation leslie oastler would eventually break down now was apparently not her moment to fall apart either lets get the check leslie said i cant wait to see what sleeping with you and not doing it is like jack thought they should tell his mother where they were spending the night alice would be worried about leslieand about jack to a lesser degree what if his mom called the house on entrada and got only the answering machine alice would be calling him on his cell phone all night ill call her while you use the bathroom mrs oastler said hed forgotten to bring a toothbrush for a host of historical reasons jack was disinclined to use leslies toothbrush but he took a dab of her toothpaste and smeared it on his teeth with his index finger please feel free to use my toothbrush jack mrs oastler said through the closed bathroom door in fact if you have any expectations of kissing me please do use it he had no expectations of kissing leslie oastlerthat is not until she brought it up against his better judgment jack used her toothbrush to brush his teeth when he exited the bathroom mrs oastler had already undressed she was naked except for her black bikinicut pantiesa sinister match to the bikini cut of her csection scar and alices signature rose of jericho leslie crossed her arms over her small perfect breasts as she slipped past jack into the bathroom with a modesty that was as unexpected as her kisses a few minutes later she was an intimidating kisser excitable and feralwithout once closing her bright watchful eyes but jack had the feeling that everything about her was an experiment that she was merely conducting a test when theyd kissed to the point of exhaustioneither they had to stop or they had to progress to a more serious level of foreplaymrs oastler calmly asked him you did this with emma didnt you i mean you kissed yes we kissed did you touch each other sometimes how he took mrs oastlers breasts in his hands is that all she asked thats the only way i touched emma he told her where did she touch you jack he couldnt say peniswith all the penisholding in his life god knows why jack let go of leslies breasts and rolled over turning his back to her mrs oastler didnt hesitate her thin arm snaked around jacks waist her small hand closing on his penis which was already hard like that was all he said to her well thats not very big leslie said i dont think emma would have had an involuntary muscle spasm over that do you jack maybe not he said mrs oastler went on holding him he tried to will his erection away but it endured leslie oastler would always have a certain power over him he was thinking she had entered his childhood at a vulnerable time first with her pushup brabefore he even met herand later by showing him her rose of jericho when jack was of such a young age that the way she trimmed her pubic hair would become the model of the form for him in this way in increments both measurable and not our childhood is stolen from usnot always in one momentous event but often in a series of small robberies which add up to the same loss for surely mrs oastler was one of the thieves of jacks childhoodnot that she necessarily meant to hurt him or that she gave the matter any thought one way or another leslie oastler was simply someone who disliked innocence or she held innocence in contempt for reasons that werent even clear to her shed been disillusioned by her doctor exhusband whose great wealth was family money which both he and mrs oastler took for granted dr oastler didnt make all that money as a doctornot in canada as a result mrs oastler had dedicated herself to the task of disillusioning others and because leslie met alice jack just happened to fall under leslies spell in any case when emma had held his penis his erection always subsided before longnot so with mrs oastler jack was sure he had a hardon that would last as long as she held him and leslie gave no indication that she was about to let go he attempted to distract her with conversation of an inappropriate kind but this only inspired her to alter her gripor to alternately stroke and pull his penis in a maddeningly indifferent way i feel that i never thanked you properly jack began his betrayal of emmas strongly expressed wishnamely that he not thank her mothermade him feel as disloyal to his dear departed friend as his continuing erection in her mothers hand thanked me for what mrs oastler asked for buying my clothesfor redding and for exeter for paying my tuition at both schools for taking care of usi mean my mother and me for all you did for us after mrs wicksteed stop it jack he would have stopped without her telling him to do so because her grip on his penis had tightenedpainfully leslie oastler pressed her open mouth between his shoulder blades as if she were preparing to bite him maybe she was smothering a scream but all she said was dont thank me but why not leslie youve been very generous me generous mrs oastler asked he felt her hand relax at last her fingers lightly traced an imaginary outline of his penis which had not relaxed at all jack remembered a lull between customers at daughter alice when his mom had said to himas if it were part of an ongoing conversation which it wasnt and not out of the blue which it waspromise me one thing jack dont ever sleep with leslie mom i would never do such a thing hed declared and there was that night at the sunset marquis a small west hollywood hotel where jack had been banging a model she had a private villa on the grounds not one of those cheap rooms in the main building a noisy bunch of musiciansrocknrollers and their groupieswere partying in an adjacent villa and jacks model wanted to crash their party jack just needed to crash but not therehe wanted to go home to prevent him from leaving the model flushed his car keys down the toilet jack could have gone to the front desk and asked someone to call him a taxi but he didnt want to leave the audi at the sunset marquis overnight bad things had happened there besides except for her bra the model had dressed herself in jacks clothes and gone off to the musicians party he would have had to leave the hotel wearing her clothes and they werent a good fit she was a size six or something jack had called emma who was writing hed begged her to take a taxi and bring him the spare set of keys to the audi they were in the kitchen drawer by the telephone he was explaining when she interrupted him promise me one thing jack just dont ever sleep with my mother emma i would never do such a thing im not so sure baby cakes i know she would i promise hed told her please come get me the model had gone off with jacks wallet which was in the leftfront pocket of his suit pants so he had to crash the rocknrollers party and find her he made himself up pretty wellthe lipstick the eye shadow the works her bras were so small that jack mistook one for a thong but he managed to stuff each cup with half a tennis ball hed cut the ball in two the model had twitches in her fingersthe result of some deficiency in her diet probablyand her personal trainer had prescribed squeezing a tennis ball as a remedy there were tennis balls all over the villa jack had used her nail scissors to cut one in half he crammed himself into a limegreen camisole with a bare midriff which unfortunately exposed the line of dark hair that ran from his navel below his waist but jack shaved this off with the models razor at the same time he shaved his legs in her sinkcutting one shin he stuck a piece of toilet paper on the cut and painted his toenails a bloodred color which matched his wound jack found a pair of peachcolored panties with a lace waistband but the leg holes would have cut his circulation off if he hadnt snipped them with the nail scissors naturally he couldnt close the zipper on the short navyblue skirt but the halfzipped look which revealed the lace waistband of his panties more or less went with the overall portrait he looked very trashy but so did half the hangerson and groupies who hung out at the bar at the sunset marquis in the fulllength mirror jack saw that hed painted his nails in too hasty a fashionit appeared that hed had a barefoot accident with a lawn mower the skirt fell off one hip and hed torn one side of the camisole which exposed the tight twisted back strap of the ivorycolored bra jacks tennisball breasts were noticeably smaller than his biceps he looked like a fieldhockey player maybe three or four months pregnant just starting to show he would have forgone the toenail polish if he could have worn his shoes but the model had used them to weigh down his suit jacket which was under about four inches of water in the bathtub it was just a musicians partyjack didnt expect that the dress code would be very severe he thought it was adequate that hed used a gob of the models extrabody conditioner and then blowdried his hair he looked like a slightly pregnant former fieldhockey player now a hooker whod been struck by lightning but compared to the girls who were the usual groupies with the rocknrollers at the sunset marquis jack was head and shoulders above the competition except for the modelshe was hot shed stripped off jacks suit pants and the white dress shirt she was dancing up a storm in his boxers and her bra the musicians and their entourage were so wasted that jack could have been toshiro mifune in drag and no one would have noticed him all but one guy who appeared to be giving mouthtomouth resuscitation to his harmonica he stopped playing and stared at jackwell at jacks tennis ball in two halves specifically did you come with her he asked jack nodding to the dancing model i recognize the boxers and the bra jack said it was a jack burns kind of lineit gave him away you could pass for jack burns the harmonica player said im not shitting you really jack asked him any idea where the honey in the boxers ditched the rest of her clothes the harmonica player pointed to a couch where a tall young woman was stretched out she was asleep or passed out or dead unmindful of the din whichever the case shed covered herself with jacks white dress shirt which either she or the model had used to blot her lipstick jack found his suit pants and took the wallet out of the leftfront pocket there was no point in keeping the pantsnot with the suit jacket under water in the models bathtuband he had a hundred white dress shirts it was the kind of night when you cut your losses and left the model was still dancing tell her she can keep the boxers but i want my bra back jack said to the harmonica player who was yowling away on his instrument like a runover cat he barely nodded in jacks direction there was a bouncertype whod not seen jack come in the bouncer followed jack out into the semidark grounds where there were other villassome lit some not there was already dew on the grass hey the bouncer said someone said you were that weirdo jack burns jacks face came up to the broad chest of the bouncers hawaiian shirt he was blocking jacks way ordinarily jack would have sidestepped him he could have easily outrun him to the lineup at the velvet rope out in front of the bar the bouncer wouldnt have messed with jack in a crowd but jacks skirt was so tight that his knees were brushing together when he walked he couldnt have run anywhere is that you honey pie he heard emma say the bouncer stepped aside and let him pass just look at youyoure half unzipped emma said to jack she threw her big arm around his hip pulling him to her she kissed jack on the mouth smearing his lipstick what happened to your shoes baby cakes she asked under water jack explained they better not have been your manolo blahniks you bad girl emma said putting her big hand on jacks ass dykes the bouncer called after them ive got a dildo that would make you cry like a little baby emma yelled at the bouncer who looked suddenly pale in the bad light a tall floppy guy like a scarecrow had fallen on the velvet rope in front of the bar he was draped over it like a coat over a clothesline i think its illegal to drive barefoot in california emma was telling jack i promise i wont sleep with your mother he whispered to her jack was almost asleep with his penis still stiff in mrs oastlers hand when leslie spoke to him i had to promise your mom i wouldnt sleep with you jack of course were not really sleeping togethernot the way alice meantare we of course not jack told her one of mrs oastlers fingernails nicked the tip of his penis and he flinched against her im sorry she said i havent played with anyones penis in quite some time its okay he said you gotta talk to your mom jack leslie said the way emma might have said it whys that he asked talk to her while theres still time jack still time for what emma and i didnt talk enough mrs oastler said now were out of time talk to my mom about what you must have questions jack she never answered them he told her well maybe nows the time mrs oastler said ask her again do you know something i dont leslie definitely she said but im not telling you ask your mom outside someone was screamingprobably in the parking lot near the hotel but at shutters on the beach you could hear someone screaming all the way from the santa monica pier perhaps it was the screaming that did it but jacks erection finally subsided oh cute mrs oastler said she was making a considerable effort to bring his penis back to life its like its going away maybe its sad he suggested remember that line jack emma had told him you can use it and to think he hadnt been able to imagine under what circumstances an admission of your peniss sadness would be of any possible use but the word sad affected leslie oastler in a way jack wouldnt have predicted she let go of his penis and rolled over turning her back to him he didnt know she was crying until he felt the bed tremble she was crying without making a sound jack guessed that this was the eventually his mother had meant when shed said that leslie would break down buteven in the act of falling apartmrs oastler was contained her small body shook her face was wet with tears her breasts were cool to his touch but she never said a word when jack woke up he could hear mrs oastler in the shower room service had come and gone unbeknownst to him the pot of coffee which was all that leslie had ordered was lukewarm shed already packed her small suitcase and had laid flat at the foot of the bed the clothes she would wear on the planea black pantsuit her bikinicut panties the little pushup bra on her pillow mrs oastler had left a surprise for jack that photograph of emma naked the one hed kept leslie must have found it in the entrada house she wanted him to know shed seen it the photo regarded jack criticallyemma at seventeen when jack was ten and heading off to redding she had never been fitter there was evidence of a matburn on one of her cheeks probably chenko or one of the minskies had given it to her when leslie oastler came out of the bathroom she was wearing a shutters bathrobe and her hair was still wet cute picture huh mrs oastler asked charlotte barford took it he said then she probably took more than onedidnt she jack an exgirlfriend made me throw them away he told her she probably thought you threw all of them away jack right he said a famous guy like you shouldnt have pictures like that lying around mrs oastler told him but im not going to throw it away for you im not likely to throw any photographs of emma awaynot now no of course not he said jack went and stood naked at the window overlooking the parking lot there was a partial view of the dead motionless ferris wheel which resembled the skeleton of a dinosaur in the bleachedgray light santa monica wasnt an earlymorning town mrs oastler came and stood behind him holding his penis in both her hands he had a hardon in a matter of seconds it seemed like such a betrayal of emmaall of it that was when jack began to cry he could tell that leslie was naked because she was rubbing herself against his bare back if shed wanted to make love he would have that was probably why he was crying the promises hed made to emma and his mother meant nothing poor jack leslie oastler said sarcastically she let him go and dressed herself her hair was so short she could dry it easily with a towel youre going to have a busy day im sure she told him doing whatever literary executors do jack could have cried all day but not in front of her he stopped he found his clothes and started to get dressed putting emmas photo in his rightfront pocket your mother will no doubt call you before im back in toronto mrs oastler was telling him shell want to know all about our night togetherhow we didnt sleep together and all of that i know what to say he told her just be sure you talk to her jack ask her everything while theres still time jack finished dressing without saying anything he went into the bathroom and shut the door he tried to do something about his hair he washed his face he was grateful to mrs oastler for leaving him her tube of toothpaste if not her toothbrush which he presumed shed packed he smeared a dab of toothpaste on his teeth with his index finger and rinsed his mouth in the sink jack heard the hotelroom door close before he was finished in the bathroom when he came back out into the room leslie was gone he had some trouble leaving shutters mrs oastler had paid the bill but the paparazzi were waiting for him thankfully theyd missed mrs oastler someone had spotted jack burns having dinner with a goodlooking older woman at one pico someone had figured out that theyd spent the night at shutters who was the woman jack one of the photographers kept asking there were a few more paparazzi waiting for him at entrada drive but that was to be expected jack wondered why they hadnt been there the night before they could have followed him and leslie to shutters he stripped emmas bed and put her linens and towels in the washing machine he straightened up the place a little his mom called before hed managed to make himself any breakfast he told her that leslie was already on the plane and that theyd had a comforting night together comforting you didnt sleep with herdid you jack of course not he said with indignation well leslie can be a little lawless alice said jack could only imagine how mrs oastler might have reacted to that he would have guessed that in their relationship his mom was the more lawless of the two but he didnt say anything jack knew he was supposed to talk to his mother but he didnt know what to say leslie said i should talk to you mom she said i should ask you everything while theres still time goodness what a morbid night you two must have had alice said mom talk to me we are talking dear she was being coy jack simply turned against her there was a time when hed tried to ask her everything and shed wanted no part of it now he didnt want to give her the opportunity to unburden herself what did jack care about any of it nowwhat did it matter when he was a kid when it would have mattered she was silent jack was the one who was silent now if theres anything you want to ask me dear ask away his mother said are you faithful to leslie he asked isnt she more faithful to you than you are to her that wasnt what jack really cared abouthe was just testing his mothers willingness to give him a straight answer jackiewhat a question what kind of guy was my dad was he a good guy or a bad one jack i think you should come home to toronto for a few daysso we can talk we are talking mom youre just being argumentative dear please tell leslie that i tried to talk to you jack said you didnt sleep with her really his mom asked jack almost regretted that he hadnt really slept with leslie oastler but all he said was no mom i did not after that their conversation such as it was slipped away when jack told his mother that hed thanked mrs oastler for all shed done for himfor them he meanthis mom responded with her usual thats nice dear he also should have said that leslie was funny about his thanking her but he didnt jack was on the cordless phone looking out the window at a tv crew in his driveway they were filming the exterior of the entrada drive house which really pissed jack off he was distracted and didnt understand what his mom was saying about some tattoo convention in woodstock new york out of the blue jack asked her do you remember when i was at redding one year you were going to come see me in maine but something happened and you couldnt come i was at redding for four years but you never came to see me well thats quite some storywhy i didnt come to redding of course i remember ill have to tell you that story sometime jack its a good one somehow this didnt strike him as what mrs oastler meant by talking to his mother they were talking in circles jack had lived with emma for ten years now emma was gone and he and his mom couldnt talk to each other they never had it was pretty clear that she didnt want to tell him anything ever alice wanted to know what was entailed in being a literary executornot that jack knew i guess ill find out whats involved was all he could say jack was surprised to see that there was only one message on the answering machine which he played while his mom was still on the phone it was mildred milly ascheim the porn producer calling with her condolences her voice was so much like myras that for a moment jack thought that myra was summoning him from the grave dear jack burns milly ascheim said as if she were dictating a letter to him im sorry youve lost your friend she didnt leave her number or say her name but she must have known that he knew the ascheim sisters spoke with one voice he was touched that shed called but once again he was distracted from what his mom was sayingsomething about mrs oastler again jack are you alone yes im alone mom i heard a womans voice it was someone on television he lied i asked you if leslie kept her clothes on jack well i think i would have noticed if shed taken them off he told her actor alice said mom i gotta go it was the way emma would have said gotta they both noticed goodbye billy rainbow his mother said hanging up the phone the button trick a st hildas old girl like leslie oastler would often choose to have her funeral or memorial service in the schools chapel where the old girls had both fond and traumatizing memories of their younger days many of which had not been spent in the contaminating presence of boysexcept for those little boys who were neither a threat nor a temptation to the much more grownup girls except for jack burns its unlikely that emma would have chosen the chapel at st hildas for her memorial service but she had left her mother no instructions regarding how she wanted to be remembered that mrs oastler chose the st hildas chapel was only natural after all it was in leslies neighborhood and she had already chosen it for her own service alice called jack to convey leslies request mrs oastler wanted him to say a little something at emmas service youre so good with words dear jacks mother said and for how many years now have you been writing something well how could he refuse besides jacks mom and mrs oastler had no idea how the myth of his writing something which emma had so presciently set in motion was now a reality in her will emma had indeed left him everything lucky you leslie had remarkedlittle knowing just how lucky he would soon be jack was emmas literary executor in more ways than onethe exact terms of which would never be known to anyone other than bob bookman alan hergott and jack burns himselffor if ever a will were ironclad that would aptly describe how emma had set him up upon her death the film rights to the slushpile reader which emma had so entangled with the kind of approvals never granted to writerscast approval director approval final cutwere passed unencumbered to jack he could make the movie of her novel as he saw fit provided that he wrote the script what only bob bookman alan hergott and jack knew was that emma had already written a rudimentary adaptation of the slushpile readerher screenplay was a rough first draft there were also her notes addressed to jacksuggestions as to what he might want to change or add or delete and there were gaps in the story some substantial where it fell to him to fill in the blanks or as emma put it write your own dialogue baby cakes she had intended all along that jack would play the porn star in the film were he to reject this flagrant plagiarismshould jack not accept the falsehood that he was the sole screenwriter of the slushpile readerthe movie could not be made until a requisite number of years had passed under existing copyright law and emmas novel had at last entered the public domain as for emmas third novel mrs oastler had been rightit did not exist but emma hadnt suffered from writers block shed simply been busy adapting the slushpile reader as a screenplay by jack burns he learned from bob bookmanwhose other clients included directors and writers not actorshow emma had persuaded bob to accept jack as a client in her words jack burns is a writer not an actor he just doesnt know it yet the royalties from emmas backlistthe paperback sales of the slushpile reader and normal and nicewere also left to jack this would more than compensate him for his time spent finishing emmas screenplay in short emma had made jack declare himself a writer to the media while she was alive in death she had given him the opportunity to become one both the unfinished draft of the screenplay for the slushpile reader and emmas notes to jack had been removed from her computer she hadnt saved any copies on disk and shed deleted the files from her hard drive the only printed copy which alan hergott kept safely in his officewhere he and bob bookman explained to jack the terms of emmas willneeded to be transcribed into jacks handwriting from interviews hed given most of them bullshit everyone knew that jack burns wrote in longhand even leslie oastler knew that he didnt own a computer or a typewriter and that he allegedly liked to write by hand bob and alan thought that jack should do the copying into longhand as soon as possible he could take all the time he needed to revise but should i really do this jack asked them i meanis it right its what emma wanted jack but you dont have to do it alan said yeah its entirely your decision bookman told him but its a pretty good script jack would read it and concur if emma had taken charge of him in life he saw no reason to resist her efforts to control him from the grave that mrs oastler wanted jack to say a little something in remembrance of emma in the chapel at st hildas where mrs mcquat had first warned him of the dangers of turning his back on god seemed appropriate to the kind of writer hed become the public impressionnamely that emma oastler had suffered from a writers block of several years duration and had as a result become grossly overweightwas further fueled by the report of that italian journalist from the hollywood foreign press according to jacks interviewer emmas allegedly platonic but livein relationship with the actor jack burns showed signs of recent strain yet the bestselling author had been extremely generous to him in her will it had been known for years that jack was a closet writeras emmas obituary notice in entertainment weekly would say now he was said to be developing a screenplay of the slushpile reader emma mysteriously had not wanted her novel to be made into a movie while she was alive what guilt jack might have hadthat is in accepting emmas gift to him as rightfully hiswas overshadowed by the certainty that even if he were to tell the truth the truth was not what emma had wanted she had wanted to get the slushpile reader made as a moviemore or less as shed written it but with her name on the script the film as she wrote it would never have been made jack burns emma knew was a movie star with his name on the screenplay he could control it thus at one of the better addresses he knewin the beverly hills offices of bloom hergott diemer and cook llp attorneysatlawjack burns transcribed emmas rough draft of the slushpile reader into his handwriting and faithfully copied her notes as well with the first small change he made which was not even as big an alteration as the choice of a different wordjack used the contraction didnt where emma had written did nothe discovered how it was possible for a wouldbe writer to take at least partial possession of a real writers work and with subsequent changes deletions additions his sense of rightful ownershipthough falseonly grew this should not have surprised him after all jack was in the movie business he had seen how scripts were changed and by how many amateur hands these alterations were wrought in another draft or two the screenplay of the slushpile reader would feeleven to jackas if hed written it but the structure of the script and its prevailing tone of voice were entirely emmas as an actor jack knew how to imitate her voice not all art is imitation but imitating was what jack burns did best with a little directionin emmas case she gave him quite a lotwriting that is rewriting the script of the slushpile reader was just another acting job jack did his job well the decision to make michele maher the character the movies voiceover was emmas the idea to make the penultimate sentence of the novel the opening line of voiceover in the film was jacks there are worse relationships in la we see michele the script reader in bed with the porn starjust holding his penis we presume under the covers its all very tastefully done the story of how they meet when she reads the porn stars atrocious screenplay is a flashback naturally we never see his that is jacks penis jack took a similar liberty with the novels first sentence which had always been his favorite he made it the end line of micheles voiceover where he thought it had more weight either there are no coincidences in this town or everything in this town is a coincidence it was too good a line to waste on the opening credits for the most part jack followed emmas instructions the michele maher character remains an angel of hope to talentless screenwriters she is consciencestricken by the awful scripts she reads an impossible optimist in the cynical world of screenplay development emma recommended that jack give the porn star miguel santiago a more anglosounding name you dont look hispanic honey pie jack decided on james stronach the last name would make his mom happy and james was a natural for jimmythe unhappy actors porn name in bored housewives one through four keep it up inc and countless other adult films for which jimmy is famous james jimmy stronachs homage to james stewart is an essential aspect of his character jackburnsasjamesstronach memorizing jimmy stewarts lines in the shopworn angel and its a wonderful life would be among jacks most sympathetic moments in the movie jack didnt look like a bodybuilder before they filmed the slushpile reader but he had time to change his diet and step up the weightlifting in truth he would never look like a bodybuilder he just had to look like he belonged at the male end of the weight rack in the freeweights section of the gym his tattoos in the movie would be fakes emma had taken some of her best lines from the novel and given them to michele maher as voiceover i lived within breathing distance of a sushi dumpster in venicethat kind of thing shed left jack a note about dropping the mutualmasturbation scene theres already too much masturbation or implied masturbation for a movie emma was right to go easy on the masturbationalthough the slushpile reader would release as a film in the same year that another masturbation movie american beauty cleaned up at the academy awards miss wurtz who was dismayed at anthony hopkinss winning an oscar for best actor for eating people would be silent on the subject of kevin spaceys winning an academy award for beating off in a shower and jack decided to cut michele mahers misadventure with the swedish power lifter per the destroyer per too closely resembled the bodybuilder at golds who had beaten emma up instead jack added a scene with james stronach scouting the locker room at world gym for bodybuilders with small schlongs james makes a mistake someone he introduces to michele isnt as small as james thinks michele gets hurt he was bigger than you thought is all michele says in the movie the words schlong and penis are never used couldnt you tell him it hurt didnt you ask him to stop jackasjames asks her i asked but he wouldnt stop michele tells him naturally jackasjames gets the guy back at the gym jack added that scene too the notsosmall schlong asks james to spot for him when hes benchpressing three hundred pounds its too good an opportunity to pass up ive got it james tells him as if jackasjames could possibly hold three hundred pounds he drops the barbell on the big schlongs chest breaking his clavicle emma herself cut the line about micheles assessment of the small schlongs she sleeps with as a muted pleasureand theres no frontal nudity no actual pornfilm parts for the most part we see the porn stars between takes or going through the motions of their private lives the horny men in motel rooms with the television light flickering on their riveted faceswell those are the implied masturbation scenes that emma referred to in her notes the film would still pull an r rating when james and michele are holding each other not talking at the end of the picturejust breathing in the sushi perfume of the dumpster as micheles voiceover puts itjack thought hed been as true to emmas novel and the rough draft of her screenplay as he could have been jack did not incorporate emmas feelings that the reason screenwriters lost control of their scripts was that they caved to the money as hed heard emma say a hundred times it was emmas triumphin her novel if not in real lifethat the michele maher character was a whole lot more sympathetic to screenwriters than emma was the film itself became a kind of tribute to the unread screenplay the unmade movie and both emma and jack were careful to be kind to porn stars to that end jack would insist that hank long have a part james jimmy stronach needed a buddy didnt he besides jack had used hank longs unnaturally high voice as the model for his stutter in the movie the stutter was emmas ideato make it clear why jamess only career choice is in socalled adult films muffy that special kind of vampire had retired by the time they made the slushpile reader but jack was instrumental in casting her as the singlemom porn stara woman with a couple of uncontainable children both hyperactive boys muffy organizes barbecue lunches on the weekends the male porn stars like hank and jackasjames handle the outdoor grill and play catch with muffys kids emma advised jack to involve mildred ascheim in the picture tooif only in an advisory role not even bob bookman or alan hergott knew why milly and hank and muffy had seen jacks small schlong for jack to be cast as a porn star could have given rise to some ugly rumors but not if the industrys only professional witnesses were part of the movie what hadnt emma oastler done for jack burns how hard could it be to say a little something in memoriam at the st hildas chapel surely he owed emma that much in the front pew in a sideaisle seat miss wong sat as still as a hardboiled egg shed positioned herself directly beneath the pulpit where jack spoke and had drawn her knees tightly togetheras if the alleged weirdness of jacks hollywood reputation might spontaneously force her legs apart it must have been emma whod first called her miss bahamas why else would miss wong have come possibly emmas fictional depictions of extreme yet acceptable dysfunction had eased miss wongs disappointment with her life to have been born in a hurricane only to find herself becalmed at an allgirls schoolwell one can imagine how this might have left her feeling let down was an old girls death always commemorated by the attendance of the existing faculty at st hildas jack didnt remember such a turnout in remembrance of mrs wicksteed but she had been old and miss wong was not the only frontpew attendant among the faculty mr malcolm whod also ensconced himself there had planted the unseeing mrs malcolm in the center aisle mr malcolm sat beside his deranged wife with his hand on the armrest of her wheelchair lest she be moved by jacks words to charge the altar or go after his mother and mrs oastler who were seated directly across the aisle from the malcolms in a sideaisle seat at some distance from the pulpit miss caroline wurtz appraised jacks performance from her audienceofone perspective the chapel was not quite full there were a few bare spots in the sideaisle pews and plenty of standing room in the vicinity of the rear entrance where mr ramsey paced and bounced on the balls of his feetas if his grief for emma whom hed barely known had left him too agitated to sit down had emma been a more popular girl than jack had first supposed of course wendy fistsofstone holton had a centeraisle seat in a pew near the front a gaunt woman with a washedout complexion and flyaway silverblond hair wendy had been recently divorced from an ear nose and throat doctor whod declared himself gay upon the accusation that hed impregnated his nurse wendy had spoken to jack before emmas service she said it would be nice to have a coffee or something if he had the time in the pew behind miss wong sat the very personification of a hurricane preparing to consume the bahamasall twohundredplus pounds of charlotte breastswithbonesinthem barford emmas canadian publisher charlotte had offered jack her editorial assistance purely for the privilege of reading whatever it was he was alleged to be writinga novel or a memoir perhaps titled a penis at st hildas or so charlotte might have dreamed before the service shed hinted to jack that it must have been a bitch to interrupt his other writing to write an adaptation of the slushpile reader indeed hed managed to sayhis voice like hank longs unnaturally high in the company of grown women among whom jack remembered being a little boy he was again a child the hamilton sisters were there notably they were not sitting together penny between whose eyes he had once ejaculated watched him with the innocent eagerness of a soccer momsperm the farthest thing from her mind not to mention her forehead shed brought her children two terribly wellbehaved and welldressed little girls her husband penny told jack was having an allboys weekend away golf jack imagined he didnt ask as for pennys sister bonnie who was in grade twelve when jack was in grade four shed managed to enter the chapel without his seeing her limp to her pewassuming that bonnie still limped her proximity to the rear entrance where mr ramsey continued to make a moving target of himself suggested to jack that bonnies pelvis was irreparably twisted her dead right leg would forever trail behind her while she lurched forward on her leading left foot the eight years between them seemed of no consequence now shed never married jacks mother had told him bonnie hamilton was the most soughtafter real estate agent in toronto mrs oastler had said with that limp leslie had added it must hold things up to have her show you a property with lots of stairs ever the prompter bonnie sat in the back and moved her lips before jack spokeas if she already knew what he was supposed to say about emma as if hed actually written something and bonnie had miraculously read and memorized it before he began to speak she was forty but the fatalistic tug jack had felt when he was nine and bonnie seventeen was pulling them together still as hed tried to tell emma but had managed to tell only mrs mcquat bonnie hamilton was an older woman who when she looked at him couldnt look away for a moment jack thought that all the older women of his childhood were there connie turnbull whod run up to mrs oastler and alice and jackthis was immediately after connie had parked her car with a big dog in ithad clearly been practicing her lines from miss wurtzs longago dramatization of jane eyre it is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity connie said breathlesslyholding jacks shoulders and assessing him as if she were measuring him for a coffin or a suit dread remorse when you are tempted to err jack began then sensing how deeply connie turnbull was dissatisfied with tranquillity he stopped jack had come up to her breasts when theyd last engaged in this dialoguewhen hed played a gradethree rochester to her gradesix jane now in her twoinch heels connie was only a forehead taller than jack was you think me i daresay an irreligious dog he started to say on cue connie took his hand and kissed it her lips were parted and she made the usual contact with her teeth and tongueonly this time there was no applause alice and mrs oastler looked on aghast they clearly didnt know their jane eyre what must they have thought that jack had arranged an assignation with connie turnbull after emmas memorial service possibly that hed slept with connie the night before nice job jack connie whispered in his earher hair faintly redolent of dogbreath which at a glance he could see was fogging up the windows of her parked car thank goodness ginny jarvis wasnt there it was as if the gun hed shot her withonstage in a mailorder bride in the northwest territorieshadnt been firing blanks but jack was unprepared for those other old girls whod come to honor emma or had they many of them were unknown to him its you baby cakes he could imagine emma saying in her husky whisper the old broads are here to get a look at you maybe so how else to explain the presence of jacks classmates there were four of them all girls the booth twins heather and patsy whose identical blanketsucking sounds had been born in the terrors of emma oastlers sleepytime stories when they were in kindergarten together and emma was in grade sixthey couldnt have come out of respect for their old tormentor likewise maureen yap whose married name would forever elude jack maureen must have remembered how emma had abused her as alert as an endangered squirrel maureen had chosen a centeraisle seat in the back of the chapel lest she should feel the sudden need to fleefrom some reference jack might make to the batcave exhibit in the royal ontario museum perchance not to mention his reminding her of emmas divorceddad story he has just passed out from too much sex it was maureen yap whod asked emma what is too much sex nothing youll ever have emma had answered her dismissively after emmas service at what mrs oastler would describe as a kind of wake which was held in the great hall maureen yap approached jack a strand of her hair had strayed to a corner of her mouth where there also lingered a remnant of cheese little cubes of cheddar skewered on toothpicks were the only food servedand these were washed down by white wine which alice said was warm or by sparkling water which jack would have described as room temperature at best whether it was the speck of cheese or the strand of hairor her miserable conviction that emmas prophecy which denied maureen yap the possibility of ever having too much sex was incontrovertibly truemaureen was difficult to understand i blame the delay on pam hoover jack thought she said as she nervously spilled her wine he sipped some tepid sparkling water and considered what maureen might have meant all the women at emmas memorial servicethe ones jack recognized and the many he did nothad looked better in their school uniforms but maybe jack had looked better then too i must have misheard you maureen he replied bringing tears to her eyes i came all the way from vancouver maureen yap repeated im staying at the four seasons under my maiden name jack was staying at the four seasons tooa source of some friction between him and his mom jack wasnt sure what leslie oastler thought of his defection to a hotel maybe mrs oastler if not his mom understood why he wouldnt have wanted to spend the night in emmas bed or even in what had been jacks designated bedroom where emma had more than once held him in her armswhere mrs machado had taken such indelible advantage of him that they each had a room at the four seasons did not mean jack was doomed to sleep with maureen yap she would never find him he was thinking he was registered under a new name because the billy rainbow film had already been released jack was jimmy stronach now as hed newly invented the porn stars name and not even bob bookman or alan hergott had read his many revisions of emmas script truly no one knew who jack burns was those women who came to the st hildas chapel had come to see himjack burns the movie star he failed to recognize the majority of them but they were mostly in their thirties and forties if they hadnt known jack as a little boy theyd probably seen him around the schooland without a doubt they had seen his films their husbands if they had husbands werent with them their children occasionally were to be sure the women wore black or navy blue but their attire struck jack as more suitable for a dinner party than a funeral maybe this was underscored by emmas memorial service being held at the cocktail hour on a sunday evening and the fourth of jacks classmates to attend the service had not entered st hildas in kindergarten lucinda fleming had been a new student when hed first met her in grade one shed never experienced emmas sleepytime tales lucinda and what miss wong once referred to as her silent rage had never been intimate with emma oastler what had urged lucinda to include jack on her christmasletter list what had made her such a tireless organizer of the class reunions at st hildas despite everyone remembering her violent overreaction to being kissed her biting herself so badly that she required stitches her lying in a puddle of her pee on the thirdgrade floor if lucinda fleming had known how emma hated christmas letters and the people who wrote them she wouldnt have come to pay her last respects if shed had any idea of the contempt emma felt for the repeated announcements of childbearing which caused emma to denounce lucindas christmas letters as breeding statisticswell lucinda fleming had she known emma at all wouldnt have been moved to pray for emmas soul but it was jacks soul lucinda and the others were afterand while he might have been a movie star in those womens eyes he instantly lost the essential contact with his audience of one in their company in the st hildas chapel where even jesus was depicted as surrounded by womensaints maybe but women definitelyhe didnt feel like jack burns the actor he felt like jack burns the little boylost again in a sea of girls no matter that they were grown women now in reentering their world jack had returned to his childhood and its fearsand like a child he felt as frightened and as unsure of himself as hed ever been how could jack say a little something about emma to this audience of older womenamong them those grownup girls and older women who had formed him how could he feel at ease in this holy placewhere even as a little boy he had turned his back on god jack gripped the pulpit in both hands but he couldnt speak the words wouldnt come the congregation waited for him the chapel was as still as emmas heart its awful how your mind can trick you when youre scared jack thought among those womens faces all of them looking up at him jack could have sworn he saw mrs stackpolethe longdead dishwasher from his exeter days if hed dared to search among their faces he might have come upon mrs adkins so long ago immersed in the nezinscotor claudia who had threatened to haunt him or leah rosen dead in chile or even emma herself who no doubt would have been disappointed in jack for failing to say what hed come to say jack tried to look beyond their faces focusing on no oneexcept maybe mr ramsey who was always so encouraging but mr ramsey had disappeared from sight actually hed been swallowed up in the sea of late arrivalsyoung girls students at st hildas who all wore their school uniforms as if this special sundayevening service were just another day at school in jacks state of mind he mistook the girls for ghosts but they were boardersthe only st hildas students on campus on a sunday they must have mustered the courage to come to the chapel en masse from their residence they hadnt been invited although they were the ageseventeen or eighteenof emma oastlers most adoring fans young women had been emmas biggest readers it was a shock to see them there standing at the rear of the chapel in their universal postures of sullenness and exultation and prettiness and slouching disarrayas jack had seen them at the age of four when he first felt compelled to hold his mothers hand the girls made him remember his fear of their bare legswith their kneesocks pushed down to their ankles as if to reveal their interior unrest the cant of their hips their untucked shirts their unbuttoned buttons their bitten lips and willfully unattended hairwell there they were these unnamed girls some of them carrying wellworn paperbacks of emmas first or second novel all of them signifying to jack the gestures of an emerging sexuality he had so skillfully imitated as an actor even as a man they took jacks breath away but they brought him back to the task at hand he found his voice though it was weakbarely above a whisperand he spoke as if only to them those younggirl boarders they were probably in grades twelve and thirteen i remember jack began how she held my hand without mrs oastlers sigh of relief he wouldnt have known shed been holding her breath a spontaneous shudder shook miss wongs shoulders her knees unclenched her legs lolled apart emma oastler looked after me jack continued i didnt have a father he told themnot that they didnt already know that but emma was my protector the word protector animated maureen yap like a jolt of electricity her hands flew up from her lap her palms held open and apart like the pages of a prayer book or a hymnal jack half expected her to sing lucinda fleming curled her lower lip and seized it between her teeth there was a sound like the binding of a new book breakingwendy fistsofstone holton cracking her knuckles against her flat chest then jacks tears came unplannedhe wasnt acting without making a noise he just started to cryhe couldnt stop hed had more to say but what was the point wasnt this the performance theyd all been hoping for jack burns breaks down or was it an act one of the tabloids would say but it wasnt an act those heartbreaking young girls the abandoned boarders with their collected loneliness were what released himthe way they just stood there without once standing still they shook their hair they shrugged their shouldersthey stood first on one leg then the other they cocked a hip here an elbow there they scratched their bare knees and looked under their nails the tips of their tongues touching their upper lips or the corners of their open mouthsas if jack burns were in a movie on a giant screen and they watched him from the dark safe and unseen jack simply stopped talking and let his tears fall not at first knowing that this would have an unleashing effect on the assembled congregation he never meant to make them cry but that was the unavoidable result mrs malcolm rocked uncontrollably back and forth in her wheelchair as if a third accidenteither crippling or blinding or bothhad befallen her it must have been something mr malcolm in his grief was powerless to ward away alices face ageless when bathed in tears was tilted up to jack he could read her lips im so sorry jackie jack burns mr ramsey cried choking back a sob miss wurtz had covered her face with a white handkerchief as if she were less than stoically facing a firing squad caroline french usually a noshow at the class reunions was a noshow at emmas memorial service as well jack was sorry to miss the sound of her heelthumping as caroline must have missed the onceresonant heelthumps of her deceased twin gordongone to a boaters watery grave dire moaning from jimmy bacon would have fit right in at emmas service but jimmy was also absent fortunately the booth twins didnt disappoint jackheather and patsy with their identical blanketsucking sounds which were now intermingled with the congregations spontaneous grieving a wail escaped wendy horton who pressed her temples with her fists of stone a bellow broke forth from charlotte barford she clutched her breasts with bones in them as if her hammering heart could not otherwise be contained they all would have wept themselves silly if jack hadnt said something they would still be weeping if he hadnt thought of something to say let us pray jack said as if hed known all along what he was doing they were in a churchthey were supposed to pray youve had a bad day and youre very tired emma had intoned in his kindergarten class but this didnt sound like an appropriate prayer for three of you emma always said before concluding her squeezedchild saga your bad day just got worse but this lacked closure and the tone was threateningnot at all prayerlike in the usual uplifting sort of way and so jack burns said the only prayer he could remember at that moment it was the one he and his mother had stopped saying together it usually made him sad to think about it because it signified everything he and his mom didnt say to each other but it had the virtue of being short the heads bowed before him were quite a sight although hed not spotted chenko in the row directly behind his mother until chenko bowed his head there on his bald pate was the familiar ukrainian tattooa snarling wolf which no matter how many times jack had seen it was always unnerving the day thou gavest lord is ended jack said to the only face looking back at himthe wolfs thank you for it now what he wondered but jack was saved by the organist whom he never saw he or she was behind jack the organist knew how and when to fill a silence andat st hildaswith what to fill it the hymn that came crashing down upon them was one they knew by heart even those castaway boys whod left the school and its morning chapel at the end of grade fourtheyd not forgotten it certainly all the old girls of whatever age had committed these quatrains to memory they doubtless murmured their beloved william blake in their sleep and what about the teenage boarders standing restlessly in the rear of the chapel where mr ramsey became their instant choirmaster what about those young women yearning for a life out of their school uniforms but fearful of what that life might beas girls of that blossoming age are boy could they ever belt out that hymn theyd sung it every week or twice a week in their seemingly interminable time at st hildas the tune of jerusalemhymn a dogeared page in the st hildas hymnalsresounded triumphantly in every old girls heart they were william blakes words set to songthat odd belief that jesus came to england where blake imagined a spiritual israel and did those feet in ancient timewalk upon englands mountains green the congregation sang jack came down the altar stairs where he was momentarily accosted by wheelchair jane wailing like a banshee she blocked the center aisle but mr malcolm never hesitated he darted into the aisle and wheeled his startled wife a hundred and eighty degrees around propelling her wheelchair ahead of him jack followed the malcolms up the aislepausing only a second for mrs oastler emmas grieving mother to take his arm and allow him to escort her chenko perhaps the only member of the congregation who wasnt singingukrainian wrestlers werent familiar with william blakewas still weeping when alice ushered him up the aisle beside her chenko hobbled on his cane pew by pew from front to back the congregation followed them bring me my bow of burning goldbring me my arrows of desirebring me my spear o clouds unfoldbring me my chariot of fire sang the multitude even penny hamiltons little girls were singing of course they werethey were probably students at st hildas as jack neared the rear entrance to the chapel one of the seventeen or eighteenyearoldsa paleskinned blueeyed blonde as thin as a modelappeared to swoon or faint or trip into her fellow boarders arms from the look of her this might have been more the result of a starvation diet than her nearenoughtotouch proximity to jack burns a movie starnot that jack hadnt seen girls her age swoon or faint or trip in his presence before or it might have been the overstimulating effect of the soaring hymn the fallingdown girl distracted jack from the more immediate object of his desire bonnie hamilton had not only managed to slip into a pew at the back of the chapel without his seeing her limp to her seat shed likewise managed to slip awayahead of the recessional hymn and the wheelchairbound mrs malcolm who still led their lamenting retreat how had bonnie escaped jacks notice with a limp like hers maybe she knew instinctively when to leave out into the corridor marching to the great hall the girls and womens voices bore them along as they retreated from the chapel the organ grew less reverberant but the closing couplet of the hymns final quatrain roared in their midst loud and strong till we have built jerusalemin englands green and pleasant land sang the throng i gotta hand it to you jack leslie oastler whispered in his earthe word gotta very much the way her daughter would have said it theres not a dry eye or a dry pair of panties in the house jack wasnt sure that wakes were a good idea possibly the fault lay in the concept of mixing mourning with wine and cheese or mixing women with wine and cheesemaybe the mourning had nothing to do with it lucinda fleming was the first to inform him that the st hildas reunion cocktail parties were held in the gym not in the great hall which was not great enough to contain the old girls whod come to pay their last respects to emmaor to gawk at or hit on jack burns most of the women wore high heels of one kind or another theyd seen jack only when he was a little boy or on the big screen they were unprepared for how short he was those women who in their heels were taller than jack were inclined to remove their shoes hence they stood seductively before him either barefoot or in their stocking feettheir high heels in one hand the plastic cup of white wine in the other which left no hand free to handle the toothpicks with the little cubes of cheese from hollywood parties which some actors view as auditions jack was in the habit of eating and drinking nothing he didnt want all manner of disgusting things to get stuck between his teeth he didnt want his breath to smell like piss to a nondrinker white wine on the breath smells like gasolineor some other unburned fueland the old girls at emmas wake were breathing up a firestorm there were especially desperatelooking women in their late thirties or early forties more than a few of them were divorced their children were spending the weekend with their fathers or so jack was repeatedly told these women were shamelessly aggressive or at least inappropriately aggressive for a wake connie turnbull whom jackasrochester once had taken in his arms while declaring never never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable contradicted her eyrelike impression by whispering in jacks ear that she was entirely domitable miss wurtz whom jack had not seen since he and claudia had escorted her to the toronto film festival more than a decade before had dramatically covered her head with a black scarfvery nearly a veil she resembled a twelfthcentury pilgrim from an order of flagellants she was thinner than ever and her perishable beauty had not altogether disappeared but was diminished by an aura of supernatural persecutionas if she suffered from stigmata or another form of unexplained bleeding i shant leave you alone jack the wurtz whispered in the same ear that connie turnbull had whispered in no doubt youve met your share of loose women in california but some of these old girls have a boundless capacity for looseness which only women who are unaccustomed to being loose can have mercy he said there was only one old girl who whether or not she stood on the threshold of looseness interested himbonnie hamilton but despite her identifying limp she appeared to have slipped away as for the teenage boarders mrs malcolm had herded them together with her wheelchair shed driven the cowed girls to a far corner of the great hall where mr malcolm was attempting to rescue them from his demented wife wheelchair jane jack could only imagine was intent on keeping these young women safe from him in mrs malcolms mind or what was left of it jack burns was the evil reincarnation of his father in her view jack had returned to st hildas for the sole and lewd purpose of deflowering these girls whose sexual awakening could be discerned in the dishevelment of their school uniforms jack noticed that the young woman whod fainted or swooned or just tripped had lost one of her shoes she walked in circles offbalance scuffing her remaining loafer jack purposely made his way to these students they were the only ones whod brought copies of emmas novel probably for him to sign the girls gave no indication of sexual interest in himthey werent the slightest bit flirtatious most of them couldnt meet jacks eyes when he looked at them and those who could look at him couldnt speak they were just kids embarrassed and shy mrs malcolm was crazy to think they needed to be protected from jack one of them held out a copy of emmas first book for him to sign i wanted emma to sign it she said but maybe you wouldnt mind the other girls politely waited their turn to the thin unsteadylooking young woman with one shoe maureen yap said something clearly unkind but incomprehensible it sounded like did you just have major bridgework but jack knew maureen he was sure shed said dont you have any homework before the poor girl struggled to answer the yapbefore she fainted or swooned or tripped againjack took her by her cold clammy hand and said lets get out of here ill help you find your missing shoe yeah lets get outta here another of the boarders chimed in lets go look for ellies shoe someone stepped on my heel as i was leaving the chapel ellie said i didnt want to see who it was so i just forgot about it i hate it when that happens jack told the young women its so rude one of them said it sucks he said it might have been the word sucks that turned maureen yap away jack went with the girls down the corridor back toward the chapel looking for the lost loafer he signed copies of emmas books on the way i havent been with a bunch of boarders since a few girls sneaked me into their residence when i was in school here he told them how old were you a girl who reminded jack of ginny jarvis asked i guess i was nine or ten jack said and the boarders were how old ellie asked they would have been your age jack told her thats sick ellie said nothing happened did it one of the boarders asked jack no of course noti just remember being frightened he replied well you were a little boy one of them pointed out of course you were frightened look theres my stupid shoe ellie said the loafer lay kicked aside against the corridor wall how will you ever make a movie of the slushpile reader one of the young women asked him its potentially so gross another of the girls said the film wont be as explicit as the novel jack explained the word penis wont ever be mentioned for example what about vagina one of the girls asked not that either he said why didnt she just get her vagina fixed ellie asked of course jack knew she meant the michele maher character but his thoughts went entirely to emma i dont know jack answered there must have been some psychological reason ellie one of her fellow boarders said i mean its not exactly knee surgery is it the young women ellie among them nodded soberly they were such sensible girlschildren at heart but in so many other ways more grown up than emma at that age not to mention ginny jarvis and penny hamilton or charlotte barford or wendy holton jack wondered what had been so different or wrong about him that those girls had ever thought it was acceptable to abuse him these girls wouldnt have harmed a little boy jack felt in their company like a nine or tenyearold againonly he felt safe so safe and like such a little boy that he suddenly announced i have to pee it was exactly the way a nine or tenyearold would have said it the young women were unsurprised they responded to his announcement in a strictly practical fashion do you remember where the boys washroom is ellie asked him theres still only one another of the young women said ill show you where it is ellie told jack taking his hand it was exactly the way she would have taken a nine or tenyearold by the hand for some reason it broke jacks heart it had all been his fault he thoughtthe way those older girls in his time at st hildas had taken such an unnatural interest in him it must have been something they detected in him jack was convinced that he was the unnatural one jack pulled his hand away from ellie he didnt want her or her friendsthese incredibly healthy normal young womento see him cry jack felt he was on the verge of dissolving into tears but in that unembarrassed way that a nine or tenyearold might cry he was suddenly ashamed of what the real michele maher might have called his weirdness i can certainly find the boys washroom by myself jack told themlaughing about it but in an actorly way i believe i could find that washroom from the darkness of my grave he added which made it sound like his journey to the boys washroom was a heroic voyagemeant to be undertaken alone and in full acceptance of such perils as one might encounter along the way jack was soon lost in an unfamiliar corridor perhaps the old school had been repainted he was thinking the stairwells were the likely haunts of ghosts he believedmrs mcquat his departed conscience or even emma disappointed by the brevity of his prayer the voices of the boarders no longer accompanied him on his journey jack wasnt followed or so he thought ahead of him not far from a bend in the corridor was the dining hallall closed up and dark did a figure old and stooped emerge from the shadows there it was an elderly woman no one jack recognized but surely not a ghost she looked too solidly built for a spirit a cleaning woman from the look of her he thought but why would a cleaning woman be working at st hildas on a sunday and where were her mop and pail jack my dahleenmy leetle one mrs machado cried to see her to know it was really her had the effect on jack of her highgroin kick of so many years ago he couldnt move or speakhe couldnt breathe hed recognized that leslie oastler had a certain power over him and always would have but in all his efforts conscious and unconscious to diminish his memories of mrs machado jack had underestimated her implacable authority over him hed never defeated heronly emma had gone was her waistwhat little shed ever had of one mrs machados lowslung breasts protruded from the midriff of her untucked blouse with the overobviousness of an amateur shoplifters stolen goods but what shed stolen from jack was more obvious mrs machado had robbed him of the ability to say no to her or to anyone else this is a frightened little boy bonnie hamilton had told her sister and ginny jarvis when those older girls were trying to get jacks penis to respond in mrs machados company jack was still a frightened little boy she circled him in the corridor as if she were setting up her customary singleleg attack she underhooked his left arm the thick fingers of her left hand closing tightly around his right wrist jack knew the takedown she appeared to be looking for but he couldnt overcome his inertia he made no move to defend himself mrs machado pressed her forehead against his chest the top of her headentangled with gray wiry hairtouched his throat jack was surprised by how short she was but of course hed been shorter when they last did this dance togetherwith chenko repeating his familiar litany like a call to prayer handcontrol circle circle dont lean on her jackie it wasnt wrestling that mrs machado had in mind with her insistent grip on jacks right wrist she guided his hand under her blouse with her broad nose mrs machado nudged his necktie out of her way and unbuttoned the second button of his shirt with her teeth jack thought he detected the smell of anchovies in her hair it was the contact his right hand made with her sagging breasts which was quickly followed by the feeling of her tongue on his chest that filled him with revulsion and gave him the strength to push her away until that moment hed never believed in socalled recovered memorynamely that various acts of abuse or molestation from ones childhood are mercifully erased only to return with a vengeance vividly many years down the road as jack recoiled from mrs machado in the semidark sunday corridor of his old school he remembered the button trick how she had unbuttoned and unzipped him with her teethand all the other clever things shed managed to do with her mouth which hed blanked from his memory dont be cruel meester penis mrs machado whispered as jack retreated from her she was shuffling after him in her laceless running shoes when she suddenly halted it wasnt jacks feeble resistance that had stopped her her gaze had shifted she was peering around him or behind himand the second he turned to look where she was looking mrs machado was gone she must have been in her late sixties or early seventies how could she have been that agile that quick on her feet or was the bend in the corridor closer to them than jack had thought it was more probable of course that mrs machado had never been there at all in any case jack hadnt heard the wheelchair behind him the wheels on that smooth linoleum floor didnt make a sound he was after all on haunted ground jack the woman in the wheelchair said you look like youve seen a ghost hed expected to be confronted by mrs malcolmever the protector of those girls whose violation she imagined jack sought but the woman in the wheelchair was an attractive fortyyearold real estate agent in a black pantsuit bonnie hamilton had managed to park her wheelchair in some outofsight place near the back of the chapel and limp to and from her pew unseen shed been successful in the real estate business she would tell jack later because she always left her wheelchair at the front entrance and limped with her clients from room to roomeven as leslie oastler had cruelly suggested up and down stairs my clients must feel sorry for me bonnie would joke nobody wants to disappoint a crippleto add insult to injury as they say but at public events or whenever there was a crowd bonnie hamilton was also successful at keeping her limp to herself she had a knack for sneaking in and out of her wheelchair without anyone seeing her in the wheelchair she looked elegant she was as beautiful to jack as shed been when they were students together jack was still speechless from his encounter with mrs machado real or notand how grotesquely he now recalled the lost details of everything mrs machado had done to him it was too much for him on top of all thatto be rescued by bonnie hamilton whod tried her hardest to protect him from her sister and ginny jarvis when hed been nine or ten jack dropped to his knees and burst into tears bonnie wheeling closer pulled him headfirst into her lap bonnie must have thought that she had made him cry it must have been jacks memory of being coerced to ejaculate on her sisters forehead that was traumatizing him still that terrible loss of his innocence in the big girls residence when hed been a frightened little boythis in addition to his losing emma no doubt had undone him jack i think about what an awful thing we did to youevery day of my life i think of you bonnie cried jack tried to shake his head in her lap but bonnie probably thought he was attempting to get away from her she held him tighter no nodont be afraid she urged him im not surprised it makes you cry to look at me or that you dress up as a woman or do other weird things after what we did to you why wouldnt you be weird of course youre weird bonnie cried shes completely crazy jack thought struggling to breathe she gripped his hair with both hands squeezing his face between her thighs bonnie hamilton felt very strong she clearly worked out a lot but you cant wrestle a woman in a wheelchair jack just let her hold him as hard as she wanted to bending over him bonnie whispered in his ear we can put it all to rest jack ive talked to a psychiatrist about the best way to get over it we can just move on she didnt hear him ask how in her lap jacks voice was muffled between her thighs her fingers combing through his hair stroked the back of his neck normal sex jackthats the best way to get over an upsetting experience bonnie hamilton told him how jack wished emma had been alive to hear this wouldnt she have gotten a kick out of the very idea of normal sex wasnt it destiny after all hadnt bonnie and jack once looked at each other and been unable to look away and that had been when he was in fourth grade and she in twelfth besides he was jack burns wasnt he supposed to sleep with everybody just how would it have made bonnie hamilton feel if he hadnt slept with her a cripple still it gave jack pauseshe was definitely nuts bonnie must have seen the reservation on his face when she finally released his head from her lap her confidence wavered she became unbearably shy dont feel that im forcing you jack you poor boy she cried youve been forced enough she backed her wheelchair away from him it was a disturbing image jack had the idea that they were rewinding a film they were returning in time at any second mrs machado would reappear he could sense her coming around the bend in the corridor reemerging from the shadows under the circumstances jack chose to leave with bonnie all night at the four seasons bonnie hamilton never once limped for jack she didnt limp when she was lying down once when she got out of bed to use the bathroomand again when she got dressed in the morningshe asked him to look away jack never fell asleep he was too afraid of the nightmares mrs machado might give him in the dark when he felt the first nightmare approachingeven though he was wide awakejack asked bonnie if shed seen the short stout woman hed been talking to in the corridor jacks body might have blocked bonnies view down low in her wheelchair shed had the impression that he was talking to himself i thought maybe you were acting she said this didnt prove that mrs machado was a ghost or that hed only imagined her there was a hair on jacks necktie he saw it when he undressed for bed more gray and wiry than a hair belonging to bonnie hamilton or jack and no one else had put her head on his chest and then there was the second button of his shirt it was already unbuttoned when jack undressed that night this made him shiver naturally the button trick was the source of the nightmares jack feared would beset himnot because of the trick itself which for so many years hed happily forgotten but because of what it led to all those other games mrs machado had played it was compassionate of bonnie hamilton to stay awake with him of course she thought of their night together as therapy and maybe it was for that night if not all the others that followed it bonnie held the button trick at bay daughter alice goes home alice and leslie oastler were perturbed with jack for leaving emmas wake at st hildas without saying goodbye a tough bunch of old girlsactually mrs oastlers former classmates at the schoolhad invited leslie and alice out to dinner jack was expected to join them or at least not run off with a woman in a wheelchair given jacks olderwoman reputation his mother and mrs oastler first thought that hed absconded with wheelchair jane no doubt the description of jacks emotional departure with bonnie hamilton was exaggerated by several eyewitnessesthat lipbiter lucinda fleming among them lucinda probably in a silent rage had observed peewee folding bonnies wheelchair and stowing it in the trunk of the limo and while alice and leslie oastler were wondering out loud what on earth mrs malcolm and jack had done with poor mr malcolm penny hamilton had a hissy fit in front of her own childrenthose darling little girls i knew it penny cried clawing at her pretty hair jack burns is fucking my crippled sisterthat slut miss wurtz whod managed to shed an uplifting light on tess of the durbervilles now put a positive spin on penny hamiltons announcement thank goodness thats been clarified caroline told alice and mrs oastler jack burns mr ramsey was overheard murmuring in faithful appreciation the old girls to a one were stunned silent only the boarders those irrepressible seventeen and eighteenyearolds continued to carry on a conversation which they conducted in a kind of shorthandcomprehensible only to them the wurtz in her ongoing effort to cheer up alice and mrs oastler said well it would have been more predictable but not nearly as much fun if jack had left as a woman instead of with one jack checked out of the hotel pretty early the next morningif not as early as bonnie hamilton who had a seven oclock appointment in rosedale they told him at the front desk that thered been about fifty calls for jack burns and no small number of increasingly irritable requests for billy rainbow but no one had known to ask for jimmy stronach he and bonnie hadnt been disturbed jack took a taxi to forest hill he fully expected that his mother would still be asleep and that mrs oastler would have been up for hours leslie surely would have made some coffee he wasnt wrong about the coffee mrs oastler told him that his mom had left the house before sevenan unheardof hour for alice to be up much less dressed and going anywhere no one wanted a tattoo the first thing in the morning leslie looked as if shed just got up she was wearing one of emmas old tshirts which fit her like a baggy dress evidently shed slept in it the tshirt almost touched her knees the sleeves falling below her elbows jack followed her into the kitchen where the coffee smelled fresh there were no dishes in the sink and not a crumb on the kitchen table it didnt look as if alice had eaten any breakfast mrs oastler sat down at the neat table her hands trembling a little as she drank her coffee jack poured himself a cup and sat down beside her i had a bet with your mom jack i said you were gonna get gangbanged by that bunch of boarders alice thought you were gonna go home with that overenthusiastic woman with the big dog nobody bet on the crip where did mom go leslie another mri mrs oastler said imaging they call it imaging for what come on jack have you talked to her lately i dont get the impression that youve talked at all ive tried he told her she wont say anything to me you havent asked her the right questions jack there was a white envelope on the kitchen table it stood perfectly straight propped between the salt and pepper shakers as innocentseeming as an invitation to a wedding if it were something alice had left for jack it would have had his name in big letters on itit would have had her drawing of a monstrous heart bursting with motherly love for him or some other overthetop illustration of undying affection but the envelope was unmarked and unsealed has my mom been sick leslie envelope what envelope i dont see an envelope mrs oastler said looking right at it whats in the envelope he asked nothing youre supposed to see jack surely nothing i would ever show you jack opened the envelope which of course was what leslie wanted him to do and placed the four photographs faceup on the clean kitchen tableas if they were playing cards in a game of solitaire with formidably different rules the photos were slightly varying views of a young womans torso from her pretty navel to her shoulders she was naked her breasts which were fully formed didnt droop her breasts and the smoothness of her skin were what indicated her youthfulness to jack but he was drawn above all to her tattoo it was a good one of what his mom would have called the old school it was a traditional maritime hearttorn vertically in two all in tattooblue the tattoo was all outline no shading the heart was tattooed on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast where it touched both the breast and the heart side of the rib cage it was exactly where in alices opinion a tattoo of a damaged heart could best be hiddenand binding this broken heart together like a bandage were the words until i find you the words were in cursive on a scroll the tattoo was good enough to be his mothers work but jack knew daughter alices handwriting by heart the writing wasnt hers more traditionalinstead of the until i find youwas the actual name of the lover whod left you or deceived you or otherwise broken your heart jack could easily imagine he was looking at a tattoo ole or a doc forest or a tattoo peteror possibly sailor jerrys work from halifax long ago the photos looked old enough but jack should have been thinking about the young woman not her tattoo youre looking at the wrong breast jack leslie oastler said i dont know why alice bothered to keep that tattoo a secret from you all these years the tattoo isnt whats gonna kill her that was when jack realized he was looking at pictures of his mothers breastsin which case the photographs must have been taken about twenty years ago contrary to her unique reputation as a tattoo artist not to mention what shed told him his mom had been tattooedprobably when william broke her heart or shortly thereafter certainly when jack had still been a child or even before hed been born alices insistence on hiding her tattoo from jack was something hed mistaken for modesty which had never made the greatest sense alongside the opposite impression he had of her it wasnt modestynot wanting jack to take a bath with her never allowing him to see her naked and this had nothing to do with the alleged scar from her csection it was the tattoo that alice hadnt wanted jack to seeand not only because she was tattooed which contradicted her claim to originality among tattoo artists mainly it was the tattoo itself that shed needed to conceal because the you in until i find you must have been his missing fatherit was william shed kept a secret from the start and to mark herself for life because of him belied the indifference she pretended toabandoning her search for william and refusing to talk to jack about him the twoinch scar on the upper outer quadrant of alices right untattooed breast was a thin surgical line with no visible stitchmarks she had the lumpectomy when she was thirtyone mrs oastler informed jack you were twelvein grade seven if i remember correctly i was at redding he remembered out loud it was when mom said she was going to come see me but she didnt she had radiation jackand the chemotherapy was repeated every four weeks for six cycles the chemo made her sick for a few days every monthyou know vomitingand of course she lost her hair she didnt want you to see her bald or with a wig you cant see the scar in her right armpit in the photographs its hard enough to see if youre looking right at it lymphnode removalrather standard procedure leslie explained did a mammogram detect it or did she feel the lump jack asked i felt it mrs oastler said it was fairly firm actually hard to the touch has the cancer come back leslie a recurrence in the other breast is very common mrs oastler said but it hasnt come back in her breast it could have spread to her lungs or to her liver but its gone to her brain not the worst place it could show upbones are awful what do they do for brain cancer he asked its not really brain cancer jack the breast cancer has metastasized in her brainthose are breastcancer cells when breast cancer goes somewhere else i guess theres not much they can do about it so mom has a tumor in her brain jack asked a spaceoccupying lesion i think they call itbut yeah its a tumor to you and me leslie said with a shrug any intervention would be futile they say even chemo would be merely palliative to relieve symptomsit isnt a cure there aint a cure she addedthe curious aint like leslies use of gonna and oughta being a grieving mothers conscious or unconscious effort to evoke her late daughters persistent but bestselling abuse of the language mrs oastler picked up the photographs and put them in a kitchen drawer it was where the manuals to the appliances were kept but it was full of other junk it was where emma and jack as kids had searched for scotch tape or thumbtacks or paper clips or rubber bands the photos of her breasts had been alices idea she wanted leslie to show them to jack but not until after she was dead what are the symptoms leslie despite the antiseizure medication she may have a few more seizures shes had one anywayi saw it i felt the lump i saw the seizure theres not much i miss mrs oastler added is it like a convulsion or a stroke he asked i suppose so leslie answered shrugging again ive also noticed vague changes in her moods even in her personality leslie moms moods change all the timeher personality has always been vague shes different jack youll see especially if you can get her to talk to you jack called a taxi to take him to queen street he thought hed go wait for his mom to show up at daughter alice mrs oastler put her arms around jack and hugged him with her head against his chest shes gonna go quickly jack they say itll be pretty painless but shes gonna go fast jack stood in the kitchen with his arms around leslie hugging her back she wasnt hitting on him she just wanted him to hold her you oughta talk to maureen yap jack she kept calling you all night from the four seasons i dont think maureen wants to talk to me he told mrs oastler i said you oughta talk to her jack maureen yap is a doctor shes a fucking oncologist oh in the lobby of the four seasons the frontdesk clerks were surprised to see jack burns checking in hed planned to spend a couple of days in new york before flying back to la but when he registeredagain as jimmy stronachjack told them that he would be staying in toronto indefinitely meaning until further notice he also asked them feigning indifference if maureen yap had checked out in fact dr yap had just called room service and ordered her breakfast they gave him back his old room because hed forgotten to take the do not disturb sign off the door and the hotel maids hadnt been informed that hed checked out it was almost as if hed never left the hoteland never been to forest hill and backexcept for the news that his mother was dying it crossed jacks mind to call maureen this is room service dr yap he might say would you like to have jack burns with your breakfast jack could only imagine maureen saying yes please but he didnt feel like joking around when maureen had told him she was staying at the hotel under her maiden name she hadnt been kidding jack took a quick shower and put on the hotel bathrobe and the stupid white slippers as if he were on his way to or from the swimming pool he knew maureen yaps room number his fans at the front desk had told him although they werent supposed to after all he was jack burns if hed called the front desk and asked them to send him a pepperoni pizza with two hookers theyd have had the pizza and the prostitutes at his door in about fortyfive minutes the movies had taught jack the power of presenting himself without words and the little peephole in maureen yaps hotelroom door offered maureen an unexpected closeup of her favorite actor her breakfast had arrived only moments beforenow here was jack burns in a bathrobe i blame the delay on pam hoover maureen mumbled again as she let jack in she was wearing her hotel robe toosans the stupid white slippers jack kicked his off at the door you came all the way from vancouver for what he asked untying her robe to have too much sex with you maureen yap said untying his never mind that it sounded like to shave my legs for you jack knew what she meant she was a tiny woman the cavity of her pelvis couldnt have been bigger than a thirteenyearold girls the skin on her breasts had the transparency of a childsa faint bluish tone as if her veins although unseen lent their color to her skin jack could touch the fingers of his hands together when he encircled her thigh my femur is smaller than your humerus maureen told him theres no describing what that sounded like but he somehow managed to understand her maureens husband and son called her in her hotel room at am in vancouver where the father was getting the little boy up for school maureen covered one of jacks ears with her cupped palmpressing his head and his other ear into her flat tummy he could still hear her endearments to her husband who was also a doctor and her young sonnot that jack could follow wordforword what she told them maureen was in tears jack could feel the taut muscles in her lower abdomen it was the sadness of emmas memorial service she told her familyit still made her cry to think about it jack heard pam hoovers name againthere was mention he thought of how pam seemed shaken and was lately insane only after the phone call would jack figure out that maureen yap had said she was taking a later plane to vancouver it was also after the phone call when jack reminded maureen that from their bed in the four seasons they were very close to the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum which prompted maureen to show him her fruitbat and vampirebat imitations naturally this led them to enact emmas squeezedchild sagaall three endings there is no way to have too much sex with you the yap told him later when he was having some difficulty peeing in her bathroom he heard this of course as it is no fair i bathe all bare for you or something like that my mother has cancer jack called from the bathroom not too loudly the door was open shes dying come back to bed maureen said distinctly once theyd moved on to medical matters he had no trouble understanding her dr yap spoke very clearly what would happen to his mothers brain jack wanted to know it must have sounded to maureen like a childs question because she held him in her arms with his head against her breasts and talked to him as if he were a child it probably wont be as bad for her as it will be for you jack she began depending on where in her brain the tumor is you should send me the mri okay jack said he noticed he was crying if its in her visual cortex shell go blind if its in the speech cortexwell you get the picture if the cancer eats through a blood vessel she will hemorrhage and die without ever knowing or feeling what has happened to her or as her brain swells she will simply slip away will she be in a coma he asked she could be jack she could die peacefully in a comashe could simply stop breathing but along the way she might think she was someone else she might have hallucinationsshe might smell strange nonexistent smells truly anything is possible she will go fairly quickly and painlessly but she may not know who she is when she goes the hard part for you jack is that you may not know who she is either the hard part for jack as he would tell maureen was that hed never known who his mother was the description of her ultimate death seemed almost familiar do you mind if i call you dr yap jack asked maureen when they were saying goodbye not if you call me incessantly she said he wouldnt of course maureen knew that when jack sent her his moms mri he already had a pretty good idea of where the tumor wasthe socalled spaceoccupying lesion alice knew too dr yaps interpretation of the mri would merely confirm the prognosis the tumor was in the limbic systemthe emotional center of the brain well isnt that fucking great leslie oastler would say i suppose that alice will think the whole thing is terribly funny or shell be laughing one minute and crying the nextan emotional yoyo either telling grossly inappropriate jokes or drowning in some inexpressible sorrow of course from jacks point of view his mom had always been that way that a malignant tumor now occupied the emotional center of her brain seemed unremarkable even normal if its gone this far jack maureen yap had forewarned him im sure that your mother has already come to terms with dying just imagine how much shes thought about it she even decided somewhere along the line not to tell you that means to me that shes thought about it a lotenough to have the peace of mind to keep it to herself its mrs oastler who cant come to terms with it and youyou wont have time to come to terms with it until shes gone itll happen that fast jack shes only fiftyone hed cried against her thirteenyearolds breasts her childsize body cancer likes you when youre young jack maureen had told him even cancer slows down when youre old there was no slowing down alices cancer it would run away with her in a hurry befitting a disease that had a twentyyear head start later that same morningafter hed said goodbye to dr yapjack got himself down to queen street and once more entered the tattoo world of daughter alice where he and his mother had a little talk a little dance would more accurately describe it do you still take your tea with honey dear his mom asked him when he walked into the shop i just made a fresh pot no honey mom we have to talk my arent we serious this morning his mother said i suppose leslie spilled the beans in her dramatic fashion youd think she was the one whos dyingshes so angry about it jack didnt say anything he just let her talk knowing she might clam up at any moment of course leslie has a right to be angry alice went on after all im leaving herand i promised her i never would she let me go to all those tattoo conventions where theres a lot of fooling around but i always came back i guess youre leaving me too jack said when were you planning to tell me the only person i ever wanted to agonize over me was your father jack and he simply refused he didnt want meeven knowing that if he rejected me i would never let him be with you perhaps it was being with maureen yap that made jack wonder if hed misheard what his mother had said but he could tell by the way she suddenly gave his cup of tea her complete attention that she might have said a little more than shed meant to say he wanted to be with me jack asked her im the one whos dying dear dont you think you should ask me about me he watched her put a heaping teaspoon of honey in his tea her hands like mrs oastlers at the kitchen table were shaking slightly as she stirred the spoon in the cup jack knew that hed not misheard her shed clearly said that william didnt want hereven knowing that if he rejected her she would never let him be with jack when his mom handed him his cup of tealooking for all the world as if she were still the wronged partyjack imagined there would be no stopping him this time no turning him away if my dad wanted to be with me jack persisted why did he flee from us i mean everywhere we went in city after city why had he always left before we arrived the cancer is in my braini suppose you know his mother replied i wouldnt be surprised if my memory is affected dear lets start with halifax jack continued did he leave halifax before you got there if he was still there when you arrived he must have wanted to see me be born he was still there when i arrived alice admitted with her back turned to jack i wouldnt let him see you be born so he wasnt exactly running away from you jack said did leslie tell you about my mood changes his mom asked theyre not always logical or what you would expect im guessing its bullshit that i was a cesarean birth jack told her the scar from your csection wasnt why you wouldnt let me see you naked there was something else you didnt want me to see isnt that right leslie showed you the photographsthat bitch alice said you werent supposed to see them until after i was gone why show me at all he asked i was beautiful once his mother cried she meant her breasts when she was youngerhed meant her tattoo ive been thinking about iti mean your tattoo jack told her ill bet its a tattoo ole from copenhagen you had it almost from the start well of course its a tattoo ole jack ole preferred only outlining and i wasnt about to shade myself i suppose you wouldnt let the ladies man shade you he said i wouldnt let lars touch me jacknot even shading i wouldnt have shown ladies man madsen my breasts were getting ahead of ourselves mom lets talk about toronto before we talk about copenhagen when we got to toronto had my dad already left he got a girl at st hildas in trouble jackhe had another girlfriend at the school and for all i know an affair with one or more of the teachers too mom i know about the girls he was with other women in halifax she blurted out mom you told me i know he left you but i never knew he wanted to see me i couldnt stop him from seeing you could i she asked when you were out in public i couldnt prevent him from getting a look at you but if he wasnt going to be with me why should i have let him be with you so that i would have a father who knows what sort of father he would have been jack with a man like that you can never be sure did he see me in toronto mom did he get a look at me when i was a babybefore you drove him away how dare you his mother said i never drove him away i gave him all the looks at you that he could stand i let him see youat least from a distanceevery time he asked he asked what do you mean from a distance mom well i would never let him see you alone she explained he wasnt allowed to talk to you what wasnt he getting jack wondered what didnt add up had he been a child on display for his father perhaps to tempt william to accept alices termsnamely to live with her let me get this straight jack said to his mother you let him see me but if he wanted further contact with me he had to marry you he did marry me jackbut only under the condition that we get immediately divorced i thought it was mrs wicksteeds idea that i have his nameso i would seem less illegitimate jack said i never knew you married him it was mrs wicksteeds idea that the only legitimate way for you to have his name would be if he married me and we were then divorced his mother told himas if this were a petty detail of no lasting importance so he must have been around in torontowhen we were herefor quite some time jack said barely long enough to get married and divorced alice said and you were still an infant i knew you wouldnt remember him she hadnt wanted jack to remember william obviously but mrs wicksteed was my benefactor wasnt she jack asked i mean we were her rentfree boarders werent we mrs wicksteed was the epitome of generosity his mother said with indignationas if hed been questioning mrs wicksteeds character and good intentions which hed never doubted who paid for things mom mrs wicksteed for the most part alice replied frostily your father occasionally helped he sent money it was the least he could do his mom cried i never asked william for a pennyhe just sent what he could but the money had to come from somewhere jack realized she must have known where william was every step of the way which brings us to copenhagen jack said we werent exactly searching for him were we you must have already known he was there you havent touched your tea dear is there something wrong with it did you take me to copenhagen to show me to him jack asked her some people jackmen especiallyare of the opinion that all babies look alike that infants are all the same but when you were a fouryearold you were something specialyou were a beautiful little boy jack he was only beginning to get the picture shed used him as bait how many times did my dad see me jack asked i mean in copenhagen what jack really meant in terms familiar to him from the movie business was how many times she had offered william the deal jackie his mother said stopping herself as if she detected in her tone of voice something of the way shed admonished him as a child when she began afresh her voice had changed she sounded frail and pleading like a woman with breastcancer cells taking hold of the emotional center of her brain any father would have been proud of what a gorgeouslooking boy you were jack what dad wouldnt have wanted to see the handsome young man you would become but you wouldnt let him jack reminded her i gave him a choice she insisted you and i were a team jackiedont you remember we were a package he could have chosen us or nothing he chose nothing but how many times did you make him choose jack asked her we followed him to sweden to norway to finland to the netherlands momyou gave up only because australia was too fucking far he should have watched his language which may have seemed especially disrespectful to a dying womannot that his mother had ever tolerated his use of the word fucking you think youre so smart alice snapped at him you dont know the half of it jack we didnt follow him i made your father follow us he was the one who gave up she saidsoftly but no less bitterly as if her pride were still hurt more than she could bring herself to say jack knew then that he knew nothing and that the only questions she would ever answer were direct onesand he would have to guess which direct questions were the right ones to ask a hopeless task you should talk to leslie his mother told him leslie likes to talk tell her i dont care what she tells you jack mom leslie wasnt there he meant in europe but his mom wasnt paying attention she was pushing buttons on her new cd player seeking to drown him out with the usual music i want to send your mri to maureen yap jack told her shes an oncologist tell leslie shell arrange it jack the door to their conversation was closing once againnot that shed ever opened it an inch more than she had to jack tried one last time maybe i should take a trip he said ill start with copenhagen where we began why not take leslie with you jack thatll keep her out of my hair i think ill go alone jack said his moms exasperation with the cd player was growing wheres the remote he asked her you should use the remote mom alice found the remote pointing it at jackthen at the cd playerlike a gun just do me a favor jackie boy she said if youre going to go find him do it after im gone the cd player was new but bob dylan was familiaralbeit a lot louder than they expected the guilty undertaker sighs the lonesome organ grinder cries the silver saxophones say i should refuse you jesus turn it down jack said but his mother pushed the wrong buttonnot the volume the song started over at the beginning go find him after im gone alice said pointing the remote at jacknot at the stupid cd player i want to know what really happened ive been asking you about the past mom i dont know enough about him to know if i want to find him well if thats the trip you want to take go on and take it his mother told him pointing the remote in the right direction and turning down the volume though it was still too loud the cracked bells and washedout horns blow into my face with scorn but its not that way i wasnt born to lose you thanks to bob they didnt hear the little tinkle of the bell as the door to the tattoo parlor swung open it was warm and stuffy in the shop but even after he closed the door the grayfaced man in the doorway kept shivering he had white shoulderlength hair like an old hippie there was a rising sun sewn on his jeans jacket just above his heart and he wore a red bandanna around his throatrichard harris as a cowboy or perhaps an overthehill rodeo rider would you like a cup of tea alice asked him the man was still too cold to talk but he nodded he wore tight black jeans and blackandpurple cowboy boots with a diamondbackrattlesnake pattern he walked stifflegged to the couch which jack knew was a sofa bed his mom occasionally slept there mrs oastler had told himprobably when alice and leslie had been quarreling the old cowboy sat down on the couch as gingerly as you might imagine him settling himself on a bronco i want you i want youi want you so bad bob dylan was wailing honey i want you youre a fullbody arent you alice asked the cowboy who was still shivering almost he told her you couldnt see a tattoo on himonly a relentless chill the cowboy was at least a decade older than william burns would be jack thought yet jack felt an instant pang as if his dad were shivering with cold the old hippie whose hands were shaking was having trouble removing one of his cowboy boots jack knelt down and helped him get the boot off the boot was so tight the cowboys sock came off with it his bare foot was startlingly white descending below the pant leg of his jeans the skull of a longhorned steer completely covered the cowboys ankle the firebreathing flames from the skeletons open mouth licked the top of his unmarked foot the cowboy made no effort to remove his other boot jack surmised that the other foot was tattooed like all the rest of him i got one thing left thats clean the cowboy hippie said to alice youre lookin at it your hands and face are clean alice told the cowboy i gotta keep my hands and face clean lady if i wanna find any interestin work as jack had done so often in the past he just slipped away he poured his cup of tea down the sink edging his way to the door ill see you at home mom he said softly jack was pretty sure that their little talk was over he was enough of a fool to think their dance was done lie downlets make you comfortable alice told the cowboy not looking at jack the old hippie stretched out on the couch where alice covered him with a blanket bob was moaning his way through the refrain again its a relentless song over which jack could nonetheless hear the cowboys teeth chattering i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you take leslie with you dear his mother said as jack was going out the door she was still not looking at him preferring to fuss over the old cowboy the door was closing when alice called after her son it doesnt matter anymore jack i dont even care if you sleep with her jack carried his moms little morsel of anticipation and horror with him as he walked along the south side of queen street until he caught a cab heading east bringing him back to the four seasons there was a small flurry of excitement among jacks fans at the front desk when he checked out of the hotel for the second time that day jack didnt like chaos it bothered him that he must have appeared disorganized even directionless but he had a plan he would move into the guest wing in what he had once thought of as mrs oastlers mansion in forest hill jack would sleep in emmas bedroom of whichof the bed in particularhe had mostly fond memories jack would move emmas desk which was a big one into what had been his bedroom where mrs machado had molested him that room charged as it was with the loss of jacks innocence would become his office add his dying mother and leslie oastler to the package as alice might have put it and he had chosen a terrific climate for completing his or emmas adaptation of the slushpile reader the screenplay and emmas notes had already been transcribed in jacks handwriting hed brought the script with himto work on all he needed was a little more writing paper and some extra pens as it would turn outand this was no surprise given what a veteran shopper she wasleslie rushed right out and got the writing supplies for him she even bought him a new lamp for emmas desk leslie was grateful to jack for not leaving her alone with his mother especially with alices changes of mood and personality at first it gave jack pause that he was alone with mrs oastler for the duration of the workday he had some anxiety that she would throw herself at him in a state of undress after all his mother had not only given jack permission to sleep with leslieshe also repeatedly encouraged leslie to sleep with jack when mrs oastler was doing the dishes after dinner for examplewhen jack was listening to music in the living room while his mom was stretched out on the couch leslie why dont you sleep with jack tonight alice would call out to the kitchen mom for christs sake no thank you alice mrs oastler would call into the living room you should try ityou might like it alice told them over supper one night you dont snore do you jack he wont keep you awake lesliewell not like i do anyway he wont keep you awake all night i mean please stop alice leslie said how much longer do you realistically expect me to sleep with you alice snapped at mrs oastler you wont sleep with me when im in a coma i hope mom leslie and i dont want to sleep together jack said yes you do dear his mother said dont you want to sleep with jack leslie well of course you do she said cheerfully before mrs oastler could respond one way or another jack could only imagine what a dysfunctional stew emma would have made of their threesomea relationship as challenging as that of a toosmall slushpile reader and a toobig pornstar screenwriter jack was indeed living as he had hoped in the perfect atmosphere in which to finish his or emmas screenplay the script itself was becoming an intense marriage of plagiarism and rightful ownership a partnership of wily commerce with those nearblinding shafts of light in which familiar but nonetheless amazing dust motes float these ordinary but wellilluminated things are what we remember best about a good film emma had said perhaps because jack was devoted to the task of making emmas best book into a movie but also because he and mrs oastler were both victims of his mothers escalating abuse jack lost his fear of leslie throwing herself at him in a state of undress for the most part she left him alone when he would venture downstairs into the kitchen either to make himself a cup of tea or to eat an apple or a banana mrs oastler would often be sitting at the kitchen tableas if alice had only recently left the house or was at any minute expected to return then in the briefest possible conversation mrs oastler would convey to jack some new detail or missing information she remembered about his father mrs oastler struck jack as exhausted most of the time her memory of what alice had concealed from jack about his dad returned to her unexpectedly and at unplanned moments which made jack extremely jumpy in her companylargely because he never knew what secret she might suddenly divulge sadly this had the effect on leslie of making her appear as if she had slept with jack which alice never failed to notice you slept with him leslie didnt you his mom would regularly ask upon coming home from daughter alice no i did not mrs oastler would say still sittingas if she had taken rootat the kitchen table well you look as if you did alice would tell her you look as if someones been banging your brains out leslie it was too easy to say that this was the tumor talkingtoo convenient to call alices outrageous behavior the cancers fault but even her language was changing not her diction or enunciation which were the unstumbling examples of miss wurtzs determined eradication of alices scottish accent but alice was increasingly vulgartonguedas emma had always been as leslie could be as alice unwaveringly criticized jack for being since california as his mother put it but jacks work went on he even showed a draft of the screenplay to mrs oastler shed said she was dying to read it to jacks surprise leslie was much moved by the script she found it extremely faithful to the novel she even took the time to compose a list of the things that were different from what theyd been in the book these werent offered as criticismsmrs oastler merely wanted jack to appreciate that shed noticed among the many differences of course were those things emma herself had changedor else shed suggested that jack change them and some of the changes were entirely his but you like it he asked leslie i love it jack she said with tears in her eyes jack burns was a firsttime writer hed never encountered literary approval something in his relationship with mrs oastler changed because of it they were united by more than his mothers dying they were joined by emmas giving him the opportunity to make a movie of the slushpile reader and by his bringing leslie into the process they were brought together too by alices refusal to talk to jack about his dadand the consequent burden of what mrs oastler knew of that subject which she was now under pressure to tell jack worstbut in the long run maybe this was bestleslie oastler and jack were drawn to each other by alices relentless and incomprehensible efforts to virtually force them to sleep together which both leslie and jack were determined not to do at least not while alice was alive and she so thoroughly and insensitively wanted them to do it and of course what made this last part so difficult was that alice even in her madness was right about one thing increasingly leslie and jack did want to sleep together alice was inarguably crazy but how much of her craziness was the result of the breastcancer cells in her brainor was more simply her undying anger at william burnsmrs oastler and jack would never know there was the night jack discovered his mother naked and asleep in emmas bedin his bed under the new circumstancesand when he woke her she told him she was staying where she was so that he could sleep with leslie jack went to bed in his old bedroom his new office that night in the bed where mrs machado had so roughly educated him this episode was not repeated but there were other episodes the police called mrs oastler one day to say that daughter alice was evidently closedmeaning all the lights were off and the venetian blinds were shut yet inside the shop bob dylan was singing up a stormeven passersby on the queen street sidewalk were complaining this was how leslie and jack learned that alice now routinely closed the tattoo parlor almost as soon as shed opened it she took an allday nap on the sofa bed lately there were sounds in her brain that kept her awake at night alice explained to them according to mrs oastler alice was either wide awake or snoring what sounds alice leslie asked her nothing i can understand alice answered voices maybenot yours not jacks no one i want to listen to hence bob at high volume thus the complaints if theres a bend in the road to your dying alice you may have gone around it mrs oastler told her suddenly shes a writer alice cried hitting jacks shoulder but pointing derisively at leslie here i am living with a pair of writers jack saw in his minds eye what hed tried to overlook when hed found his mother naked and snoring in his formerly emmas bed the slackness of her breasts in sleep and how the tattoo of her broken heart had shifted slightly from its perfect placement on her younger left breast and the heart side of her rib cage it was now a lopsided brokenheart tattoo as if thered been something irreparably wrong with daughter alices heart before william burns had broken it even in her sleep there were still faint creases where the underwire of her bra had marked both breasts and in the light cast from the bathroomthe door was ajarthe scar from alices lumpectomy shone an unnatural white as did the scar in that sameside armpit where the lymph node had been removed jack had never seen that scar before if youd only just fuck each other his mother shouted one night making a fist and pounding the kitchen table which made jack and mrs oastler jump if you fucked each other all day ill bet you two writers wouldnt be so poetic although the screenplay kept getting better jack rarely felt he was poetic it was no surprise but it hurt nonetheless that his mother refused to read the script ill be dead by the time you make the movie dear shed told him if there were a poetic presence in the house in his mothers final days jack would have said that it was leslie who appeared early one afternoon in the doorway of his makeshift officean unprecedented interruption she was naked by her reddened skin in the area of her rose of jericho he saw that shed been scratching at her tattoo she was sobbing i regret ever getting this tattoo she said her appearance did not have that unmistakable aura of seduction im sorry leslie life forces enough final decisions on us mrs oastler continued we should have the sense to avoid as many of the unnecessary ones as we can jack just sat at emmas old desk while mrs oastler turned away from him and went down the hall can i use that leslie he called after her he was missing some essential voiceover for the michele maher character and there it was what you just saidcan i use it sure mrs oastler said so softly that jack almost didnt hear her when they eventually signed lucia delvecchio for the michele maher role lucia would say it was the voiceover that made her want the partthat and the fact that she knew shed have to lose twenty pounds to play michele miramax would put that voiceover on the movie poster and in all the ads for the film life forces enough final decisions on us we should have the sense to avoid as many of the unnecessary ones as we can bingo jack shouted down the hall after mrs oastler but shed gone into her bedroom and had uncharacteristically closed the door there was also the night when leslie came to his bedroom where jack was sleepingbut there was scarcely an aura of seduction about this visit either by now the remembered bits of informationthe lost details of his missing fatherwere waking mrs oastler at all hours of the night this happened as regularly as alices alternating sleeplessness and snoring would wake mrs oastler or the more violent occurrences when alice would beat leslies back with her fiststhis for no better reason than that alice had woken up and discovered that leslie had turned her back on her which was apparently forbidden in their relationship neither alice nor mrs oastler could remember when this rule had been established or even if it had ever been observed but this didnt deter alice from attacking leslie who was at least grateful that alice didnt insist on bob dylan blaring through the house all nightnot the way bob belted it out all day at daughter alice or so the police duly reported when i start to go jackyou take me there his mom had told him he knew she meant her tattoo shop when i start to go im sleeping in the needlesnowhere else dear it was in this largely sleepless context that mrs oastler crawled into jacks bed one night she took hold of his penis so suddenly but without any indication of seeking more intimate contact that he at first thought emmas ghost had grabbed him after all it was emmas bed im here to talk jack leslie said i dont care if your mother thinks were fucking im just here to tell you something go ahead he said shed already told him that his father had paid the lions share of jacks tuition at st hildas it was mrs wicksteed who had only to use his mothers words occasionally helped and the clothes hed believed mrs oastler had bought for him both for redding and for exeternot to mention the tuition at both schools i was just the shopper leslie had told him the money came from william even for collegethose years in durham hed asked her even your first couple of years in la shed said he didnt stop sending money until you were famous jack and what about daughter alice i mean the tattoo parlor leslie william bought her the fucking shop this was a portrait of a very different dad from the one jack had imaginedwhen last heard of playing the piano on a cruise ship to australia on his way to be tattooed by the famous cindy ray not so maybe mrs oastler remembered alice saying that william had never gone to australia leslie had further surprised jack by telling him she was sure his father was still in amsterdam when jack and his mother left i think he watched you leave mrs oastler had said thus when leslie slipped into his bed and took hold of his penisthis was almost in his halfsleep like old timesjack was eager to learn which new tidbit of information about his father might have surfaced in mrs oastlers fitful sleep its about her tattooi mean the you in until i find you leslie whispered in his ear its not necessarily william what he whispered back think about it jack she wasnt looking for himshed already found him its not like william was lost or something where is he now jack asked her i have no idea where he is now alice doesnt know either stop whispering alice cried she was calling from mrs oastlers bedroom down the hall although her voice was so loud that she could have been in emmas bed with leslie and jack talking is better than whispering his mother shouted jack whispered to leslie who else could the you in until i find you be the love of her life possibly that certain someone who would heal the heart your dad broke obviously she never found him its certainly not me mrs oastler declared as jacks mom called out to them again fucking is better than talking alice yelled you mean its a nonspecific you jack asked leslie for christs sake jack its not me and maybe its not williamthats all im saying i want to go home alice called to them for christs sake aliceyou are home mrs oastler called back jack lay there having his penis held his thoughts entirely on the you in until i find you as if there were anyone who could have healed his mothers heartas if she could conceivably have met the man or woman who had a snowballs chance in hell of healing her miss wurtz leslie whispered so suddenly that jacks penis jumped in her hand he wrote to miss wurtz caroline had some kind of correspondence with your dad the wurtz jack whispered miss wurtz herself told me leslie whispered back i dont think your mom ever knew about it something blocked the light from the bathroom where the door was ajara sudden appearance of the kind the gray ghost was once the master of as if mrs mcquat who had tried to save him were reaching out to jack again or maybe mrs machado or her ghost was coming to get him but it was his mother naked she was as close to entering the next world as any ghost i want to go home alice whispered if you insist on whispering im going to whisper too she said climbing into emmas bed strangely it was her heartside breast that looked ravagednot the breast where shed had the lumpectomy her brokenheart tattoo was the blueblack of a bruise the you in cursive as meaningless as what was written on the toe tag of a total stranger in a morgue mrs oastler and jack hugged alice between them please take me home his mother kept whispering you are home leslie told herkissing her neck her shoulder her face or do you mean edinburgh alice no home alice said more fiercely you know where i mean jack where do you mean mom jack knew where she meant he just wanted to see if she could say it i mean the needles dear his mother said its time to take me to my needles not surprisingly thats what daughter alice meant by going home a faithless boy jacks mother died peacefully in her sleep much as maureen yap had predicted for five days and nights she slept and woke up and fell back to sleep on the sofa bed at daughter alice leslie and jack took turns staying with her they had discovered that alice was less abusive to them if they werent together and the sofa bed wasnt big enough for three people on the fifth night it was leslies turn alice woke up and asked mrs oastler to let her hear a little bob dylan leslie was aware of the police complaints she turned up the volume only slightly is that loud enough alice she asked there was no answer mrs oastler at first assumed that alice had fallen back to sleep it was only when leslie got into bed beside her that she realized alice had stopped breathing it would turn out that a blood vessel in her brain had hemorrhaged eaten away by the cancer jack was in bed with bonnie hamilton in bonnies house when the phone rang he sensed that his mother was sleeping in the needles before bonnie answered the phone ill tell him he heard bonnie say while he was still trying to orient himself in the darkened bedroom he didnt want to get out of bed and stumble into the wheelchair ill tell him that too alice died in her sleepshe just stopped breathing mrs oastler had announced straightaway i think jack and i should stay with her till morning i dont want them to take her away in the dark alice had talked to leslie and jack about the kind of memorial service she wanted shed been uncharacteristically specific it should be on a saturday evening if you run out of booze the beer store and the liquor store will still be open jack and mrs oastler had humored her theyd agreed to a saturday evening although the concept of running out of booze at any event originating in the st hildas chapel was unimaginable alice wasnt an old girl maybe a few of the old girls would show up but they would be leslies old friends and they werent big drinkers the novelty of seeing jack burns so soon after seeing him at emmas memorial service would surely have worn off out of a genuine fondness for jack thered be a smattering of st hildas faculty no doubt some of the same boarders would attend but those girls werent drinkers either compared to how it was at the service for emma mrs oastler and jack assumed that the chapel would be virtually empty the wake part should be in the gym not in the great hall alice had instructed them and nobody should say anythingno prayers just singing hymns leslie had asked it should be an evensong service jacks mother the former choirgirl had said leslie you should let caroline wurtz arrange it you dont know anything about church music and jack doesnt even like music i like bob dylan mom lets save bob for the wake part mrs oastler had suggested in disbelief leslie and jack completely missed it the part about running out of booze should have forewarned themnot to mention that alice had asked them to inform just a few of her old friends jack called jerry swallowsailor jerry from alices halifax days although jerry had moved to new glasgow nova scotia a woman maybe jerrys wife answered the phone jack asked her to please tell jerry that daughter alice had died to his surprise the woman asked him where and when there was going to be a service jack gave her the details over the phonelittle suspecting that sailor jerry and all the rest of them would show up jack didnt call tattoo ole or tattoo peterthey were both dead tattoo theo wasnt on alices list probably he had also died doc forest was the second tattoo artist jack called doc was still in stockholm jack recalled docs forearms like popeyes and his neatly trimmed mustache and sideburnshis bright twinkling eyes jack remembered what doc had said to him toowhen jack and his mom were leaving sweden come back and see me when youre older maybe then youll want a tattoo doc regretted that he couldnt come such a distance for alices service but he said he would pass along the sad news jack thought it must have been simply a courtesy on docs partto even mention undertaking such a journey doc had last seen alice at a tattoo convention at the meadowlands in new jersey she was a maritime girl the former sailor told jack his voice breakingor maybe it was the longdistance connection jack next called hanky pankythe tattoo name for henk schiffmacherat the house of pain in amsterdam schiffmacher had written several books the famous tattoos among them many of the illustrations in that book were collected at the tattoo museum in the redlight district alice had believed that hanky panky was one of the best tattoo artists in the world shed met him at any number of tattoo conventions and shed stayed with him and his wife in amsterdam henk schiffmacher was sorry he couldnt come all the way to canada on such short notice but ill pass the word he said im sure that a lot of the guys will show up it was only lateractually on the night before alices memorial service at st hildasthat leslie informed jack that shed called a different threesome of tattoo artists alice had given leslie another list this one also had just a few names to call who were they jack asked mrs oastler jesus jacki cant possibly remember their names you know what their names are like did you call philadelphia eddie jack asked make that crazy philadelphia eddie or maybe mao of madrid or bugs of london there were three guys leslie informed him they were all in the united states they all said theyd pass the word maybe little vinnie myers he suggested or uncle pauly jack imaginedor armadillo red hed never met them but he knew their names well they wont come anyway mrs oastler said but she didnt sound so sure whats the matter leslie mrs oastler was remembering what one of them had asked her when shed given the guy the bad news wheres the party the tattoo artist had inquired he said party jack asked leslie isnt that all they do jack at least thats my impression all they do is party this gave them both a bad nights sleep about am mrs oastler got into emmas bed with jack but she wasnt interested in holding his penis what if they all come leslie whispered as if alice were still alive or somehow capable of overhearing them what will we do well have a party he told mrs oastler only half believing that it might be true in the morning while leslie was making coffee jack answered the phone in the kitchen it was bruce smuck a toronto tattoo artist and a good friend of alices shed liked his work and had been something of a mentor to him hed already called leslie and offered his condolences now he was calling to ask what he could bring oh just bring yourself bruce jack answered cluelessly well be glad to see you was that bruce smuck again mrs oastler asked after jack hung up the phone he wanted to know if he could bring something jack said the gravity of bruces offer slowly sinking in bring what leslie asked bruce must have meant booze jack thought bruce was a nice guyhe was just offering to help out obviously bruce expected a mob jack called peewee on his cell phone and increased the original liquorstore order from a case each of white and red wine to three cases of white and five cases of red from what alice had told leslie the majority of tattoo artists were redwine types tell peewee to go to the beer store too mrs oastler said the bikers drink a lot of beer better fill the fucking limo with beerjust in case leslie was sitting at the kitchen table with her head in her hands inhaling the steam from her coffee cup she looked like someone whod recently quit smoking and desperately wanted a cigarette jack poured himself a cup of coffee but the phone rang before he could take his first sip uhoh mrs oastler said it was a saturday morningalices evensong service was scheduled for fivethirty that afternoonbut caroline wurtz was calling on her cell phone from the st hildas chapel where she and the organist and the boarders choir were already practicing when jack answered the phone he could hear the organ and the choir better than he could hear caroline jack a quandary has presented itselfin clerical form miss wurtz whispered she sounded as if she were in emmas bed with himas jack had so often dreamedand his mother was within hearing distance down the hall what quandary is that jack whispered back the reverend parkerour chaplain jackwishes to lead the congregation in the apostles creed mom requested no prayers caroline i know she whispered i told him maybe i should tell him jack said hed met the reverend parker only once parker was a young twit whod felt excluded from emmas memorial service hence he was inserting himself in alices i think i can negotiate with him jack miss wurtz whispered in the background the organ was fainter nowthe girlish voices from the boarders choir were less and less distinct the wurtz must have been retreating from the chapel with her cell phone jack could hear the squeak of her shoes on the linoleum in the hall what might be the terms of your negotiation he asked let him lead the congregation through the twentythird psalm since he evidently wants to lead us through something caroline said more loudly mom said nobody should say anything arent psalms like prayers the reverend parker is the chaplain jack i like the twentythird psalm better than the apostles creed jack conceded there appears to be another small quandary miss wurtz went on jack couldnt hear the organ or the choir at all caroline must have walked all the way down the hall to the main entrance yet he was having trouble hearing her again this time it wasnt the organ or the boarders choir that was causing the interference goodness the wurtz exclaimed over the throttling engines a neardeafening sound another quandary had presented itselfthis one jack guessed was not small what is it he asked although he already knew at the tattoo conventions his mother used to tell him the bikers always arrived early perhaps they wanted to be sure they had a good place to park my word its a motorcycle gang caroline cried loudly enough for mrs oastler to hear her what on earth is a motorcycle gang doing at an allgirls school ill be right there jack told her better lock up the boarders your mother has cursed us jackthis is just the beginning leslie said still holding her head in her hands caroline and jack had already had a little talk about miss wurtzs correspondence with william his dad had taken a particular interest in jacks artistic or creative training your development as the wurtz had put it when i was at st hildas jack asked indeed jackwhen you were in the earliest stages of your dramatic education your dramatizations you mean beginning with but by no means exclusively your remarkable success in female roles miss wurtz informed him i thought that william would be especially pleased with how you and i in conversation arrived at the idea that heyour fatherwas your own special audience of one if you remember how could i forget jack asked her but he was not pleased caroline told jack gravely your father strenuously objected in fact he objected to being my audience of one to the very idea of an audience of one jack william was opposed to the concept aesthetically why jack asked hed noticed that shed now said the name william twice caroline sighed no more perishable beauty ever existed well she said i think his theory more aptly applies to organs why organs your father insisted that you should be taught to play your heart out jack as for your audienceif only in your minds eyethey were all the wretched downontheirluck and hardofhearing souls in the hindmost pews of the church and beyond beyond what he meant even the drunks sleeping it off in the streets and alleys outside the church thats what william said he meant even the prostitutes within hearing of the oude kerk jack was thinking indeed his dad must have meant that jack should be reaching vastly more than an audience of one that is if he was any good i think i get it jack told caroline i wouldnt call it a correspondence jack we exchanged at most two or three letters i wouldnt want you to think that i still hear from him but he taught at the schoolhowever brieflywhen you were teaching there too jack reminded her you knew him didnt you caroline jack and miss wurtz were in a coffee shop on the corner of lonsdale and spadina it was the weekend after alice had died caroline was dressed as hed never seen her in blue jeans and a mans flannel shirt jack didnt think she was wearing a bra nevertheless she was absolutely stunning for a woman in her fiftiesshe was radiant even glowing those high cheekbones her fine jaw cut like crystal the peachlike blush to her skinmiss wurtz was a knockout she sighed again and ran her long fingers through her wavy hair which was now completely gray but still lustrous her hair had the sheen of slate in sunlight yes jackif you must knowi knew him caroline said staring down at the coffee in her cup she added softly william gave me some of my favorite clothes he had an eye for womens clothes they may be a bit oldfashioned by todays standards but theyre still my favorites jack naturally emma had spotted the clothes caroline saw that jack couldnt speak she reached across the small café table and touched his face he was not just my loverhe was my only lover miss wurtz told him well it didnt last she said almost cheerfully too many other women wanted williamwomen and girls caroline added laughing jack was surprised that she sounded more amused than bothered by the thoughtmaybe because it was so long after the fact your father was far more committed to his music than to our fair sex jack she went on and if you ever heard him play miss wurtz whispered taking jacks hands in hers well it suffices to sayno wonder he was more engaged by his music than by us no wonder jack had dressed the wurtz in mailorder underwear in his dreams who could resist the temptation to give her clothes his father hadnt resisted her jack swallowed his coffee with unusual difficulty did my mom know he asked caroline your mother knew that william liked the way i spoke thats all she knew miss wurtz told him william must have said something to alice about my voicemy diction my enunciation he used to tell me admiringly that i didnt have an accent so it was moms ideato have you teach her how to talk jack asked i thought it was mrs wicksteed who wanted her to lose the scottish accent goodness no caroline said with a laugh mrs wicksteed was such an oldschool canadianshe loved a scottish accent but you must have known about the girlsi mean the boarders caroline oh who didnt know about those silly girls miss wurtz exclaimed you know boarders jack if they could get pregnant all by themselves theyd probably try it but he left you too didnt he jack asked her you dont sound as if you hate him i never expected him to stay jack of course i dont hate him william was one of those pleasures every woman wants to have at least once in her lifetime with all due respect to alice jack you have to be deluded to imagine you might keep a man like that especially at his age at that timehe was so young jack looked at caroline wurtz with everything he had lost visibly written on his facethe way he must have looked when his mother said who knows what sort of father he would have been jack with a man like that alice had said with disgust you can never be sure but miss wurtz had used the exact same phrasea man like thatwith enduring affection if youd been my mother he told caroline i would have had a father at least i would have occasionally seen him i havent heard a word from him or about him in years miss wurtz told jack but that doesnt mean you cant find him he may be dead caroline mom is the wurtz leaned across the café table and grabbed hold of jacks left ear it was as if she were mrs mcquat and he still in grade three about to be taken to the chapel by the gray ghost you faithless boy she said if william were dead my heart would have stopped the day he dies my breasts will shrivel to the size of raisins in my sleepor ill turn into linoleum or something linoleum jack wondered the poor woman had been at st hildas too long his ear which she still held was throbbing suddenly miss wurtz let him go she laughed at herself like a young girl well dont i sound like a brainless boarder caroline exclaimed you faithless boy she said to jack againthis time fondly go find him tell me the context baby cakes emma used to say everything comes with a context that saturday in marchit was and march in toronto is not reliable motorcycle weatherjack walked to the circular driveway at the corner of pickthall and hutchings hill road where he had once stood holding his mothers hand in a sea of girls the motorcycles their engines off were parked in a rowwith something less than military precision the day was overcast there was a raw chill in the air and the gas tanks of the motorcycles were beaded and glistening in the descending mista fine drizzle in that weather jack didnt take the time to count them but there were about thirty motorcyclestheir license plates indicating how far some of their riders had traveled north dakota dan had driven all the way from bismarck hed hooked up with lucky pierre at twin cities tattoo in minneapolis and they rode together down to madison wisconsin where badger schultz and his wife little chicken wing were waiting theyd picked up the fronhofer brothers at windy city tattoo in chicago and rode together into michigan they hit snow in kalamazoo and battle creek but they still made it to east lansing in time to have a party with flipper volkmann at spartan tattoo the next morning they rode with flipper to ann arbor where wolverine wally joined them they had some understandable difficulty clearing canadian customs but they picked up the in windsor and rode through the rain to kitchener and guelph where they met a couple of ontario tattoo artists jack had never heard of he still couldnt remember their names there were riders heading north from louisville kentucky and three cities in ohio too joe ink from tiger skin tattoo in cincinnati and the skretkowicz sisters from columbusone of whom was the exwife of flattop tom who joined up with the sisters in cleveland the contingent from pennsylvania too numerous to name included notables in the tattoo world from pittsburgh harrisburg allentown and scrantonand nightshift mike from sailors friend tattoo rode the long way north from norfolk virginia there were motorcycles in the circular st hildas driveway with license plates from maryland and massachusetts and new york and new jersey too from the voices raised in songone could hear them booming from the chapel the male voices seeming to challenge the organ and overwhelming the boarders choirjack knew that miss wurtz hadnt been idle shed ushered the bikers inside and made them comfortable at the rehearsal hot coffee would soon be available in the gym miss wurtz had told them which wasnt quite truenot soon anyway but how many of you know god save the queen the wurtz had asked them to the bikers uncomprehending silence caroline had said well i thought so it seems you could benefit from a little practice by the time jack got to st hildas she had them singing most of the tattoo artists didnt know which queen they were singing to savebut it was for daughter alice which is why theyd come and the sound of their voices seemed to warm them they stood dripping in their wet leathers the smell of the road oil and exhaust mixed with the smell of their wellworn gear their windblown beards their helmetmatted hair thrilled the boarders choir faced them from the safety of the altar the girls voices sounded like those of children among the bikers who were mostly men the organist a pretty young woman who was as new to st hildas as the twit chaplain was making mistakes even jack could tell she was nervous and that her errors were increasing with each new mistake she made calm down eleanor miss wurtz told her or ill have to take over and i havent played an organ in years while eleanor took a short breather jack introduced himself to his moms friends the goodlookin jack burns he heard nightshift mike say appraising him daughter alices little boy one of the skretkowicz sisters said im the other skretkowicz the other sister told jack the one who was never married to flattop tom or to anybody else she whispered in jacks ear biting his earlobe your mom sure was proud of you badger schultz said his wife little chicken wing was already dissolved in tearsand it wasnt even noon they had hours to go before alices memorial service caroline clapped her hands were still rehearsingwere rehearsing until i say stop miss wurtz called from the altar area eleanor the organist seemed almost composed i didnt know you could play the organ caroline eleanor saidmore audibly than shed meant to because jack and the bikers had suddenly stopped talking glancing in jacks direction miss wurtz blushed well i had a few memorable lessons she said god save our gracious queen long live our noble queen god save the queen send her victorious happy and glorious long to reign over us god save the queen under the wurtzs direction they sang and sang the pure girlish voices of the boarders choir were no match for the beerhall gusto of the bikers whoas they recovered from the damp chill of the march roadsshed their leathers their tattoos rivaled the colors of jesus and his surrounding saints on the chapels stained glass jack slipped away he knew that miss wurtz could dramatize anything by the time of the blessed event caroline would have polished to perfection both the boarders and the bikers choir as jack was leaving the tattoo artists were listening reverentially to the girls who were singing lord of the dance i danced in the morning when the world was begun and i danced in the moon and the stars and the sun and i came down from heaven and i danced on the earth at bethlehem i had my birth out in the circular driveway two more riders had arrived they were parking their motorcycles alongside the others slick eddie esposito from the blue bulldog in new haven connecticut and bad bill letters from black bear season tattoo in brunswick maine their creased leathers were streaked with rain and they looked stiff with cold but they recognized jack burns and smiled warmly jack shook their icy hands hed thrown on some old clothes at mrs oastlersjeans running shoes a waterproof parka that had been emmas and was way too big for him im just going home to change my clothes for the service jack told the newly arrived bikers they seemed mystified by the girls voices coming from the chapel the others are inside practicing practicing what bad bill asked it must have been the third or fourth refrain to lord of the dance miss wurtz had obviously decided to bring the bikers into the chorus the mens big voices reached them out in the rain dance then wherever you may be i am the lord of the dance said he and ill lead you all wherever you may be and ill lead you all in the dance said he come on billlets go sing with em slick eddie said are you comin back as a girl bad bill asked jack not today jack told him they were going inside the building when jack heard slick eddie say youre an asshole bill of course im an asshole bad bill said jack went back to mrs oastlers house and stretched out in a hot bath leslie came into the bathroom in her black bikinicut underwear she put the lid down on the toilet and sat there not looking at him how many of them are there she asked about thirty motorcycles maybe forty riders he told her most of the tattoo artists your mother knew werent bikers jack the bikers are just the tip of the iceberg i know jack said we better call peewee we better call the police mrs oastler replied they cant all sleep at st hildasnot even in the gym some of them could sleep here he suggested your mother intended to do this jack maybe if we had slept with each other she would have spared us this final indignity i dont know jack said i get the feeling that mom couldnt have kept them away peewee called later that afternoon i should be driving a van not a limo montheres no room for more booze in the limo jack better make two trips jack told him this is the third trip mon if you and mrs oastler dont get your asses to that chapel you wont have any place to sit peewee was a born alarmist jack knew that miss wurtz was in charge he trusted caroline to save him and leslie a couple of seats the wurtz did better than that she stationed stinky monkey like an usher in the aisle to guard the pew bad to the bones was there tooand sister bear and dragon moon they were all thereeveryone jack had imagined and more a group came from italy luca brusa from switzerland wouldnt have missed it he told jack heaven hell came from germany manu and tintin from france the las vegas pricks were there and hollywoods purple panther they crammed the pews the aisleseven the corridor halfway to the gym a small frightenedlooking gathering of old girlsmrs oastlers trembling former classmateswere huddled in two front pews on a side aisle where ed hardy bill funk and rusty savage appeared to have appointed themselves as the old girls bodyguards at least they werent letting their fellow tattoo artists anywhere near these older women who were like the schoolgirls theyd been long ago holding hands miss wurtz had marshaled her two choirsthe boarders and the bikersto take their positions on either side of the aisle where these disparate groups faced the largely baffled congregation the tattoo artists who hadnt arrived early could make no sense of god save the queen whos the queen a broadshouldered man in a bright yellow sports jacket asked jack he had so much gel in his hair which stood straight up that the top of his head resembled a sharks dorsal fin both the bright yellow jacket and the hair were familiar to jack from the tattoo magazines hed seencrazy philadelphia eddie there could be no doubt the reverend parker arrived late there was no place to park the chaplain peevishly complained before he had a closer look at the congregationthe tiedyed tank tops the tattooed arms the open collars of the hawaiian shirts the exposed chests also tattooed real snakes and mythological serpents regarded the chaplain coldly in the reptilian tattoos there were creatures that the garden of eden and the reverend parker had never seen there were many depictions of christs bleeding heart bound in thornslacking the usual anglican reserve there were many skeletonssome breathing fire others speaking obscenities in the blaze of all this tattooed flesh the wurtz had outdone herself with lord of the dance the boarders whom leslie described as a choir of notquite virgins sang all five versesthe bikers joining them for the five refrains the wrecked blond boarder whod lost her shoe at emmas memorial service sang the fourth stanza solo and a beautiful soloist she was though theyd rehearsed this together several times already she had the bikers in tears i danced on a friday when the sky turned black its hard to dance with the devil on your back they buried my body and they thought id gone but i am the dance and i still go on when it was time for the chaplain to read the twentythird psalm it was warm in the chapel and some of the heavily tattooed types had taken off their shirts they werent all tattoo artiststhere were many of alices clients present her signature work was everywhere jack recognized more than a few daughter alices he also noticed that mrs oastler was crying she slumped against him in the pew her small body shaking that was how alices colleagues knew who she was ive got a sweetie in toronto alice had told more than one of them as in no thanksnot tonight ive got a sweetie in toronto the lord is my shepherd i shall not want the reverend parker began anxiously he was thoroughly rattled by the time he got to yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will feel no evil fear not feel no evil miss wurtz corrected him fear no evil the chaplain stumbled ahead for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me your what someone in the congregation saida womans voice jack didnt see who said it but he would bet it was one of the skretkowicz sisters this was followed by general laughter one of the old girls among mrs oastlers former classmates was in hysterics that was when leslie lost it no praying no saying anything mrs oastler shouted to the chaplain alice wanted just singing thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies the reverend parker mumbled then he stopped he saw the presence of his enemies all around him just singing pal bad bill letters said yeahsing or shut up one of the fronhofer brothers said sing or shut up flattop tom repeated sing or shut up the congregation shouted eleanor the organist was frozen caroline sat down on the organ bench beside her if youve forgotten how to play jerusalem eleanor miss wurtz said the good lord may forgive you but i wont eleanor bless her timid heart lurched forward she attacked the keyboard the organ was a little louder than expected but the boarders and the bikers choir gave it their best and did those feet in ancient time walk upon englands mountains green and was the holy lamb of god on englands pleasant pastures seen as they went up the aisle mrs oastler was swept into the arms of crazy philadelphia eddie she was overcome with emotion and didnt or couldnt resist him all of alices friends had heard of leslie and wanted to hug her its alices sweetie people were whispering why do they know me leslie asked jack mom must have told them about you jack said she did asked mrs oastler who was in tears they were all in tearsall the tattoo artists all of daughter alices clients and her friends it was a sentimental business tattooingas leslie was only now discovering they were marching up the hall to the gym by the time the boarders and the bikers hit their full stride in the fourth verse even eleanor with miss wurtzs encouragement had kept up i will not cease from mental fight nor shall my sword sleep in my hand till we have built jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land a bathtubsize bucket of ice full of cold beer awaited them in the gym wine corks were popping huge slabs of roast beef and platters of sausages weighed down the picnic tablesnot the usual cheesespearedontoothpicks fare who ordered all this food jack asked leslie i did jack peewee had to make a few more trips wolverine wally and flipper volkmann were having a heated argument a michigan matter badger schultz was saying diplomatically as he forced himself between them badgers wife little chicken wing had taken mrs oastlers arm joe ink from tiger skin tattoo in cincinnati placed his hand on leslies shoulderthe tattoo on the back of his hand was an ace of spades overlapping an ace of hearts if youre ever in norfolk nightshift mike was saying to mrs oastler ill show you the town like you wouldnt believe they loved her leslie said breathlessly to jack invite them to stay jack she added slick eddie esposito was showing her the mans ruin on his belly it was daughter alices work invite all of them jack asked mrs oastler to stay with us of course with us leslie told him where else can they stay maybe not the skretkowicz sisters jack thoughtmaybe not both of them anyway why not just the one who hadnt been married to flattop tom but he realized you couldnt control a tattoo artists party you had to go with the flow as alices generation would say miss wurtz was in fine form praising the bikers firsttime performance ever the nondrinker jack watched over the boarders like a sheep dog but everyone was extremely well behaved the dispute between flipper volkmann and wolverine wally notwithstandingand not even that michigan matter had resulted in a fight it was a mild surprise that mrs oastlers former classmates appeared to be having a good time too the old girls had not seen so much skin on display in a great whileif ever the st hildas gym was hopping there was nonstop bob dylan on the cd player from his mothers description of jerry swallow as a traditionalist jack should have recognized him a pretty woman wearing a nurses cap was tattooed on one of his biceps its hard to be more of a traditionalist than that the writing on sailor jerrys shirt was in japanese as was the tattoo on his right forearm a kazuo oguri he told jack proudly so jerry swallow had come all the way from new glasgow nova scotianot to mention that hed made over a hundred phone calls oldtimers keep in touch jackie jack thanked him for coming such a long way life is a long way young mr burns sailor jerry said nova scotia isnt all that far later in the evening when jack thought hed introduced himself to everyonethe boarders choir keeping him company like his notquitevirgin guardshe spotted a recognizable presence at the far end of the gym bob dylans rainy day women was booming from the cd player when jack edged his way toward the shy stoned figure weaving to the music under the basketball net his dreamy countenance the gray wisp of whiskers on his chinas if even in his late forties or early fifties his beard still hadnt begun to growand something selfdeprecating in his eyes which were perpetually downcast all reminded jack of someone whose confidence in his own meager talent had never been high not now and not when hed been tattoo theos young apprentice on the zeedijk not another broken heart alice had told robbie de wit when shed said goodbye ive had enough of hearts torn in two or otherwise hence robbie had settled for alices signature on his right upper armthe slightly faded daughter alice that robbie revealed as jack approached him still listening to der zimmerman jackie robbie said bobs refrain wailed around them but i would not feel so all alone everybody must get stoned still listening to den zimmerman robbie im really not in the same league with these guys robbie de wit told jack gesturing unsteadily toward the rest of the gym it didnt work out for me in amsterdam im sorry to hear that jack told him im in rotterdam now got my own shop but im still an apprenticeif you know what i mean im doing okay he said his head bobbing the receding hairline had fooled jack at firstas had the eggshaped forehead and the deep crowsfeet at the corners of robbies pale watery eyes what happened in amsterdam robbie what happened to mom what made her leave oh jackiedont go there let dying dogs die robbie meant let sleeping dogs lie but jack understood him i remember the night she was a prostitute at least she acted like one jack said to him saskia and els looked after me you brought mom a little something to smoke i think dont jackie robbie said let it go my dad didnt go to australia did he jack asked robbie de wit he was in amsterdam the whole time wasnt he your father had a following jackie your mom couldnt help herself help herself how jack asked robbie tripped forward almost falling he offered jack the faded daughter alice on his upper right arm as if he were daring jack to punch him on his moms tattoo i wont betray her jack robbie said dont ask me i apologize robbie jack was ashamed of himself for being even a little aggressive with him robbie put his hand on the back of jacks neck bowing offbalance he touched his eggshaped forehead to the tip of jacks nose your mom loved you jackie she just didnt love anybody not even you like she loved william the old girls not counting leslie oastler had gone home the single onesespecially those old girls who were divorced and proud of ittook some of the tattoo artists with them mr ramsey bidding jack his usual adieujack burnshad taken a tattoo artist home with him too nightshift mike from sailors friend tattoo in norfolk virginia mike was indeed a friend of sailors even miss wong at last in touch with the hurricane she was born in danced up a stormmost memorably losing control of herself on the gym floor jitterbugging with both fronhofer brothers to stuck inside of mobile with the memphis blues again miss wong went home with the betterlooking brother remarkably the malcolms stayed latemrs malcolm being unusually cheered by the presence of marvin mekong delta jones from tuscaloosa alabama marvin had lost both legs and part of his nose in the vietnam war hed parked his wheelchair alongside mrs malcolms and had entertained both her and mr malcolm with his hilarious stories perhaps apocryphal of trying to get laid when he was wheelchairbound and had half a nose not everyone is sympathetic one story began he had wheelchair jane in stitches miss wurtz who went home at a proper hourneedless to say the wurtz went home alonebrought the house down by singing along with bob her renditions of all i really want to do and ill be your baby tonight were haunting flattop tom told jack there was nobody like her in cleveland north dakota dan said there was no one like miss wurtz in bismarck either how jack wondered had edmonton been so blessed the oastler mansion was a motel that night the motorcycles stationed like sentinels on the lawnsome of them lurking close to the house as if they were intruders seeking access through a window lucky pierre passed out on the livingroom couch where he was covered by so many of the bikers leathers that no one knew where he was in the morningthat is until joe ink sat on him flipper volkmann and wolverine wally had to be separatedthat old michigan matter again they put flipper to bed in jacks former bedroom and made the wolverine spend the night in the kitchen where the lessgoodlooking of the fronhofer brothers watched over himthe one who hadnt gone home with miss wong and the hurricane she carried inside her bad bill letters and slick eddie esposito slept headtotoe on the diningroom table where their conversation about nightshift mike the sailors friend was overheard throughout the house youd have to have your eyes in your asshole bill to not know nightshift was a fag slick eddie said eddie if you had your eyes in your asshole youd be the first to know nightshift was a fag bad bill told him youre an asshole bill slick eddie said of course im an asshole bad bill replied tell me somethin i dont know but slick eddie was fast asleep he was already snoring sweet dreams assholes bad bill cried as if he were addressing everyone in the house sweet dreams assholes badger schultz and his wife little chicken wing called from the laundry room where they were sleeping on the floor on an antique quilt great party huh jack whispered to the skretkowicz sister he was sleeping with in emmas bed yeah your mom woulda loved it ms skretkowicz said she was alas the one whod been married to flattop tom she also had a fabulous octopus tattooed on her ass it completely covered both cheeks flattop toms work she admitted a little sadly not to take nothin away from the octopus down the hall leslie was in bed with the other skretkowicz sister she was a real sweetie mrs oastler would tell jack later it was no surprise to leslie that the other skretkowicz sister had never been marriednot to flattop tom or to anybody else her biting jacks earlobe had been insincere jack was awake for a long time not only because of the tender ministrations of the former mrs flattop tom emma used to say that jacks more than occasional sleeplessness was the plight of a nondrinker in a world of drinkers jack doubted this it is fair to say that what the heterosexual skretkowicz sister could do with the octopus on her ass would keep anyone awake for a long time but jack had more on his mind than that interesting octopus he regretted again his bad behavior with robbie de wit who had come all the way from rotterdam out of his love for alice understandably robbie would never betray herto use his word for it if jack wanted to know those things his mom had kept from him or how shed distorted his dads story in her telling of the tale jack needed to do his own homeworkto make his own discoveries jack needed to take that trip hed threatened to take when his mother was still alive not to find william as miss wurtz had urged himat least not yet not that trip but the trip jack had taken with his mom when he was four allegedly when jack was three his capacity for consecutive memory was comparable to that of a nineyearold at four his retention of detail and understanding of linear time were equal to an elevenyearoldsor so hed been told but what if that wasnt true what if hed actually been a normal little boy a fouryearold whose memory was as easy to manipulate as that of any fouryearold a fouryearold like any other whose retention of detail and understanding of linear time were completely unreliable that was why jack was wide awake he suddenly knew it was a joke for him to even imagine he could remember what had happened to him in those north sea ports when he was four almost thirty years ago that was the trip jack needed to takealone or certainly not with leslie oastler it was not only a trip hed already taken it was possibly a trip hed largely imagined or it had been under his mothers management and shed imagined it for him it was not the time to look for his father it was the time to discover if william was worth looking for theyd gone to copenhagen first his mother hadnt manipulated that at least jack knew where their trip had started and where he would soon be returning copenhagen he said aloudnot meaning to as unlikely as this may seem jack had forgotten about the skretkowicz sister whose strong thigh gripped his waist shed kicked the covers off maybe the word copenhagen had triggered something because her hips were moving longdistance motorcyclists have a certain authority in their hipsin the case of jacks skretkowicz sister even in her sleep a green somewhat startledlooking sea horse was tattooed on her forearm which was flung across jacks chest the sea horse stared unblinkingly into the flickering light from the weather channel on emmas small tv which was on mute the skretkowicz sisters had a long ride ahead of them in the morning the former mrs flattop tom had wanted to know the forecast for ohio there was a storm story on the weather channel palm trees were snapped in half docks had been swept away in high seas a small boat was smashed on some rocks breakers were poundingall without a sound the bluegreen light from the television illuminated the tattoo on ms skretkowiczs hip the light threw into relief the barbed dorsal spines near the base of a stingrays whiplike tail yes jack observed there was a stingray tattooed on his skretkowicz sisters undulating hip the tentacles of the octopus on her ass appeared to be reaching for the ray as if the tattoo artists body were a map of the oceans floor jack had to arch his back to reach for the remote which he still couldnt quite reach it was not the response to her hips that his biker friend had expected dont go she whispered hoarsely still half asleep where are you going copenhagen jack repeated is it raining there she asked him groggily it would be april before he could get there jack was thinking there was a good chance it would be raining probably he answered dont go she whispered again as if she were falling back to sleepor at least she wanted to i have to go he told her whos in copenhagen his skretkowicz sister asked jack could tell she was wide awake now whats her name she said her bikers thigh gripping him tighter it was a he not a she who primarily interested jack since jack didnt know his name it would be hard to find him but there could be little doubt who jack was thinking ofthe littlest soldier who saved him not to diminish the importance of ladies man madsen its just that lars would be easier to find at least jack knew his name the commandants daughter her little brother jack slipped away from toronto without telling miss wurtz his plans he never even said goodbye he was afraid that caroline would be disappointed in his decision not to go looking for his father straightaway he took only his winter clothes with him jack thought theyd be suitable for april in the north sea his toronto clothes mrs oastler called them leslie had helped him pack after all shed shopped for jacks clothesshed even paid for most of them during the winter alice was dyingand mrs oastler had her own opinions regarding how he should dress in those european ports of call i hope you know jackyou dont wear the same clothes to a tattoo parlor that you would wear in a church and vice versa he left leslie with the responsibility of sending his screenplay of the slushpile reader to bob bookman at caa in beverly hills in the long canadian winter leslie had become jacks partner in the project a couple of times hed come close to telling her that emma had left him more than her notes for a screenplay but that wouldnt have been faithful to what emma had wanted in the months hed spent with his mom in toronto jacks mail had been forwarded from california like her late daughter mrs oastler invariably read jacks mail before giving it to him she didnt give all his mail to him either she was more censorial than emma the fan mail from female admirers was not worthy of jacks interest mrs oastler said she refused to show him the photographs of his shemale tormentors too it must have been february when jack asked leslie didnt i get any christmas cards this year yeah you got a ton of christmas cards mrs oastler answered i threw them away you dont like christmas cards leslie who needs them jack youre a busy guy somehow the letter from michele maher escaped the censor in mrs oastler and made it into jacks hands although it was a month or more after leslie had first read micheles letter this ones interesting mrs oastler said some doctor in massachusetts with the name of emmas character jack must have looked stricken or overeager to see the letter because leslie didnt immediately hand it over someone you know she asked him someone i knew he corrected her holding out his hand mrs oastler looked the letter overmore carefully than she had the first time emma knew that i knew her jack explained emma knew she was using a real persons name sort of an inside jokeis that what youre saying jack she still wouldnt give him the letter sort of he said would you like me to read it to you leslie asked jack was still holding out his hand dear jack mrs oastler began promptly interrupting herself well even your fans address you as jackyou can see why i never guessed that she actually knew you perfectly understandable jack said his voice remaining calm dr mahershes a dermatologist of all thingsgoes on leslie continued i know you were close to emma oastler and ive read that youre adapting her novel the slushpile reader as a film good luck with the screenplay and your other projects that novel is one of my favorites not only because of the main characters name with my best wishes and congratulations on your considerable success as an actor well thats it mrs oastler said with a sigh its a typed letterprobably someone else typed it she just signed her name michele its her office letterheadsome sort of doctors office building at mount auburn hospital in cambridge massachusetts on second thought its not that interesting a letter theres nothing personal in it really no one reading this would dream that she ever knew you leslie held the letter at arms length in her handnot quite as if it were dirty laundry but something potentially worse something she sensed jack wanted may i see the letter please he asked her its not the sort of letter one has to answer jack give me the fucking letter leslie i guess it wasnt a funny inside jokeemma using michele mahers name mrs oastler said she made him reach and take the letter from her hand the stationery was offwhite almost creamcoloredhigh quality the skyblue letterhead was printed in a large clear fontletter gothic nothing personal about it as leslie had observed with my best wishes didnt exactly convey a lot of warmth or affection now that i think of it its more of a note than a letter mrs oastler was saying while jack searched micheles scrawled almost illegible signature for some clue of her true feelings for him personally i dont like to touch anything a dermatologist has touched leslie went on but her letters been around here so longyou dont suppose it could still be contaminated do you no i dont suppose so jack said that letter was coming to the north sea with him jack would read it every day he believed he would keep that distant uncommitted even loveless letter foreverknowing that it might be the only contact he would ever have with michele maher jack couldnt get a direct flight to copenhagen he had an earlymorning klm connection out of amsterdam following an earlyevening departure from toronto when it was time for him to go to the airport mrs oastler was taking a bath jack thought he might leave her a note on the kitchen table but leslie had other ideas dont you dare slip away without kissing me goodbye jack he heard her call from her bath she always left the door to her bathroom openusually the door to her bedroom too theyd been alone together in the house for more than a week after the bikers had left but thered been no nighttime visits not a single trip down the hall not only had there been no penisholding thered been no nakedness or nearnakedness in each others company either maybe alice had wanted leslie and jack to sleep together a little too much despite the spell of attraction that existed between them jack believed that he and mrs oastler were still resisting his mother perhaps he thought the skretkowicz sisters had broken the spell anyway a goodbye kiss was clearly in order jack dutifully traipsed upstairs he tried not to notice the black bikinicut underwear tossed on mrs oastlers unmade bed in the bathtub leslies watchful feral face was all that was visible above the suds of bubble bath under the circumstances jack imagined this might turn out to be a fairly innocent goodbye kiss youre not getting away from me jack mrs oastler said emma and alice have left me youre not going to leave me too are you no i wont leave you he answered as neutrally as possible she puckered up her small mouth and closed her dark eyes jack knelt beside the bathtub and kissed her very lightly on the lips her eyes snapped open her tongue slipping into his mouth leslie grabbed his wrist with her soapy hand and pulled his hand into the bathwater soaking the sleeve of his shirt if jack had to guess where his fingers touched her underwater he would say he made contact with mrs oastlers rose of jericho before he could pull his hand away the kiss lingered a little longer after all theyd been through jack didnt want to hurt her feelings he tried not to let leslie sense his impatience with her but he was irritated that he would have to change his shirt mrs oastler had never had the greatest esteem for jack as an actor probably because shed known him as a child she could always read his face come on jack i may not be michele maher but it wasnt that bad a kiss was it i have to change my shirt jack said hoping she wouldnt notice his erection keeping his back turned to her as he went out the open bathroom door he added no it wasnt bad at all just remember leslie called after him it was what your mom wanted jack burns carried that thought to copenhagen it felt heavier than his suitcase of winter clothes he checked into the hotel dangleterrethis time not the chambermaids quarters but a room overlooking the statue in the square both the statue and the arch that stood over it were smaller than he remembered them but nyhavn was familiarthe boats slapping on the choppy water of the gray canal the wind blowing off the baltic as for what hed told his skretkowicz sister jack had guessed right it was raining when he unpacked he found the photos of his mothers tattooed breast mrs oastler had carefully placed them on top of his clothes shed kept two for herself and had given him two which seemed fair jack was happy to have themnot only for the purpose of verification his mom had lied to him about so many things maybe her until i find you wasnt a tattoo ole although jack was pretty sure it was the tattoo parlor at nyhavn was still called tattoo ole some of the flash on the walls was oles and the little shop still smelled of smoke and apples alcohol and witch hazel some of the pigments had special odors too although jack couldnt identify them bimbo was the man in charge hed come in and had trained with tattoo ole bimbo was short and powerfully built he wore a navy watch cap his flash was a lot like oles a maritime manan oldtimer sailor jerry would have said like ole bimbo would never have called himself a tattoo artist he was a tattooist or a tattooer of the old school a man after daughter alices heart bimbo was working on a broken heart when jack walked in nothing really changes jack was thinking bimbo didnt look up from his tattooinprogress jack burns he said as if hed been expecting him it wasnt the enthusiastic way mr ramsey said jacks name but it wasnt unfriendly either when i heard your mom died i kind of figured youd be coming bimbo said the boy getting the broken heart looked frightened on his reddened chest you could see his actual heart beating the zigzag crack across his tattooed heart was horizontal the wounded organ lay on a single rose a real beauty it was a very good tattoo there was a banner unfurled across the bottom half of the heartjust a banner with no name on it if the boy was smart he would wait and add the name when he met someone who could heal him why did you think id be coming jack asked bimbo ole always said youd be coming with lots of questions bimbo explained ole said you were pumped full of more misinformation than most magazines and newspapers and thats saying something jack was beginning to guess that this was true ole said if that kid turns out to be crazy i wont be surprised but you look like you turned out okay i guess you didnt know my mother jack said i never met the ladythats true bimbo answered choosing his words very carefully or my dad jack asked everybody loved your dad but i never met him either that everybody loved his father came as something of a surprise to jack i dont mean that nobody loved your mom bimbo added she just did some things that were hard to love what things jack asked him bimbo exhaled softlyso did the boy getting the brokenheart tattoo the boys lips were dry and parted he was gritting his teeth well you should talk to someone who really knew her bimbo told jack i just know what i heard ole had another apprenticeat the same time my mom worked here jack said surei know him bimbo said ladies man ole called him we also called him ladies man lars or ladies man madsen jack said you mean the fish man bimbo corrected him hes no ladies man anymore hes in the fish businessnot that theres anything wrong with that jack remembered that the madsen familys fish business was not an enterprise the ladies man longed to join jack recalled how lars had rinsed his hair with freshsqueezed lemon juice kirsten had been the tattoo on ladies man madsens left ankle the one entwined with hearts and thorns in jacks coverup hed left larss left ankle with a confused bouquet it looked as if many small animals had been butchered their hearts scattered in an unruly gardena shrub of body parts so lars went back to the fish business jack asked i wouldnt have let him tattoo me bimbo said not even the shading my mom tattooed him jack told bimbo a blushingred heart as jack recalled where the heart was torn in two the jagged edges of the tear left a bare band of skin wide enough for a name thered been some dispute about it but jacks mom had given lars her signature on the white skin between the pieces of his torn hearther very own daughter alice jack began to describe the tattoo to bimbo but bimbo cut him off i know the tattoo the old maritimer said i covered up the daughter alice part so what were the things alice did that were hard to love clearly fish man madsen knew something about them it seemed that the ladies man had stopped loving alice for some pretty good reason bimbo said tattoo ole told me if jack comes back tell him not to be too angry jack thanked bimbo for telling him this bimbo was also nice enough to interrupt his tattooinprogress to draw jack a little map where they were on nyhavn wasnt far from the fiskehuset højbrothe fish shop where lars madsen worked at højbro plads there was a statue of bishop absalon in the square which was close to the christiansborg slotthe castle now occupied by the danish parliament bishop absalon was the founder of copenhagen jack could actually see the old castle from the fish market bimbo told him according to bimbo the area was quite a popular meeting place nowadayscafés and restaurants all around jack almost forgot to show bimbo the photographs but he remembered as he was leaving have a look at these jack said handing bimbo the two photos does the tattoo look familiar i would know tattoo oles work anywhere bimbo said handing the photos back ole told me he tattooed your mom that was all the verification jack needed almost everything about the little shop seemed unchanged even the radio was playing if not the same radio but that wasnt the way bimbo saw things as jack was reaching for the door bimbo said its all different now in the late sixties and early seventies you could recognize everyones work your work was a kind of a signature but not anymore there are too many scratchers jack nodded hed heard his mom say thisall the maritime tattooers said it twenty years ago bimbo said we had two ships a day in here now theres one a day he said as if that defined absolutely everything that was different thank you again jack told him it was a wet windy afternoon the restaurants on nyhavn were already cooking jack could still distinguish the smells the rabbit the leg of deer the wild duck the roasted turbot the grilled salmon even the delicate veal he could smell the stewed fruit in the sauces for the game and those strong danish cheeses but he couldnt identify the restaurant where ole and the ladies man had taken him and his mom for their farewell dinner in copenhagen thered been an open fireplace and jack thought hed had the rabbit a place called cap horn at nyhavn looked vaguely familiar but jack didnt go inside he wasnt hungry and he couldnt wait to find fish man madsen like bimboeven more than bimbo jack imaginedthe ladies man was sure to be expecting him and if lars madsen had covered up the daughter alice on his broken heart he knew something jack didnt know and it must have hurt him ladies man madsen was still blond and blueeyed he had the same gaptoothed smile and busted nose too jack was happy to see that lars had lost the pathetic facial hair and had put on a little weight the fish man was pushing fifty but he looked younger it seemed that the fish business had agreed with him despite his earlier apprehensionsas if alices rejection had served lars better than hed expected and his failure in the tattoo world had somehow preserved his innocence the ladies man was married now he and his wife had three kids you remember elise he asked jack sheepishly i remember covering up her name jack said elise was the name hed covered up on larss right ankle she had formerly been attached to a chainlink fence which jack had mangled with his signature sprig of holly the result had called to mind a destroyed christmas decorationantichristmas propaganda ole had called it well she came back jack ladies man madsen said smiling you couldnt cover elise up for good although the rain had stopped it was still too damp and windy to sit outside at the sidewalk tables but the view across the wet cobblestonesthe gray castle now the parliament buildingwas just fine from the fish shop sometimes you were my babysitter jack began i thought she was working late jack i didnt know she was seeing the kidi swear what kid that poor little boy lars said stop jack said what little boy ladies man lars looked very distressed ole said this would happen he blurted out what would happen thisyou finding me madsen said okay okay lets begin with that jack how hard was it to find me not very jack told him its not hard to find anybody jacklets begin with that your mom was never looking for your dad shed already found him before she came here do you get that yes i get that jack said it was never about finding him right thats rightyouve got that right the ladies man said okay okay he repeated jack realized that the fish man had been dreading this moment for almost thirty years okay okay here we go jack because william thought that the news might finally persuade alice to leave him alonenot to mention that he hoped alice would allow him at least occasional visits with his sonjacks father wrote to alice in toronto and told her that he was engaged to be married the lucky girl was the daughter of the commandant at kastellet the frederikshavn citadel where william burns was apprenticed to the organist anker rasmussen in the kastelskirken jack thought he remembered the ladies man telling him and his mom that william was involved with a military mans young wife but william burns had actually been engaged to a military mans daughter there was no young wife if jack had heard of one it was his mother whod told him about her not lars alice had brought jack to copenhagen to prevent the marriage from ever taking place hans henrik ringhof was the commandants name he was a lieutenant colonel he loved william like a son lars madsen told jack lieutenant colonel ringhof had a young son niels who was twelve going on thirteen nielss older sister karinwilliams fiancéedoted on niels william was teaching niels to play the organ niels was quite a gifted pianist karin was an accomplished organist her late mother had been a musician lieutenant colonel ringhof had lost his wife in a car crash the family had been returning to copenhagen from a summer holiday in bornholm when the accident happened they were a wonderful family william wrote to alicehe felt he was marrying all of them once jack had started school his father hoped that jacks mother would allow the boy to spend part of his christmas vacation in copenhagen william thought that jack would find the atmosphere of the frederikshavn citadel stimulating at that time of year there were christmas concerts and what boy wouldnt be excited to spend time in a fortification with all the soldiers but your mother had her own agenda ladies man madsen told jack soon lieutenant colonel ringhof and his daughter were exposed to various sightings of aliceand the same longdistance sightings of jack that his mom had permitted his dad in toronto nothing had changed in alice she had a keepmeorlosejack mentality as the ladies man put it in copenhagen alice added a new rule to the conditions she imposed on william if he wanted to get a look at his son william had to bring his fiancée with him she had to see jack too naturally it was alice who wanted to get a look at karin ringhof but karin complied she loved william and shared his hope that alice would one day permit the boy to spend time with his father additionally lars told jack alice tried to seduce the only men in williams life who mattered to him anker rasmussen the organist was justifiably appalled by her behaviorrasmussen refused to see her lieutenant colonel ringhof the widower who loved william almost as much as he loved his own little boy was also appalled lieutenant colonel ringhof tried to reason with alice to no avail he most certainly didnt sleep with her the situation was at a standoff ladies man madsen informed jack then you fell in the kastelsgraventhe damn moat but what did that have to do with it jack asked because the commandant sent little niels to rescue you lars told jack it was niels ringhof not the littlest soldier whod saved him until then the ladies man continued everyone had done a good job keeping your mom away from niels she barely knew he existed i know that niels knew nothing about her but that was how she met him jack your mom must have said something to the boy she must have thanked him for saving you i suppose that had been jacks ideathat his mom should offer his rescuer a free tattoo not that a tattoo was what she offered niels she seduced the kid jack asked ladies man madsen she sure did jack she got to him somehow niels ringhofs clothes had almost fit jack but not the soldiers uniform niels had obviously borrowed or stolen it maybe that was how alice had got him in and out of the citadelshed dressed him like a soldier and that night shed sent him back from the dangleterre he must have walked home alone he was how old did you say twelve jack asked lars maybe twelve going on thirteen jack id say thirteen tops their last night in copenhagen tattoo ole and lars had taken jack and his mom to a fancy restaurant on nyhavn but william had picked up the tab that would have been williams last sighting of his son in copenhagenhis and karins last sighting because jacks mom insisted that his father bring karin to the restaurant too to see us off alice had told william they were there in the restaurant jack asked lars at a table on the same side of the fireplace the ladies man answered you may remember the restaurant jack you had the rabbit but alice had not told niels ringhof that she was leaving the twelve or thirteenyearold was crushed until jack and his mom left copenhagen karin ringhof and her father the commandant had no idea that the boy had been seeing alicenot to mention the depth of the childs infatuation with her william had no idea either what happened to the kid jack asked it had started to rain again which was not a good sign niels shot himself madsen said it was a barracks after alla military compound there were lots of guns around the kid either died of the gunshot wound or drowned in the kastelsgraven they found his body in the moat about where you broke through the ice he died where he saved you jack the moat the kastelsgraven looked more like a pond or a small lake in april without the ice the water had a greenishgray color jack didnt think it looked deep enough to drown in but it might have sufficed when he was four and niels ringhof was only twelve or thirteen and hed just shot himself clearly the kastelsgraven had been deep enough for niels if thered been ice on the moat jack would have tested it againthis time hoping no one would save him the wooden rampart on which the soldiers boots had made such a racketputting even the ducks to flightnow looked like a toy road of course jack knew it hadnt been anker rasmussen the organist whod come running with alice in all likelihood there had never been a soldierorganist a military musician at the kastelskirken the man in uniform would have been the commandant lieutenant colonel ringhof hed sent for his young son who was sick in bed because the commandant knew that the ice would hold niels but not a soldier that jack still had that nightmare when he dreamed of death at last made sense to him on that april morning in copenhagen it was still raining but what did it matter in jacks mind he had already drowned when he awoke as he did every time to a lasting cold jack now knew where the cold came fromfrom the moat from the kastelsgraven where he always met those centuries of europes dead soldiers the little hero who saved him stood out among themmost notably not for the disproportionate size of his penis which jack had probably exaggerated in his most unreliable memory but for the stoic quality of his frozen salute jack had correctly remembered the salute it was not a real soldiers salute but a young boy imitating a soldier not the littlest soldier in jacks imagination but niels ringhof a twelveyearold going on thirteena thirteenyearold topswhod been sexually abused by jacks mother as surely as mrs machado had molested jack hed made an appointment to see the organist at the kastelskirken the citadel church that view of the commandants house from the church square was familiar to jack he remembered being carried from the kastelsgraven to the commandants house where he was dressed in niels ringhofs clothes his offduty clothes alice had called them shed been a gifted liar the organist at the citadel church was lasse ewerlöf a swedishsounding namemaybe he was swedish at the age of fourteen hed studied the sitar the violin and the piano hed started the organ relatively late when he was nineteen or twenty jack was disappointed that ewerlöf couldnt keep their appointmenthed been called out of copenhagen rather suddenly to play the organ at an old friends funeralbut hed been kind enough to ask the backup organist at the kastelskirken to meet with jack instead lasse ewerlöf knew that jack was interested in hearing a little christmas musicjust to imagine what he might have heard at those christmas concerts his dad had thought would be stimulating to the boy the concerts hed never heard ewerlöf had left jack a list of his christmas organ favorites which his backupan older man who told jack he was semiretired because he suffered from arthritis in his handsvolunteered to play but will it hurt your hands jack asked him the backup organists name was mads lindhardt hed been a student of anker rasmussens and had known jacks father not if i dont play for too long lindhardt said besides i would consider it an honor to play for william burnss boy william was very special naturally i was jealous of him when i first heard him play because your father was always better than i was most unfair because hes younger jack was unprepared to meet someone at kastellet whod actually known his dadmuch less thought of william as special jack couldnt respond all he could do was listen to mads lindhardt play the organ jack could scarcely tell there was anything the matter with lindhardts hands they were alone in the kastelskirken except for a couple of cleaning women who were mopping the stone floor of the church the women might have thought it strange to hear christmas music on a rainy april morning but the music didnt appear to interfere with their work among lasse ewerlöfs christmas favorites mads lindhardt told jack were a few of williams favorites too bachs weihnachtsoratorium and his kanonische veränderungen über das weihnachtslied which jack already knew his dad liked to play also messiaens la nativité du seigneur and charpentiers messe de minuit which were new to jack jack realized listening to mads lindhardt that william would have many times imagined playing the organ for his son but this had been forbidden lost among the other things alice had not permitted its christmas music mr burns mads lindhardt was saying gently only then did jack notice that the organist had stopped playing its supposed to make you happy but jack was crying that boy niels was the darling of the citadel mads said and your father was the darling of the entire ringhof familythat was why it was such a tragedy no one blamed your dad for what happened to niels but karin had adored her little brother understandably she simply could not look at your father in the same way again even the commandant was sympathetic but he was destroyed for him it was like losing two sons where are they now jack asked lieutenant colonel ringhof had retired he was an old man living in frederiksberga place quite close to copenhagen where many retired people went karin the commandants daughter had never married shed also moved away she taught music in odense at a branch of the royal danish conservatory the only mystery remaining to the copenhagen story was why william had followed alice and jack to stockholm jack understood that it would have been painfuleven impossiblefor his father to stay at the frederikshavn citadel but why did william follow them when alice had caused him such a devastating loss to see you mads lindhardt told jack how else was he going to get a look at you jack she was crazy wasnt she jack asked my mother was a madwoman here is something lasse ewerlöf taught me mads lindhardt said most organists become organists because they meet another organist lindhardt could see that jack wasnt getting his point many women become crazy because they cant get over the first man they fall in love with jack whats so hard to understand about that jack thanked mads lindhardt for his time and for the christmas concert leaving kastellet jack regretted that he had not seen a single soldier maybe they didnt march around in the rain leaving the frederikshavn citadelas angry and saddened as jack now knew his father must have felt when he left that fortificationjack tried to imagine his dads state of mind as he had followed alice and jack to stockholm en route to stockholmin advance of his second arrivaljack also tried to imagine what deceptions and outright deceits his mother had created for him there in copenhagen it was not the littlest soldier who had saved jackand his rescuer had been his mothers victim now he wondered if he had been saved by a swedish accountant in stockholm or not and who had been his mothers victim or victims there so much of what you think you remember is a lie the stuff of postcards the snow untrampled and unspoiled the christmas candles in the windows of the houses where the damage to the children is unseen and unheard or what jack thought he remembered of the hedvig eleonora churchthe one with the golden altar in stockholm where his memory of meeting torvald torén the young swedish organist was jack was sure not exactly as it seemed torén was real jack recognized him when they met again but william hadnt slept with a single choirgirlmuch less with three alice had invented ulrika astrid and vendela no wonder jack had no memory of meeting them in stockholm jacks dad had been more celibate than a catholic priestwell almost the hedvig eleonora was lutheran and torvald torén had much enjoyed having william burns as an apprentice william was older than torén and had actually taught the younger organist a few pieces to play not for long alice had wasted little time in poisoning the congregation against william whom she portrayed as a runaway husband and father what little i could manage to say in church every sunday torvald torén told jack could never overturn that image of you and your mom at the grand it was a very visible place for her to be soliciting which she was and it was no life for a young boy like youto be on display as you were whether there at the grand or skating on lake mälaren with your fathers mistressyou were on display jack what jack said surely torén couldnt have meant torsten lindbergs wife agneta nilsson as jack remembered herbecause she preferred to use her maiden name torvald torén shook his head i think you better talk to torsten lindberg jack the organist said jack had been planning to do so he just happened to talk to torén first after all it was easy to find him in the hedvig eleonora it wasnt hard to find lindberg eitherhe still ate breakfast every day at the grand naturally agneta nilsson jacks skating coach had never been married to torsten lindberg lindberg jack would soon discover was gay he always had been agneta nilsson had taught choral music at the royal college of music in stockholm where william was her favorite student in his sorrow at the death of niels ringhofnot to mention the end of his engagement to karin ringhof with whom william had been very much in lovewilliam found comfort in the older womans arms if jacks father wanted to see his son in stockholmthat is in addition to watching the boy stuff his face at breakfastalice insisted that william watch jack skate on lake mälaren with agneta nilsson williams mistress i have the room and the equipment if you have the time jack had committed to memoryin english and in swedish jag har rum och utrustning om ni har tid what a dance alice had put them throughboth jack and his dad it was all done to torture themi mean your father and poor agneta torsten lindberg told jack when jack met him for breakfast at the grand and im sure your mother knew that agneta nilsson had a bad heart it was probably your father who told herinnocently without a doubt agneta died jack asked shes dead yes i mean she died eventually jack it wasnt overly dramaticthat is it didnt happen on the ice im not even suggesting that all the skating hastened her death and the manager at the grand jack inquired what about him lindberg said was he extorting my mother jack asked not the word i would use surely she seduced himand she was the one who made their affair so public torsten lindberg informed jack to disgrace your father i suppose but there was never any discernible logic that motivated alice torsten lindberg was so obviously gay but at four how would jack have known the accountant was no less thin than jack remembered his appetite no less voracious jack himself was eating a little more than usual for breakfast this was not out of any fondness for the memory of eating there with his momon display as he could now seebut because jack was conscious of needing to put on a little weight for what he hoped would be his role as the failed screenwriter and successful porn star in the slushpile reader after breakfast when jack felt like throwing up he asked lindberg if he could see the accountants rose of jericho jack thought there were some things in this world he could rely ona few constants jack knew what his moms rose of jericho looked likesurely he could count on that my what torsten lindberg asked lets start with your fish jack said on your forearm if im not mistaken you have a japanese tattoo of a fish oh my fish out of water yes lindberg cried my tattoos you mean yes of course they went to jacks room at the grand it was chiefly his moms rose of jericho that jack wanted to see he wanted to look at lindbergs doc forest too the clipper ship a threemasted type with a sea serpent cresting under its bowthat sailing ship on torsten lindbergs chest the doc forest tattoo that alice had said was better than the homeward bound vessel on the breastbone of the late charlie snow but could jack believe anything his mother had told him at least the doc forest was as jack had remembered it what boy wouldnt recall a clipper ship endangered by a sea serpent as for the eyeball on the left cheek of lindbergs ass jack had missed its gay implications the first timenot to mention the pair of pursed lips on the right cheek like wet lipstick the fish on lindbergs forearm was almost exactly as jack had remembered itnothing gay intended by it clearly as for alices rose of jericho jack had never seen the finished tattoohed only heard it discussed as a workinprogress it was not a rose of jericho of course what would a gay man want with a vagina hidden in a rose there was a rose all right but the penis was not what jack would describe as hidden in the petals of that unruly flower it was a penis practically bursting out of a rose what did you call it torsten lindberg asked jack had no idea what to call ita penis of jericho perhaps but he thought it best to say nothing there was one other lesser error in jacks socalled memory of torsten lindbergs tattoos tattoo oles naked ladyshe with her oddly upturned eyebrow of pubic hair well she was one of oles naked ladiesjack could see thatbut this naked lady had a penis too ive seen all your moviesi cant tell you how many times torsten lindberg told jack i wont embarrass you jack by telling you what my friends are always saying about you lets just say they love you as a shemale at the grand jack woke every morning to the ships hornsthe commuter traffic from the archipelago one such morning he went to see lake mälaren like the kastelsgraven it wasnt frozennot in aprilbut it was possible to imagine where william might have stood to watch his son skating with his mistress with the bad heart agneta nilsson as for doc forests tattoo shopthe atmosphere was friendly and familiar jack had never seen a photograph of his father jack knew only that william was goodlooking to women but that was not the same thing as a physical description doc forest was the first person who actually described jacks dad he had long hair to his shoulders doc said he moved like an athlete but he looked like a rock staronly better dressed torvald torén had already cast some doubt on the tattoo william was alleged to have gotten from doc foresta piece by pachelbel alice had said shed suspected it might be something called hexachordum apollinis shed mentioned either an aria quarta or a toccata william played some pachelbel of course torén had told jack but i never saw your fathers tattoos mads lindhardt had told jack the same thing not about pachelbel but about williams tattoos tattoo artists had seen the music mans tattoosand the women william had slept with surely but at least two organists whod known him well and had liked him had never seen his tattoos strange that his father didnt show them jack thought and since so much of what alice had told jack was bullshit jack was preparedwhen he went to see doc forestfor the fact that his dads pachelbel tattoo might be bullshit too there was no bullshit about doc he was glad to see jack again he said hed seen all of jacks movies including the ones in which jack appeared half naked doc had been wondering when jack was going to get a tattoo it was an honor that daughter alices son had come to doc forest for a tattoo doc told jack jack explained that hed not come to see doc for a tattoo doc had aged well he was still small and strong and his sandy hair had not yet gone gray for a former sailor whod acquired his first tattoo in amsterdam from tattoo peter doc forest looked terrific doc would not say an ill word about alicethose oldtimers the maritimers stuck togetherbut he had also liked jacks dad doc had even gone to the hedvig eleonora to hear william play i was wondering if you remember the tattoo you gave him or perhaps you gave him more than one jack said a piece of music by pachelbel maybe no music just words doc said they might have been words in a song but not a hymn not church musici can tell you that do you remember the words jack asked him doc forests tattoo shop was as neat and trim as doc sailors had to be organizedthe good ones anyway it didnt take doc long to find the stencil your dad was very particular about his tattoos doc forest said he wouldnt let me write on his skin he said he wanted to see my handwriting on a stencil first he certainly was particular about the punctuation doc forests cursive was uniform and clear the tattoo artists jack had known all had excellent handwriting the stencil was a little dusty but jack had no trouble reading the words and the particular punctuation the commandants daughter her little brother my first one of those doc said pointing to the semicolon its not a song its more like a story jack told him well your dad sure liked it the tattoo i mean doc said how do you know jack asked he cried and cried doc forest said with a tattoo jack remembered his mother saying sometimes thats how you knew when you got it right the wrong tattoo a childs memory is not only inaccurateits not reliably linear either jack not only remembered things that had never happened he was also wrong about the order of events including at least one thing that had actually taken place when jack and his mom had gone downstairs for dinner in the hotel bristol it wasnt their first night in osloit was their last a young couple did come into the restaurant just as jack remembered hed thought it was the first time he saw how his mother looked when she encountered a couple in love the young man was athleticlooking with long hair to his shoulders he looked like a rock star only he was better dressed in fact he looked exactly as doc forest had described william burnsand his wife or girlfriend couldnt take her eyes or her hands off him jack even remembered the young womans breasts jack also recalled how hed said to his mom that she should give the couple her sales pitch about getting a tattoo no shed whispered not them i cant jack had boldly taken matters into his own small hands hed walked right up to that beautiful girl and said the lines he still said in his bed to help him sleep do you have a tattoo well that young man was jacks father of coursenot that jack knew it alice was offering william a last look at jack before she and jack left for helsinki jack didnt know who the girl was not yet no onecertainly not alice least of all williamhad expected jack to approach the young couple not to mention speak to them what was the matter with the guy jack had wondered the handsome longhaired young man looked almost as if it pained him to see jack william had regarded jack as if hed never seen a child before but whenever jack had looked at him william had looked away and thered been a bitterness in williams voice that made jack look at him againmost notably when the young father had said to his son maybe some other time come with me my little actor alice had whispered in jacks ear and jacks dad closed his eyeswilliam didnt want to see his son go it was after hed checked into the bristol in april of jack was eating dinner alone in that quiet old restaurantwhen he realized hed actually seen his father in that gloomy room maybe some other time william had said then jack had reached for his mothers hand and shed taken the boy away william would have other sightings of jackin helsinki and in amsterdam no doubtbut this might have been jacks first and last look at his dad and jack had not known who william was but who was the young woman and why had william brought her were they really in love william must have known he was going to see his son jacks father just hadnt expected the boy to speak william wasnt prepared for thatneither was alice obviously jack had surprised them both it unnerved jack to think hed correctly remembered the meeting but that hed been wrong about when it happened this made jack not trust the seeming chronology of things if hed met his own fathernot knowing that william was his fatheron jack and his moms last night in oslo instead of their first when had his mother encountered andreas breivik when had she offered andreas a free tattoo and when had jack and alice met the beautiful young girl with the speech impediment ingrid moe jack recognized the oslo cathedral when the taxi dropped him at the front entrance to the bristolthe dome that greenish color of turned copper the clock tower large and imposing he decided he would go there in the morning and speak with the organist that the organist would turn out to be andreas breivik was not the only surprise in store for jack there was a new organ nownot the germanmade walcker which jack remembered had a hundred and two stops even the organ that replaced the walcker had been replaced the new one was special in its own way andreas breivik told jack all about it if breivik had been sixteen or seventeen when alice seduced himor gave him an invisible tattoo as alice might have put ithe was not a day over fortyfive when he spoke with jack in the domkirke but andreas breivik had made something of a maestro of himself and his success had made him pompous his blond blueeyed good looks had not endured a man with delicate features had to be careful breiviks face was slightly puffy perhaps he drank he gave jack a virtual lecture on the subject of the cathedrals new organ which had been completed only a month before jacks arrival in osloby a finn living in norway jack couldnt have cared less about the organ or the finn with a grandiose gesture to the greenandgold instrument which positively shimmered breivik said we have the funeral of king olav the fifth to thank for this january ill never forget it the old jørgensen was such a disgrace the prime minister himself insisted that money be raised for a new organ i see jack said andreas breivik had studied choral music in stuttgart hed furthered his organ studies in london this hardly mattered to jack but he nodded politely breiviks education not to mention his mastery of english meant a great deal to breivik ive seen your films of coursevery entertaining but you dont seem to have followed in your fathers musical footsteps so to speak nono musical footsteps jack said i took after my mother it seems are you tattooed breivik asked no are you good lord no andreas breivik said your dad was a talented musician a generous teacher an engaging man but his tattoos were his own business we didnt discuss them i never saw them mr breivik please tell me what happened i dont understand what happened jack remembered the cleaning woman in the churchhow horrified shed been to see him and his mom he recalled what little hed understood of his moms seduction of andreas breivik and how ingrid moe had come to her for a tattoohow ingrid had wanted a broken heart and alice had given the girl a whole one but why had alice insisted on talking to ingrid moe in the first place and what information about jacks father could either ingrid or andreas possibly have given jacks mom his dad hadnt run away alice hadnt been trying to find william what was there about william that alice didnt already know andreas breivik was less pompous in relating this story he wasnt proud of it nor was it an easy story for him to tell but the pattern which jack had failed to grasp till now was really rather simple everywhere jack and his mom went after copenhagen they arrived ahead of his dad alice not only expected william to follow themshe knew how much william wanted to see his sonbut alice also knew ahead of time where william would be inclined to travel next you didnt just choose a church and an organ breivik told jack these appointments took time to arrange there was always an experienced organist with whom a relatively inexperienced organist wanted to study next and the church where that mentor played had its own hierarchical way of choosing apprentices no organist wanted more than a few students and only the most gifted students were chosen with an organ because of how many notes there were to play sight reading was mandatory students with very narrow tastes or those who disliked certain core composers were generally discouraged most younger students were irritating because they liked to practice only loud or flashy music you had to have a few irons in the fire andreas breivik said he meant that you had to be making plans way ahead of yourself where was the next organist you wanted to study with what church which organ in this world you were both an apprentice and a teacher as an apprentice you also needed to go where youd have students not too many but enough to pay the rent this was the way it worked when william was still playing the organ at the citadel church in denmark he was already thinking about swedenabout apprenticing himself to torvald torén about playing the organ at the hedvig eleonora in stockholmand all the while he was in stockholm william was planning to come eventually to oslo where he could study with rolf karlsen and play the organ at the domkirke what alice did starting in copenhagen was to find out which irons in the fire were the hottestwhat city was the next in line for william jack and his mom would go there and alice would establish herself she would set up shop and wait for william to arrive then systematically alice would set out to destroy the relationships william valued most first of all those friends he might have made in the churchpossibly even the organist who was his mentor but alice more often chose easier targets in the case of oslo she chose williams two best students andreas breivik and ingrid moe contrary to what jack had believed for twentyeight years his dad hadnt seduced ingrid moe she was sixteen at the time and engaged to be married to young andreas breivik theyd been childhood sweethearts they even played the same instruments first the piano and then the organ and william prized them as studentsnot only because they were talented and hardworking but also because they were in love having been in love with karin ringhof william burns had a high regard for young musicians in love your father was more than a terrific organist and a great teacher andreas breivik told jack in oslo the story of what had happened to him in copenhagen preceded him he was already a tragic figure so my mother seduced you jack asked him his once delicate now slightly puffy features hardened i had known only ingrid breivik said a young man whos had only one girlfriend is vulnerable to an older womanperhaps especially to a woman with a reputation your mother put it to me rather bluntly she saidshe was teasing me of courseandreas youre really just another kind of virgin arent you where did you tattoo him jack remembered asking his mom where hell never forget it shed whispered to jack smiling at andreas possibly the sternum jack had imagined that would explain why the young man had trembled at her touch just keep it covered for a day jack had said to breivik as the young organ student was leaving it looked like it hurt him to walk it will feel like a sunburn jack had told him better put some moisturizer on it but andreas didnt know anything after the organ student had gone alice had sobbed if hed known anything he would have told me shed meant that andreas breivik didnt know what irons william had in the fire the boy had no idea where william was thinking of going next but ingrid moe knew and alice wasted little time in letting ingrid know that shed slept with the girls fiancé ingrid had never felt so betrayed her speech impediment isolated her shed always been shy about meeting people ingrid couldnt forgive andreas for being unfaithful to her it didnt help that alice wouldnt leave the girl alone jack remembered that sunday when his mom took the shirt cardboard to churchhow shed stood in the center aisle at the end of the service with the shirt cardboard saying ingrid moe held to her chest jack had thought rolf karlsen must have been playing the organ that sunday because everyone said karlsen was such a big deal and the organ sounded especially good but the organist that sunday had been william burns it was the one time his father had played the organ for jack butnot unlike how the boy had met his dad in the restaurant at the hotel bristoljack didnt know it and neither did william im sorry he hurt you alice had said to ingrid moe when the girl had come to the hotel for her brokenheart tattoo but the he had been andreas breivik whod slept with jacks mothernot as jack had thought his father who had never slept with ingrid moe jack remembered how ingrids exquisite prettiness was marred by what an obvious strain it was for her to speak not that hed understood her very well for all these years jack had thought of her speech impediment as an agony connected with kissing when hed imagined his father kissing the girl jack had felt ashamed i wont do his name alice had told ingrid i dont want his name the girl had answeredclenching her teeth together when she talked as if she were afraid or unable to show her tongue shed wanted just a heart ripped in two then alice had given her a whole heart insteada perfectly unbroken one as jack recalled you didnt give me what i wanted ingrid moe had blurted out i gave you what you have a perfect hearta small one alice had told her im not telling you anything the girl had said shed told jack insteadsibelius shed said not the composer but the name of a music college in helsinki where williams next best students would come from new students were part of what andreas breivik meant by irons in the fire ingrid quit the organ andreas told jack she went back to the piano without much success i stayed with the organ i kept growing as you have to he said with no small amount of pride ingrids marriage didnt have much success either jack didnt like him breivik seemed smug even a little cruel what about your marriage jack asked him or didnt you get married andreas shrugged i became an organist he said as if that were all that mattered im grateful to your mother if you really want to know she saved me from getting married at a time when i was far too young to be married anyway i would have had a timeconsuming personal life when what i needed was to be completely focused on my music as for ingrid in all likelihood she would have chosen a personal life over a careerwhether she married me or someone else and i dont think her personal life would have worked out any better or differently if shed been married to me with ingrid things just wouldnt have worked outthey just didnt like some other successful people jack had known andreas breivik had all the answers the more breivik said the more jack wanted to talk with ingrid moe theres one other thing jack said i remember a cleaning woman in the churchan older woman wellspoken imperious thats impossible breivik said cleaning women arent wellspoken are you telling me this one spoke english yes she did jack replied her english was quite good she couldnt have been a cleaning woman andreas said with irritation i dont suppose you remember her name she had a mopshe leaned on it she pointed with it she waved it around jack went on her name was elsemarie lothe breivik laughed scornfully that was ingrids mother ill say she was imperious you got that right but elsemarie wasnt that wellspoken her english was only okay her last name was lothe she had a mop jack repeated she was divorced from ingrids father shed remarried andreas said she had a cane not a mop she broke her ankle getting off the streetcar right in front of the cathedral she caught her shoe in the trolley tracks the ankle never healed properlyhence the cane she had dry hands like a cleaning woman jack mentioned lamely she was a potterthe artistic type potters have dry hands breivik said needless to say elsemarie lothe had hated alice shed ended up hating andreas breivik too jack could easily see how that could happen jack asked breivik for ingrid moes married name and her address its so unnecessary for you to see her andreas said you wont find her any easier to understand this time but after some complaining breivik gave jack her name and address under the circumstances it turned out that andreas breivik knew more about ingrid moe than jack would have thought her name was ingrid amundsen now after her divorce breivik said she moved into a thirdfloor apartment on theresesgateon the left side of the street looking north you can walk from there to the center of oslo in twentyfive minutes breivik said this with the dispassion of a man who had timed the aforementioned walk more than once the blue tram line goes by andreas continued as slowly as if he were waiting for the tram since the new rikshospitalet was built there are three different lines passing the noise might have bothered ingrid to begin with but she probably doesnt hear it any longer ingrid amundsen was a piano teacher she gave private lessons in her apartment theresesgate is quite a nice street andreas said closing his eyes as if he could walk the street in his sleepof course he had down at the south end toward bislett stadium which is only a fiveminute walk from ingrids there are a few cafés a decent bookstoreeven an antiquarian bookstoreand the usual eleven closer to ingrid on her side of the street is a large grocery store called rimi theres a nice vegetable store next to the stensgate tram stop too its run by immigrantsturkish i think you can buy some imported specialtiesmarinated olives some cheeses its all very modest but nice breiviks voice trailed away youve never been inside her apartment jack asked him breivik shook his head sadly its an old building four stories built around its a bit shabby i suppose knowing ingrid she probably would have kept the original wooden floors she would have done some of the renovating herself im sure her children would have helped her how old are her children jack asked the daughter is the older one breivik told jack shes living with a guy she met in university but they dont have children she lives in an area called sofienberg its a very popular and hip place for young people to live the daughter can get on a tram in trondheimsveien and be at her mothers in about twenty minutes by bicycle it would take her ten or fifteen i imagine if she had children shed want to move out of central oslomaybe holmlia an affordable area where there are still almost as many norwegians as there are immigrants and ingrid has a son jack asked the boy is studying at the university in bergen andreas breivik said he visits his mother only during vacations jack liked breivik a little better after this conversation jack nearly told andreas that he would come see him after he visited with ingridand that he would describe the interior of her apartment to him so that the organist could imagine the interior part of ingrids life as obsessively as hed imagined the rest of it but that would have been cruel andreas was probably unaware of what an investigation hed made of his former girlfriend ingrid moe had been sixteen when jack had covered the tattoo on her heartside breast with a piece of gauze with vaseline on it he remembered that hed had some difficulty getting the adhesive tape to stick to her skin because she was still sweating from the pain have you done this before ingrid had asked sure jack had lied no you havent shed said not on a breast when hed held the gauze against her skin jack could feel the heat of her tattooher hot heart burning his hand through the bandage like andreas breivik ingrid amundsen would be about fortyfive now what a waste andreas cried out suddenly startling jack she had such long fingersperfect for playing the organ the piano breivik said contemptuously what a waste jack remembered her long arms and long fingers he remembered her thick blond braid toohow it hung down her perfectly straight back reaching almost to the base of her spine and her small breastsespecially the left one which jack had touched with the tattoo bandage when ingrid moe now amundsen spoke she curled back her lips and bared her clenched teeth the muscles of her neck were tensed thrusting her lower jaw forward as if she were about to spit it was tragic hed thought that such a beautiful girl could be so instantly transformedthat the notsosimple act of speaking could make her ugly jack was a little afraid of seeing her again that girl is a heartstopper his mother had said twentyeight years before you have your fathers eyes his mouth ingrid had whispered to jack but her speech impediment had made a mess of her whisper shed said mouth in such a way that the mangled word had rhymed with roof and jack had thought he would faint when she kissed him when her lips opened her teeth had clicked against his he remembered wondering if her speech impediment was contagious was there a problem with her tongue of course there might have been nothing the matter with ingrids tongue jack had not asked andreas breivik about the source of ingrids speech impediment naturally he had no intention of asking ingrid when jack called her from the bristol he was afraid she wouldnt see him why would she want to be reminded of what had happened but it was stupid to try to deceive her and jack didnt do a very good job of it some actor you are emma would have told him when ingrid amundsen answered the phone jack was completely flustered that she said something in norwegian well what else would the poor woman speak in norway hello im an american who finds himself in oslo for an indefinite period of time jack blurted out as if there were worse things the matter with him than a speech impediment i want to keep up my piano lessons jack burns ingrid said the way she spoke jack could hardly recognize his own name when you speak the way i do she continued you listen very closely to other peoples voices i would know your voice anywhere jack burns about the only thing i have in common with people who can talk normally is that ive seen all your movies oh jack said as if he were four years old and if you play the piano jack you probably play better than i do i doubt i can teach you anything i dont play the piano he confessed my mothers dead and i dont know my father i wanted to talk with you about him jack could hear her crying it wasnt pretty she couldnt even cry normally im glad your mothers dead she said i think ill have a party i would love to talk to you about your father jack please come talk with me and well have a little party he remembered watching her walk away from himdown the long carpeted hall of the bristol shed been sixteen going on thirty as he recalled from behind she didnt look like a child shed walked away from him like a woman and what a voicethat voice had always been sixteen going on fortyfive although it was raining jack stood for fifteen minutes outside her building on the theresesgatefortunately under an umbrella the taxi had brought him sooner than hed expected ingrid had invited him at five in the afternoon which was when her last piano student of the day would be leaving jack looked up from his watch and saw a boy about twelve or thirteen coming out of ingrids building he looked like a piano student jack thoughta little dreamy a little delicate a little like it wasnt entirely his idea to be doing this excuse me jack said to the boy do you play the piano the kid was terrified he looked as if he were sizing up which way to run forgive me for being curious jack said hoping to sound reassuring i just thought you looked very musical anyway if you are a piano player keep doing it never stop i cant tell you how much i regret that i stopped bugger off the boy said walking backward away from him to jacks surprise the boy had an english accent you look like that creep jack burns just bugger off jack watched him run the boy went in the direction of the stensgate tram stop jack imagined that the piano student was about the age of niels ringhof when niels had slept with jacks mother he rang the buzzer for amundsenno first name no initial it was a thirdfloor walkup but even a snob like andreas breivik might have enjoyed the view the kitchen and the two smaller bedrooms overlooked the stensparkena cleanlooking park situated on a hill at the south end of the park ingrid pointed out the fagerborg kirkethe church where she went every sunday on sunday mornings she told jack you could hear the church bells in the whole area the organist at the fagerborg church isnt in the same league as your father or andreas breivik ingrid said but hes more than good enough for a simple piano teacher like me shed learned to conceal her mouth with her long fingers when she spoke or to always speak when her face was turned slightly away the constant movement of her long arms as if she were conducting music only she could hear was very graceful she was a head taller than jack even in her white athletic socks she made him take off his shoes at the door breivik had been right about the floorsshed saved the original wood her son had helped her remove the old layers of lacquer the kitchen was the best room in the apartment it had been remodeled in the early nineties with cupboards and all the rest from ikeanothing fancy ingrid said it was a blueandwhite kitchen with a wooden workbench and a kitchen table with three chairs around it there was no dining room in the living room which faced the street there was an old fireplace and the original stucco work was intact the piano faced a wall of photographsfamily pictures for the most part the biggest of the three bedrooms which was ingrids also faced the streetnot the park i think the park is rather lonely at night she told jack and besides my children wanted views of the park from their bedrooms there have been no difficult decisions in this apartment she had an interesting way of speakingthat is in addition to her speech impediment the thick braid that had hung to her waist was gone her hair was slightly shorter than shoulderlength now but still blond with only hints of silver in it she wore jeans and what may have been her favorite among her sons leftbehind shirtsa mans flannel shirt untucked like miss wurtz had once worn i wore this for you because its so american ingrid said plucking at the shirt with her long fingers i never dress up or wear any makeup in this apartment another notdifficult decision jack imagined if i dressed up and wore makeup it might make my pupils nervous jack said that he thought hed met one of her pupils and that hed probably made him nervouswithout meaning to an english boy about twelve or thirteen jack asked she nodded and smiled many of her students were from diplomats families the parents wanted their children to be occupied with cultural things to keep them from being at loose ends ingrid said not a bad reason for playing the piano jack asked her if she would play for him but she shook her head the apartment wasnt soundproofed she explained in the old building her neighbors could hear the piano through the walls she stopped playing after five in the afternoon and the first of her students never came to the apartment before ninemore often tenin the morning she and jack sat in the kitchen where ingrid made some tea her cheeks were a little sunken in but she was still beautiful nothing of what had been babyfaced about her remained and her long limbs and broad hips had always given her a womanly appearance she was more handsome than pretty befitting the mother of two grown childrenthe childrens photos were all over the apartment not just on the wall behind the piano jack had spotted a nicelooking man with the children when the kids were younger he was a sailor in some of the pictures a skier in others the childrens father ingrids exhusband jack assumed the man looked nice in the way emma had once defined the word meaning that he looked normal everything about ingrid seemed normal tooin the best sense of the word i shouldnt have said i was glad your mother was dead thats an awful thing to say about a mother to her son she exclaimed im sorry no dont be sorry jack said i understand i hated her twice ingrid told him for what she did to me for seducing andreasof course i hated her for that but when i had children of my ownwhen they were the age you were when i met youi hated your mother all over again i hated her for what she did to you first i hated her as a woman then as a mother no woman can have children and continue to think of herself first but she did alice wasnt thinking of youof you not having a father she was thinking only about herself jack couldnt say anything everything ingrid said sounded true he couldnt argue with her but he also couldnt agree with hernot with any authority what did jack burns know about having children and how having children changed you he finally said you have a third reason to hate herfor your tattoo i remember that it wasnt what you asked for ingrid laughed her laughter was more naturalsounding than the way she had cried on the telephone she was moving gracefully around the kitchenopening the refrigerator putting food on the table jack realized that shed prepared a cold suppergravlaks with a mustard sauce a potato salad with cucumber and dill and slices of very dark rye bread well it was just a tattooit wasnt lifechanging she was saying but i was proud of myself for telling her what i wanted i knew she would hate the idea a whole heart a perfectly unbroken one i told her a heart my babies will one day love to touch i said theres not a thing the matter with my heart i told your mother maybe just make it a little smaller than average i told her because my breast is a little smaller than average too i thought i was so brave to tell her this when all the while my heart was broken andreas and your mother had broken it but i wasnt going to let her know that what did you say jack asked her it wasnt the speech impediment he was pretty sure he had understood her you didnt ask for a broken heart ingrid ask who would want one she exclaimed i asked your mother for the kind of heart i had before she fucked andreas ingrid was lighting a candle shed already arranged the place settings she hadnt turned a light on in the kitchen preferring the dusk and the view of the stensparken and the bitch gave me a broken heart ingrid said as ugly a heart as one could imagine well you put the bandage on it jack you remember i remember it the other way around he told her she was pouring herself a glass of wine somehow she knew jack didnt drink she told him later that shed read about his being a teetotaler in an interview i remember you asking for a heart ripped in two and my mom gave you a good one she gave me a good one all right ingrid said she stood next to jacks chair and unbuttoned the flannel shirt she wasnt wearing a bra he thought of miss wurtz in a shirt like that without a braunbuttoning her shirt for his father even at dusk in the dim candlelight the tattoo of ingrid amundsens torn heart looked like a fresh woundthe jagged tear cut the heart diagonally in two the bloodred edges of the tear were darker than the shading of the heart and more sharply defined than the outline jack had not seen his mother do an uglier tattoo but ingrid seemed accepting of it well guess what she said buttoning her shirt back up my babies loved it they loved to touch it and i came to realize that your mother had given me the heart i hadnot the heart i used to have how much more cruel it would have been to walk around wearing the heart i used to have not that alice was consciously doing me a favor she sat down at the table and served him bon appétit jack she said when i see you in the movies i think of how proud you must make your fatherand how it must have hurt your mother to see you hurt her how he asked because she finally had to share you ingrid said she never knew how to share you jack the food was very good and jack was hungry it seemed strange that there wasnt any music but music is never background music to musicians your father was very religious ingrid told him when he was helping her do the dishes its hard to play church music in a church and not be although i wasnt i became more religious when i went back to playing the pianothat is not in a church how was he very religious jack asked when andreas and your mother hurt me william told me something he said find someone devote yourself to that person have a child or children praise god not that it ever worked out that way for me but thats what william told me thats what he believed in well i got the children and i praise god thats been good enough so youre religious too he asked yesbut not like your father jack tell me more about the religious part he said take your mother for example ingrid said a little impatiently your father forgave her i didnt he forgave her he fought back once but it backfired i dont think he fought back again she told him it was as if her speech impediment had almost gone away or hed forgotten it she was such a healthy person jack was thinking shed gone into the living room and had come back to the kitchen with a photograph a pretty young woman dont you think she asked showing him the picture jack recognized the beautiful girl in the photograph it was the woman william had brought with him to the restaurant in the hotel bristol i asked her if she had a tattoo jack said that was what backfired ingrid told him your dad didnt expect you would speak to them he felt awful who was the girl jack asked my sister an actress ingrid said shes not a movie star like youbut in norway shes a little bit famous in the theater i convinced your father to take her with him i thought it would serve your mother right alice was always telling him how and when he could get a look at you in copenhagen and in stockholm she even told him who to have with him yes i know jack said so i told him to take my sister the actress and i told my sister to fall all over him i said to them both make the bitch think youre in love with each other make her think that all the lies she tells jack have come true but then you went up to them and they didnt know what to do naturally your mom fell apart and she took you away again she was always taking you away yes he said your father told me maybe forgiveness would have worked better ingrid but i told him that nothing would work with alice nothing workeddid it jack no nothing worked he answered your father said god wants us to forgive each other ingrid thats all i know about the religious part jack it was dark outsidethe lonely time of night in the stensparkenand the candle on the kitchen table was the only light in the darkening apartment look how dark it is jack burns ingrid whispered bending down to touch his ear with her clenched teeth youre still a little boy to me i cant let you go home in the dark even with her speech impediment she made it sound as if this were another notdifficult decision in her fabulous apartment where thered been no difficult decisionsnot ever kissing ingrid amundsen was almost normal there was an unnatural sound she made when she swallowed when she was kissing him but it wasnt unpleasant jack held his moms rippedheart tattoo on ingrids small left breastexactly where her babies had been delighted to touch her ingrid had no breasts to speak of and the blue veins in her forearms stood out against the gold of her skinjust as hed remembered another blue vein which began at her throat ran down between her small breasts that vein seemed to have a pulse in it as if an animal lived under her skin maybe the animal affected her speech at least hed remembered her veins correctly i used to think about which of us was the more damaged but were all right arent we ingrid asked him her poor voice sounded awful at that moment yes i think so jack said but he didnt really feel that he was all rightand he couldnt tell about ingrid she had the aura of an accepted sadness about her jack hated to think of her meeting people for the first time and what that did to her he was even angry at her son whod gone off to the university in bergen couldnt the kid have stayed in oslo and seen more of his mother yet ingrids life her seeming wholeness impressed jack as more likable than whatever life andreas breivik was living breiviks opinionnamely that ingrid had not had much success at anythingstruck jack as arrogant and wrong but andreas had known her better than jack did she was such a beautiful yet flawed woman it hadnt been hard for jacks mom to make the boy believe that ingrid and william had been lovers who wouldnt have been her lover it couldnt have been as bad for your father anywhere as it was in copenhagen ingrid told jack but i dont think that the problems with your mother ever got better not in helsinki anyway alice was perfectly awful to him there but she didnt achieve her desired effect i think your mom started running out of steam in helsinki jack that had always been jacks impression what happened in helsinki he asked her i dont know everything jack i just know that alice tried to break up a lesbian couple but she couldnt manage it they both slept with herand had a good time or notbut they went right on being a couple who were they jack asked music studentsyour dads two best like andreas and me only one of them was an organist the other one was a cellist ritva and hannele were gay jack asked their names sound familiar ingrid said the point is jackyour mother once again didnt get what she wanted but neither did your father you stayed in touch with him jack asked till he left for amsterdam ingrid told him whatever happened there he didnt write me about it i lost touch with him when he left helsinki the kissing had become more interesting it was principally her speech that was damaged there was something detectably but indefinably strange about her mouthif not actual damage a kind of involuntary tremor that felt like damage jack didnt know what it was but it was very arousing it seemed the wrong time to ask her but the thought had occurred to jackwhen she implied shed had some limited correspondence with his father if only when william was in finland jack just had to ask her was there anything romantic between you and my dad ingrid what a thing to ask meyou naughty boy she said laughing he was a lovely man but he wasnt my type for one thing he was too short shorter than i am jack asked a little shorter maybenot much of course i was never with him when i was lying down she added laughing again ingrid grabbed jacks penis which in his experience implied an impatience with the particular conversationwhatever it was so im not your type either he asked she kept laughing it was the most natural sound she was capable of making except perhaps on the piano i have other reasons for wanting to sleep with you jack was all she told him what other reasons ingrid when youve made love to me again and again ill tell you she said ill tell you lateri promise there was an urgency about her speech impediment now something more than impatience he began by kissing her brokenheart tattoo which seemed to make her happy in the morning jack woke her by kissing the tattoo again it looked as if it were still bleeding she smiled before she opened her eyes yes keep doing that ingrid said with her eyes still closed he kept kissing her woundedheart tattoo if you keep doing that ill tell you what i believe about hell her eyes were wide open nowhell being an eyeopening subject he kept kissing her of course if you hurt people if you know youre hurting them you go to hell ingrid said in hell you have to watch the people you hurt the ones who are still alive if two people you hurt ever get together you have to watch everything they do very closely but you cant hear them everyone in hell is deaf you just have to watch the people you hurt without knowing what theyre talking about of course hell being hell you think theyre talking about youits all you ever imagine while youre just watching and watching kiss me everywhere jacknot just the tattoo he kissed her everywhere they made love again what a bad nights sleep your mothers had jack ingrid said shes been up all night just watching jack had fallen back to sleep when he heard the piano there was the smell of coffee in the apartment he got out of bed and went into the living room where ingrid was sitting naked at the piano playing softly nice way to wake up isnt it she asked with her back turned to him yes it is he told her we both have to get dressed and you have to go she said my first pupil is coming okay jack said turning to go back to her bedroom but come kiss me first she said while the bitch is watching there was a lot jack didnt know about religion his dad apparently was a forgiver ingrid moe now amundsen wasnt she hadnt forgiven andreas breivik or alice as jack kissed ingrid on her damaged mouth he was thinking that he wasnt much of a forgiver either in hell where his mother was watching alice might have regretted giving ingrid the wrong tattooor so jack burns was also thinking the truth jack never saw what the rest of finland looked like it was dark all the way from the airport into helsinki although it was april it was almost snowing one or two degrees colder and the rain would have turned to snow he checked into the hotel torni marveling at the large round room on the first floor which served the hotel as a lobby jack remembered it as the american bara hangout for the young and wild some brave girls among them the old irongrate elevator which had been temporarily out of service for the duration of jacks time in the torni with his mom was now working but although the american bar was gone the torni was still a hangout for young people on the ground floor was an irish pub called omalleys shamrocks all over the place guinness on draft it was an unwise choice for the jack burnses of this worldit was packed with more moviegoers than coconut teaszer but jack wasnt hungry and hed slept on the plane he didnt feel like eating or going to sleep a notbad band of irish folksingers was playing to the pubcrowda fiddler a guitarist and a lead singer who said he loved yeats hed left ireland for finland fifteen years ago jack talked to the band members between sets the young finns in the pub were shy about speaking to jack although they did their share of staring when the irish folksingers went back to work a couple of finnish girls started talking to jack they didnt seem all that brave in fact they were very tentative he couldnt tell what they expected or what they wanted to happen first one of them began to flirt with him then she stopped flirting and the other one started you cant dance to this music the one whod stopped flirting remarked you look like you dont need music to dance the one whod started flirting said to jack thats right he told her i suppose you think i was suggesting something she said jack wasnt about to mess up his memory of ingrid moe by sleeping with either of the finns or with both of them he thought he was hungry enough to eat a little something but when he said good night to the finnish girls one of them remarked i guess were not what youre looking for actually jack told them im looking for a couple of lesbians what a waste of a good end linein omalleys irish pub in helsinki of all places he went to the lobby of the torni and asked the concierge if there was still a restaurant called salve it used to be popular with sailors jack said not anymore the concierge told him and im not sure its the right place for jack burns to walk into its a local place given the moviegoing crowd in omalleys irish pub jack was glad hed registered at the torni as jimmy stronach jack went up to his room and changed into what leslie oastler called his tattooparlor clothesjeans and a black turtleneck mrs oastler had also packed emmas bomber jacket the sleeves were way too long on jack but he loved it it still felt cold enough to snow when he walked into salvean oldfashioned restaurant the kind of place where you got fairly ordinary but homecooked meals if as hed once imagined helsinki was a tough town in which to be afflicted with selfdoubts jack could see what the concierge had meant about a movie star showing up at salve surely some of the locals were moviegoers maybe they just hadnt liked jack burnss movies the waitresses were as hed remembered themhardworked and fairly longoftooth jack was thinking about the tough waitress whod been married to sami salo the scratcher she would have fit right in twentyeight years later shed been tough enough to call alice dearie jack recalledalthough he wondered if the bad feelings between them had really been about his mom putting sami out of business jack remembered mrs sami salo if thats who she was as a short stout woman whose clothes were too tight shed squinted whenever she took a step as though her feet hurt her her fat arms had jiggled he was trying not to look at anybody too closelycertainly not to meet anyones eyewhen the waitress came up to his table which needed wiping she used a wet dishcloth jack tried not to look too hard at her either she was as thin as mrs sami salo had been fat or maybe only mrs salos arms had been fat he couldnt remember the thin waitress had hunched shoulders and a coarse complexion but there was a kind of tired prettiness in her long face and catlike eyes when she stood facing jack at his table she cocked one hip to the side as if her legs were tired too i hope youre meeting someone she said you didnt come here alone did you isnt it all right to come here alone he asked its not all right for you to come here alone she told him it might be safer for you to come here as a girl i was hoping you could tell me where to get a tattoo jack said this used to be the place to ask im the one to ask the waitress said seriouslyif you arent meeting someone here you better be sure you leave with someone what about the tattoo he asked movie stars shouldnt get tattooed she told him it ruins you for the nude scenes theres makeup for that jack said you probably shouldnt get tattooed alone either the waitress said are you here making a movie actually im looking for a couple of lesbians but ill start with where to get a tattoo he told her she smiled for the first time she was missing an eyetooth which was probably why she was disinclined to smile if youre alone ill go home with you the waitress said you cant do much with a couple of lesbians she could tell he was thinking about itanother closeup opportunity but jack was suddenly tired and he wanted to hold on to the memory of ingrid moe a little longer im not really old enough to be your mother the waitress added i just look it its not that im just too tired he told her ive been traveling if you end up here youve been traveling all right she said ill have the arctic char please jack said what are you drinking i dont drink he told her ill bring you a beer the waitress said you can just pretend youre drinking it she was wise to do that because the locals kept toasting himall through his dinner the toasts were somehow sinister even hostilemore challenging than friendly jack would raise his beer glass and pretend to swallow they didnt seem to notice that his glass stayed full or they didnt care if there were jack burns fans in finland they had a way of masking their affection jack didnt go home with the waitress she was nice about it she made him wait at the table while she called him a taxi only when the cab was parked outside would she release him she even walked him to the door holding his arm the whole way my name is marianne there are much more difficult names in finland she said ill bet there are marianne she gave him a blackandwhite business card it was a little scary the place was called the ducks tattoo there was an excellent drawing of donald duck but he was smoking a blunta cigar filled with marijuana his eyes were fried and he looked raving mad someone had wrapped a snake around the reefersmoking duck more in the manner of a straitjacket than a shawl there was a phone number written on the back of the business card thats my number marianne told jack ive got a couple of tattoos i could show you if youre ever not too tired thank you marianne the tattooist you want to see is diego she said not a finnish name i guess diegos italian but he was born in finland marianne said hes been in business here for fifteen years the ducks tattoo was on kalevankatuabout a tenminute walk from the torni the concierge said the next morning the concierge also sent jack to a gym near the hotel kuntokeskus motivus call it motivus for short the concierge had recommended it was clean with lots of free weights but jack was distracted during his workout by a pregnancyaerobics class the bouncing women were doing dangerouslooking things on his way to the ducks tattoo jack passed a porn shop one of the magazines in the window was a german one called schwangere girls all the women were pregnant more bouncing women doing dangerouslooking things pregnancy seemed to have made itself the unwanted theme of jacks day helsinki struck him as a warren of construction sites he found himself in a part of the city that had been built by the russians a hundred years before the ducks tattoo was opposite the former russian army hospital it had been a sailors neighborhood with lots of sailors pubs and restaurantslike salve used to bebut the neighborhood was growing trendier by the day diego later told jack diego was a small man with friendly eyes and a goatee his forearms were completely covered with tattoos one was a rather formal portrait of a woman almost like a photograph another was an entirely less formallooking woman who was naked in fact she was naked with a duck diego had other tattoos but the naked woman with the duck was the one jack would remember best he liked diego whod never met daughter alice but had heard of her diego had three children and was not a regular participant at the tattoo conventions hed studied with verber in berlin hed worked in cape town south africa he was planning a trip to thailand to get a handmade tattoo by a monk in a monastery a chest tattoo he called it he was inclined to big works diego saidboth getting them and doing them hed recently copied a whole movie poster onto someones back diego had two apprentices working with him one of them was a muscleman in camouflage pants and a black jack daniels tshirt the other was a blond woman named taru evidently taru did the piercing she had a silver stud in her tongue there was another guy in the ducks tattooa friend of diegos named nipa who told jack a fairly involved story about accidentally dropping a paperback novel in a toilet it was his favorite novel nipa said and he was trying to figure out a way to dry it jack talked to diego about the relationship between sailors and tattooing diego had his first boat when he was just fourteen the flash in the ducks tattoo was impressive indian chiefs dragons skulls birds harley engines and many cartoon characters like the jokerand ducks of course lots of edgy ducks diego admitted he wasnt much of a moviegoerhe mentioned his three children againbut taru the piercer and the muscleman in the jack daniels tshirt had seen all of jacks films nipa told jack he was more of a book person than a movie person as one might surmise from the toilet accident i dont suppose you ever tattooed an organist named william burns jack said to diego tattoo artists call him the music man i guess most of his tattoos are music he might be a fullbody might be diego said laughing i never tattooed himi never met the guybut from what i hear the music man hasnt got a whole lot of skin left when jack got back to his room at the hotel torni he tried to write a letter to michele maher as a dermatologist maybe she would know why some people with fullbody tattoos felt cold it was a strange way to start a letter to someone hed not written or spoken to for fifteen years and quite possibly the fullbody people only thought they felt cold what if the part about feeling cold was all in their minds and had nothing to do with their skin tattoo artists themselves didnt agree about the fullbody types alice had believed that most fullbodies felt cold but some of the tattooists jack met at his moms memorial service told him that many fullbodies felt normal the ones who feel cold were either cold or crazy to begin with north dakota dan had said but how else could jack begin a letter to michele maher after fifteen years of silence dear michele here i am in helsinki looking for a couple of lesbians whats up with you how was that for too weird jack crumpled up the piece of stationery perhaps a more general beginning would be better dear michele guess what my mother died it turns out she lied to me about my fathermaybe about a lot of other things im in europe where i once believed my dad had slept with just about everyone he met but it turns out that my mom was the one who was sleeping with everybodyamong them a twelve or thirteenyearold boy and a couple of lesbians interesting huh the things you think you know jack crumpled up another page he was beginning to believe that the only way he could communicate with michele maher was if he developed a skin problem but wait hadnt she written to him to wish him luck on his adaptation of the slushpile reader michele was an emma oastler fan perhaps a more literary approach would impress her dear michele thank you for your letter yes i was close to emma oastler although we never actually had sex emma just held my penis and of course as with any adaptation i have had to take some liberties with her novel the name of the porn star for examplei dont exactly look like a miguel santiago do i and please dont think there will be any actual pornfilm footage in the slushpile reader it wont be that kind of movie the pornography will be sort of implied besides i have what im told is a rather small or smallish penis jack couldnt write a letter to michele maher he was too weird for michele or for anyone else who wasnt desperately lonely or crazy or a kid or griefstricken or otherwise depressed or cheating on her husband or tattooed with an octopus on her ass or an old lady besides he had used up what pathetically little stationery the hotel torni provided for guests jack blamed the day on the agitation the pregnancyaerobics class had caused himnot to mention the added stress of seeing schwangere girls he was even tempted to go buy the magazine but what he really wantedand this truly disturbed himwas to have sex with a nice pregnant woman like a wife jack was thinking like someone who was going to have his baby like michele maher he kept hoping more realistically because he wasnt hungry or too tired jack could try his luck with whomever he might pick up downstairsin omalleysor he could call the waitress at salve but by the time marianne got off work jack probably would be too tired and the very idea of looking for a brave girl in omalleys irish pub was humiliating there was still some daylight left in the sky when jack called sibelius academy the music college and asked if there was anyone who might be able to tell him the whereabouts of two of their graduates in the early s the matter was complicated not only did it take the college a little time to connect him with someone who spoke english jack didnt even know the last names of the graduates talk about taking a stab in the dark i know it sounds crazy jack said but hannele was a cellist and ritva was an organist and i think they were a couple a couple the woman who spoke english said on the phone she had the doubting tone of voice of a knowledgeable bookseller whos convinced that the title of the book youre asking for is not the correct one yes i mean a lesbian couple he said the woman sighed i suppose youre a journalist she said her tone of voice was worse than doubting now she couldnt have made journalist sound any nastier if shed said rapist no im jack burnsthe actor he told her i believe these women were students of my father william burnsthe organist i met them when i was a child they also knew my mother well well the woman said am i truly speaking with the jack burnsi mean really yes really well well she said again hannele and ritva arent as famous as you are mr burns but theyre rather famous in finland really yes really the woman said it would be hard for them to hide in helsinki practically anyone could tell you where to find them jack waited while the woman sighed again she was taking the time to choose her next words very carefully its an awful temptation jack burns but ill refrain from asking you what youre wearing later jack called room service and ordered something to eat he also called the front desk and requested more hotel torni stationery he resisted both the faint impulse to explore omalleys and the slightly stronger desire to call marianne the waitress and ask to see her tattoos the next morning he got up early again and went to the motivus gym he wasnt at all sure how to approach hannele and ritva the unpronounceable church where the two musicians practiced every midday was called temppeliaukion kirkko the church in the rock as it was also called was more famous in helsinki than hannele and ritva it was underground buried under a dome of rockan ultramodern design presumably done for the acoustics there were numerous concerts therethese in addition to the sunday services which were lutheran very lutheran the woman from sibelius academy had told jackwhatever that meant ritva was the regular organist at the principal sunday service but hannele often accompanied her jack had inquired if much music had been written for organ and cellohe certainly hadnt heard anybut the woman from sibelius academy said that ritva and hannele were famous for being improvisational they were a most improvisational couple jack had already imagined indeed if theyd both slept with aliceyet theyd managed to stay a couple as ingrid moe had told jackhannele and ritva were no strangers to successful experimentation even their rehearsals were famous people often went to the church in the rock during their lunch break just to hear hannele and ritva practice jack imagined that it wouldnt be easy to speak with them in such an atmosphere in those surroundings hannele and ritva and jack were too well known to be afforded any privacy maybe he should just show up at the church in the early afternoon and invite them to dinner jack was finishing his workout on the ab machine in the gym when his thoughts were interrupted about half a dozen sweaty women from the pregnancyaerobics class had surrounded him jack guessed that their workout their dangerouslooking bouncing was over given his michele maher state of mindnot to mention his disturbing memories of the schwangere girls magazinethese pregnant women were an intimidating presence hi he said from flat on his back hi the aerobics instructor replied she was a darkhaired young woman with an arresting oval face and almondshaped eyes because her back had been turned to him during the aerobics class jack hadnt noticed that she was pregnant too hed watched her lead the leaping women from behind you look like jack burns that actor the most pregnantlooking of the women said jack wouldnt have been surprised to learn later that these were her last words before going into labor but you cant benot if youre here another of the women said doubtfully you just look like him right its a curse jack told them bitterly i cant help it that i look like him i hate the bastard it was the last line that gave him away it was one of billy rainbows lines in the movie jack said it three timesnot once referring to the same person its him one of the women cried i knew you were jack burns the most pregnantlooking woman told him jack burns always gives me the creeps and you gave me the creeps the second i saw you well theni guess that settles it jack said he was still lying on his back he hadnt moved since hed noticed them surrounding him what movie are you making here who else is in it one of them asked theres no movie he told them im just in town to do a little research one of the pregnant women grunted as if the very thought of what research jack burns might be doing in helsinki had given her her first contraction half the women walked away now that the mystery was solved they were no longer interested but the aerobics instructor and two other women stayed including the most pregnantlooking woman what kind of research is it the aerobics instructor asked him its a story that takes place in the pasttwentyeight years ago to be exact jack told them its about a church organist whos addicted to being tattooed and the woman whose father first tattooed him they have a child theres more than one version of what happened but things didnt work out are you the organist the most pregnantlooking woman asked no im the childall grown up twentyeight years later he told them im trying to find out what really happened between my mother and father the pregnant woman who hadnt yet spoken said what a depressing story i dont know why they make movies like that she turned and walked awayprobably she was going to the womens locker room the most pregnantlooking woman waddled after her jack was left alone with the aerobics instructor you didnt say you were doing a little research for a movie did you she asked him no i didnt he admitted this research isnt for a movie maybe you need a guide she said she was at least seven months pregnant probably eight her belly button had popped like an erect nipple it poked out against the spandex fabric of her leotard i meant to say a date ive never had a pregnant date jack told her im not marriedi dont even have a boyfriend she explained this baby is kind of an experiment something you managed all by yourself he asked i went to a sperm bank she answered i had an anonymous sperm donor i kind of forget the insemination part from flat on his back on the ab machine jack made one of those toohasty decisions that had characterized his sexually active life because hed imagined that he wanted to be with someone who was pregnant jack chose to be with the pregnant aerobics instructor at the motivus gymthis instead of even trying to make a dinner date with hannele and ritva the lesbian couple who were the reason for his coming to helsinki in the first place jack rationalized that what he might learn from the organist and cellist who were a couple when his mother and father knew themand they were still a couplewas in all likelihood something he already knew or could guess jacks mother had somehow misrepresented them to him they had slept with her not his dad of course there would be other revelations of that kind but nothing that couldnt be said over coffee or teanothing so complicated that it would require a dinner date to reveal jack decided to go to the church in the rock about the time hannele and ritva would be finishing their rehearsal he would suggest that they go somewhere for a little chat surely that would suffice jack thought there was no reason not to spend his last night in helsinki with a pregnant aerobics instructor as it would turn out there was a reason but jack was responding to an overriding instinct familiar to far too many mennamely the desire to be with a certain kind of woman precluded any reasonable examination or indepth consideration of the aerobics instructor herself whose name was marjaliisa they made a date which was awkward because they had to get a pen and some paper from the reception desk other people were watching them marjaliisa wrote out her name and cellphone number for him she was clearly puzzled by what jack wrote out for herjimmy stronach hotel torniuntil he explained the business of always registering under the name of the character he plays in his next movie when jack left the gym and returned to the torni he went first to that porn shop where hed seen the unlikely but alluring schwangere girls in the window he took the magazine back to his hotel roomjust to look at the pictures which were both disturbing and arousing when jack left the hotel for the church in the rock he threw the disgusting magazine awaynot in his hotel room but in a wastebasket in the hall opposite the elevator not that you can really throw pictures like those awaynot for years maybe not ever what those pregnant women were doing in those photographs would abide with jack burns in his graveor in hell where according to ingrid you were deaf but you could see everyone you ever knowingly hurt you just couldnt hear what they were saying about you since that afternoon in helsinki jack could imagine what hell might be like for him for eternity he would watch those pregnant women having uncomfortablelooking sex they would be talking about him but he couldnt hear them for eternity jack could only guess what they were saying to jack the dome of temppeliaukio church looked like a giant overturned wok the rocks which covered all but the dome had a pagan simplicity it was as if the dome were a living egg emerging from the crater of a meteor the apartment buildings surrounding the church in the rock had an austere sameness about them middleclass housing from the s there were more rocks inside the church the organist sat in view of those people on the left side of the congregation the empty rounded benchesfor the choiroccupied a centerstage position choirs were important here the copper organ pipes were very modernlooking against the darker and lighter woods the pulpit was surrounded by stone jack thought it looked like a drinking fountain in the early afternoon he sat and listened to hannele and ritvaritva in profile to him on the organ bench hannele facing him with her legs wide apart straddling her cello a small audience quietly came and went while the two women practiced jack could tell that hannele had recognized him as soon as he sat down she must have been expecting him because she merely smiled and nodded in his direction ritva turned once to look at jack she smiled and nodded too the lady hed spoken to at sibelius academy must have forewarned hannele and ritva that jack burns was looking for them it wasnt all church musicat least not the usual church music as a former canadian jack recognized leonard cohens if it be your willnot that he was used to hearing it played on organ and cello as an american jack also recognized van morrisons whenever god shines his light on me hannele and ritva were very good even jack could tell that their playing together had become second nature of course he was predisposed to like them jack gave them a lot of credit in advance just for surviving whatever assault his mom might have made on them as a couple jack also listened to them rehearse two traditional piecescome sing the praise of jesus and o come o come emmanuel the latter was an advent hymn and both hymns were better known in scotland than in finland hannele and ritva told jack later but the hymns they said had been particular favorites of his fathers william taught us those two ritva said we dont care that it isnt the month before christmas they were having tea in hannele and ritvas surprisingly beautiful and spacious apartment in one of those gray somber buildings encircling the church in the rock hannele and ritva had combined two apartments overlooking the dome of temppeliaukio church like the church their apartment was very modernlookingsparsely furnished with nothing but steelframed blackandwhite photographs on the walls the two women now in their late forties were goodhumored and very friendly naturally they were not as physically intimidating as theyd seemed to jack at four you were the first woman i ever saw with unshaven armpits he told hannele the astonishing hair in hanneles armpits had been a darker blond than the hair on her head although jack didnt mention this detailnor the birthmark over hanneles navel like a crumpled top hat the color of a wine stain the shape of florida hannele laughed most people remember my birthmark not my armpits jack i remember the birthmark too he told her ritva was enduringly short and plump with long hair and a pretty face she still dressed all in black like a drama student i remember how you fell asleep jackhow hard you were trying not to ritva told him he explained that hed thought at the time they had come for their halfaheart tattoos because theyd both slept with his father with william hannele cried spilling her tea ritva could not stop laughing they were the kind of gay women who were so comfortable with each other that they could flirt unselfconsciously with him or with other young men because they were confident that they wouldnt be misunderstood i suppose i shouldnt be surprised hannele said william told us that your mom was capable of telling you anything jack ritva and i underestimated how far she would go hannele explained that her relationship with ritva was new and still uncommitted when jacks mother had first hit on them the young music students had even discussed sleeping with alice as a kind of test of their relationship it was jack ritva said and hannele and i were young enough to imagine that you could treat any relationship as an experiment william had warned them about alice hed told hannele and ritva her history yet the girls had imagined that if they both were unfaithful with jacks mother they wouldnt hurt each other it hurt us more than we expected hannele told jack we decided to hurt your mother back the tattoo we shared was a symbol of how we had hurt each othera reminder to not be unfaithful to each other again a reminder of what sleeping with your mom had cost us and we let her know that we were brave enough to sleep with anybodyeven with william of course we wouldnt have slept with william jacknot that your father would have slept with either of us ritva said but your mom was extremely sensitive about anyone your dad might sleep with and it wasnt hard to convince her that hannele and i were lawless we even flirted with you jackjust to piss her off hannele said yes i remember that part jack told them their halfaheart tattoos had been torn apart vertically both women were tattooed on their heartside breasts you have eyelashes to die for jack hannele had told him under the covers her long fingers had lifted his pajama top and stroked his stomach when she was sleeping beside him hed almost kissed her go to sleep jack his mom had told him tell me about the sweet dreams part jack asked hannele and ritva in their beautiful apartment it was growing dark outside the lights shone through the dome of the church in the rock like a fire burning windows in an eggshell jack remembered that hed thought sweet dreams was something his dad probably said to all of his girlfriends hes not four anymore ritva said to hannele who was shaking her head go on tell him its what your mom whispered in our ears before she kissed us down there hannele said averting her eyes from jacks oh ritva had said sweet dreams to jack before shed kissed him good night isnt that what you say in english shed asked alice sweet dreams sometimes alice had said and hanneles brave whistling had stopped for a secondas if the pain of the shading needles on her heartside breast and that side of her rib cage had suddenly become unbearable but jack had been sure it was the sweet dreams that had hurt her not the tattoo talk about a notaroundjack subject jack told hannele and ritva about his mothers surprisingly longlasting relationship with leslie oastlernot that alice hadnt probably had other lesser relationships in the same period of time but her relationship with another woman was the only one that had endured were hannele and ritva surprised at that he asked the two women looked at each other and shrugged there wasnt anything your mom wouldnt do jack ritva said not if she could have an effectalmost any effecton your dad after william i dont think alice cared who she slept with hannele told him man woman or boy the blackandwhite photographs on the walls of the apartment were mostly of hannele and ritvamany concert photographs among them there was one of ritva on the organ bench in the johanneksen kirkko where jack had gone with his motherthis had been following a heavy snowfall he remembered flanking ritva on the organ bench were her two teacherskari vaara the organist with the wildlooking hair and a handsome thinlipped young man whose long hair fell to his shoulders framing a face as delicate as a girls my father jack asked ritva pointing to the picture william looked almost the same as he had that night in the restaurant of the hotel bristol yes of course ritva told jack you havent seen his picture before what are you thinking ritva hannele asked do you imagine alice kept a photo album for jack what jack was unprepared for was how young his father looked in in helsinki william burns would have been thirtyonea couple of years younger than jack was now it is strange to see for the first time a photograph of your father when he is younger than you are jack was also unprepared for the resemblance william looked almost exactly like jack of course william seemed small beside ritva and kari vaara william was a small but stronglooking man not slight but somehow feminine in his features and with an organists longfingered hands jack had his moms small hands and short square fingers william was wearing a longsleeved white dress shirt open at the throatthe organ pipes of the walcker from württemberg rising above him jack asked hannele and ritva about his fathers tattoos never saw them hannele said ritva agreed shed never seen them either in the bedroom jack saw blackandwhite photographs of hanneles and ritvas tattoosjust their naked torsos the hearts cut in half on their left breasts at least the tattoos were as hed remembered them but hannele had shaved her armpit hair her hands folded flat above her navel hid her birthmark from the photographer it was a mild surprise to see that they had other tattoos there was some music on hanneles hip and more musicit looked like the same musicon ritvas buttocks like the photos of their shared heart these were closeupsonly partial views but they were such different body types jack had no difficulty telling hannele and ritva apart whats the music he asked them we played it earlierbefore you came to the church ritva said its another piece william taught us a hymn he used to play in old st pauls sweet sacrament divine hannele told jack she began to hum it we only know the music not the words but its a hymn it sounded familiar perhaps hed heard it or had even sung it at st hildas jack knew hed heard his mom sing it in amsterdam in the redlight district if it was something his dad used to play at old st pauls it was probably anglican or scottish episcopal the old scratchers name almost didnt come up but hannelepointing to the blackandwhite photo of the tattoo on her hipjust happened to say it its not bad for a sami salo jack told hannele and ritva the story of the scary night at the hotel torni when sami salo had banged on the doornot to mention how samis noticeably younger wife that toughtalking waitress at salve had told alice she was putting sami out of business hannele was shaking her head againher short curly blond hair not moving samis wife was long gone before you and your mom came to town jack ritva said that waitress at salve was samis daughter her name was minna hannele told him she was williams friend one of your dads older women i always thought it was a peculiar relationship but minna had gone through some hard timeslike your dad she had a child out of wedlock and the child died as an infantsome upperrespiratory ailment your father wasnt looking for a girlfriend jack he was probably still in love with the dane ritva said minna was just a comfort to him i think thats all he thought he was good for to be a comfort to someone you know its that old christian ideayou find someone down on their luck and you help them certainly agneta nilsson whod taught william choral music in stockholmand jack how to skate on lake mälarenwas an older woman maybe agneta had been down on her luck too after all shed had a bad heart look were musicians jack your dad was first and foremost a musician hannele said im not claiming an artists license for how i livewilliam wasnt either but what sort of license was your mom taking there wasnt anything she didnt feel entitled to hannele the slut was his motherno matter what you say about her ritva said if somebody dumps you you move on hannele told jack your mom made a featurelength film out of it hannele ritva said weve seen all your movies jack we cant imagine how you turned out so normal jack didnt feel normal he couldnt stop thinking about the waitress with the fat armsminna sami salos daughter how her arms had jiggled how shed been a friend of his fathers so jacks mother had undermined even thata comfort relationship hannele doubted that his dad and minna had ever had sex ritva thought they probably had but what did it matter alice had convinced sami salo that his unlucky daughter could expect nothing but betrayal and heartbreak from william burns sami couldnt wait for alice and jack to go to amsterdam where william would be bound to follow it was true that sami salo was a scratcher even so he wasnt losing that much business to daughter alice as hannele and ritva explained to jack his mom tattooed mostly students at the hotel torni even welltodo students werent inclined to spend their money on tattoos most of the sailors still went to sami at that time sailors spent more money on tattoos than students did jack also learned that kari vaara traveledvaara was always giving concerts abroad william was what amounted to the principal organist at the johanneksen kirkko where he loved the church and the organ he loved his students at sibelius academy tooritva and hannele being two of the better ones william would have no students in amsterdam where his duties at the oude kerk were so demanding that he had no time for teaching too you mean the organtuning jack asked hannele and ritva the what jack explained what hed been told namely that his dads only real job in amsterdam was tuning the organ in the oude kerk which was indeed vast as kari vaara had described it but the organ was always out of tune william couldnt tune a guitar much less an organ ritva cried he only agreed to play the organ at the oude kerk if the church hired an additional organtuner hannele told jack there was already someone who tuned the organ before every concert butat your dads insistencethe new organtuner came almost every day ritva said it was every night hannele corrected her thats when jack knew who the additional organtuner had beenthe doughfaced youngster who alice had said was a child prodigy the young genius whod put baby powder on the seat of his pants so that he could more easily slide on the organ bench which was also vastfrans donker whod played for jack and his mom and whatever whores were on hand one night when he the child prodigy was supposed to be tuning the organ they say that in the oude kerk one plays to both tourists and prostitutes kari vaara had told alice and jack vaara was very proud of william hannele and ritva said vaara had called william his best student ever yet alice had wanted jack to see his father as a mere organtuner she had purposely discredited william in his sons eyes something happened in amsterdam jack said to hannele and ritva my dad stopped following ussomething must have happened hannele was shaking her head again the blond curls holding fast to her head the lawyer made a deal with your mother jack ritva said it was a hard deal but someone had to stop her it was no deal for william hannele said angrily it was the best deal for jack hannele ritva said i dont remember any lawyer jack told them what lawyer femke somebody i dont remember her last name hannele said she was some super divorce lawyershed been through some bigdeal divorce herself well it was almost funny that jack had thought femke was a prostitute thered been some preposterous story about her becoming a prostitute to embarrass her exhusband femke was rich as jack recalled yet shed become a whore what wouldnt you believe when you were four and your mom was the manager of your socalled memories begin with the cop jack ritva said there was a cophe was your dads best friend he got you out of therehe was your best friend too jack hannele said yes i remember him jack said he was a nice guy nico oudejans nicos eyes were a robinsegg blue and high on one cheekbone he had a small scar shaped like the letter l naturally i thought he was my mothers friend jack told hannele and ritva and i thought femke was a prostitute they were sitting on the leather couch in the living room with the darkness now fallen over the glowing dome of the church in the rock the two women flanked jack on the couch they put their arms around him jack your mother was a prostitute femke was just a lawyer hannele said my mom was a prostitute for just one night jack blurted out she took only one customera young boy she said he was a virgin the two women went on hugging him jack no ones a prostitute for just one night ritva said theres no such thing as a prostitute who takes only one customer jack hannele told jack not to mention one virgin we should all have dinner tonight ritva cried suddenly unless jack has a date hannele said teasing him i refuse to share jack with a date jack just sat on the leather couch staring at the darkness out the window from the look of him hes got a date ritva said yes hes got a date i can see it in his eyes hannele said im sorry jack told them he just didnt know how sorrynot yet the aerobics instructor was thirtyone weeks pregnant and expecting her second child same anonymous sperm donor jack asked as nonchalantly as the circumstances permitted they were both naked and in bed in his hotel room at the torni and marjaliisa was pressing jacks face against her big belly so that he could feel how a thirtyoneweekold fetus moved around in there no my husband died she explained we were planning to have a second child but it took me almost three years to get up the nerve to have the second one alone do you have a boy or a girl a fouryearold boy in the context of jacks return trip to the north sea almost everything about a fouryearold boy was interesting to him however he sensed that this wasnt the time and place to tell marjaliisa how sorry he was to miss meeting her son jack was leaving for amsterdam very early in the morning she said a friend was with the fouryearold giving the boy his supper and putting him to bed marjaliisa warned jack that she couldnt stay late it was unusual for her to stay out past her sons bedtime and she was always back home in her own bed when the boy woke up in the morning the athleticism of the thirtyoneweekold fetus was a marvel to jackless so the lovemaking of the aerobics instructor hed never been in bed with a pregnant woman jack had no idea what to expect he probably shouldnt have been concerned by how active marjaliisa wasthat is for a woman in her condition after all hed watched her lead the leaping women in the aerobics class and jack knew that most of the uncomfortablelooking positions hed seen in the schwangere girls magazine could not have been faked jack realized only later what he had wanted which was not to have sex with her but just to hold her while he fell asleep all he really desired was his hand on her big belly his hand imagining that there were two people he lovednot just a woman but also the child she was about to have it had been a great way to fall asleep the knock on the door was quiet at first then more insistent it was not a sami salo kind of knocking but one jack was able to incorporate into his dreamin the dream jack was a father marjaliisa are you there said a mans voice in the hall then he must have asked the same question in finnish the pregnant aerobics instructor had gone jack woke up alone in the bed he went into the bathroom and wrapped a towel around his waist there was a hotel torni envelope stuck to the mirror with a dab of his toothpaste it was a clever way for her to have left him a note he realized now that he must have been talking in his sleep my name is marjaliisa not michele whos michele jack crumpled up the envelope and threw it in the bathroom wastebasket clutching the towel around his waist he went to see who was at the door jack had a bad feeling that he already knew who it was marjaliisai know youre there the man was saying only a little more loudly until jack opened the door he didnt know that the man had brought the fouryearold with him but what else could the poor guy have done if you were a responsible father you didnt leave a fouryearold alone there was no question in jacks mind that the young man with the darkblond hair was marjaliisas husbandnot her dead husband either nor did the young man look like an anonymous sperm donor any doubts jack might have had were dispelled by the boy the fouryearold had his dads darkblond hair but the childs oval face and almondshaped eyes were exactly like his mothers i knew it marjaliisas husband said youre jack burns marjaliisa said she saw you at the gym shes not here jack told him the unhappy husband looked past jack into the disheveled room the little boy wanted his dad to pick him up the child was wearing slippersocks with reindeer on them and a ski parka over his pajamas jack stepped back into the room and the father carried his son inside the pillows and bedcovers were all in a heap the young husband stared at the bed as if he could discern the imprint of his pregnant wifes body on the rumpled sheets marjaliisa had told her husband that she had a latenight aerobics class at the gym but he found her gym bag in her closet after hed put the fouryearold to bed he had been tidying up the apartment and went to her closet to put some article of her clothing away and there was the gym bag the young man showed jack the piece of paper hed found in the bagjimmy stronach hotel tornibut hed guessed all along that jimmy stronach was jack burns she kept telling me theres a movie star in the gym and i look like a whale youre not even her favorite movie star but i suppose that doesnt matter her husband said the fouryearold wanted to get down his father looked distressed to see the boy climb onto the bed and burrow under the mound of pillows she didnt want a second child marjaliisas husband told jack the pregnancy was an accident but she blames me for it because i wanted to have more children the fouryearold was sleepylooking but he had found a way to amuse himself with the feather quilt and all the pillows the little boy moved in circles on all fours like an animal trying to bury itself jack assumed that the child didnt speak english and therefore couldnt understand themnot that the boy would have paid any closer attention to his dad and jack if theyd been speaking in finnish hes only four jack kept thinking jack hoped that the child wouldnt remember this adventurebeing woken up and taken to a hotel in the middle of the night in his pajamas or perhaps the boy would remember no more than what he was told about this night and why would his parents ever talk about it to him maybe only if the night became a turning point in his familys history which jack hoped it wouldnt shes probably gone home or she was on her way home and you just passed each other jack told marjaliisas husband who was looking more and more distraught the fouryearold was completely hidden from view under all the pillows and bedcovers in a muffled voice the little boy asked his father something he wants to use the bathroom the husband told jack sure jack said there was more finnishboth the language and the barrier of the bedcovers making the exchange incomprehensible jack could see that marjaliisas husband didnt want to touch the bed so jack helped the little boy get untangled from the feather quilt and all the pillows the fouryearold left the bathroom door open while he was peeing the boy was also talking to himself and singing thus jack must have followed his mother through those north sea ports peeing with the bathroom doors open talking to himself and singing remembering next to nothingor only what his mom told him had happened what she wanted him to remember im sorry jack said to the unhappy husband and father jack wasnt going to make it worse for the poor man by telling him that his wife had told jack her husband was dead or that she was pregnant this time with the help of an anonymous sperm donor who is jimmy stronach the young man asked jack jack explained that it was the name of a character in the movie he hoped to make next he didnt mention the pornstar part or that he was not just an actor in this movie but also the screenwriter the little boy came out of the bathroom jack hadnt heard the toilet flush and the fouryearold was disturbed about something it appeared he had peed in the leftinside pocket of his ski parka his father said some reassuringsounding things to him in finnish oh we all pee in our parka pockets from time to time jack imagined possibly jack burns had been a more aware fouryearold than marjaliisas little boy but jack doubted it the little boy wanted his father to pick him up again which his dad did the child snuggled his face against his fathers neck and closed his eyes as if he were going to fall asleep right there it was late no doubt the boy could have fallen asleep almost anywhere jack opened the hotelroom door for themhoping the husband wouldnt give one last look at the landscape of the abused bed but of course the betrayed man did as they were leaving the husband said to jack i guess jimmy stronach is the bad guy in this movie then they went down the hall with the little boy singing a song in finnish jack went into the bathroom and flushed the toilet noting that the fouryearold had peed all over the toilet seat like a lot of fouryearolds hed not lifted the seat before he peed jack kept telling himself that if marjaliisas son was a normal fouryearold and he certainly had behaved normally the boy would never remember this awful nightnot a moment of it jack had to look everywhere for the piece of paper with marjaliisas name and cellphone number on it when he managed to find it he called the number jack thought he should forewarn her that her husband and small son had paid him a visit when marjaliisa answered the phone she was at home and already knew that her husband and child were missing she sounded frantic jack told her that her husband had been visibly distressed but extremely well behaved jack also told her that her little boy had looked sleepy but that the child had seemed to understand none of it i wish youd told me the truth jack said the truth she cried what do you know about the truth it was dark all the way from the hotel torni to the airport which was some distance from helsinki it was very early in the morning but it looked like the middle of the night naturally it was raining a little after dawn when the plane took off jack could see patches of what looked like snow in the woods he was thinking that there was nothing more he wanted to know hed already learned too much about what had happened no more truth jack kept thinkinghed had enough truth for a lifetime he didnt really want to go to amsterdam but thats where the plane was going the deal jacks second time in amsterdam he stayed at the granda good hotel on the oudezijds voorburgwal about a twominute walk from the redlight district the rain had followed him from finland he walked through the district in the latemorning drizzle the tourists appeared to be discouraged by the rain the blatancy of the prostitutesin their underwear in their windows and doorwaysmade their business plain yet despite the obviousness of the undressed women the fouryearold whom jack had recently met in helsinki could have been persuaded that the women were advicegivers as jack himself had been persuaded no one was singing a hymn or chanting a prayer not one of the women had the appearance of a firsttimer or of someone who planned on being a prostitute for only one day the women would beckon to jack and smile but if their smiles werent instantly returnedif he just kept walking or wouldnt meet their gazethey quickly looked away he heard his name a few times only once as a question jack burns one of the prostitutes asked as he passed by he didnt turn his head or otherwise respond usually the jack burns seemed to be part of a declarative sentence but one he couldnt understandin dutch or in some other language that wasnt english not many of the women were dutch jack walked as far north as the zeedijk just to see for himself that tattoo theos old shop de rode draakthe departed red dragonwas indeed gone he easily found the small st olofssteeg but tattoo peters basement shop had moved many years ago to the nieuwebrugsteeg a nearby street jack saw the new tattoo parlor but he didnt go in when he asked one of the prostitutes what she knew about the shop she said that someone named eddie was in chargetattoo peters second son jack thought she said oh you mean eddie funk someone else would later tell jack suggesting that the eddie in the new shop wasnt actually related to tattoo peter but what did it matter whoever eddie was he couldnt help jack tattoo petereddies father or nothad died on st patricks day or so jack had read in an old tattoo magazine when he and leslie oastler were cleaning out daughter alice in toronto listen to this he remembered saying to mrs oastler tattoo peter was born in denmark i never knew he was a dane he actually worked for tattoo ole before moving to amsterdam so what leslie had said i never knew any of this jack had cried he drove a mercedesbenz i never saw it he walked with a canei never saw the cane i never saw him walk his wife was french a parisian singer people compared her to edith piaf i think alice told me he stepped on a mine mrs oastler had said thats how he lost his leg but she never told me hed shouted she never told you fuckall jack he remembered leslie saying jack walked around the oude kerk in the falling rain but he didnt go inside he didnt know why he was procrastinating the kindergarten next to the old church looked fairly new there were more prostitutes than he remembered on the oudekerksplein but the kindergarten children hadnt been there when jack and his mom had traipsed through the district jack had no difficulty finding the police station on the warmoesstraat but he didnt go inside the station either he wasnt ready to talk to nico oudejans assuming nico was still a policeman and jack could find him jack walked on the warmoesstraat in the direction of the dam square pausing at the corner of the sint annenstraatexactly where he and his mom and saskia and els had encountered jacob bril who had the lords prayer tattooed on his chest there was a tattoo of lazarus leaving his grave on brils stomach there were some things you didnt forget no matter how young you were when you saw them in the lords eyes you are the company you keep jacob bril had told alice what would you know about the lords eyes els had asked him or so jack rememberedif any of it was true the tattoo museum on the oudezijds achterburgwalmaybe a minutes walk from jacks hotelwas a warm and cozy place with more paraphernalia and memorabilia from the tattoo world than jack had seen in any other tattoo parlor he met henk schiffmacher at noon when the museum opened and henk showed him around henks tattoo shop was also therehanky pankys house of pain as it was called whoever eddie was in the new tattoo peter henk schiffmacher was the tattoo peter of his day everyone in the inkandpain business knew hanky panky henk was a big heavy guy with a bikers beard and long hair a female deaths head with what looked like a single breast on her forehead was breathing fire on his left biceps a spool of film was unwinding on his right forearm of course hanky panky had other tattoos his body was a road map of his travels but jack would remember these two best he watched henk give a japanese guy an irezumi of a cockroach on his neck irezumi means tattoo in japanese hanky panky had traveled everywhere japan the philippines singapore bangkok sumatra nepal samoa while henk tattooed the cockroach on the japanese guys neck jack listened to johnny cash sing rock of ages on the cd player a good tattoo shop was a whole universe hed heard his mother say a place where every desire is forgiven henk schiffmacher said why then couldnt jacks mom forgive his dad and how had william managed to forgive alice or had he jack thought that he couldnt forgive her is a guy named nico oudejans still a cop in the district jack asked hanky panky nico hes still the best cop in the district henk said nicos a frigging brigadier on jacob brils bony back was his favorite tattoo the ascensionchrist departing this world in the company of angels as jack walked through the redlight district to the warmoesstraat police station he remembered brils version of heaven as a dark and cloudy place it had stopped raining but the cobblestones were greasy underfoot and the skylike jacob brils heavenremained dark and cloudy jack burns heard his name a few more times wherever they were from some of the women in the windows and doorways were moviegoersor they had been moviegoers in a previous life jack crossed the bridge over the canal by the old church and came upon the small foulsmelling pissoira oneman urinalwhere he remembered peeing as a child it had been dark his mom had stood outside the barrier while he peed she kept telling him to hurry up she probably didnt want to be seen standing alone in the area of the oudekerksplein at night jack could hear drunken young men singing as he peed they must have been singing in english or he wouldnt have remembered some of the words in their song they were english football fans his mother would tell him later theyre the worst shed said thered been a football game which the english team had either lost or won it seemed to make no difference in regard to how their fans behaved in the redlight district they were filthy louts jack remembered saskia saying filthy louts wasnt in his moms vocabulary jack walked around the oude kerk once more on the side where the new kindergarten shared the street with the whores someone was following him a man had fallen into step behind him at the corner of the stoofsteeg almost as soon as jack had left the tattoo museum and the house of pain when jack slowed down the man slowed down tooand when jack sped up the man picked up his pace again a fan jack thought he hated it when they followed him if they came up and said hi i like your movies and then shook his hand and went on their waywell that was fine but the followers really irritated jack they were usually women not this one he was a toughlooking guy with a dirtyblond beard wearing running shoes and a windbreaker his hands were shoved into the pockets of the windbreaker as he walked his shoulders thrust forward as if it were still raining or he was cold a guy in his fifties maybelate forties anyway the man didnt make the slightest effort to pretend he wasnt following jack it was as if he were daring jack to turn around and face him jack doubted that the bastard would have the balls to follow him into the police station so he just kept walking jack was one small street away from the warmoesstraat when a brownskinned prostitute stepped out of her doorway in her underwear and high heels she almost touched him hey jackive seen you in the movies she said she had a spanishsounding accent she might have been dominican or colombian when she saw the man who was trailing jack she immediately put up her hands as if the man were pointing a gun at her she quickly stepped back inside her doorway that was when jack knew that the man following him was a cop clearly the dominican or colombian woman knew who the cop was she didnt want any trouble with him jack stopped walking and turned to face the policeman whose eyes were still a robinsegg blue and high on one cheekbone was the small identifying scar like the letter l the beard had fooled jack when the cop had been in his late twenties or early thirties when jack had first met him nico oudejans didnt have a beard jack had always thought that nico was a nice guy hed been very nice to jack when the boy was four now in his fifties nico looked just plain tough ive been expecting you jack for a few years now ive had my eye out for you i keep telling the ladies nico said with a nod to the dominican or colombian prostitute who was smiling in her doorway one day jack burns the actor will show up give me a call when you see him i keep telling them well nico said shaking jacks hand i got half a dozen calls today i knew at least one of the ladies had to be right when they turned onto the warmoesstraat the policeman put his hand on jacks shoulder and steered him to the rightalmost as if nico didnt trust jack to remember where the police station was were you coming to see me jack yes i was jack said so your moms dead nico asked jack assumed that nico had read about alices death because she was jack burnss mother her death had been reported in most of the movie magazines but nico oudejans didnt read those magazines the policeman had just guessed that jack wouldnt have come back to amsterdam if alice were still alive why jack asked him ill bet your mom would have talked you out of coming nico said she sure would have tried they went into the warmoesstraat station and climbed the stairs to a bare virtually empty office on the second floor there was just a table and three or four chairs and jack sat across the table from the policeman it was as if jack were going to be questioned about a crime jack thought it was funny that nico left the office door open as if they couldnt possibly have had anything private to discuss jack got the feeling that every cop in the building not only knew in advance everything he might ask nico oudejansthey had all the answers too maybe because he was with a cop jack just started talking he told nico everything as if all the deceits and deceptions of jacks childhood were his crime not his mothers as if what hed only recently learned was a story jack had somehow concealed from himself jack didnt even pause or interrupt himself when another policeman came into the office and put some money on the table in front of nico after that cop left a second and a third policeman came in and did the same thing maybe five or six cops did thissome in uniform others in plainclothes like nicobefore jack even got to the amsterdam part of the story when jack finally got to the amsterdam part he was pretty worked up while jack had talked nico had handrolled a few cigarettes he had some darklooking tobacco in a pouch and he went on carefully rolling the cigarettes as if he were alone jack had the impression that putting a cigarette together mattered more to nico than smoking it but now nico stopped making cigarettes there were not more than three or four cigarettes on the table the policeman hadnt lit one yet i thought mom did it for only one night jack said i thought there was just one kid probably a virgin he broke her pearl necklace nobody does it for only one night jack when i told her to stop or id have her deported she just kept doing it with alice they were always virgins at least they told her they were virgins or they looked like virgins but whyd she do it jack asked she had a job didnt she she was making money at tattoo peters and at tattoo theos alice had two pretty good jobs in fact and william was giving her money for jacks expensesthis in addition to whatever mrs wicksteed was sending her alice didnt need money however the one way she hadnt tried to make william come back to her was that she hadnt exposed jack to any risk she hadnt yet done something to herself that a child of his age shouldnt see but if she was a prostitute alice reasoned and if jack was exposed to thatwell how would it be for a boy growing up to remember his mother as a whore what if jack remembers that this is what you did to me she asked your dad nico oudejans told jack since you like prostitutes so much that you play for them william your mother said what if jack remembers how i became a whore because you stopped playing for me nico told jack that william played the organ for the prostitutes for strictly religious reasons he was a fanatical christian but the good kind of fanatic nico explained william had insisted that there be an organ service for the prostitutesat that early hour of the morning when many of them stopped working william wanted them to know that the oude kerk was theirs at that time and that he was playing for them he wanted them to come to the old church and be soothed by the music he wanted them to pray william wanted them to stop being prostitutes of course but the music was the only way he ever proselytized to them not everyone at the oude kerk was in favor of williams playing the organ for the prostitutes but he silenced most of his critics by citing the zeal of st ignatius loyola william burns said that hed encountered a greater evil in amsterdam than st ignatius had met on the streets of rome ignatius had raised money among rich people hed founded an asylum for fallen women it was in rome where the saint announced that he would sacrifice his life if he could prevent the sins of a single prostitute on a single night naturally some of the higherups at the old church expressed their doubtsafter all loyola was a catholic nico oudejans told jack among protestants your dad was sounding a little too close to rome for comfort but william said look im not trying to prevent the sins of a single prostitutealthough in his own way he was im just trying to make these women feel a little better and if some of them hear our lords noise in the music whats the harm in that our lords noise jack asked thats what william called it jack he used to say that if you could hear gods noise in the organ you were at heart a believer did it work jack asked were any prostitutes converted he made believers out of some of those women nico said but i dont think any of them stopped working as prostitutesat least not until long after your mother started some of the prostitutes didnt like your dadthey thought he was yet another christian dogooder who disapproved of them william had just found an odd way in which to disapprove but more of the ladies hated your mother they wouldnt let their own children anywhere near the redlight district but your mom dragged you through it every day and nightjust to drive your dad crazy you told her youd have her deported jack asked another policeman came into the office and put more dutch guilders on the table prostitutes who werent dutch citizens used to get deported all the time nico said but your dad didnt want her deported he didnt want to lose you jack at the same time he couldnt bear to see you in this environment jack asked about frans donker the organtuner nico said that donker had imitated or had tried to imitate everything william did donker had spent half his time trying to play the organ instead of tuning it and when your dad needed a good nights sleepwhen he was too tired to play for the ladies in the oudekerkspleinfrans played for them i think frans donker was a little simple maybe someone had dropped him on his head when he was a baby the policeman speculated but your dad treated donker like a helpless pet william indulged donker he pitied him he was always charitable to him not that donker deserved itthat boy didnt know what he was about he put baby powder on his ass jack remembered out loud donker even imitated your dads tattoos but badly nico said then he took a really stupid jobsomething only donker would dream of doingand we never saw him again in the district i think i know what donker did jack told the policeman he took a job on a cruise ship playing the piano he sailed to australia to be tattooed by cindy ray yes thats it nico oudejans cried what a memory you have jack thats a detail even a cop like me had forgotten jack also remembered the darkbrown woman from suriname she was one of the first prostitutes to speak to him hed been surprised that she knew his name shed been in a window on either the korsjespoortsteeg or the bergstraatnot in the redlight district but in that same general area where jack and his mom had met femke and hed thought that femke was an unusual prostitute when in fact she was a lawyer the surinamese prostitute had given him a chocolate the color of her skin ive been saving this for you jack shed said and hed believed for years that she must have been one of his dads girlfriendsone of the prostitutes whod taken william home with her and had slept with him as jacks mother had led the boy to believe but that wasnt true jacks father had not had sex with a prostitute in amsterdam william had only played the organ for them a sound both huge and holy which had compelled them to just listen as for some of themthose whod managed to hear the lords noise in the musicwilliam may have saved them from the sins of a single night albeit later in their lives when a few of them did stop being prostitutes i called your dad the protestant loyola which seemed to please him nico oudejans told jack nico also told jack that the surinamese prostitute was one of williams earliest converts to christianity shed heard gods noise in the organ and had become an overnight believer jack had lost count of how many policemen had come into the office and put their guilders on the table in front of nico but when another cop had come and gone jack asked nico if he had won a bet on a game or a horse i won a bet on you jack the policeman said i bet every cop in district two that one day before i retired jack burns would walk into the warmoesstraat station and wed have this little talk about his mom and dad the next evening wednesday jack went with nico to the oude kerk to hear willem vogel the organist rehearse vogel had officially retired from teaching and conducting but he still wrote music for organ and choira cd of his compositions had recently been releasedand he still played in the oude kerk the long service on sunday and the wednesdayevening rehearsal willem vogel was in his late seventies but looked younger he had long hairless hands and was wearing a sweater with sagging elbows in the unheated church a wool scarf was tied around his neck jack had correctly remembered the narrow bricklined stairs leading to the organists hidden chamber above the congregation the wooden handrail was on one side as you climbed a waxed rope the color of burned caramel was on the other there was a bare bright unshaded lightbulb behind the leathercovered organ bench it cast the perfect shadowless light upon the yellowed pages of the music vogels wellworn shoes made a soft tapping on the foot pedals his long fingers made an even softer clicking on the keys jack could hear only the drone of the choir in the distant background when the organ was soft or not playing when vogel played hard you could barely hear the accompanying voices from the organ chamber at a moment when the choir sang without him vogel opened a small piece of hard candyneatly putting the paper wrapper in his pocket before popping the candy in his mouth the names printed on the stops the registers were meaningless to jack it was a world beyond him baarpijp voet octaaf voet nachthoorn voet tremulant positief jack struggled to hear the lords noise in the music but even when vogel played the sanctus and the agnus dei the lord wasnt speaking to jack willem vogel had never met jacks dad once in vogel had been out to dinner rather late with some friends one of the friends suggested that they go to the oude kerk and listen to william burnss concert for the fallen ladies but vogel was tired and declined the invitation i regret i never heard him play the organist told jack some say he was marvelous others say that william burns was too much of an entertainer to be taken seriously as a musician the next morning jack went with nico oudejans to a café where they were meeting saskia for coffee saskia had stopped being a prostitute more than ten years before her retirement hadnt improved her disposition nico forewarned jack shed gone to a school for beauticians and had learned how to cut hair maybe also how to do makeup and manicures she worked in a beauty shop on the rokina wide busy street with many mediumexpensive shops saskia hadnt wanted nico and jack to come to the beauty shop given her former line of work even a friendly visit from the police was unwelcome and saskia feared thatin a beauty shop of all placesthe ladies would make too much of a fuss over her knowing jack burns when jack saw her coming he thought shed had more than a career change shed had a whole makeover gone was the winking armload of bracelets hiding her burn scar in her fifties now she was still thin but the gauntness had left her face there wasnt a trace of the comeon of her former profession about her saskias hair was cut as short as a boys over a white turtleneck she wore what looked like a mans tweed jacket her baggy jeans were unflattering her anklehigh boots with a low heel gave her a mannish walk jack got to his feet and kissed her but saskia was a little cool to himnot unfriendly but not warm either she was only marginally friendlier to nico she was carrying a yorkshire terrier in her oversize handbag the dog and nico appeared to be old friends the yorkie hopped out of saskias handbag and sat contentedly in nicos lap while the waiter took saskias order jack half expected her to order a hamandcheese croissant but she asked for a coffee instead he wasnt surprised that shed had her teeth fixed why wouldnt a new mouth have been included in her makeover i know why youre here jack and it doesnt interest me saskia began i dont go along with it jack didnt say anything everyone took your dads side but i hate men and i liked your mom besides i wasnt working in the district to take time out to go to church and listen to him play his bleedingheart organ i remember bringing you hamandcheese croissants jack told her he was trying to calm her down because she sounded angry your father hung out therethat was where your mother let him see you when she was buying a bloody hamandcheese croissant i think i would die on the spot if i ever ate another one you and els took turns being my babysitter jack asked her your mom helped els and me pay the rent on our rooms she answered alice paid part of elss rent and part of mine the three of us shared two rooms it made sense businesswise and mom admitted only virgins he asked some of those boys had been with half the ladies in the district it only mattered to alice that they looked like virgins saskia said did she honestly believe that my dad would get back together with her just to stop her from being a prostitute she believed that your dad would do almost anything to protect youto give you the life he thought you should have which wasnt a life in the redlight district saskia said it was the fuckhead lawyer who worked out a way to make your mother stop being a prostitute you didnt like the lawyer jack asked he remembered how saskia and els had screamed at femke how hed thought that els and femke had come close to having a physical fight femke was as much of an asshole dogooder as your fucking father jack on the one hand she was this outspoken advocate for prostitutes rights on the other hand she wanted us all to go back to school or learn another profession what was the deal that she offered mom femke told your mother to get off the street and take you back to canada your dad wouldnt follow you this time femke promised if your mom would put you in a good schoolif she kept you in schoolyour dad would pay for everything but your mother was tough she told femke that your father had to promise he would never seek even partial custody of you and he had to promise that he wouldnt look you up not even when you were oldernot even if alice was dead but why would my dad promise that he opted to keep you safe jackeven if it meant he could never make contact with you nico oudejans said if your mom couldnt have your dad then he couldnt have you saskia said it was that simple listen jackyour mother would have slashed her throat and bled to death in front of you just to teach your fucking father a lesson what lesson was that jack cried that he should never have left her listen jack saskia said again i admired your mom because she put a price tag on his leaving hera high one most women can never be paid enough for the terrible things men do to them but what terrible thing did he do to her jack asked saskia he just left her he didnt abandon me he gave her money for my education and for my other expenses you cant get a woman pregnant and then change your mind about her and not have it cost you jack saskia said just ask your father nico hadnt said anything since telling jack that his dad had opted to keep him safe saskia like alice had clearly chosen revenge over reason do you cut mens hair too jack asked her or just womens he was trying to calm himself down a little saskia smiled shed finished her coffee she made a kissing sound with her lips and the yorkshire terrier sprang out of nicos lap and into her arms she put the tiny dog back in her handbag and stood up from the table just womens she told jack still smiling but now that youre all grown up jackie boy if you ever want someone to cut your balls off just ask me i guess she didnt learn the castration part in beauty school nico oudejans said after theyd watched saskia walk away she didnt once turn to wave she just kept going what about els jack asked nico i suppose you know whats happened to her too fortunately for you nico said els has a somewhat sweeter disposition shes not cutting hair jack asked youll see the policeman said everyone has a history jack nico led jack past the damrak away from the redlight district they wound their way through streams of shoppersacross the nieuwendijk to the tiny sint jacobsstraat where els occupied a secondfloor apartment her window with the red light was a little uncommon for a prostitutes window not solely for being outside the district but because her room was above streetlevel yet when jack considered that els had taken an overview of her life in prostitutionshed grown up on a farm and took an overview of life on a farm as wellhe thought that els in her window above the street was where she belonged during the day she greeted passersby with boisterous affection but nico told jack that els was more judgmental at night if you were a drunk or a drug addict pissing in the street she would turn her policeissue flashlight on you and loudly condemn your bad manners on the sint jacobsstraat els was still a prostitute but she was also a selfappointed sheriff drugs had changed the redlight district and driven her out of it alcohol and drugs had killed her only children two young mentheyd both died in their twenties jack had been wrong to think that els was about his mothers age or only a little older even from streetlevel looking up at her he could tell she was a woman in her seventies when jack had been a fouryearold els would have been in her forties jackie els called blowing him kisses my little boy has come back she announced to the sint jacobsstraat jackie jackiecome give your old nanny a hug you too nico you can give me a hug if you want to they went up the staircase to her apartment the windowroom was only a small part of the place which was spotlessly cleanthe smell of all the rooms dominated by the coffee grinder in the kitchen els had a housekeeper a much younger woman named marieke who immediately began grinding beans for coffee as a former farm girl els hated cleaning chores but she knew the importance of a tidy house she shared the prostitute duties with another girl she explained to jack the women took turns using the windowroom although petra the other prostitute didnt live in the apartment petras the young one im the old one els exclaimed happily jack didnt meet petra but nico told him she was sixtyone els who claimed to be about seventyfive said that most of her regular customers were morning visitors they take naps in the afternoon and theyre too old to go out at night the only customers who visited her at night were the ones off the streetthat is if they happened to be passing by when els was sitting in her upstairs window for the most part she let petra sit in the window at night im usually asleep els admitted giving jacks forearm a squeeze or i go to the moviesespecially if its one of your movies jackie els had always been a big woman with an impressive bust her bosom preceded her with the authority of a great ships prow her hips rolled when she walked she was massive but not fat although jack noticed how her forearms and the backs of her upper arms saggedand she walked with a slight limp she had a bad heart she claimedand perhaps an embolism in the brain els pointed ominously to her head she still wore a platinumblond wig every day jackie she said kissing his cheek i take so many pills i lose count els had landlord problems too she wanted nico to know maybe the police could do something about the buildings new owner like shoot him she told nico with a smile kissing him on the cheekthen kissing jack again thered been a rent dispute and a tax issue the new landlord was a prick in her opinion els was a longstanding spokesperson for the prostitutes union she regularly spoke to high school students about the lives of prostitutes the students many of them only sixteen had questions for her about firsttime sex years ago shed had a husband shed been married for three years before her husband found out she was a whore she had a bruise on her face nico asked her if she was getting over a black eyeperhaps something one of her offthestreet customers had given her no no she said my customers wouldnt dare hit me els had gotten into a fistfight at a café on the nes just off the dam square shed run into a former prostitute who wouldnt speak to her some holierthanthou cunt she said you should see her face nico jack thought that the holierthanthou subject might make a good starting point for a conversation about his father els had not only known him unbeknownst to alice els had often gone to the oude kerk in the wee hours of the morning to hear william play the organ jack gathered that els had not heard any racket from the lordjust the music to his surprise els told jack that she had taken him to the old church one night i thought that even if you didnt remember hearing william play some part of you might absorb the sound she said but i had to carry you thereyou were asleep the whole wayand you never woke up or took your head off my breast the entire time you slept through a twohour concert jackie you never heard a note i dont know what you could possibly remember of any of it not much he admitted jack knew how hidden the organists chamber in the oude kerk was he knew that his father would never have seen him sleeping on the big prostitutes bosomwhich was probably just as well knowing his dads opinion of what nico had called this environment because saskia and alice were more popularbecause they had more customers els informed jackels was jacks babysitter what she called his nanny most of the time and i was stronger than your mom or saskia so i got to carry you she exclaimed she had lugged him from bed to bed i used to think you were like one of usone of the prostitutes she told jack because you never went to bed just once because i was always taking you out of one bed and tucking you into another i remember that you and femke almost came to blows he said i could have killed her i should have killed her jackie els cried but femke was the dealmaker and something had to be done its just that it was a bad dealthats what made me so mad lawyers dont care about whats fair whats a good deal to a lawyer is any deal that both parties will agree to something had to be done elsas you say nico said fuck you nico els told him just drink your coffee it was good coffee marieke had made them some cookies too did my dad see me leave amsterdam jack asked els he saw you leave rotterdam jackie he watched the ship sail out of the harbor femke had brought him to the docks shed driven him to rotterdam in her car saskia would have none of it she accompanied your mom and me and you to the train station in amsterdam but that was as much drama as she would tolerate that was saskias word for the goodbye businessdrama she called it so you took the train to rotterdam with us i went with you to the docks i got you both on board jackie your mom wasnt in much better shape than your dad it seemed to be just dawning on her that she wouldnt see william after that day although the deal was what she said she wanted you saw my dad at the docks fucking femke wouldnt get out of the car but your dad did els said he just cried and cried he fell apart he lay down on the ground i had to pick him up off the pavement i had to carry him back to the fuckhead lawyers mercedes did tattoo peter really have a mercedes jack asked her femke had a better one jackie els said she drove william back to amsterdam in her mercedes i took the train from rotterdam in my minds eye i kept seeing you wave from the ship you thought you were waving to mei was waving back of coursebut it was your father you were really waving goodbye to some deal huh nico she asked the policeman sharply something had to be done els he said again fuck you nico the old prostitute once more told him when jack got back to the grand two faxes were waiting for him it didnt help that he read them in the wrong order he began with a surprising suggestion from richard gladstein a movie producer bob bookman had sent gladstein the script for the slushpile reader dear jack stay where you are in amsterdam what do you say we have a meeting with william vanvleck i know youve worked with wild bill before it strikes me that the slushpile reader is a kind of remake maybe right up the remake monsters alley think about it the story is a remade porn film but not a porn film right we wouldnt show anything pornographic but the very idea of james jimmy stronachs relationship with michele maher is a little pornographic isnt it hes too big shes too small brilliant we should discuss but first tell me your thoughts on the mad dutchman as it happens hes in amsterdam and youre in amsterdam if you like the idea of vanvleck as a director i could meet you there richard everything became clearer when jack read the second fax which he should have read first it was from bob bookman at caa dear jack richard gladstein loved your script of the slushpile reader he wants to discuss possible directors with you richard has the crazymaybe not so crazyidea of using wild bill vanvleck call me call richard bob jack was so excited that he called richard gladstein at home waking him up it was very early in the morning in la wild bill vanvleck was in his late sixties maybe his early seventies hed moved back to amsterdam from beverly hills no one in hollywood had asked him to direct a picture for a couple of years the remake monster had sold his ugly mansion on loma vista drive something had gone wrong with his whippets jack remembered the skinny little dogs running free in the mansion slipping and falling on the hardwood floors something bad had happened to wild bills chef and gardener the surinamese couple someone had drowned in vanvlecks swimming pool richard gladstein told jack richard couldnt remember if it was the childsize woman from suriname or her miniature husband possibly the drowning victim had been one of the whippets so the mad dutchman was back in amsterdam where he was living with a much younger woman vanvleck had a hit series on dutch tv from richard gladsteins description wild bill had remade miami vice in amsterdams redlight district richard talked about the difficulty of bringing miramax around to the idea of hiring william vanvleck to direct the slushpile readerthat is assuming richard and jack had a good meeting with the mad dutchman but the idea gladstein and jack agreed had possibilities bob bookman had already overnighted jacks screenplay to wild bill richard and jack also talked about the idea of lucia delvecchio in the michele maher role shed have to lose about twenty pounds jack told richard shed love to gladstein said there was little doubt of that jack thought there were a lot of women in hollywood who wanted to lose twenty poundsthey just needed a reason the more he thought about wild bill vanvleck the better jack liked the idea what had always been wrong with the remake monsters material was the material itselfnamely wild bills screenplays not only how hed ripped them off from other better material but how he went too far he always pushed the parody past reasonable limits if youre irreverent about everything the audience is left with nothing or no one to like conversely there was sympathy in emmas storyboth for the toosmall slushpile reader and for the porn star and bad screenwriter with the big penis vanvleck had never directed a sympathetic script before jack wished he could ask emma what she thought of the idea but he didnt think that his working with wild bill vanvleck as a director would necessarily make emma roll over in her grave jack went back out in the rain he passed the casa rosso where they showed porn films and had livesex showsmore advicegiving jack had once believed he wasnt tempted to see a show not even as research for the slushpile reader he walked once more to the warmoesstraat police station but nico was out working in the redlight district a couple of young cops both in uniform told jack that they thought william vanvlecks tv series about homicide policemen was reasonably authentic wild bill had spent time in the warmoesstraat station hed gone out in the district with real cops on the beat it was a favorable sign that real policemen actually liked a tv series about cops jack worked out at a gym on the rokin it was a good gym but the music was too loud and relentless it made him feel he was rushing though he was taking his time his appointment with femke which nico had arranged wasnt until four oclock that afternoon he was in no hurry when jack returned to the grand from the gym nico oudejans had left a package at the reception deska videocassette of vanvlecks homicide series jack showered and shaved put on some decent clothes and went out again the address of marinus and jacob poortvliets law firm was on the singel femke their mother was retired jack saw at once how easy it had been for his mom to confuse him into thinking that femke occupied a prostitutes room on the bergstraat the poortvliets law office was roughly halfway between the bergstraat and the korsjespoortsteegvirtually around the corner from those streets where the more upscale prostitutes were in business some small details about the office were familiar both the cars on the singel and the pedestrians on the sidewalk were visible from the leather reading chair and the big leather couch on the walls of the office a few of the landscapes were also familiar jack even remembered the rug an oriental femke was late jack talked with her sons conservatively dressed gentlemen in their fifties theyd been university students in but even people of their generation remembered the controversial organist william burns whod played for the prostitutes in the oude kerk in the earlymorning hours university students had made the organ concerts in the old church a favorite among their latenight outings some of us considered your father an activist a social reformer after all he expressed a profound sympathy for the prostitutes plight marinus told jack others took a view that was common among some of the prostitutesim referring to those women who were not in williams audience at the old church william was a holy roller in their eyes converting the prostitutes meant nothing less than steering them away from prostitution jacob explained but he played great marinus said no matter what you thought of william he was a terrific organist the poortvliets had a familylaw practice they not only took divorce and childcustody cases but they also settled inheritance disputes and were engaged in estate planning what had made william burnss case difficult was that he was still a citizen of scotland although he had a visa that permitted him to work in holland for a limited period of time alice who was a canadian citizen had no such visabut in the case of foreigners who were apprenticed to dutch tattoo artists the police allowed them several months to earn a taxfree living after that they were pressured to leave or pay dutch taxes there could be no childcustody case in the dutch courts because jacks mom and dad werent dutch citizens as outrageously as his mother was exposing jack to her new life as a prostitute his father had no means to claim custody of the boy alice however could be made to leave the countrychiefly on the grounds that as a prostitute she had repeatedly engaged in sex with underage boys and she was a magnet for more widespread condemnation within the prostitute community as if the hymnsinging and prayerchanting in her window and doorway werent inflammatory enough alice had dragged her fouryearold through the district you were carried day and night in the arms of that giantess among the whores marinus poortvliet told jack half the time you were asleep or as inert as groceries his brother jacob said the prostitutes called you the whole weeks shopping because in that womans arms you looked like a bag of groceries that could feed a family for a week marinus explained so dutch law had the means to deport my mom but not to gain custody of me for my dad jack said just to be sure the two sons nodded that was when femke arrived and jack once again felt intimidated by hernot because she was a fearsome and different kind of prostitute but because she struck him as a great initiator no matter what experience you thought youd had femke could initiate you into something youd never known or even imagined when i look at you in your movies she said to jack without bothering to say hello i see someone as pretty and talented as your father but not half so openso utterly unguarded youre very much guarded arent you jack burns she asked seating herself in the leather reading chair and jack had once thought shed taken up that position in her sidewalk window to attract customers off the street thank you for seeing me jack said to her very much guarded isnt he she asked her sons not expecting so much as a nod or a shake of the head from either of them it wasnt a real question femke had already decided upon the answer at seventyeight only a couple of years older than els femke was still shapely without being fat her elegance of dress which she had seemingly been born with made it abundantly clear to jack that only an idiot or a fouryearold could ever have mistaken her for a whore her skin was as unwrinkled as the skin of a wellcaredfor woman in her fifties her hair which was her own was a pure snowwhite if only youd been dutch i would have got your dad custody of you in a heartbeat jack i would have happily sent your mother back to canada childless femke said the problem was your father forgave her he would forgive her anything if she just promised to do the right thing by you meaning good schools a safe neighborhood and some vestige of stability jack asked those arent bad things are they femke said you seem to be both educated and alive i daresay in the direction your mom was headed that wouldnt have happened here besides she was at least beginning to accept that william would never come back to herthat began to happen in helsinki but that william would accept the pain of losing all contact with youif alice would just take you back to canada and look after you as a mother shouldwell what a surprise that was to your mother and to me we didnt expect him to agree to it but wed both underestimated what a good christian william was femke did not say christian in an approving way i was just the negotiator jack i wanted to drive a harder bargain for your dad but what can you do when the warring parties agree is a deal not a deal you drove him to the docks in rotterdam jack asked her they both went along with it right till the end femke looked out the window at the slowly passing traffic on the singel your little face on the ships deck was the only smiling face i saw jack your mother had to hold you up so you could see over the rail you were waving to that giant whore the way your dad dropped to the ground i thought hed had a heart attack i thought id be taking a body back to amsterdamin all likelihood in the backseat of my mercedes the big prostitute picked him up and carried him to my car she carried him as easily as she used to carry you mind you i still thought your dad was dead i didnt want william in the front seat but thats where the huge whore put him i could see then that he was alive but barely what have i done how could i what am i femke your father asked me youre a flaming christian william you forgive too much i told him but the deal was done and your dad was the only man on earth who would stick to his side of a bargain like that from the look of you jack your mom stuck to her side of the bargain toosort of at that moment jack hated them bothhis mother and his father in his moms case the reasons were pretty obvious in his dads case jack suddenly saw him as a quitter william burns had given up on his son jack was furious femke a retired lawyer but a good one could see the fury on jacks face oh get over it dont be a baby she told him whats a grown man in good health doing wallowing around in the past just move on jack get married try being a good husbandand be a good father to your children with any luck youll see how hard it is stop judging themi mean william and your mother from the way her two grown sons fussed over her jack could tell that they adored her femke once more looked out the window there was something final about the way she turned her face in profile to jack as if their meeting were over and she had nothing more to say nico oudejans had asked her to see jack and she probably had a fair amount of respect for nicomore than she had for jack shed done her duty her face in profile said femke wasnt freely going to offer jack more information if i could just ask you if you know what happened to himstarting with where he went jack said to her i assume he didnt stay in amsterdam of course william didnt stay she said not when he could imagine you on every street cornernot when your mothers image was engraved in the lewd posture of every prostitute in every gaudy window and dirty doorway in the district jack didnt say anything by their imploring glances and gestures femkes sons were urging him to be patient if he just waited the old woman out jack would get what hed come foror so femkes sons seemed to be saying hamburg femke said what organist doesnt want to play in one of those german churchesmaybe even somewhere bach himself once played it was inevitable that william would go to germany but there was something special about hamburg i cant remember now he said he wanted to get his hands on a herbert hoffmanna famous organ probably jack took some small pleasure in correcting her she was that kind of woman a famous tattooist not an organ he told femke i never saw your dads tattoos thank god femke said dismissively i just liked to listen to him play jack thanked femke and her sons for taking the time to see him he took a passing look at the prostitutes in their windows and doorways on the bergstraat and the korsjespoortsteeg before he walked back to the grand this time avoiding the redlight district jack was glad he had the videocassette of wild bill vanvlecks homicide series to look at because he didnt feel like leaving the hotel there was more than one episode from the television series on the videocassette jacks favorite one was about a former member of the homicide team an older man who goes back to police school at fiftythree his name is christiaan winter and hes just been divorced hes estranged from his only childa daughter in universityand hes taking a training course for policemen on new methods of dealing with domestic violence the police used to be too lenient with the perpetrators now they arrested them of course the dialogue was all in dutch jack had to guess what they were saying but it was a characterdriven storyjack knew christiaan winter from an earlier episode when the policemans marriage was deteriorating in the episode about domestic violence winter becomes obsessed with how much of it children see the statistics all point to the fact that children of wifebeaters end up beating their wives and children who are beaten become childbeaters the social message wasnt new to jack but vanvleck had connected it to the cops personal life while winter never beat his wife the verbal abusewinters and his wifesno doubt damaged the daughter one of the first cases of domestic violence that christiaan winter becomes involved in ends in a homicidehis old business in the end he is reunited with his former team vanvlecks homicide series was more in the vein of understated realism than anything on american television there was less visible violence and the sexual content was more frank nor did happy endings find their unlikely way into any of the episodeschristiaan winter is not reunited with his family the best he can manage is a civil conversation with his daughter in a coffeehouse where he is introduced to her new boyfriend we can tell that the veteran policeman doesnt care for the boyfriend but he keeps his thoughts to himself in the last shot after his daughter gives him a kiss on the cheek winter realizes that the boyfriend has left some money on the table for the coffee this was noir warm which was wild bill at his bestat least this is what jack said to nico oudejans when nico called and asked jack his opinion of vanvlecks series nico liked the series too nico didnt ask jack how the meeting with femke had gone nico knew femke as a good cop he knew every detail of daughter alices story too jack told nico about herbert hoffmann being a tattoo artist not an organ naturally nico asked if jack was going to hamburg he wasnt jack knew actors may be more highly skilled at lying than other people but they are no more adept at lying to themselvesand even actors should know better than to lie to cops what more do i need to know jack asked nico who didnt answer him the policeman just kept looking at jacks eyesthen at his hands then at his eyes again jack began to speak more rapidly to nico jacks thoughts were more runon than consecutive but the cop didnt question him jack said that he hoped for his fathers sake that william had another family jack wouldnt invade his fathers privacy after all william hadnt invaded jacks besides jack knew that herbert hoffmann had retired alice had revered hoffmann but jack would leave herbert hoffmann in peace too so what if hoffmann had almost surely met william burns now that youre getting close maybe youre afraid to find him jack nico said it was jacks turn not to say anything he just tried to look unafraid maybe youre afraid that youll cause your father pain or that he wont want to see you the policeman said dont you mean that ill cause him more pain jack asked now that youre getting close maybe you dont want to get any closerthats all im saying jack maybe jack said he didnt feel like much of an actor anymore jack burns was a boy whod never known his father a boy whose father had been kept from him maybe what jack was really afraid of was losing his missing father as an excuse thats what claudia would have told him but nico said nothing more if william had wanted a herbert hoffmann jack thought he knew which kind he imagined it was one of hoffmanns sailing shipsoften seen sailing out of port or in the open sea on a long voyage sometimes there was a dark lighthouse and the ship was headed for rocks herbert hoffmanns sailors grave was among his most famous there were his last port and his letzte reise or last trip too in most cases hoffmanns ships were sailing into danger or unknown adventures the feeling the tattoos gave you was one of farewell although herbert hoffmann had done his share of homewardbound tattoos as well a homeward bound would not have been his fathers choice jack was thinking on the ship that had carried jack away from his dad jack sensed there would have been more of a sailors grave or a farewell feelingat least from williams point of view a ship leaving harbor conveys an uncertain future or else william burns had stuck to music on his skin jack could imagine that too there was a nonstop flight from los angeles to amsterdama little more than ten hours in the air richard gladstein was going to be tired he would leave la at in the afternoon and land in amsterdam at in the morning the next day jack assumed that richard would want to take a nap before they met vanvleck for dinner that evening for two days jack didnt leave his hotel room except to go to the gym on the rokin he lived on room service he wrote pages and pages to michele maher he came up with nothing he would send to her but the stationery at the grand was both more plentiful and more attractive than that at the hotel torni jack did manage to come up with a clever way of asking michele maher the fullbody tattoo questionthat is dermatologically speaking dear michele as a dermatologist can you think of any reason why a person with a fullbody tattoo might feel cold please return the stamped selfaddressed postcardchecking the appropriate box yours jack on a postcard of the oudezijds voorburgwal canal he gave michele the following options o no o yes lets talk about it love michele of course he didnt send that letter or the postcard for one thing he didnt have a us stamp for the return delivery for another the love michele was taking a lot for granted after fifteen years his second day alone jack almost went to see els again in her apartment on the sint jacobsstraat he didnt want to sleep with a prostitute in her seventieshe just liked els mainly jack would lie awake at nightimagining his little face on the ships deck where his mother had lifted him above the rail jack was just smiling and waving to beat the band while the damage was being done around himespecially to his dad in hamburg maybe william had met someone that might have helped him to forget jack if hed ever managed to forget his son after all hed had a correspondence with miss wurtz when jack was attending st hildas it wasnt as if william had stopped thinking about jack cold when richard arrived he went straight to bed and jack went back to the gym jack was eating more carbs and had changed his weightlifting routine hed managed to put on a few pounds but jack was still no jimmy stronach not that there was anything he could have done to acquire jimmys penis in the gym on the rokin possibly in a failing effort to drown out the awful music in the weight room jack tried singing that ditty his mother had sung only when she was drunk or stonedthe one that seemed to resurrect her scottish accent oh ill never be a kittie or a cookie or a tail the one place worse than dock place is the port o leith jail no ill never be a kittie of one true thing im sure i wont end up on dock place and ill never be a hure how funny that it had once been alices mantra to never be a whore jack thought of their nightly prayer whichwhen he was a childthey usually said together he remembered one night in amsterdam when she fell asleep before he did and he said the prayer by himself jack had spoken a little louder than usual because he had to pray for the two of them the day thou gavest lord is ended thank you for it of course that had probably happened more than once jack took a footbridge across the canal on his way back to the grand he stood on the bridge and watched a sightseeing boat drift by in the stern a small boy sat looking up at the footbridgehis face pressed to the glass jack waved but the boy didnt wave back it was already dark when jack walked with richard gladstein to the herengracht to a restaurant called zuid zeeland where they were meeting william vanvleck jack was in no mood for the meeting he kept thinking about the other williamthe one he would have loved but was afraid to meet v dr garcía therapy five years lateras if striking the match that would set fire to jacks life in los angeles strip his character bare and ultimately lead him to seek his fathera young woman younger than he realized at the time sat not quite fully clothed on jacks livingroom couch in that forlorn dump he still lived in on entrada drive she was thumbing through his address book which shed picked up off his desk and reading aloud the womens names in an insinuating tone of voice she would first say the name and then guess what relationship jack might have had or still had with the woman this juvenile behavior should have alerted him to the fact that she was clearly younger than shed told him she wasnot that jack shouldnt have guessed her real age for other reasons but he did have difficulties with math she got into the gs before jack said thats enough and took his address book away from her thats when the trouble really started elena garcía the girl had just said your cleaning lady or former cleaning lady you definitely fucked her elena garcíadr garcíawas jacks psychiatrist he had never had sex with her for five years dr garcía had not once been a love interestbut jack had never depended on anyone to the degree that he depended on her elena garcía knew more about jack burns than anyone had ever knownincluding emma oastler jack had often called dr garcía in tears not always but sometimes in the middle of the night hed called her from cannesonce when he was at a party at the hôtel du cap that same day jack had pushed a female photographer a stalker paparazzo off a chartered yacht hed had to pay an outrageous fine another time he banged some bimbo on the beach of the hotel martinez she said she was an actress but she turned out to be one of those croisette dogwalkers shed been arrested for fucking on the beach before and jack should have won the palme dor for bad behavior for the fracas he got into in that glassandconcrete eyesore the palais des festivals this happened after the evenings redcarpet promenade jack was on a narrow staircase leading to one of the palaiss upstairs rooms some journalist shoved him into one of those thugs who comprise the festivals security staff the security guy thought that jack had purposely shoved him which led to jacks impromptu lateral drop chenko would have been proud of jack for the perfect execution of his movecoaches clum hudson and shapiro toobut the incident was in all the papers the security thug broke his collarbone and jack got another stiff fine the weaselly french lastly from his oceanfront suite at the carlton jack poured a whole bottle of taittinger chilled onto that former agent lawrence the fink was giving jack the finger from the terrace lawrence was just the kind of asshole you ran into at cannes jack hated cannes from dr garcías point of view jacks behavior was only marginally better in venice deauville and torontothe three film festivals where richard gladstein wild bill vanvleck lucia delvecchio and jack promoted the slushpile reader a recent headline in varietylots of libido on the lidocould have been written about jack burns they had a very good run with what jack would usually call emmas movie careerwise it may have been jacks best year they shot the film in the fall of and took it to those festivals in august and september of before the premieres in new york and london near the end of that year there was the unfortunate incident with lucia delvecchio in the hotel des bains in venice shed had too much to drink and bitterly regretted having slept with jack but no one knewnot even richard or wild bill and no one except lucias husband who was not in venice would have cared bad things happened in that languid lagoon dont be so hard on yourself jack told lucia the whole city is sinking visconti shot death in venice in the hotel des bains i think he knew what he was doing but it was mostly jacks fault lucia had been drunk he knew she was married that precipitated another call to dr garcía he called her from the hotel normandie in deauville too it wasnt lucia that time worse it was an older member of the jury the olderwoman thing again dr garcía had asked jack on the phone i guess so hed told her jack was with mrs oastler at the toronto film festival when they screened the slushpile reader in roy thomson halla packed house a triumphant night it was gratifying to show the film in emmas hometown but leslie had a new girlfriend a blonde who didnt like jack the blonde wanted him to remove all his clothes from mrs oastlers house jack didnt think leslie cared whether he left his clothes in her house or not but the blonde wanted him and his things gone jack was in mrs oastlers familiar kitchen when the blonde handed him the two photographs of his mothers naked torso and the until i find you tattoo those are leslies he explained i have two photos she has the other two take them the blonde told him your mothers dead jack leslie doesnt want to look at her breasts anymore i dont want to look at them anymore either jack said but he took the photos now he had all fourthese in addition to that photograph of emma naked at seventeen mrs oastlers mansion as jack used to think of it was different with the blonde there leslies bedroom door was usually closed it was hard to imagine mrs oastler closing her bathroom door too but maybe the blonde had taught her how to do it that trip to toronto jack resisted sleeping with bonnie hamilton she wanted to sell him an apartment in a new condo being built in rosedale for when you tire of los angeles bonnie told him but toronto wasnt his town notwithstanding that he had long been tired of la when he was in toronto jack had a less than hearttoheart talk with caroline wurtz she was disappointed in him she thought he should be looking for his father jack couldnt tell her half of what hed learned on his return trip to the north sea he was in no shape to talk about it it was all he could do to tell the story to dr garcía and too often he couldnt talk to her either he tried but the words wouldnt comeor he would start to shout or cry it was dr garcías opinion that jack shouted and cried too much especially the cryingits simply indecent for a man she said you really should work on that to that end she encouraged jack to tell her what had happened to him in chronological order begin with that awful trip you took with your mother dr garcía instructed him dont tell me what you now know about that trip tell me what you thought happened at the time begin with what you first imagined were your memories and try not to jump ahead more than is absolutely necessary in other words go easy on the foreshadowing jack later after he beganwith copenhagen when he was fourdr garcía would frequently say try not to interject so much i know youre not a writer but just try to stick to the story it hurt jacks feelings to hear her say that he wasnt a writer it felt especially unfair after his notinconsiderable contributions to emmas screenplay of the slushpile reader and to recite out loud the story of his lifethat is coherently and in chronological orderwould take years dr garcía knew that she was in no hurry she took one look at what a mess jack was and knew only that she had to find a way to make him stop shouting and crying its woefully apparent that you cant tell me your life story without everyone in the waiting room hearing you she said believe me its only tolerable to listen to you if you calm down where does it end jack asked dr garcía when hed been spilling his life story aloud for four going on five years well it ends with looking for your fatheror at least finding out what happened to him dr garcía said but youre not ready for that part not until you can spit out all the rest of it the end of it jack is where you find himthats the last place you have to go youre not through with traveling jack too hastily concluded that if his retelling of his life were a book for example his finding his father would be the last chapter i doubt it dr garcía said maybe your penultimate chapter if youre lucky when you find him jack youre going to learn something you didnt know before arent you i trust that the learning part will take an additional chapter and the whole thing had to have a name too didnt it there had to be a title to the story of his life which jack was recitingwith such restraint and in chronological orderto his psychiatrist but jack knew the name of his life story before he started telling it the first day he went to see dr garcía when hed been unable to tell her anything without shouting or crying jack knew that his mothers until i find you tattoo had been her crowning deception certainly shed been proudest of it why else if only after her death had alice wanted leslie oastler to show jack the photographs why show me at all hed asked his mom i was beautiful once alice had criedmeaning her breasts when she was younger hed thought at the time but the tattoo was what interested jack shed been so proud of keeping the tattoo from him that even after everything alice had wanted him to see it from the time he was four that until i find you tattoo said everything there was to say about jack burns as a psychiatrist dr garcía was the opposite of an editor jack was not supposed to delete anythinghe was instructed to leave nothing out and not infrequently dr garcía wanted more she required corroborating details instances of what dr garcía had identified early on as jacks olderwoman thing could not be overemphasized in his boyhood the seemingly unmotivated cruelty and aggressiveness he encountered in older girls was an underlying problem what was it about jack that had provoked those older girls ditto the penisholding most surprising in jacks case in dr garcías experience was how this didnt necessarily lead to having sex then there was the closeness hed felt to his mom as a child but how swiftly and absolutely they had grown estranged it was almost as if jack knew that alices lies were lies before he actually found out dr garcía was further puzzled by the emma relationship which stood in contrast but bore certain similarities to jacks relationship with leslie oastler did he still want to sleep with leslie dr garcía wanted to know if so why if not why not dr garcía was a stickler for thoroughness i think im done with the st hildas part jack had told her on several occasions oh noyoure not dr garcía had said a boy with looks like yours in an allgirls school are you kidding youre not only not done with st hildas jackyou may never be done with it jack got tired of all the contradictionshis inglorious return to the north sea especially but not dr garcía there couldnt be too many contradictions for her how longs it been since you thought about dressing as a girl she asked him i dont mean in a movie he must have hesitated you see she said give me more contradictionsgive me all youve got jack jack sometimes felt he wasnt seeing a psychiatristit was more like taking a creative writing class but with nothing on paper to show for it and when dr garcía gave him an actual writing assignment he almost stopped the therapy altogether she wanted him to write letters to michele mahernot to send to michele but to read out loud at their therapy sessions theres no way i can explain myself to michele jack told his psychiatrist at the time it had been more than a yearcloser to two yearssince michele had written him he still hadnt answered her letter but explaining yourself to michele is what you want to do isnt it dr garcía asked him he couldnt deny that it was further unnerving that dr garcías office was on montana avenue in santa monica within walking distance of that breakfast place where hed first met myra ascheimanother older woman who had changed his life fascinating dr garcía said but dont tell me about it now please keep everything in chronological order jack in when jack won the academy award for best adapted screenplay dr garcía found it illuminating that he referred to the award and the statuette itself as emmas oscar but dr garcía wouldnt allow him to tell her his feelings even the oscar had to be rendered in chronological order and dr garcía disapproved of his first actual communication with michele maher for several reasons in the first place jack hadnt shown the doctor the letter he wrote michele before he mailed it in the second place it was a ridiculous letter to have sent michele after almost eighteen years of nothing between them but when jack was nominated for two academy awards one for best supporting actor and the other for the screenplay he felt he had a golden opportunity to make contact with michele maherwhile at the same time sounding casual about getting together dear michele i dont know if youre married or otherwise attached to someone butif youre notwould you be my date at the academy awards this would mean coming to los angelessunday march naturally i would take care of your travel expenses and hotel accommodations yours truly jack burns what was wrong with that wasnt it polite and to the point micheles answer which was prompt was a little wishywashy dear jack gosh i would love to but i have a boyfriend sort of i dont live with anyone but im seeing someoneas they say of course im very flattered that you thought of meafter all these years ill make a point of actually staying up to watch the awards this year and ill keep my fingers crossed for you best regards michele its hard to tell if she really wanted to go isnt it jack asked dr garcía which prompted his psychiatrists third reason for disapproving of his letter to michele jack you are very fortunate that michele turned you down dr garcía said what a wreck you would have been if shed said yes if shed been your date you would have blown it jack didnt think this was fair he could have had a ball with the mediajust telling them that his date for the academy awards was his dermatologist but dr garcía was not amused she considered his faux pas of inviting michele maher to the oscars to be in the denial category dr garcía said that jack was completely unaware of how far removed he was from the normal world of normal people and normal relationships but what about her he cried jack meant michele maher whats she mean that she has a boyfriend sort of is that normal youre not ready to make contact with michele maher jack dr garcía said you have heaped so many unrealistic expectations upon a relationship that as i understand it never developed in the first placewell i dont want to hear another word about this now to me youre still a fouryearold in the north sea speaking strictly professionally youve not recovered from your sea of girlsand i need to know much more about emma and your olderwoman thing keep it in chronological order is that understood it was he had a bitch psychiatrist or so it seemed to jack but he had to admit that her therapy had noticeably cut down his tendency to shout and burst into tearsand his inclination to wake up weeping in the middle of the night which became habitual after he came back from the north sea the second time so jack stuck with her and the unfinished telling of his life story went on and on jack had become what emma said he could bea writer albeit one given to melancholic logorrhea a storyteller if only out loud jacks actual writing was limited to those unmailed letters to michele maher dr garcía was a heavyset but attractive mexicanamerican she appeared to be in her late forties from the photographs in her office she either came from a large family or had a large family of her own jack didnt ask her andfrom the photoshe couldnt tell of the children in the many pictures he couldnt recognize dr garcía as a childso perhaps they were her children yet the olderlooking man in the photographs seemed more like a father to her than a husband he was always well dressed to the point of fastidiousness and his pencilthin mustache and perfectly trimmed sideburns suggested a character actor of a bygone era a cross between clifton webb and gilbert roland jack thought dr garcía didnt wear any rings she wore no jewelry to speak of either she was married with more children than jack could count in her office photos or shed come from such an overlarge family that this had persuaded her to never marry and have children of her own in a doomed effort to solve this mystery jack cleverly said maybe you should be my date for the academy awards dr garcía at a stressful event like that a psychiatrist would probably come in handier than a dermatologistdont you think you dont date your psychiatrist dr garcía said oh thats a word you overuse jacks psychiatrist said the distinguishedlooking older man in dr garcías family photographs had an air of detachment about him as if he were withdrawing from a recurrent argument before it started he seemed far removed from the clamor of the everpresent children in the photos it was almost as if he couldnt hear them maybe dr garcía had married a much older man or a deaf one jacks psychiatrist was such a strong woman she was probably contemptuous of the convention of wedding rings richard gladstein had recommended dr garcía to jack she knows actors richard had told him you wouldnt be her first movie star at the time this had been a comforting thought yet jack hadnt seen anyone famous in dr garcías waiting room it made him wonder if she made house calls to the more famous movie stars among her patients but to judge dr garcía by the waiting room outside her office was confusing there were many young married women and some of them came with their small children there were toys and childrens books in a corner of the waiting room which gave you the disquieting impression that you were seeing a pediatrician the young married women who showed up with their children always brought friends or nannies with them these other women looked after the kids when the young mothers went into dr garcías office for their therapy sessions are you here to see the doctor or to watch someones kid jack asked one of the young women once like dr garcía she wasnt wearing a wedding ring are you trying to pick me up or something the young woman said jack almost asked her if she would be his date at the academy awards but he stopped himself when he considered what dr garcía might have to say about that who should i take to the academy awards hed asked his psychiatrist please dont mistake me for a dating service jack thus jack was on his own for the academy awards in addition to his two nominations lucia delvecchio had a nomination for best actress wild bill vanvleck had one for best director and richard gladstein got a best picture nomination too no one thought lucia had a shot she was up against some very big gunsmeryl streep and julianne moore and annette beningand besides it was hilary swanks year as an occasional crossdresser jack was a big fan of hilary in boys dont cry and richard gladstein knew going in that the slushpile reader was a long shot for best picture it would go to american beauty william vanvleck was just happy to be there not one review of the slushpile reader referred to wild bill as the remake monster the mad dutchman had become almost acceptable not acceptable enough to win best director there were some heavy hitters in the lineup that year sam mendes would winamerican beauty again nor did jack realistically have a chance to win best supporting actormichael caine won jacks role as a niceguy porn star was sympathetic but not that sympathetic jack knew long before the night of the awards that the films best chance for an oscar was in the best adapted screenplay categoryemmas screenplay as he thought of it how could he not look at it as emmas oscar it was her movie yes jack had learned a little bit about screenwriting in the course of finetuning the script emma had given him but as a storyteller he was learning more from his therapy with dr garcía go easy on the foreshadowing watch the interjections keep it in chronological order miramaxs promotion of the slushpile reader was exhausting and the lions share of it had fallen to jack in february and march of wild bill vanvleck was back in amsterdam his much younger girlfriend was an anchorwoman on dutch television and wild bill was completely taken with her besides vanvleck was a disaster at promoting his own picturein this case that pornography was such an issue in the united states offended the mad dutchman nobody had a problem with pornography in the netherlands it is only a problem in puritan america which is ruled by the christian right vanvleck declared it was probably wise of miramax to keep wild bill in amsterdam except for the film festivals following her tragic onenight error in venice lucia delvecchio had shunned jack shed virtually turned her back on the film too jacks old friend erica steinberg was the miramax publicist jack had been on the road with ericain print and on televisionfor the slushpile reader almost nonstop it was the night after jack did larry king live that he called leslie oastler and asked her if she would be his date at the academy awards fuck the blonde he thought im flattered you would think of me jack mrs oastler began but how would that make dolores feel and i dont know what i would wear its emmas night leslie jack said no its gonna be your night jack emmas dead why dont you go with miss wurtz mrs oastler asked him the wurtz are you kidding an oscar would be wasted on me jack what would i want with a gold bald naked man holding what is alleged to be his sword leslie oastler had always had a particularly pointed way of seeing things the next morning jack called caroline wurtz and popped the question would she consider coming to los angeles to attend the academy awards with him ive heard so many terrible things about the driveby shootings miss wurtz said but they dont shoot people at the oscars do they no he told her they only wound you internally well i suppose i should go see the movie shouldnt i caroline asked ive heard both wonderful and awful things from people whove seen it as you know your friend emma was never one of my favorite writers i think its a pretty good film jack said there was a lengthy pause as if caroline was considering the invitationor perhaps the wurtz had forgotten that hed invited her to anything jack was a little miffed that she hadnt seen the slushpile reader the movie had five oscar nominations everyone jack knew had seen it dont you have anyone else to ask jack i cant be the best you can do caroline said for a couple of years ive been seeing a psychiatrist he admitted to her i havent been in the best shape goodness miss wurtz cried in that case of course ill go with you im sure if mrs mcquat were alive shed want to go with us too well there was a concept at mrs mcquats urging jack had taken miss wurtz to that most memorable toronto film festivalthe one he went to with claudia when the wurtz was convinced that the morons protesting the godard film were outraged by the ritualistic suicide in the mishima movie jack wondered what confusions awaited miss wurtz at the shrine civic auditorium on the night of the academy awards whom might she mistake billy crystal for jack explained to caroline that he would arrange her air travel and all the rest of it that jack burns was taking his thirdgrade teacher to the oscars was a bonus bit of publicity nor did it hurt that emma oastler had died and put him in charge of bringing her first and best novel to the screen the death connection jack had called it that turned out to be a bonus bit of publicity for both miramax and jack burns the issue of what miss wurtz would wear provided a downtoearth return to the heart of the matter jack told her that armani was dressing him for the academy awards they had called hed said okay this was how it usually happened who is dressing you the wurtz asked armanithe designer caroline different fashion designers dress the nominees and their guests for the oscars if theres a particular designer you like im sure i could arrange it or you could just wear something by armani too i think ill dress myself if its all the same to you miss wurtz replied i have some perfectly lovely clothes your father bought for me naturally william will be watching hell be so proud of you i wouldnt want william to see me wearing a dress he didnt choose for me jack well there was a concept toonamely that jacks father would be watching the wurtz would be dressing for him youll have to tell me whos nominated for what caroline was saying then ill go see all the movies jack wondered how many academy voters had the diligence of a thirdgrade teacher butwhen jack would finally get to the oscarwinning part of his life storydr garcía would call the diligence detail an example of his interjecting too much jack doubted that every film nominated for an oscar was still playing in a theater in toronto quite possibly not every film had ever played there but he knew this wouldnt deter miss wurtz from trying to see them all jack almost called leslie oastler to thank her for suggesting the wurtz as his date for the academy awards but he didnt want to risk getting leslies blonde on the phone dolores he would be tempted to say to the bitch i wanted to alert you to a large package thats coming your waymore of my clothes if you or leslie wouldnt mind hanging them in my closet as soon as they arrive id appreciate it i wouldnt want them to be wrinkled for my next visit or words to that effect naturally jack didnt make the call had she known dr garcía would have been proud of him for exercising such restraint the twobedroom suite at the beverly hills four seasons where miramax put them up for the long oscar weekend was larger than miss wurtzs apartmentor so she told jack there was even a piano which miss wurtz liked to play in her four seasons white terrycloth bathrobe she claimed to know only hymns and the st hildas school songs but her voice was pretty and she played well oh i dont play wellnothing like your father who used to tease me she said william would say if you want to be even a bit more tentative caroline you might try breathing on the keys instead of using your fingers he could be funny your father i wish youd tell me more about your trip jack why dont you begin with copenhagen ive never been there there were always a lot of parties prior to the academy awards as a nondrinker escorting his thirdgrade teacher a woman in her sixties jack didnt think that he and caroline were in step with the bacchanalian behavior of many of his colleagues in the industry but they went to those parties where jacks absence would have been resented even if they spent much of the time talking quietly to each other having calmly described so many of the painful passages in his life to dr garcía jack found that he was in better control of himself while recounting to miss wurtz those discoveries he made in his return trip to the north seabeginning with the ringhof family tragedy that alice had engendered in copenhagen which jack was able to relate in a deadpan narrative more closely resembling the written word than conversation not once did he raise his voice nor did he shed a tear jack didnt even blink goodness was all miss wurtz had to say in reply they were at an outdoor luncheon at bob bookmans home the screenwriters who were jacks or emmas principal competition in the best adapted screenplay category that year were therein addition to jack bookman represented three of his fellow nominees but there jack was in bob bookmans garden with his thirdgrade teacherhis fathers former loverand jack was back in those north sea ports of call telling miss wurtz what he had learned dont downplay what happened in stockholm jacki mean just because it wasnt as bad as what happened in copenhagen miss wurtz would tell him later that same weekend and even if you had sex with someone in oslo please dont spare me any details he didnt dr garcía had taught him not to spare her any details jack found that he could actually talk his way through itat least to as sympathetic a soul as caroline wurtz jack doubted that he would have been able to tell the north sea story to leslie oastler and her unfriendly blondenot without shedding a tear or two or indulging in a little shouting but he told miss wurtz everything about copenhagen and stockholm without batting an eye he didnt even hesitate when he got to oslo he didnt want to be overoptimistic but jack thought that dr garcías therapy was working straining to see the weinstein brothers were backing more than one oscarnominated film that year the night before the academy awards miramax had a party at the regent beverly wilshire the antipornography people were protesting the slushpile reader outside the hotel the film had an r rating it wasnt pornographic but it was offensive to the antipornography people that jacks character jimmy stronach the porn star was sympathetically portrayed those other characters in the film who were part of the porn industry were also sympatheticchiefly hank long and muffy and mildred milly ascheim made a cameo appearance as herself worse from the point of view of the antipornography people all the porn stars were portrayed as having normal livesto the degree that socalled la dysfunctional is normal and emma believed it was there were fewer than a dozen protesters outside the hotel but the media gave them undue attention there were usually the same small number of zealots every yearsome of them protesting what jacks mother would have called the deterioration of language in movies in general the antiprofanity people the antipornography peoplethere would always be complainers with too much time on their hands jack thought that the best thing was to pay them no attention but the media tended to inflate their importance and their numbers miss wurtz hadnt noticed the protesters when wild bill vanvleck was ranting at the miramax party about the antipornography people caroline clutched jacks arm and said anxiously there are protesters what are they protesting pornography jack said miss wurtz looked all around the room as if there might be pornographic acts under way in their very midst and she had somehow mistaken them for more innocent forms of entertainment jack explained you know carolinemy character jimmy stronach is a porn star i think thats what theyre protesting nonsense miss wurtz shouted i did not see a single reproductive organ in the filmnot one penis or one female thingamajig a what wild bill said looking shocked a vagina jack whispered to him you shouldnt say that word at a party caroline said it soon became clear that the wurtz had seen too many films in too short a period of timeas many as three a day for the past several weeks or so shed told jack miss wurtz had never seen so many movies in her life they were all a blur and this years films were mingled with movies shed not seen since she was a child to her the recognizable celebrities at the party were not movie stars but the actual characters theyd played unfortunately these movies had overlapped in her mindto the extent that shed merged the plots of several different films into one incomprehensible epic in which virtually everyone she recognized at the regent beverly wilshire had played a pivotal role oh looktheres that envious young man who killed those people one with an oar i think she said indicating matt damon who was tom ripley in the talented mr ripley not that the wurtz made any distinction between tom ripley and the character tom cruise played in magnolia that year and she had convinced herself that kevin spacey was trapped in a bad marriage which he periodically escaped by lusting after young girls someone should be assigned to watch him miss wurtz told jack who understood that by watch she meant control him seeking to change the subject jack said he admired how thin gwyneth paltrow wasto which the wurtz replied she looks in need of intravenous feeding when youve seen too many movies time stands still no one grows old or dies miss wurtz mistook anthony minghella for peter lorre i thought peter lorre was dead caroline would tell jack the next day he hasnt made a movie in years to which jack could only think to himself true looking worriedly around the wurtz announced that a party of this sizeand with so many celebritiesshould have more than one bouncer she thought that ben affleck was the sole bouncer judi dench was there which prompted caroline to confess to jack that shed always thought judi dench would be an inspired choice to play mrs mcquatshould anyone ever make a movie about the gray ghost a movie about mrs mcquat jack said stunned you know she was a combat nurse jack the trouble with her breathing was because shed been gassedim not sure with what thus jack was doomed to think of judi dench as the gray ghost gassed but come back to lifea troubling thought jack kept giving wild bill vanvleck the eyethe eye that meant isnt it time to leave but wild bill was nowhere near ready to go he was back in hollywood reborn as the director of an academy awardnominated film jack didnt begrudge the mad dutchman his triumph the remake monster had admirably restrained himself in directing the slushpile reader jack had always trusted vanvleck as a craftsman and wild bill had stuck to the craftsmanlike part of his business this time hed left the parody alone after they finally left the miramax party jack and miss wurtz went out to dinner with richard gladstein and his wife and vanvleck and his much younger anchorwoman whose name was anneke outside the regent beverly wilshire the protesters were still chanting and holding up posters of male and female reproductive organspenises and thingamajigs galore miss wurtz became incensed all over again if you dont like pornography stop thinking about it caroline said sharply out the window of the limousine to a baffledlooking man in a limegreen shortsleeved shirt he was holding a poster depicting a naked child above whom the intimidating shadow of a grownup loomed it was a good thing the wurtz wasnt riding in the limo with hank long and muffy and milly ascheim jack found out later that milly had put down her window and shouted at the protesters oh go home and watch a movie and beat off youll feel better goodness its already sunday morning miss wurtz declared when she and jack were having breakfast at the pool at the four seasons in beverly hills and your story has bogged down in oslo as i recall its probably best not to try to imitate ingrid moes speech impediment just tell me what she said the way you would normally say it jack the speech impediment is too distracting not surprisingly jack would elect to tell the story in this fashion when he told it to dr garcía too he made no effort to render an approximation of ingrids awful affliction knowing dr garcía she would have referred to any effort on jacks part to recreate the speech impediment as an interjection thus jack described ingrid moes vision of hell as if it were his personal account of an actual visit to the place he paid particular attention to ingrids lack of forgiveness for his mother which stood in such dramatic contrast to the fact that his father forgave his mother for everythingeven the amsterdam part of the story which jack was a long way from getting to on that sunday morning in beverly hills he felt certain that he and miss wurtz wouldnt get to amsterdamat least not before the academy awards which would commence later that afternoon having been to the oscars once before jack knew they were in for a long night miss wurtz wearing a widebrimmed straw hat and smeared from head to toe with more sunscreen than a naked newborn was pressing jack for details about helsinki she was clearly impatient with oslo and ingrid moe although williams appearance at the hotel bristol had thrilled her the wurtz was especially pleased to learn that william had not cut his hair william had beautiful hair you have his hair jack caroline said taking his hand im so glad you havent cut your hair short the way everyone else does nowadays frankly it doesnt matter whether long hair for men is in or out if you have good hair you should grow it the helsinki part of the story took what remained of their private time that sunday erica steinberg had thoughtfully arranged for someone to come to the hotel to do miss wurtzs hair whatever do means the wurtz whispered to jack before she went off with erica after lunch im keeping it graythats all i know its too late for me to be a blondenot that there arent enough blondes already especially out here jack went to the gym which was next to the pool sigourney weaver was there he came up to her collarbone good luck tonight jack she said that was when he began to get nervous that was when he realized that it meant everything to him to win its just possible jack dr garcía would tell him later that winning the oscar was some small consolation for what youve lost she didnt mean only his father she didnt mean only emma either she meant michele maher notwithstanding dr garcías assessment of the unrealistic expectations jack had heaped upon michele she meant jacks false memories the childhood his mother had fabricated for him which hed lost too dr garcía also meant his mom of course erica rode in the stretch limo with jack and miss wurtz to the shrine auditorium they saw the protesters from the night beforethe same righteous faces the identical posters the limo was moving so slowly that this time jack could count them there were nine antipornography people altogethernot that this would prevent entertainment weekly in its postoscar issue from describing the scores of protesters ringing the auditorium miss wurtz looked wonderful she wore a long slender gown with a queen anne neckline it was the same silver color as her hair jacks allblack armani which included a black shirt as well as the black tuxedo and the black tie made him resemble a shrunken gangster hed lost the twenty pounds hed put on for the jimmy stronach rolehe was looking lean and mean as michele maher had once observed they werent on the red carpet more than twenty minutes before erica steered them in the direction of the obligatory joan rivers interview jack was dreading miss wurtzs answer to joans predictable question regarding who she was wearing but rather than say jacks father gave it to me when we were lovers caroline answered the dress is personal a gift from a onetime admirer that was perfect jack thought joan rivers knew all about the thirdgrade connection in advance it seemed that everyone in the media knew what sort of a student was jack she asked miss wurtz even as a child jack was as convincing as a woman as he was as a man caroline answered he just needed to know who his audience was and who is your audience jack burns joan rivers asked him my father is my audience of one he told her but i suppose ive picked up a few other fans along the way jack looked into the camera and said for the first time in his life hi dad he noticed that miss wurtz was smiling shyly at the camera after that jack couldnt get off the red carpet fast enough he was a wreck he almost called dr garcía calm down caroline said its not necessary for you to say anything to william he just wants to see youhe wants more than anyone to see you win there was a lot of waiting at the academy awards erica took jack and miss wurtz inside the auditorium where they waited for an eternity jack drank too much evian and had to peethis was before billy crystal was carried onstage like a baby by a motorcycle cop in sunglasses and a white helmet and the evening officially began jack had a sixthrow aisle seat all the nominees had aisle seats richard gladstein sat in the aisle seat in front of jack and wild bill vanvleck had the one behind him miss wurtz was seated between jack and harvey weinstein caroline didnt remember who harvey wasjack had introduced them twice at the party the previous nightbut she knew he was someone important because there was a television camera pointed at him from start to finish for reasons that would remain unclear to jack miss wurtz deduced that harvey was a famous prizefightera former heavyweight champ quite possibly shed overheard someone saying how much harvey enjoyed a good fight jack could think of no other explanation the best supporting actor award was announced fairly early in the program when michael caine won jack knew it would be a long wait for the writing awards which were near the end of the evening almost no one sat through the entire programespecially not if youd had as much evian as jack but you had to pick your peebreak pretty carefully they would let you leave or go back to your seat only during the tv commercials miss wurtz became enraged at those awardwinners who overspent their allotted fortyfive seconds for their acceptance speeches pedro almodóvar really pissed her off in accepting the oscar for best foreign language film for all about my mother pedro went on for so long that antonio banderas had to pull him offstage buenas noches miss wurtz called out to almodóvar they took their peebreakthat is they took jacks peebreak since he was the one in dire need of itduring the presentation of the irving g thalberg memorial award this year it went to warren beatty caroline was cross with jack for causing her to miss it miss wurtz had once had a crush on warren beatty nothing compared to what i felt for your father jack but it was a crush just the same by the time they were back in their seats jack had to pee again he whispered to miss wurtz that if he didnt win he would have to pee in his evian bottle jack was counting on there being a mens room backstageif he could get there finally the writing awards came thankfully the oscar for best adapted screenplay preceded the award for best original screenplay kevin spacey was the lone presenter annette bening was supposed to join him onstage but she was arguably too pregnant to risk the short trip from her seat spacey made a joke about how she was due to go into production herself he said further i could not ask her to climb stairs unless of course she wins the oscar then shell climb up here on all fours jack took this as an unfavorable omen for his chances to win given his night in helsinki with the pregnant aerobics instructor the very idea of annette bening on all fours in her condition filled him with remorse but it was only seconds after that bad moment when kevin spacey said and the oscar goes to jack didnt hear the rest because miss wurtz was shrieking think of how happy william is for you jack she shouted in his ear between kisses of course the camera was on them and jack was aware of the wurtz looking past him to the camera she knew exactly where the camera was because it had been pointed at harvey weinstein the former prizefighter all night jack was on his feetrichard was kissing him wild bill too harvey crushed miss wurtz and jack in one embrace when jack stepped into the aisle he saw caroline blow a kiss to the cameraher lips forming the name william as she did so jack took the oscar from kevin spacey and spoke for only thirtyfive of his allotted fortyfive seconds in a small way this made up for pedro almodóvar thanking the virgin of guadalupe the virgin of la cabeza the sacred heart of mary and all the rest of the living and the dead of course jack thanked his thirdgrade teacher miss caroline wurtz because he knew that the camera would go to her if he did he thanked mr ramsey too and naturally he thanked richard and wild bill and everyone at miramax most of all jack thanked emma oastler for everything shed done for him andlargely because he knew how angry it would make the blondehe thanked leslie oastler for her contributions to the screenplay lastly jack thanked michele maher for staying up late to watch him in his heart he hoped micheles sortof boyfriend was watching too hearing jack thank michele might make the boyfriend jealous and lead to their breaking up jack might have used the full fortyfive seconds if he hadnt had to pee so badly when he left the stage with kevin spacey they passed mel gibson coming onmel was the presenter for the best original screenplay award which would go to alan ball for american beauty tom cruise a fellow former wrestler tried to wrestle the oscar away from jack backstage the way jack had to pee that bit of friendly fooling around could have ended badly clint eastwood spoke to jack he said way to go kid or words to that effect jack knew he couldnt trust his memory of moments like thatthe ones that mattered too much jack was still seeking the whereabouts of the mens room when alan ball came offstage with his oscar and jack congratulated him good job mate jack thought mel gibson said but had mel been speaking to jack or to alan after a night of waiting everything seemed over so quickly at last jack found the place he was looking for his relief turned to awkwardness almost immediately however because he had never been to a mens room with an academy award before leslie oastler had attempted to diminish oscar by describing him as a gold bald naked man holding what is alleged to be his sword but in jacks estimation an oscar was longer than a porn stars penis and a whole lot heavier jack wouldnt recommend peeing with one it was an experience in childlike clumsiness that reminded him of marjaliisas fouryearold peeing in his parka pocket at the hotel torni jack couldnt quite get the hang of it so to speak he tried pinning the oscar under one arm but that didnt work very well if youve just won your first academy award fully understanding that you might never win another one youre not inclined to put it down on the floor of a public mens roomnor would you attempt to balance it on the urinal by maintaining perilous little contact with oscars sleek head by means of your chin jack was glad he was alone in the mens room there was no one to observe his embarrassing struggleor so he thought suddenly he saw at the opposite end of the row of urinals that there was someone else there the fellow appeared to have finished with his business no one could help but notice how jack was failing to do his the man was broadshouldered with a weightlifters crafted body and an unbreakablelooking jaw jack didnt recognize him right away nor did he remember that the former bodybuilder had been a presenter from jacks perspective the opposite end of the row of urinals seemed a football field away but jack had no trouble identifying the big mans inimitable austrian accent would you like me to give you a hand with that arnold schwarzenegger asked no thank youi can manage jack answered goodness i hope he meant he would give you a hand with the oscar miss wurtz said later when jack told her the story well of course arnold had meant the oscarhe was just being nice that the future governor of california might have been offering to hold jacks penis was unthinkable it was bedlam backstage at the next television commercial jack went back to his seat in the auditorium he didnt want to leave miss wurtz unattended she might ask harvey weinstein about his greatest fights jack was thinking or god forbid what if there were a power outage and miss wurtz suffered an uncontrollable flashback to her experience in the batcave exhibit at the royal ontario museum but by then the evening was winding down the slushpile reader had won its only oscar it was american beautys night but it was jacks night and emmas night too miss wurtz was perplexed that she could see no evidence of dancing at the board of governors ballthe dinner party at the shrine auditorium after the academy awards no amount of explaining could convince her that ball was an acceptable description of the occasion but what did jack care he was happy they ate dinner at a table with meryl streep whod brought her daughter jack could see the wheels of the wurtzs mind spinning here was that woman from sophies choice with an actual living child jack told erica that he thought they should leave and go to another party before caroline committed whatever she was imagining to words they went to the vanity fair party at mortons next erica got them there somehow jack remembered how long he and emma had waited to get into that party the night hed been nominated but didnt win the oscar it makes a difference when you win their limo driver waved the gold bald naked man out the window and they were swiftly ushered through the traffic hugh hefner among others appeared to have arrived before them probably hugh had come early because he hadnt been at the shrine the playboy founding publisher had those twins with himsandy and mandy miss wurtz was more incensed at hef than shed been at the antipornography people what does that dirty old man think hes doing with those young girls caroline said to erica and jack rob lowe and mike meyers and dennis miller were all talking about something but they stopped the second jack got near them when that happened to him around men jack couldnt help but think that theyd been talking about him as a girl as it happened jack was on his way to the mens room againalthough this time hed left his academy award with erica and miss wurtz they went next to the miramax party at the polo lounge in the beverly hills hotel jack knew that richard and wild bill would be there he just wanted to be with friends miss wurtz once more avoided making any prizefighter references to harvey weinstein caroline had a little too much champagne jack had a beera green bottle of heineken which looked especially green alongside the gold of his oscar he couldnt remember when hed last had a whole beermaybe when he was a college student then there was a breakfast party in another area of the beverly hills hotel they went to that too it must have started at three or four in the morning roger ebert was there he was eating his breakfast on a bed which jack found peculiar jack was nice to him although roger had savaged the slushpile reader rogers wife and daughter were very nice they informed miss wurtz that theyd liked the movie it pleased jack to think that he and emma might have caused an argument in the ebert family it was about am when jack told miss wurtz that he was tired and wanted to go to bed we can go back to our hotel jack she told him but you cant go to bed not until you tell me about the second time in amsterdam shed had it on her mind the whole night the wurtz went on to say she knew she couldnt sleep until she heard the story jack told erica that they had to leave and she rode with them in the limo back to the four seasons on a side street in beverly hills they got stuck behind a garbage truckthe only traffic they encountered at that time on a monday morning the smell of the garbage wafted over them in their limousine as if to remind jackeven with his newly won oscar in handthat there are some things you cant escape and they will find you jack was okay telling miss wurtz about the amsterdam business only the end of the story was difficult dr garcía would have been proud of himno tears no shouting when jack told caroline how his heart wasnt in that first meeting with richard gladstein and william vanvleckthat he kept thinking about the other williamthe southern california sun was streaming in the open windows of the living room of the twobedroom suite at the four seasons miss wurtz and jack were seated on the couch in their matching white terrycloth bathrobestheir bare feet on the glasstopped coffee table where the oscar gleamed carolines toenails were painted a rosepink color the sunlight seemed especially bright on her toenails and on the oscarand on the lustrous black piano which was shining like a pool of oil dont look at my feet jack miss wurtz said my feet are the oldest part of me i must have been born feet first but jack burns was miles away in the dark of nightthe streetlights reflecting in the herengracht canal richard gladstein and wild bill vanvleck and jack had been talking in the restaurant called zuid zeeland and wild bills much younger girlfriendanneke the anchorwomanwas looking restless and bored how much fun is it to be young and greeneyed and beautiful and have three men talking to one another and ignoring youespecially when theyre talking about how to make a movie from a novel you havent read as little as jacks heart was in it he saw that he and richard and wild bill were all on the same page they seemed to agree about what needed tweaking in the script and about the tone the film must have richards eyes kept closinghe was falling asleep because of his jet lag wild bill was teasing him to the effect that richard was not allowed to fall asleep before he signed the check producers pay the bills vanvleck was chanting he was a man who loved his red wine out on the herengracht richard woke up a little in the damp night air it seemed inevitable to jack now that wild bill would suggest a stroll through the redlight district but it took him by surprise at the time when they walked past the first few girls in their windows and doorways jack could tell that richard was wide awake anneke was still bored jack had the feeling that wild bill took all his outoftown friends on a tour of the redlight district after all it was the homicide territory of his tv series and he knew the district well almost as well as jack knew it but jack didnt let on that hed ever been there before anneke livened up a little most noticeably when she observed how the prostitutes in their windows and doorways recognized jack burns as frequently as they recognized her as an attractive anchorwoman she was a famous fixture on dutch televisionbut no more famous than jack was and not only was jack a movie star he had the added advantage of nico oudejans telling all the whores in the district to be on the lookout for him you cocktease jack one of the transvestite prostitutes called out she was brazilian probably those chicks with dicks were out to get him this captured annekes attention but wild bill had downed a couple of bottles of red wine he didnt notice the mad dutchman was lecturing richard nonstop suddenly jack was irritated by it vanvleck was showing off the redlight district as if hed invented it as if hed hired all the girls himself poor richard was fighting off his jet lag and the overwhelming seediness of the place by all counts it had been a forgettable night for anneke well jack thoughtill show them something theyll all remember this is nothing jack announced as they circled the oudekerksplein he began to lead them across the warmoesstraat out of the redlight district you havent seen anything until youve seen els els vanvleck said where are we going richard asked they were walking away from the hotel that was all he knew els is the oldest working prostitute in amsterdam jack told them shes an old friend she is wild bill said stumbling along jack led them across the damrak it was now late at night he was sure that els would have gone to bed petra her colleague who was only sixtyone might be sitting in the secondfloor window or maybe petra would have gone home and gone to bed too in either case jack would wake up elsjust to show wild bill and richard and anneke that he had a history in amsterdam that ran a little deeper than a dutch tv series when they came into the narrow sint jacobsstraat wild bill was staggering the street could seem a little menacing at night jack saw richard look over his shoulder a couple of times and anneke took jacks arm and walked close beside him to jacks surprise elsnot petrawas in the window some drunk woke me up shouting she would tell jack later petra had gone home and i felt like staying up call it my intuition jackie when jack spotted her he started waving els is in her seventies he said to wild bill who was staring up at els in her redlit window as if he had seen one of hells own avenging spiritsa harpy from the netherworld an infernal fury shes how old richard asked think of your grandmother jack told him jackie els shouted blowing kisses my little boy has come back again she once more announced to the sint jacobsstraat jack blew kisses to her he waved and waved that was when he lost itwhen els started waving back to him it is impossible that jack could have remembered his mother lifting him above the ships rail as they sailed from the dock in rotterdam impossible that he actually recalled waving to els twentyeight years before or that when jack was four he truly saw his father fall to the ground with both hands holding his broken heart dont cry jackiedont cry els called to him from her secondfloor window but jack had dropped to his knees on the sint jacobsstraat he was still waving goodbye and els kept waving back to him richard and wild bill were struggling to get jack to his feet but wild bill was drunk richard in addition to his jet lag had been knocking back the red wine too youre her little boy richard was asking but jack was waving goodbye to his dad and couldnt answer jacks heart was in his throat you actually know this lady wild bill asked losing his balance and sitting down in the street richard was holding jack under one arm but he let go jack just lay in the street beside wild bill jack was still waving jackie jackieyour mother loved you els was calling as best she could it was wild bills pretty anchorwoman who finally helped jack to his feet shed laid off the red wine jack had noticed for gods sake stop waving to that old hooker anneke said stop encouraging her she was my nanny jack blubbered she was his what wild bill asked richard his babysitter richard explained marvelous wild bill exclaimed oh shut up bill cant you see hes crying anneke asked the mad dutchman jack why are you crying wild bill asked she looked after me while my mother was working jack told them working where working here richard asked my mom worked in a window in one of those doorwaysback there jack said pointing in the general direction of the redlight district my mother was a prostitute he told them i thought his mom was a tattoo artist wild bill said to richard she was a tattoo artist too jack said she wasnt a prostitute for very long but she was one jack began to wave goodbye to els again but anneke wrapped her arms around him she pinned his arms to his sides for gods sake stop the anchorwoman said come back and see me before i die jackie els was calling wild bill was still sitting in the street he had begun to wave goodbye to els too but anneke kicked him what a great idea bill she said you give a tour of the redlight district to a guy whose mom was a whore well i didnt know wild bill shouted richard helped him to his feet anneke removed a candybar wrapper from vanvlecks long gray ponytail they were walking away from els in her window toward the redlight district that was the most direct way back to the grand richard who was walking beside jack put his arm around him are you all right jack richard asked ill be fine jack told him but richard was sober enough to be worried about jack and they were fast becoming friends when you get back to la i know someone you could see richard said do you mean a psychiatrist jack asked dr garcía knows actors richard said you wouldnt be her first movie star the waving goodbye had stopped but jack could still see els lifting his dad off the pavement and carrying him like a child to femkes mercedes in all probability alice had put jack down on the deck and the boy could no longer see over the ships rail the damp night air blew into jacks face like ocean airlike the air blowing all the way from rotterdam to montreal which was where the ship was heading jack heard the women and girls in their windows and doorways calling out his name but he just kept walking brilliant jack heard richard say once for no apparent reason anneke was holding jacks arm againthis time as if to shield him from the greetings of the prostitutes when you get back to the hotel just go straight to bed and try to forget about it anneke whispered to him good night my dears wild bill was calling to the redlight women jack would forever feel the movement of the ship pulling out of the harborthe deck rolling under his fouryearold feet rotterdam receding how he wanted to see his fathers herbert hoffmannthe tattoo william got in hamburg if he got one a sailing ship seen from the stern the ship would be pulling away from shore hoffmanns sailors grave or his last porta tattoo like that was what william would have wanted jack felt pretty sure about it that was when jack knew he would have to find him in beverly hills the sun was now high enough in the sky that the slanted rays of light no longer came in the open windows miss wurtzs painted toenails were a lessbright shade of rosepink the black piano had taken on a more somber toneless like a pool of oil more like a coffin but even without direct sunlight the oscar standing beside their bare feet on the glasstopped table was no less goldno less dazzling i know that william saw you last night jack miss wurtz was saying i dont care what time of night or early morning it was in europe if thats where he is i just know that he wouldnt have missed seeing you caroline got up from the couch and kissed jack on the forehead holding her bathrobe tightly to her throat she bent over and kissed oscar on the top of his gleaming head im going to go to sleep you two she said jack watched her walk across the living room her hand trailing lightly for a moment on the keys of the black piano there was just the tinkling of those soft notes before she went into her bedroom and closed the door behind her jack got up and went into his bedroom and closed the door he left the curtains closed but he opened the windows some light came into the bedroom when the breeze stirred the curtains and he could hear the sound of a hose below him in the garden someone was watering the flowers oscar lay down beside jack the statuette had its own pillow jack looked at oscar lying there holding his alleged sword in the dim light oscar looked like a dead soldier maybe his comrades had found him on the battlefield and laid his body to rest in a dignified pose jack slept until the phone woke him that monday afternoon it was richard jack had forgotten that he and vanvleck and richard had agreed to go to a sound studio to record the commentary track for the dvd of their film they had to screen the entire movie pausing it occasionally while they talked about the intention behind this shot or that scenehow a particular moment had come about or how this line of dialogue or voiceover had actually been moved from somewhere else jack took a shower and got dressed he put the oscar on the piano on top of a note of explanation to miss wurtz she was still sleeping they would have dinner togethermaybe with richard and wild bill jack said in the note so that no one would steal the oscar or wake up miss wurtz jack left the do not disturb card on the door to the suite at the front desk he told them not to put through any calls then he walked out into the harsh sunlight and joined richard and wild bill in the limo for the ride to the sound studio wild bill had a bad hangover which had not been improved by anneke getting sick in the middle of the night something she ate wild bill told them i wish id eaten it too i wish it had killed me richard told jack that no hangover was as bad as not winning the oscar it seemed to take hours to record the dvd commentary as when jack first met with richard and wild bill in amsterdam his heart wasnt in it but jack liked the movie they had made together and when he watched the film he remembered how it had all come about whose idea was this wild bill would say from time to time yours i think richard would tell him it went pretty well all things considered wild bills hangover seemed to go away or else he rose to the occasion in a short while vanvleck was doing most of the talking there was almost a half hour when wild bill just talked nonstop it was amazing what he could remember but hearing the dutchmans voice like that was oddly dislocating jack could almost hear him asking you actually know this lady or when jack had explained that night in the sint jacobsstraat that els had been his nanny how wild bill had asked richard she was his what jack why are you crying the mad dutchman had also asked here they were in hollywood in a sound studio and wild bill vanvleck was going on about how theyd made emmas movie but in the drone of the dutchmans voice his actual words were lost jack saw wild bill sitting drunk in the street shouting to his girlfriend well i didnt know and later as they made their way through the redlight district jack could still hear vanvleck calling good night my dears well they had a job to dorichard wild bill and jackand they did it later that afternoon when jack got back to the four seasons he found miss wurtz in the living room of their suite playing the piano jack sat on the couch for a while and just listened the wurtz began to talk to him butat the same timeshe kept playing i want to thank you jacki had the best time it was quite a night for an old lady jacks neck was stiff and his toes hurtsomething hed done in the gym he was thinking but i must enlighten you jack miss wurtz went on dont take this the wrong way but not even a night like last night is as special to me as every night i spent with your father if i never got to go to the oscars i would still have had william in my lifethats all that matters and that was when jack knew why his neck was stiff and his toes hurt in those few hours of that early monday morning following the academy awardswhen he actually got to sleepjack knew what hed been dreaming he was standing on the deck of that ship leaving rotterdam and he was straining to see over the rail jack was standing on his toes and stretching his neck for the few hours he slept jack must have maintained this uncomfortable position no matter how hard he tried of course he couldnt see the shore jack burns may not have been a big believer in socalled recovered memory but here is what jack remembered listening to miss wurtz play the piano and he was sure it really happenedhe knew it was true lift me up jack had said to his mother on the deck of that ship the docks were still in sight but jack couldnt see them lift me up hed begged his mom i want to see but she wouldnt do it youve seen enough jack his mom had said she took his hand were going below deck now shed told him lift me up i want to see jack had demanded but alice was in no mood to be bossed around youve seen enough of holland to last you a lifetime jackie boy shed said under the circumstances jack had seen enough of canada to last him a lifetime too because the next country jack saw was canada where his mother took himwhere he would never see his dad signs of trouble it had been mrs machados fondest hope or so shed said that mister penis would never be taken advantage of but by whom by willful girls and venal women dr garcía told jack that many women who sexually molest children believe that they are protecting themthat what the rest of us might call abuse is for these women a form of mothering dr garcía further speculated that mrs machado must have observed a certain absence of the mothering instinct in alice women like mrs machado know which boys are vulnerable jacks psychiatrist said it helps of course if you know the boys motherif you see whats missing principiis obsta mr ramsey had once warned him beware the beginnings if jack had mother and father issues one wonders what to make of lucy she was four almost five that early fall evening in when jack discovered her in the backseat of her parents silver audihis first and last night as a parking valet at stans in venice when he saw lucy again in the waiting room of dr garcías office in santa monica it was more than a year after hed won the oscarapril or may lucy would have been eighteen jack didnt recognize her but she recognized him everyone did a pretty girlsomeones nanny jack had assumed hed long ago learned to expect and tolerate the stares of girls lucys age but lucys eyes were riveted to his face his hands his every glance and movement her keen interest in him went far beyond overt flirtation or the groupie thing jack almost asked the receptionist if he could wait in another room he didnt know if there were other roomsthat is other than a bathroom and a closetbut lucys wanton obsession with him was distressing then the problem appeared to go away they overlapped only that one time in dr garcías waiting room jack completely forgot about the girl the reason jack would remember the year and the season of his first reunion with lucy which at the time he didnt know was a reunion is that he was getting ready for a trip to halifaxhis first trip there since hed crossed the atlantic and landed in nova scotia in his mothers womb dr garcía had warned him against returning to his birthplace which she viewed as a possible setback to his therapy but jack had other business in halifax a notverygood canadian novelist and screenwriter doug mcswiney and a venerable french director cornelia lebrun wanted him to play the lead in a movie about the halifax explosion in they probably couldnt get adequate financing for the film without a movie star attached andgiven the offcenter nature of mcswineys screenplaynot just any movie star would do because of the crossdressing inclination of the main character the movie star had to be jack burns the character jack would play a transvestite prostitute loses his or her memory in the explosion when all his clothes are blown off and he suffers seconddegree burns over his entire body then he falls in love with his nurse at first jacks character doesnt remember that hes a transvestite prostitute but it wouldnt be a movie if his memory didnt return jack had some issues with the screenplay but hed always been interested in the halifax explosionand in seeing the city of his birth it appealed to him to work with cornelia lebrun as a director too she was by far the more accomplished element in this collaboration and when she proposed a meeting in halifaxwhere she was working with mcswiney urging him to improve his tortured scriptjack seized the opportunity to see his birthplace he would also have a chance to put in his two cents regarding doug mcswineys trivialization of the halifax disaster after jack had won the oscar hed said no to an uncountable number of offers many of these were suggested adaptations hed read a lot of novels looking for a possible adaptation that appealed to him but ever since jack had been telling the story of his life to dr garcía the idea of writing any screenplay paled jack burns was back in the acting business at least for the time beingor so he told bob bookman but after the oscar jack had been inclined to be picky about the acting opportunities too the thought of making a movie in halifax however intrigued him who knows what socalled recovered memories he might unlock there infant dreams and premonitions mainly jack imagined that was his state of mind in june when he drove to santa monica for his appointment with dr garcía it was a warm day when he parked the audi he left all the windows open jack had a number of reasons to be feeling positive three years after the fact he had described his return trip to all but one of the north sea ports of calland jack had discovered that he could tell dr garcía what had happened while managing to hold himself together in a few instances dr garcía had looked in danger of losing it furthermore jack was looking forward to his trip to halifaxno small part of the reason being that his going there was against dr garcías wishes and last but not least jack had just heard from michele maher this was all the more remarkable because he had not heard from her for well over a yearnot even so much as a postcard congratulating him for the academy award jack had concluded of course that the sortof boyfriend had taken stronger possession of her that the boyfriend had forbidden her to communicate with jack burns had also crossed jacks mind now came her long most informativeif not overaffectionateletter naturally jack showed micheles letter to dr garcía but the doctor wasnt pleased in jacks acceptance speech at the academy awards his thanking michele maher for staying up late to watch him had backfired it had prompted a heated discussion with her sortof boyfriendapparently on the subject of micheles commitment to him or lack thereof michele had never lived with anyone to her oldfashioned thinking cohabitation meant marriage and children living with someone wasnt supposed to be an experiment but because jack mentioned her nameto an audience of millionsmicheles sortof boyfriend insisted that they live together michele gave in though she stopped short of marriage and children he was a fellow doctor an internista friend of a friend shed known in medical school they were very much perhaps too much alike she wrote everything in dr mahers letter dr garcía said when shed finished reading it suggests a pragmatism unlike your approach to anything in this world jack but jack had come away with something a little different from micheles letterfor starters it hadnt worked out with the livein boyfriend a year of commitment in which ive never felt so uncommitted as michele put it she was living alone again she had no boyfriend she was finally free to congratulate jack for winning the oscar and to suggest thatwere he ever to find himself in the boston areathey should meet for lunch i realize that you dont get nominated for an oscar every year michele wrote moreover should you ever go back to the academy awards i wouldnt expect you to consider asking me to go with you again but in retrospect i might have spared myself an unhappy year by saying yes to you the first time theres more than a hint of a comeon in the in retrospect part isnt there dr garcía commented this was not phrased as a question she expected jack to answer this was simply dr garcías way of presuming his agreement spätervielleicht micheles letter concluded youll have to help me with the german dr garcía said almost as an afterthought laterperhaps jack translated hmm this was dr garcías way of downplaying the importance of something i could come back from halifax via boston he suggested how old is michelethirtyfive thirtysix dr garcía asked as if she didnt know yes shes my age jack replied most doctors are workaholics dr garcía said but like any woman her age micheles clock is ticking he should have told dr garcía about micheles letter in chronological order jack was thinking but he didnt say anything on the other hand she doesnt exactly sound like a starfucker does she dr garcía said she was just suggesting lunch jack said hmm there were no new photographs in dr garcías office there hadnt been any new photos in the three years hed been her patient but there wasnt any room for new ones not unless she threw some of the old ones away call me from halifax if you get in trouble jack i wont get in any trouble he told her dr garcía took a good look at the skyblue businesslike letterhead on micheles stationery before handing the letter back to him call me from cambridge massachusetts then she said i can almost guarantee you jackyoure going to get in trouble there at the time in the chronologicalorder part of his life story as told to dr garcía he was up to what miss wurtz called the second time in amsterdam understandably he was in no hurry to relate that part of his life story to the doctor jack thought that a little trip to halifax with a stopover in boston on the way back might do him a world of good when he came out into the waiting room jack was distracted by a womanone of the young mothers who was a regular patient of dr garcías she commenced to scream the second she saw him jack hated it when that happened the receptionist quickly led him to the montana avenue exit jack saw that another young mother or the screaming womans friend or nanny was trying to comfort the screamer whose wailing had frightened the children some of the kids were crying he got into his audi and tucked michele mahers letter under the sun visor on the drivers side he was approaching the intersection of montana avenue and fourth street when lucys face appeared in his rearview mirror jack almost had an accident when she said im not well enough behaved to eat in a grownup restaurant he still didnt get it jack knew only that hed last seen her in dr garcías waiting room but he didnt know who she was the nanny with groupie potential as hed thought of her i usually sleep on the floor if i think anyone can see me sleeping on the backseat the strange girl said i cant believe you keep buying audis and theyre always silver lucy jack said it took you long enough she told him but i didnt have any tits when you met me i guess its understandable that you didnt recognize me an unfortunate coincidence he realized lucy wasnt anyones nanny like jack she was one of dr garcías patients one of the less stable ones he would soon discover it was hard to see what faint resemblance she still bore to the worried but courageous little fouryearold jack had picked up in his arms at stans some of her courage had remained or it had hardened into something else now in her late teens lucy wasnt worried about anythingnot anymore she had deadcalm unblinking eyessuggesting the steely recklessness of a car thief if you dared her to do itor bet her five bucks that she couldntshe would drive foottothefloor through every red light on wilshire boulevard all the way from santa monica into beverly hills unless she got broadsided in brentwood or shot by a cop in westwood village thered be no stopping herher bare left arm would be lolling out the window giving everyone the finger the whole way jack turned right on ocean avenue and pulled the audi to the curb i think you better get out of the car lucy he said ill take off all my clothes before you can get me out of the backseat the girl told him jack held the steering wheel in both hands looking at lucy in his rearview mirror she was wearing a pink tank topbarely more than a sports braand black puma running shorts like a jogger jack knew she could take off everything she was wearing in the time it would take him to get out of the drivers seat and open the back door what do you want lucy he asked her lets go to your house she said i know where you live and i got a helluva story to tell you you know where i live he asked the girl my mom and i drive by your house all the time she told him but we never see you i guess youre not there much or something lets just talk in the car jack suggested its kind of a long story the girl explained in the rearview mirror he could see that she was wriggling her running shorts down over her hips her thong was pink it didnt look as if it would be comfortable to run in please pull your shorts up he said well go to my house she was wearing dirty running shoes with those short socks that all the kids seemed to likethe kind that didnt even cover your ankles she walked all over jacks house on the balls of her feet as if she were imitating mr ramseyor else she was too restless to sit down jack followed her around like a dog it was as if they were in lucys house and she was in charge when you headbutted my dad that was a lifechanging moment lucy told him that was when my mom decided shed had enough of him i remember she screamed at him all the way home they wouldve been divorced before breakfast the next morning if my mom couldve arranged it in my experience you dont remember things with much accuracy when youre four years old he cautioned her you were my mothers fucking hero lucy said you think i wouldnt remember that when you got famous we went to all your movies and my mom said theres the guy who got me out of my miserable marriage of course my dad hated you when they were divorced i had to listen to him talk about you too if i ever run into jack burns he wont know what hit him my dad was always shouting your dad didnt handle himself too well the first time jack pointed out to her let me tell youif my mom ever ran into you shed fuck your brains out and then tell my dad all about it lucy said all my life youve been such a big fucking deal in my family i was just appalled that your mom and dad would leave a fouryearold in the back of their carin venice he said lucy was fingering the tattoo magnets alice had given jack for his fridge japanese flashirezumi henk schiffmacher had called them there were half a dozen magnets the size of quarters jack had used them to hold the four photographs of his moms naked torso against the refrigerator doorfour slightly different views of her until i find you tattoo which he saw lucy looking at very closely but lucy wouldnt settle down she went off to have a look at the stuff on jacks desk the flat glass paperweight which slightly magnified the photo of emma naked at seventeen was an eyecatcher hed always thought that one day he would regret keeping one of those photographs which claudia had asked him to get rid of i gotta use your bathroom lucy said there were two other bathrooms in the house but she waltzed right through jacks bedroom and went into his bathroom and closed the door jack had converted emmas former bedroom into a small gymtwo kinds of stationary bikes a treadmill an ab machine some benches and a lot of free weights there were no mirrors on the wallsjust some of his favorite movie posters including a couple from films hed been in there was a mat on the floor for stretching and rolling arounda long rectangle about a third of a regulationsize wrestling mat jack sat down on the mat and hugged his knees to his chest wondering what he should do about lucy he heard the toilet flush and the water running in the sink he heard the girl come out of the bathroom and pick up the telephone on the night table next to his bed jack could tell by her automatic tone of voice that she was talking to an answering machine hi momits me he heard lucy say im in jack burnss house im naked im in his bed isnt this what you always wanted sorry i beat you to it but whats it matter the thought of you or me with jack burns is gonna drive dad crazy love ya jack went into his bedroom and saw that lucy hadnt been kidding shed pulled back the covers and was lying naked on his bed now were going to get in trouble lucy said maybe you are lucy but im not he told her he walked past her into the bathroom he was intending to bring her clothes to her but he couldnt see her clothes or imagine what shed done with them shed put her dirty running shoes with the little socks on his bathroom scale but the rest of her clothes were gone how could they just disappear he was thinking jack went back into the bedroom youre leaving now lucy where are your clothes she shrugged yes she was a pretty eighteenyearold even jack could count the years from when he first came to la and add them to four and after all hed been doing a lot of thinking about fouryearolds lately but jack wasnt even considering having sex with lucy not even if it was legalthat wasnt the issue she was one of those willfully grimy girls with flecks of gold glitter in her hair every toenail was painted a different color the fingershaped citron known as buddhas hand was tattooed on the inside of one thighhigh up where her running shorts had covered it some young women were more arousing before they took their clothes off besides jack had never liked being bullied ill give you a tshirt and some running shorts of mine he said ill dress you myself lucy if you dont get yourself dressed and get out of here my moms already called the cops she told him shes home all day with nothing to do she just screens all her calls in case its my dad im telling you shes already played my message twiceshes already given the cops your address and everything jack went into the kitchen and picked up the phone there he called and said he had an unwelcome eighteenyearold girl in his houseshe had hidden herself in his car now shed undressed herself and called her mother he hadnt touched her jack saidhe didnt want to touch her if the girl wont dress herself maybe one of the officers you send should be female he said jack was asked if this was a domestic dispute did he know the girl i havent had any contact with her since she was a fouryearold he shouted well that meant he did know her didnt it jack was asked he should have seen that coming look she thinks im the reason her mother and father got divorced she and her mother are obsessed with me her father hates me you know the whole family he was asked when jack gave his address he got a quick wait a minute in response a squad car had already been dispatched naturally thered been an earlier calllucys mother the first caller had said something about a rapeinprogress thats not true jack shouted the toilet keeps flushing lucy called from the bedroom forget the cops you better call a plumber jack hung up the phone and stomped back through his bedroom to the bathroom lucy had put her clothes in the watertank part of the toilet they were soaked jack put them in the bathtub the rod that held the ball was bent out of shape that was why the toilet kept flushing at least he knew what to do about that when jack went back into the bedroom lucy was writhing all around on his bed the bedcovers were completely untucked and one of the pillows had been flung on the floor the bed looked as if hed just had sex with several eighteenyearoldsall of them gymnasts this is nothing but a big nuisance he told the little bitch believe me youre not going to think this is so funny when they check you for bodily fluids im just so sick of hearing how you fucked up my entire family the girl shouted jack walked out of the bedroom closing the door behind him he went outside and stood leaning against his audi in the driveway he was still waiting for the police to arrive when he noticed the photographer an overfamiliar paparazzobest known for his photos of a young actress barfing in a swimming pool at a wedding in westwood jack saw the paparazzo looking at him through the long telephoto lens from the far side of the street when the cops came jack was glad that one of the two was a female officer jack told her where lucy was and the policewoman went into the house to find her while he told his story to the other officer are you sure shes eighteen the policeman interrupted jack once otherwise he just listened the paparazzo had crossed the street and was photographing them from the foot of jacks driveway she cant wear her own clothestheyre all wet jack was explaining to the officer just before lucy ran naked out the front door and threw her arms around jacks neck the policeman tried to shield her from the photographer the female officer came out of the house carrying a bath towel she tried to wrap the towel around lucy but lucy kept wriggling out of the towel it took both officers to disengage the girl from around jacks neck jack just stood there doing his best not to touch lucy while the paparazzo kept snapping away if the photographer had taken one step up the driveway jack might have broken all the fingers on the guys handsone finger at a time even with the police officers there i suppose stuff like this happens to you on a regular basis the male cop was saying to jack whatever hes been telling you ill bet its true the female officer told her partner if this girl were my daughter id be tempted to drown her in a toilet she was a tall lean black woman with a despairing expression that was accented by a scar the scar had dug a groove through one of her eyebrows her partner was a husky white guy with a crew cut and paleblue eyes his eyes were as calm and unblinking as lucys be sure to check her for evidence of bodily fluids jack told the officers in case im lying the black woman smiled dont you get in trouble too she told him behave yourself wed like to have a look inside your house just to corroborate a few things the husky policeman said sure jack told him it was a long day jack kept looking out the window he was hoping the paparazzo would come onto his property but the photographer maintained his vigil at the foot of the driveway after the police took lucy awayjack insisted on giving lucy the bath towelthe photographer went away too jack was surprised that both police officers never once appeared to doubt his story but the female officer had cautioned him about the photos of alices breasts and her tattoo on the refrigerator when jack explained the history of the photographs the policewoman said that doesnt matter if theres ever any trouble here you dont want pictures like those on your fridge he showed her the photo of emma naked at seventeenthe one under the paperweight on his desk ditto he asked her youre learning the female officer said i sense that you have real potential after everyone had gone jack found lucys thong in his bathtub it was so small that the police must have missed it he put it in the trash together with the four photos of his mom and the old one of emma if he hadnt been leaving for halifax in the morning jack might have been more careful about the trash it would make sense to him laterhow the magazine that bought the paparazzos photographs had sent someone to the house on entrada drive to sort through jacks trash it made sense that the magazine would talk to lucy tooand that she would dismiss the incident as a prank all jack said when the magazine later asked him for a commentallegedly for a followup storywas that the police had behaved properly first of all theyd believed jack wasnt lucy the one theyd taken away you figure it out jack said to the woman from the magazine who called herself a diligent factchecker he meant that the police hadnt taken him away had they but jack knew nothing about any of this when he left in the morning for halifax given all the things that had happened to himthe bad choices hed made those years he would regretthe lucy episode struck him as a virtual nonevent he didnt even call dr garcía and tell her about it let her wait let her hear about it in chronological order jack thought but sometimes even a nonevent will be registered in the public consciousness jack had done nothing to lucyexcept try to look after her when she was four but in a scandalmongering movie magazine complete with photos the girls irritating prank would carry with it a whiff of something truly scandalous it would appear as if jack burns had gotten away with something this would be hard to say to dr garcía when the time came butalthough it didnt yet exista trap had been set for jack lucy wasnt the trap but she was a contributing factor to a trap that waited in his future that nice female officer had tried to tell him jack had thrown away the photographs but the photos hadnt been all she was warning him about if theres ever any trouble here wasnt that how shed put it halifax jack called michele mahers office on his cell phone en route to the airport it was very early in the morning in la but dr mahers nurse answered the phone in the doctors cambridge office it was three hours later in massachusetts the nurse was a friendly soul named amanda who informed him that dr maher was with a patient jack told amanda who he was and where he was going he said hed gone to school with michelethat was as far as he got with their history i know all about it amanda said everyone in the office wanted to kill her for not going to the oscars with you oh are you going to have lunch with her amanda asked jack guessed that everyone in the office knew about the letter michele had written him possibly amanda had typed it jack explained that he was hoping to see dr maher on his return trip from halifax hed booked a stopover in boston if michele was free for dinner that night or lunch the next daythat was as far as he got so now its dinner amanda said eagerly maybe lunch and dinner maybe breakfast jack told amanda that he would call later in the week from halifaxjust to be sure dr maher had the time to see him you should stay at the charles hotel in cambridge you can walk to the hospital and our office i can reserve a room for you if you want amanda told him the hotel has a gym and a pool and everything thank you amanda he said that would be very niceif dr maher has the time to see me whats with the dr maher amanda exclaimed jack didnt bother to tell amanda to reserve a room for him at the charles under a different name although not only michele but everyone in the office would know that jack burns was in town and where he was staying as interested as jack was in the halifax explosion or the idea of making a movie in his birthplace he was by no means committed to the role of the amnesiac transvestite prostitute in doug mcswineys screenplay in fact the more jack thought about the issues he had with mcswineys script the less he felt like registering in any hotel as an amnesiac transvestite prostitute at the hotel in halifax hed made the reservation in his own name jack thanked amanda for her friendliness and help and gave her the phone number of his hotel in halifax and his cellphone numberjust in case michele wanted to call him jack had sufficient airplane reading for the trip beginning with doug mcswineys screenplay which he read two more times called the halifax explosion mcswineys script was purportedly based on michael j birds the town that dieda chronicle of the halifax disaster first published in birds book which was by far the best of jacks airplane reading had been rendered a disservice on december two ships collided in the narrowsa milelong channel only five hundred yards wide that connects bedford basin with halifax harbor and the open sea a french freighter the mont blanc was bound for bordeaux loaded with munitions for the war effort a norwegian vessel the imo had arrived in halifax from rotterdam and was sailing to new york the mont blancs cargo included more than two thousand tons of picric acid and two hundred tons of tnt upon impact the mont blanc caught fire less than an hour later the ships lethal cargo blew up people were watching the burning ship from almost everywhere in town they didnt know they were about to be blown up too almost two thousand people were killed nine thousand injured and two hundred blinded the explosion leveled the north end of the city which bird describes as a wilderness a vast burning scrap yard hundreds of children were killed there was incalculable damage to other ships in the harbor and to the piers and dockyards and the naval collegein addition to the wellington barracks and the dartmouth side of the narrows where the captain and crew of the mont blanc had swum ashore jack thought that the character of the french captain aimé le medec was the most challenging for an actor bird describes him as not more than feet inches in height but well built with a neatly trimmed black beard to add authority to his somewhat youthful face a contemporary of le medec called the captain a likeable but moody man at times inclined to be truculent and a competent rather than a brilliant sailor jack burns wasnt that short butas an actoreven le medecs physique appealed to him and jack was good at accents in the inquiry following the disaster much was made of the fact that the mont blancs pilot frank mackey didnt speak french le medec who spoke english was disinclined to speak the language because he didnt like it when people misunderstood him mackey and le medec had communicated with hand signals jack liked everything he read about this truculent french captain in jacks view that was the role he should have been offered and the screenplay should have stuck to the facts which were interesting enough without creating fictional characters to coexist with the historical figures the canadian authorities in halifax found captain le medec and his pilot frank mackey responsible for the collision in the narrows the supreme court of canada later found that both ships were to blamethey were equally liable but le medec and his crew were french in the eyes of many englishspeaking canadians not just nova scotians the french were to blame for everything the french director cornelia lebrun took the view that le medec deserved only half the blame the french government would take no action against le medec who didnt retire from the sea until whereafter he was made a chevalier de la légion dhonneur but this didnt explain madame lebruns attachment to doug mcswineys script in which le medec is a minor character and the halifax explosion itself is given merely a supporting role mcswiney had an eye for the periphery following the disaster bird comments in passing many halifax prostitutes moved to toronto or montrealto return later when conditions had improved as for those prostitutes who never left town business was brisk perhaps it was from this small mention of the life of prostitutes in halifax that doug mcswiney invented his peripheral story at some water street location this is given scant mention in birds book a prostitute watches a customera merchant seamanleaving her door and going off in the direction of the waterfront its early morning the mont blanc is about to explode in mcswineys screenplay this prostitute or someone based on her breathes in the cold morning air a little too long the blast rips the whores clothes off detaches her wig and hurls her into the airrevealing to the audience that the prostitute now naked and burning is a man jack burns of coursewho else while devastation reigns the amnesiac transvestite prostitute is taken to a hospital pitiful sights abound as bird writes two hundred children the matron and every other member of the staff died under the fallen roof and walls of the protestant orphanage on campbell road those who were not killed outright were slowly burned to death yet the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for jacks character an amnesiac transvestite prostitute despite the many burned women and children in the hospital an attractive nurse feels especially sympathetic toward jacks character the historical background of the film which is given short shrift is intercut with the amnesia victims slow recovery and the evolving love affair with his nurse the transvestite prostitute cant remember who he isnot to mention what he was doing naked flying and burning in the air above water street at a little after am on that fateful thursday when he is well enough to leave the hospital the nurse takes him home with her there then comes the inevitable scene in which the amnesia victim recovers his memory knowing jack burns you can see this coming the nurse has gone off to work at the hospital and jacks character wakes up in her bedroom he spots one of her uniforms on a chairher clothes from the day before he puts them on and when he sees himself in the mirrorwell you can imagine flashbacks galore unseemly behavior in female attire thus the audience is treated to a second version of the halifax explosion we get to see the disastrous life of a transvestite prostitute leading up to that other disasterthe real one as bird observes in this moment of agony a greater number had been killed or injured in halifax than ever were to be in any single air raid on london during the whole of world war ii but what was doug mcswiney thinking jack hated those movie meetings where he went in knowing that he detested the script but he liked the director and the idea behind the film he knew he would be perceived as the interfering movie star who was trying to distort the material to better serve himself or in this casein doug mcswineys eyes without a doubtthe academy awardwinning screenwriter talk about beginners luck who was trying to tell a writer of mcswineys vastly greater experience how to write aside from halifax being his birthplace jack was beginning to wonder why he had comethis being well before he touched down in nova scotia where he had last landed in utero thirtysix years before maybe this would set back his therapy as dr garcía had warned jack checked into the prince george he made a dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant called the press gang the restaurant was virtually across the street from the corner of prince and barrington where william burns had once played the organ in st pauls close by on argyle and prince was the st pauls parish house where the anglicans had put up jacks pregnant mother it might even have been the building where jack was born no csection required st pauls was built with white wooden clapboards and shingles in in memory of the halifax explosion the church had preserved an unfrosted secondstory windowa broken window facing argyle street when the mont blanc exploded a hole had been blown in the window in the shape of a human head the face in profile especially the nose and chin reminded jack of his mothers the organ in st pauls had been erected in memory of an organist whod died in the organ pipes were blue and white and there was a second commemoration of another organist to the glory of god and in grateful memory of natalie littler organist they must have needed a new organist in there was no commemoration of william burns who jack hoped was still among the living hed come to halifax to play the organ in st pauls in god knows how long william had stayed there was no mention of his ever being there jack went outside the church and stood in the old burying ground on barrington street looking in the direction of halifax harbor he was wondering what would have happened if he and his mother had stayed in halifaxif they might have been happy there jack knew that what was called the explosion window in st pauls churchthat perfectly preserved head in profile which memorialized the disasterwas better material for a movie about the halifax explosion than that pieceofcrap screenplay doug mcswiney had written jack was embarrassed to have come all this way for a meeting about a film he knew would never be madenot with jack burns as the amnesiac transvestite prostitute anyway furthermore jack didnt ever want to meet doug mcswiney he decided he should just tell cornelia lebrun how he felt about the project and leave it at that jack knew there were a lot of movie meetings that could be avoided if people just told one another how they felt before they met jack knew that cornelia lebrun was staying at the prince george too but hed learned from emma that it was better to express yourself in writingespecially if youre pissed off about something before dinner jack had just enough time to go back to the hotel and write out what he should have told the french director in a simple phone call from los angeles he had a personal interest in spending a little time in halifax jack explained to her but he would not be associated with a film about the halifax explosion that trivialized the disaster jack wrote that he was attracted to the character of le medec and wanted to know more about him jack pointed out to cornelia lebrun that his physique was suitable for the role of le medec and that the sea captains reported moodiness and truculence were well within jacks range as an actor he mentioned his gift for accents too another good role among the real people involved in the historical disaster was that of frank mackey the pilot who didnt speak french and there was a third role of interest to any actorthat of c j burchell the counsel for the norwegian shipping company at that time burchell was the bestknown maritime lawyer on the eastern seaboard representing the imos owners burchell wasin birds wordscapable of the most ruthless courtroom tactics given the judges bias in favor of the imo and how local opinion was stacked against the mont blanc and the french burchell must have been further encouraged to attack and browbeat witnesses what need was there for a fictional story jack asked cornelia lebrun in his letter with almost two thousand people killed and nine thousand injuredwith nearly two hundred blindedwho cared about an amnesiac transvestite prostitute who gets burned a little and loses his or her clothes and his memory and his wig jack told the french director that mcswineys screenplay in a word sucked dr garcía would have cautioned jack against this particular interjection andas things turned outshe would have been right but thats what he wrote in the heat of the moment he apologized for wasting madame lebruns and mr mcswineys time by agreeing to a meeting in halifax which he now believed was pointless jack added that his one look at the socalled explosion window in st pauls church drove home to him how mcswiney had managed to write a disaster movie both prurient and banal hed made a sordid love story out of the halifax explosion jack forgot to tell cornelia lebrun that he remained interested in working with her as a director which of course had initially persuaded him that the meeting in halifax was a good idea he also forgot to tell her that hed been involved in enough crossdressing to satisfy whatever slight yearning he might have felt for transvestite roles as an actor jack didnt feel it was asking too much to be allowed to be a man notwithstanding these omissions he left a great mess of pages at the front desk of the hotela virtual ream of prince george stationery to be delivered to madame lebruns room then jack went off to the press gang restaurant for a solitary dinner when jack returned to the hotel he inquired at the front desk if cornelia lebrun had left a message for him he was told she was in the bar jack had only a dim idea of what the french director looked like a small woman in her sixtiesabout the same age as miss wurtz he thought he spotted her easily how many women in halifax were likely to wear a suede pantsuit in lilypad green cornelia jack said to the little frenchwoman whose lipstick was a bold orange zzzhhhack burns she cried but before he could kiss her offered cheek a large hirsute man forced his way between them the man was bigger than any of his bookjacket photographs and more hairy than a lumberjack jack had been unable to read the furfaced authors novels due to the persistence of the rugged outdoors on every pagea characteristic relentlessness in the prose fir trees bent by the wind the gray rock of the canadian shield the pitiless seaharsh weather and hard drinking even the whisky on the authors breath was bracingdoug mcswiney of course jack was reaching to shake his hand when mcswineys left hook caught him on the right temple jack never saw it coming suck on that mcswiney said but jack heard only the suck he was out on his feet before he fell he should have had the brains to expect a cheap shot from a writer insensitive enough to turn the halifax explosion into an unwholesome love story jack came to in his hotel room he was lying on his back on his bed with his clothes on but his shoes off his head was pounding cornelia lebrun was sitting on the bed beside him she had wrapped a wet washcloth around some ice cubes which she held against the swollen bruise on jacks right temple the drunken bearded bastard could have killed me jack was thinking eets my fauld madame lebrun was saying i cant read english when eets in writingbyhand longhand jack corrected her i asked dougie to read your notes out lout to me beeeg faux pas oui i theenk the word sucked was what deed eet to heem or banalor prurient maybe oui alzo hees dreenking ive had bad reviews myself jack told her i didnt try to club roger ebert to death with my oscar clup who to dead the little frenchwoman asked it doesnt matter i dont want to be in the movie he told her i would cast a frenchman to play le medec zzzhhhackno matter how goot your axzent ees she would never get the movie made anyway later that year after the terrorist attacks on september it would be too difficult to find financing for a film about the halifax explosioneven with a movie star in it suddenly disaster movies werent all that appealing this feeling would persist for a whole year or more something about the halifax explosion appeared on canadian television but that happened a couple of years later and jack never saw it he didnt even know if it was a documentary or what miss wurtz would have called a dramatization jack only knew that doug mcswiney had had nothing to do with it and after that introduction in the bar of the prince george jack doubted that he would ever work with cornelia lebrun the hotel sent a female doctor to jacks room while madame lebrun was still attending to his head injury the doctor told jack that he had a mild concussion from the beat of his pulse in his right temple he might have disputed the word mild with her she also told him that he shouldnt sleep for more than two hours at a time the doctor left instructions at the front desk to give jack burns a wakeup call every two hours if he didnt answer his phone someone had to go into his room and wake him up and he shouldnt travel for another day the doctor said that night between the wakeup calls he had dreams of being on a movie set hold the talking please someone on the set would say for what seemed like the hundredth time pictures up stand by it made jack realize that he missed the process maybe it had been too long since hed made a movie in the morning jack walked along barrington street looking for something to read he found a bookstore called the book room the owner recognized him and invited him to have a coffee with him jack volunteered to sign some booksjust what they had on hand of the screenplay of the slushpile reader emmas paperback publisher had published the script in most bookstores the screenplay was on the shelf alongside the movie tiein edition of emmas novel the booksellers name was charles burchell he turned out to be the grandson of c j burchell the legendary maritime lawyer whod led the courtroom attack on the mont blancs captain and pilot when jack told charles that he thought hed been born in the st pauls parish house charles told jack that the vestry of the church had been used as an emergency hospital in the days following the halifax explosion the bodies of hundreds of victims had been laid in tiers around the walls charles was kind enough to take jack on a tour of the harbor jack wanted to see the ocean terminals particularly the pier where the immigrants landed charles also drove jack to the fairview lawn cemetery jack was curious to see the titanic grave site halifax had seen its share of disasters jack walked with charles among the gravestones erected to the memory of an unknown child whose remains were recovered after the disaster to the titanic april there were many more alma paulson aged years lost with four children some were just names with their ages toburg dandria aged paul folke aged stina viola aged gosta leonard aged others were just numbers died april a small headstone marked j dawson had the largest number of flowersbouquets of flowers dwarfed the headstone almost obscuring the oddly familiar name charles told jack why the name was familiar the character leonardo dicaprio played in the titanic movie was named jack dawson you dont mean he was real jack said i have no idea charles said the j dawson on the headstone could have been a different dawson jack dawson dicaprios character might have been invented but since the movie had been released visitors to the titanic grave site put flowers on j dawsons headstone because they believed he was that character worsewhether or not jack dawson in the movie was related to j dawson on the headstone the young girls bringing flowers thought there was someone in that grave who had once looked like leonardo dicaprio movies jack said with disgust charles laughed but jack saw it thenthis was where that hairfaced novelist and screenwriter had gotten the idea to make a love story out of the halifax explosion it was a bad idea to begin with but it hadnt even been mcswineys idea hed stolen it from the titanic movie hed ripped it off from a graveyard full of children does doug mcswiney come from halifax jack asked charles burchell since charles was a bookseller jack knew that charles would know born and raised charles said hes an awful manhes always punching people the titanic grave site gave jack additional grounds for wanting to kick the crap out of mcswiney and jack still had a headache as cheap shots go a blow to someones temple is asking for trouble jack went back to the hotel and took a short nap he probably did have a concussion mild or not because he wasnt feeling well he was wondering why michele maher hadnt called himjust to say she was looking forward to lunch or dinner or whatever maybe she was shy probably she was busy jack didnt sleep very soundly or for long at the first ring of the wakeup call he sat up too suddenly and saw stars the stars continued to twinkle while he brushed his teeth a separated shoulder would be a justifiable injury to inflict on doug mcswiney jack was thinking given that mcswiney had hit jack with a left hook he was probably righthanded if so a separated right shoulder would be a good idea jack called dr mahers office and once again got micheles nurse amanda on the phone hi amandaits jack burns im calling to confirm breakfast lunch and dinner he could tell right away that something was wrong the formerly friendly amanda was icecold to him dr maher is with a patient the nurse said whats with the dr maher amanda no breakfast no lunch no dinner amanda said dr maher doesnt want to see youshe wont even talk to you i canceled your reservation at the charles maybe ive misunderstood you jack said i have a concussion that girl gave you a concussion amanda asked what girl im talking about the lucy businessthe photographs the whole story dont they have news in canada jack could see that flaming paparazzo as if the photographer were still standing at the foot of the driveway snapping away one of the sleazier movie magazines had bought the photographs the story and the tamer of the photos had also been on television you dont come off very well amanda explained i did not have sex with that young woman he told her im sure you didnt amanda said the girl just knew that you wanted to and that you definitely would have had sex if she hadnt called her mother thats not true i called the cops and asked them to come get her i waited outside my own house until the police came you had a naked eighteenyearold in your bedyou even have the same psychiatrist amanda pointed out you knew lucy when she was a childyou beat up her father and why did you keep her thong and those terrible pictures there was a photo of what looked like another naked eighteenyearold on your desk there were photographs of a naked womans tattooed breast on your refrigerator i threw all that away jack shouted where on your front lawn the nurse asked please let me speak to michele he begged her michele said if jack calls tell him hes just too weird for me thats what the doctor said amanda told him hanging up the phone jack turned on the television in his hotel room it took him a while to find an american network among the canadian tv channels although as leslie oastler would soon inform him the lucy story had already been picked up by the canadian media when he found headline news jack discovered that he was the lead item in the entertainment segment when lucy was told that her pink thong had been recovered from jacks trashtogether with those incriminating photographs which lucy had earlier described to reportersshe speculated that jack must have wanted to have some keepsake of her visit and had therefore hidden her thong from the police apparently hed had second thoughts and had thrown out the thong with the other evidence the thong looked really small on tv it appeared that jack had stolen it from a child jack needed to see the sleazy magazine itself before he could understand everything that was incriminating about the photographsthat is the ones not fit for television he left the hotel and walked over to the book room charles burchell was a bookseller charles would know where every newsstand in halifax was naturally charles already had a copy of the movie magazine i called you at the hotel jack but they said you were napping none of the saleswomen in the book room would look at jack theyd all seen the photos and had read the insinuating story the magazines cover photo was of lucy hanging naked from around jacks neck resembling a pornographic ornament both police officers appeared to be struggling as much with jack as with lucy the photographs inside the magazineparticularly the ones that had been rescued from his trashwere no less condemning the pink thong was not only very small it was still wet emma naked at seventeen had been doctored for magazine propriety jack thought that the black slash across emmas eyes made her unrecognizable even to anyone who knew her at that age and who but jack had really known her naked at that age hed forgotten that mrs oastler was familiar with that photograph in the case of those photos of his mother the movie magazine had selected only one there were two black slashes across alices nipples the photo of emma had been so badly mangled in the trash that you couldnt see her nipples very distinctly the magazine hadnt bothered to conceal them although theyd had the decency to crop the photograph above emmas waist dr garcía was mentioned in the article jack was sure that she would have refused to comment but a former patient whose name was withheld and who described the therapists methods as unorthodox to say the least said that dr garcía strongly discouraged her patients from dating one another jack knew perfectly well that dr garcía didnt believe for a moment that he was dating lucy but everyone knows what kind of magazine would do this the story is implied and nothing is stated even the headline the very name of the article was deliberately misleading in the case of the lucy story the headline was a real winner jack burns denies any hanky panky but whats he hiding in his trash jack hadnt done anything but he looked guilty it was too weird as michele would say charles burchell was a good guy he gave jack his heartfelt condolences jack had a pounding headache by the time he got back to the prince george he took a couple of tylenol or maybe it was advilhe wouldnt remember taking anything jack had fun calling his number in la and listening to all the messages on his answering machine commiserations from richard gladstein bob bookman and alan hergott wild bill vanvleck had called from amsterdam jack found out later that the mad dutchmans anchorwoman girlfriend had been the first to report the scandal in the netherlands someone with a st hildas connection had alerted leslie oastler to the story mrs oastler was hopping mad i cant believe you kept that photograph of emma and those pictures of your mother you idiot jack im surprised you havent called me he heard dr garcías voice say on his answering machine i trust youve changed your mind about the stopover in boston or that michele has changed her mind about it and i wouldnt recommend any further contact with lucy jack we might want to reconsider how much time you spend in the waiting room you might run into lucys mother jack wondered how the sleazy movie magazine had missed that little tidbitnamely that lucys mom was also dr garcías patient it made perfect sense that she would be somebodys patient once in the waiting room one of the young mothers had explained to jack that dr garcía was unique among all the psychiatrists shed ever seen you didnt have to make an appointment apparently this young mother tended to feel the need to see her psychiatrist on the spur of the moment many of the young mothers in dr garcías waiting room said that they found the presence of other young mothers comforting it was such a loose arrangement no therapist in new york or vienna would have allowed it no psychiatrists patient in new york or vienna would have accepted the situation either but loose arrangements were what jack appreciated about living in santa monica he gave his plane tickets to the concierge at the prince george and asked her to do what she could to change his flights just get me back to los angeles tomorrowthe most direct way you can he told her no stopover in boston please then jack went off to the press gang where he had made another dinner reservation he hadnt eaten all day and was hungry jack sat alone at his small table and ordered one of the appetizers except for his table for one the restaurant was crowded and noisy maybe the press gang seemed noisier than it was because jack was alone and had a concussion he sat facing a window with his back to the other tables hed brought a book with himsomething charles had recommendedbut when he tried to read his headache came back and the noise in the restaurant was amplified the table nearest him was the loudest but jack couldnt see the people at that table if they were looking at him all they could see was his back one loudmouth in particular was the dominant storyteller he was braying about an altercation in a hotel baraccording to him it had been a fair fight fucking wrestlers he shouted they cant take a punch that certainly got jacks attention concussion and all jack burns landed like a dead fish the man was telling his friends as someone engaged in telling the story of his life in chronological order jack had discovered that what many people lazily referred to as coincidences werent necessarily coincidental one might think for example that it was coincidental for jack to find himself in the same restaurant with doug mcswineyonly one night after the fat furfaced author had coldcocked jack with a sucker punch but halifax was not a big city and the press gang was a popular place jack tried to get a look at him but mcswineys broad back was all there was to see the way one of the writers friends suddenly recognized jack jack could tell that none of them had known he was theremcswiney hadnt been telling his tale for jacks benefit jack got up from his table and walked over to mcswiney the big mans friends let mcswiney know that jack was there but the bastard didnt stop his story the little lightweight just lay there mcswiney was saying jack stood beside mcswiney but a little behind him there were three couples at the table jack couldnt tell which of the women was with mcswiney the two men were smiling at jackthey were almost smirkingbut the women were expressionless as they observed the unfolding drama i want to apologize jack said to doug mcswiney those notes i wrote about your screenplay werent meant for you i would never have expressed myself that frankly that personallynot to you directly it was only because cornelia couldnt read my handwriting that she showed those notes to you she cant read english if its in longhand i hope you know it was an accident i wouldnt have said anything to intentionally hurt your feelings now mcswineys two male friends were definitely smirking but the women were smarter women had always known how to read jack burns jack wasnt really apologizinghe was just being nice twice as mrs wicksteed had taught him back in the bar at the prince george when hed offered to shake doug mcswineys hand that had been being nice the first time of course jack knew that mcswiney was too drunk and too belligerent to understand this the author just went on with his story that little frenchwoman called the bellman and together they loaded jack burns on a luggage cartthey wheeled him off to his room like a baby in a stroller mcswiney was saying the two men laughed but the women didnt the women were tense and watchful when jack put his hand on the back of mcswineys neck and gently pushed the big shaggy head in the direction of the fat mans dinner plate he already knew that mcswiney was the stronger of the two jack was prepared for the big man to place both hands on the table and push himself to his feet jack never expected to hold mcswiney down with one hand jack just wanted mcswiney to spread his arms and brace himself against the table because that made it easier for jack to slap the full nelson on him before mcswiney could stand up jack overlapped one hand with the other on the back of mcswineys neck and drove the writers face into his paella up to his ears jack could feel the warm food on his wrists an errant shrimp coated with saffroncolored rice flew off the platealso a sausage mcswiney rooted around in the paella trying to clear some space to breathe in wrestling theres more than one reason why a full nelson is illegal yes you can break someones neck with the hold butfrom a wrestling point of viewthats not the only thing wrong with it its nearly impossible to pin someone with a full nelsonunless you break your opponents neck in the process and the hold is very hard to get out of in addition to a full nelson being dangerous its also a stalling tactic mcswiney wasnt going anywhere he had no leverage especially sitting in a chair jack kept pushing mcswiney into the paella the furfaced writers forehead was pressed against the bottom of the plate from the sound of him he must have gotten some rice up his nose mcswineys two male friends werent smirking now jack never took his eyes off them if one of them had stood up jack would have changed the full nelson to a chickenwing with which he would have driven mcswineys right elbow past his right earin all likelihood breaking the collarbone but almost certainly separating mcswineys right shoulder then jack would have gone after one of the other two guys starting with the tougherlooking one but jack could see that there wasnt going to be any trouble the two men just sat there mcswiney was bigger than both of them together and they could observe for themselves that their friend wasnt doing too well the women were more fidgety than the men they exchanged glances with one another and they kept looking at jacks facenot at mcswineys head in the paella mcswiney sounded as if he were still eating but there was something more nasal than eating involved if the big man had started to choke jack would have tipped him out of his chair and put a gutwrench on him until mcswiney threw up on the floor but that wasnt necessary the writer was breathing okay just noisily a fat man doesnt breathe too comfortably with his chin on his chest even without the paella factor writers jack said more to mcswineys friends than to mcswiney they cant even eat without saying too much one of the women smiled which may or may not have eliminated her as the woman who was with mcswiney jack ground his chin into the top of mcswineys head he wanted to be sure that mcswiney could hear him theres another thing about your screenplay jack told him just what do you think would have happened to a transvestite prostitute in a town full of sailors in some sailor would have killed himlong before the halifax explosion could have done the job the story isnt only prurient and banalits also unbelievable jack could tell that mcswiney was trying to say something but jack wasnt about to let the overweight author wriggle out of his paella the woman whod smiled at jack spoke for mcswiney i think dougie is trying to say that were all dying to hear about lucy the woman said jack guessed that she probably was the woman with mcswiney if not his wife she was about the writers age which jack estimated to be late fortiesmaybe early fifties well lucy is a lot younger than anyone at this tablebetter tits and everything jack told themthe way billy rainbow would have said it no one was smiling now please dont hurt him the woman said thats all anyone ever had to say jack told them he lightened up on the full nelson i hope you know that i could have hurt you jack said to mcswiney who tried to nod jack let him go and stepped away from their table he half expected mcswiney to stagger to his feet and come at him swinging but the fat man just sat there looking more subdued than combative the woman whod spoken to jack wet her napkin in her water glass and began to fuss over mcswiney she picked the rice out of his hair and beard finding a shrimp or two and some sausagealso a piece of chicken she cleaned him up as best she could but there was nothing she could do about the saffron the writers beard and forehead were stained a pumpkinorange color a waiter whod been watching the whole time kept his eye on jack who returned to his table but sat with his back to the window facing mcswineys party jack didnt look at any of them directly but he wanted to see mcswiney coming if the big man came at him the woman whod asked him not to hurt mcswiney looked at jack from time to time with no discernible expression jack waved the waiter over and told him if theyre staying please offer mr mcswiney another paella ill pay for it theyre not staying the waiter said mr mcswiney is experiencing chest painsthats why theyre leaving it would be bad luck to have contributed to the death of the drunken loutthe overweight writer was a blustering god of canadian letters the autopsy might reveal that mcswiney had rice in his lungs hed been murdered with food the murder weapon had been the paella eulogies would abound nationwide a voice blowing over the canadian landscape like a galeforce wind had been silenced worst of all would be the lengthy quotations from mcswineys prose gargantuan descriptions of rocks and trees and seagulls in quill quire would you know if mr mcswiney has experienced chest pains before jack asked the troubledlooking waiter oh all the time the waiter said he has terrible heartburn jack ordered a beer he hadnt had one since the heineken hed had at that party in the polo lounge after the academy awards he noticed that a large gob of mcswineys paella had landed on his pants hed been busy and had somehow missed seeing it the shrimp coated with saffroncolored rice the sticky sausagejack wiped off the mess with a napkin but like mcswiney there was nothing he could do about the saffron stain whenever he saw the troubledlooking waiter jack was distracted by his thoughts of mcswineys chest pains he sincerely hoped it was just heartburn mcswiney was an asshole but he was too young to die jack had restrained himself from hurting the bastard it would have been too cruel for it to turn out that jack had had even an inadvertent hand in killing doug mcswiney and that was halifax jack would beg dr garcía to allow him to tell her a little bit about what happened there after all it might be a year or more before jack got around to that part of his life story in chronological order because his psychiatrist could see that jack was agitated and because shed already talked to lucy and lucys mother about the lucy business dr garcía indulged him she at least let him tell her the part about doug mcswiney jack was fortunate he admitted to dr garcía that mcswineys chest pains hadnt amounted to anything mrs oastler found a small account in the newspaper of a drunken brawl in the press gang restaurant in halifaxa case of two feuding writers whod earlier come to blows in the bar of the prince george hotel one canadian journalist had reported because leslie knew that jack didnt drink she was all the more perplexed by the reporter noting that jack had calmly sipped a beer while mcswiney was attended to by his friends jack dr garcía said it seems to me that you should hire a bodyguard i dont need a bodyguard he told her i just need to watch out for a left hook i meant that you need a bodyguard to keep you from hurting someone else she said oh well weve got our work cut out for uslets leave it at that his psychiatrist said what should i do jack asked her sincerely you better find a movie to be in soon dr garcía told him i think you should take a break from being jack burns dont you forgettable the following year jack was in three movies the year after that he did two more his handicapped math notwithstanding even jack could count that hed been in five films in two years hed taken a big break from being jack burns in two years time hed not heard from michele maher she made no response to his letter of explanation about the lucy episode dr garcía had urged jack to recognize that the michele maher chapter of his life was behind him or should be it was a good thing that he hadnt heard from michele the doctor said in those two years jack made a lot of money and spent very little about the only expensive thing he bought was a new audi naturally it was another silver one he could not motivate himself to sell the place on entrada drive and buy something more suitable this was because what he really wanted was to get out of laalthough no other city beckoned and jack held fast to emmas idea that it was somehow good to be an outsider besides as long as his life story was a workinprogress he couldnt imagine cutting his ties to dr garcía she was the closest jack had come to a good marriage or even a possible one he saw her twice a week putting his life in chronological order for dr garcía had become a more regular and restorative activity in jacks life than having sex as for sex in the last two yearssince adamantly not having sex with lucyjack had briefly comforted lucia delvecchio who was in the throes of a nasty divorce lucias divorce was obdurately ongoingone of those drawnout battles involving children and credit cards and summer homes and motor vehicles and dogsand because her irate husband viewed jack as the root cause of their marital difficulties jacks presence in lucias unmarried life was of little comfort to her and not longlasting he was romantically linked with three of his costarsin three out of his last five filmsbut these rumors were false in two out of three cases the one costar jack did sleep with margaret becker was a single mom in her forties she had a twelveyearold son named julian and a house on the ocean in malibu both margaret and julian were very sweet but fragile the boy had no relationship with his father and hed had unrealistic expectations of every boyfriend his mother had hadtheyd all left her as a result julians expectations of jack were aimed a little lower the boy kept anxiously looking for signs that jack was preparing to leave him and his mom jack liked the boyhe loved having a kid in his lifebut julian was very needy margaret julians mom was a fullfledged clinger whenever jack had to go away she stuffed his suitcase with photographs of herself in the photos which were pointedly taken for the occasion of jacks trip margaret looked stricken with the fear that he would never come back to her and jack would often wake up at night and find margaret staring at him it was as if she were attempting to penetrate his consciousness in his sleep and brainwash him into never leaving julians sorrowful eyes followed jack as if the boy were a dog jack had neglected to feed and margaret said to jack at least once a day i know youre going to leave me jack just try not to walk away when im feeling too vulnerable to handle it or when it would be especially harmful to poor julian jack was with her six months it felt like six years and leaving julian hurt jack more than leaving margaret the boy watched him go as if jack were his absconding father we take terrible risks with the natural affection of children jack would one day say to dr garcía but she complained that he had told her about these relationships in a sketchy fashion or was it that hed had nothing but sketchy relationships months later although the dominant sound in jacks house on entrada drive was the traffic on the pacific coast highway he would lie in bed hearing the oceanthe way he had listened to it in margarets house in malibu while waiting for julian to come into the bedroom and wake him and margaret jack sincerely missed them but they had driven him awayalmost from the first moment jack entered their lives it was dr garcías assessment that they were even needier than jack was im not needy jack replied indignantly hmm dr garcía said have you considered jack that what you crave most of all is a real relationship and a normal life but you dont know anyone whos normal or real yes i have considered that he answered ive been seeing you for five years yet i cant recall hearing you express a political opinionnot one dr garcía said what are your politics jack generally more liberal than conservative he said youre a democrat i dont vote jack admitted ive never voted well theres a statement dr garcía said maybe its because i started my life as a canadian and then i became an americanbut im really not either he said hmm i just like my work jack told her you take no vacations she asked the last vacation i remember hearing about was a school vacation when an actor isnt making a movie hes on vacation jack said but thats not exactly true is it dr garcía asked youre always reading scripts arent you you must spend a lot of time considering new roles even if you eventually turn them down and youve been reading a lot of novels lately since youve been credited with writing a screenplay arent you at least thinking about another adaptation or an original screenplay perhaps jack didnt say anything it seemed to him that he was always working even when he wasnt you go to the gym you watch what you eat you dont drink dr garcía was saying but what do you do when youre just relaxing or are you never relaxed i have sex he said the kind of sex you have is not relaxing dr garcía told him i hang out with my friends jack said what friends emmas dead jack i have other friends he protested you have no friends dr garcía said you have professional acquaintances youre on friendly terms with some of them but who are your friends jack pathetically mentioned herman castrothe exeter heavyweight now a doctor in el paso herman always wrote hey amigo on his christmas cards the word amigo doesnt make him your friend dr garcía pointed out do you remember his wifes name or the names of his children have you ever visited him in el paso youre depressing me jack told her i ask my patients to tell me about their lifes most emotional momentsthe ups and downs jack dr garcía said in your case this means what has made you laugh what has made you cry and what has made you feel angry im doing it arent i he asked her but the purpose for doing this jack is that when you tell me your life story you reveal yourselfat least thats what usually happens thats whats supposed to happen dr garcía said i regret that in your case youve been a very faithful storytellerand a very thorough one i believeyet i dont feel that i know you i know whats happened to you do i ever know itad nauseam but you havent revealed yourself jack i still dont know who you are please tell me who you are according to my mother jack began in a small voice which both he and dr garcía recognized as jacks voice as a child i was an actor before i was an actor but my most vivid memories of childhood are those moments when i felt compelled to hold my mothers hand i wasnt acting then then i guess you better find a way to forgive her dr garcía told him gently you might learn a lesson from your father im just guessing but when he forgave your mom maybe it enabled him to move on with his life youre thirtyeight jackyoure rich youre famous but you dont have a life my dad shouldnt have moved on with his life without me jack cried he shouldnt have left me you better find a way to forgive him too jack dr garcía sighed jack hated it when she sighed now youre crying again she observed it doesnt do you any good to cry you have to stop crying what a bitch dr garcía could be thats why jack didnt tell her when he heard from michele maher he went to the national convention of dermatologists without letting dr garcía know that he was going because he knew that she would do everything in her power to persuade him not to go because jack was afraid of what the doctor would say because he knew she was always right as for micheleas if thered been no hard feelings between them as if the twenty years theyd not been in each others company were shorter than those fleeting summer vacations when theyd been at exetermichele maher wrote jack that she was coming to los angeles where she very much looked forward to seeing him she didnt attend the dermatology convention every year she wanted him to knowusually only when it was in the northeast but shed never been to la can you imagine she wrote and because the convention this year provided michele with an opportunity to see jackwell she made it sound as if he were the reason shed decided to blow a long weekend in a glitzy hollywood hotel with a bunch of skin doctors the dermatologists had chosen one of those annoying universal city hotels rising out of a landscape of soundstages that resembled bomb shelters the sheraton universal overlooked the hollywood hills and was across the street from universal studiosthe theme park the hotel had the feeling of a resort the look of a place where conventioneers not infrequently brought their families while the dermatologists talked about skin their children could go on the rides at the theme park in the southern california climate jack imagined that the children of dermatologists would be sticky with sunscreen and wrapped up to their eyes in fact he was surprised that dermatologists would hold a convention in such a sunny place michele mahers letter was positively perky she wrote to jack with the flippancy of a prepschool girl her former self her letter caused him to remember her old richard iii joke wheres your hump dick she had asked him its in the costume closet and its just a football jack had answered for maybe the hundredth time but shed been a good sport when hed beaten her out for the part of lady macbeth and of course jack also remembered that michele was over fivetena slim honeyblonde with a models glowing skin and in ed mccarthys vulgar estimation a couple of high hard ones why dont you have a girlfriend jack michele had asked himwhen they were seventeen she was just kidding around or so hed thought but he had to go and give her a linejack was just acting because i get the feeling youre not available hed said i had no idea you were interested in me jack i didnt think you were interested in anyone shed told him how can anyone not be interested in you michele hed asked her thus setting in motion a disaster what had drawn them together in the first place was acting the one honest thing jack had done was not sleep with heronly because he thought hed caught the clap from mrs stackpole the dishwasher and he didnt want michele to catch it but this was hardly honest as dr garcía had already pointed out to him jack didnt tell michele why he wouldnt sleep with her did he of course hed thought at the time that almost no one would have believed he was banging mrs stackpoleespecially not michele who was so beautiful while mrs stackpole was so unfortunatelooking even in the world of much older women why then didnt the flirtatious chirpiness of micheles letter warn jack away from her how desperate was he to connect with someone to have a socalled real or normal relationship outside the world of acting that he failed to see the crystalclear indications michele and jack had never had a real relationship they hadnt even almost had a relationship if he had slept with herand not given her the clap which jack hadnt caught from mrs stackpolehow soon after that would they have broken up when michele went off to columbia in new york city and jack went off to the university of new hampshire probably when he met claudia definitely in short michele maher had always been jacks illusion the concept of the two of them together had been more the fantasy of other students at exeter than it had ever been a reality between them they were the most beautiful girl and the most handsome boy in the school maybe thats all they ever were i have meetings all day and there are lectures every night michele wrote to him about the dermatologists convention at the sheraton universal but i can skip a lecture or two just tell me which night or nights youre free im dying to see where you hang out what i mean jack is that you must own that town but hollywood wasnt that kind of town it was a perpetual glittering ongoing award for the most part hollywood kept escaping you there was one night when you owned the townthe night you won the oscar but then there came the night and the next night after that how quickly it happened that hollywood was not your town anymore and it wouldnt benot unless or until you won another academy award and then another one the studios once owned hollywood but they didnt own it anymore there were agents who behaved as if they owned it there were actors and actresses who thought they owned it but they were wrong the only people who truly owned hollywood had more than one oscar they just kept winning oscars one after the other and jack burns was not one of those people and never would be but to michele maher he was a movie star she believed that was all that mattered according to dr garcía jack had come closest to having a real or normal relationship with claudiait was at least an actual relationship before they went their separate ways but michele maher was both more dangerous and more unforgettable to jack because shed only ever existed as a possible relationship theyre the most damaging kind arent they dr garcía had asked him of course she also meant the relationship that jack could only imagine having with his father thus warned jack drove out to universal city to pick up michele maherdr maher a thirtyeightyearold unmarried dermatologist what was he thinking he already suspected that he might have a better time with an amnesiac transvestite prostitute that was jacks state of mind when he walked into the lobby of the sheraton universal which was overrun with hyperactivelooking children returning from their day of themepark rides michele had said she would meet him in the bar where he found her drinking margaritas with three or four of her fellow dermatologists they were all sloshed but jack was heartened to see that michele could manage to stand at least she was the only one who stood to greet him she must have forgotten how short jack was because she was wearing very high heels at fiveten even barefoot she towered over him you see she said to the other doctors arent movie stars always smaller than you expect them to be the unkind thought occurred to jack that if penis mccarthy had been there he would have observed that jack came up to her high hard ones he took michele out to dinner at jonesa trendy hollywood hangout it was not jacks favorite placecrowded irritatingly thrivingbut he figured that michele would be disappointed if he didnt provide her with an opportunity for a little sightseeing the food wasnt all that interesting but the clientele was hipmodels starlets lots of fake boobs with the pizzas and pasta of course jack saw lawrence with one of the models jack and lawrence automatically gave each other the finger michele was instantly impressed if a little unsteady on her feet i havent eaten all day she confessed i should have skipped that second margarita have some pasta jack said thatll help but she downed a glass of white wine while he was still squeezing the lemon into his iced tea he kept looking all around for lawrence who probably wanted to pay jack back for the bottle of taittinger jack had poured on him in cannes my gawd michele was sayinga conflation of the worst of boston and new york in her accent this place is cool alas she wasnt her skin which hed remembered as glowing was dry and a trifle rawlookingas if shed just emerged from a hot bath and had stood outside for too long on a new england winter day her honeyblond hair was dull and lank she was too thin and sinewy in the manner of women who work out to excess or diet too rigorouslyor both she hadnt had all that much to drink but her stomach was emptymichele was one of those people who looked like her stomach was empty most of the timeand even a moderate amount of alcohol would have looped her she was wearing a streamlined gray pantsuit with a slinky silver camisole showing under the jacket new york clothesjack was pretty sure you couldnt buy a suit like that in boston or cambridge and she probably didnt get those very high heels anywhere but new york either even so she looked like a doctor she held her shoulders in an overerect way the way someone with a neck injury doesor as if shed been born in a starched lab coat i dont know how you do what you do she was telling jack i mean how youre so natural doing such unnatural thingsa crossdressing ski bum for example a dead rock stara female one a limo driver whos married to a hooker ive known a lot of limo drivers he told her how many homophobic veterinarians have you known jack michele asked him she had even seen that unfortunate film im weird you mean he said to her but you bring it off youre a natural at being weird michele told him jack didnt say anything she was fishing for something that had fallen to the bottom of her second glass of white wine which was half empty it was a ring that had slipped off her finger ive lost so much weight for this date she said im two sizes smaller than i was a month ago i keep moving my rings to bigger fingers jack used a spoon to scoop her ring out of her wineglass the ring had slipped off the middle finger of her right hand the middle finger of her left hand was even smaller michele explained but the ring was too small to fit either index finger it was a somewhat oldfashionedlooking ring for a woman her age to wear a little clunkya big sapphire wreathed by diamonds it has some sentimental value this ring jack asked her michele maher knocked over her wineglass and burst into tears against jacks advice shed ordered a pizzanot pasta the pizza at jones had a pretty thin crust jack didnt think the pizza had a rats ass of a chance of absorbing the alcohol in her it had been her mothers ringhence the bursting into tears her mother had died of skin cancer when michele was still in medical school michele had instantly developed a skin ailment of her own she called it stressrelated eczema shed specialized in dermatology for personal reasons her father was remarried to a much younger woman the gold digger is my age michele said shed ordered a third glass of white wine and she hadnt touched her pizza you remember my parents apartment in new york dont you jack she asked she had placed her dead mothers unwearable ring on the edge of her plate where it seemed poised to eat the pizza the ring honestly looked more interested in eating the pizza than michele did of course jack answered how could he forget that park avenue apartment the beautiful rooms the beautiful parents the beautiful dog and the picasso toiletseathigh in the guestroom bathroom where it virtually dared you to pee on it that apartment was supposed to be my inheritance michele said now the gold digger is going to get it oh why didnt you sleep with me jack she asked how could you have proposed that we masturbate together mutual masturbation is much more intimate than having conventional sex isnt it i thought i had the clap he admitted i didnt want you to get it the clap from whom you werent seeing anyone else were you i was sleeping with mrs stackpole the dishwasher you probably dont remember her michele those women who worked in the kitchen were all old and fat she cried yes they were jack said wellmrs stackpole was anyway you could have slept with me but you slept with an old fat dishwasher she asked in a ringing voice she said dishwasher the way shed said gold digger i was sleeping with mrs stackpole before i knew i could sleep with you jack reminded her and your relationship with emma oastlerwhat was that exactly michele asked here we go jack thought here comes too weird and all the rest of it emma and i were just roommateswe lived together but we never had sex thats so hard to imagine michele said toying with the ring on the edge of her plate you mean you just masturbated together not even that he told her what did you do you must have done something michele said we kissed i touched her breasts she held my penis in reaching for her wineglass micheles elbow came down on the edge of her plate her mothers ring went flying the ring landed on an adjacent table startling two models who were on a redwine diet one of the models picked up the ring and looked at jack oh you shouldnt have she said slipping the ring onto one of her pretty fingers im sorryits her mothers ring jack told the model she pouted at him while michele looked mortified you dont remember me do you jack the other model asked jack got up and went over to their table holding his hand out to the model who was still wearing micheles ring he was trying to buy a little time struggling to remember who the other model was i was afraid youd forgotten me he told her it was one of billy rainbows linesjack had always liked it it was not the answer the model had been expecting jack still couldnt place her or else hed never met her before in his life and she was just playing a game with him the model who had micheles ring was playing another kind of game with jack she was trying to put the ring on one of his fingers who would have thought jack burns had such little hands she was saying the ring was a loose fit on his left pinkie jack went back to his table wearing it jack burns has a little penis the other model said jack guessed that she did know him but he still didnt remember her michele just sat there looking glassyeyed i dont feel very well she told jack i think im drunk if you want to know the truth you should try to eat something he said dont you know that you cant tell a doctor what to do jack come on ill take you back to the hotel he said i want to see where you live michele said plaintively it must be fabulous its a hole in the wall the model who knew jack said dont tell me youve actually moved out of that nookie house on entrada jack were much closer to your hotel than we are to where i live he told michele did you sleep with that girl michele asked him when they were back in the audi you didnt look like you knew her i dont remember sleeping with her jack said whats a nookie house she asked him its slang for brothel jack explained do you really live in a hole in the wall on la strada michele asked yes i do he admitted its on entrada but why do you live in a hole in the wall why wouldnt jack burns live in a mansion i dont really know where i want to live michele my gawd she said again michele fell sound asleep on the hollywood freeway jack had to carry her into the lobby of the sheraton universal he didnt know her room number he couldnt find her room key in her purse he carried her into the bar where he was sure he would find a few of her drunken colleagues jack hoped that one of them would be sober enough to recognize michele another woman dermatologist came to jacks assistance she was a homely caustic person but at least she hadnt been drinking together they got michele to her room the other doctors name was sandra she was from somewhere in michigan sandra must have assumed that jack was sleeping with michele because she proceeded to undress michele in front of him run a bath for her sandra said we cant let her pass out like this if she vomits she might choke people who are deaddrunk often aspirate their vomit its better to wake her up and let her be sick when shes awake jack did what the doctor said then he carried michele to the bath and with sandras assistance slid her into it naked she was much too thinemaciated like a woman whod been recently pregnant michele had stretch marks on her small breasts the skin there looked wrinkled it was the weight loss she hadnt been pregnant christ how much weight has she lost sandra asked jack as if he were the one whod put michele up to it i dont know what she weighed before jack said i havent seen michele in twenty years well this is a wonderful way to see her sandra said michele had told him more about the stressrelated eczema it occurred on her elbows and knees when it was bad the eczema was the color and nubbly texture of a roosters wattle jack kept staring at micheles elbows and knees while she lolled in the bath he half expected her mysterious skin ailment to suddenly appear what are you looking at sandra asked him michele even in the bathwater was still out cold jack held her under her armpits so her head wouldnt slip underwater he explained about the stressrelated eczema but sandra assured him that it wasnt about to blossom before his eyes its not like timelapse photography she said sandra looked at his hands nice ring she commented micheles mothers ring was still on jacks left pinkie when michele started coming around she was unaware that sandra was with them ill leave you two lovebirds alone just dont let her throw up in her sleep sandra said you seem to enjoy staring at her anyway did we do it yet michele asked him he heard sandra letting herself out of the hotel room the door closing on her harsh laugh no jack said we didnt do it when are we going to do it jack or do you think you have the clap again i didnt have it the first time i just thought i might have it he explained to her but you cant even remember who youve slept with michele reminded him and its not as if you drink or anything you must sleep with an awful lot of women jack not really jack said he felt nothing for her but the kind of pity and contempt you feel for people who arent in control of themselves as a nondrinker jack would have admitted to feeling superior to people who drank too muchwhatever the circumstances and the pity he felt for michele was all caught up in those expectations shed hadfor their big night out on the town together for her parents new york apartment which the gold digger had stolen from her even for her dead mothers ring which didnt fit any of her fingers jack took the ring off his left pinkie and put it in the soap dish above the bathroom sink he helped michele dry herself off she was a little shaky she wanted to be alone in the bathroom for a moment the hotel maid had already turned down the bed and closed the curtains but jack opened the curtains to get a look at the view of the hollywood hills the room had floortoceiling windows it was a spectacular view but not even the hollywood hills could divert him from the sound of michele retching in the toilet jack went and stood next to the bathroom door to be sure she wasnt choking later when he heard the toilet flush and the water in the sink running jack went back and stood at the giant windows it was hed been in los angeles for sixteen years he was trying to remember sleeping with that model at jonesthe one whod said that his penis was smallbut he couldnt remember anything about her when he closed the curtains jack was thinking that hed seen enough of the hollywood hills when michele came out of the bathroom she was wearing one of the hotels terrycloth robes she seemed shy and relatively sober and she smelled like a whole tube of toothpaste jack was sorry that she wanted to sleep with himhed been hoping that she wouldnt want to but he couldnt turn her down a second time not when he knew she was still thinking about the first time hed rejected her it was only later that it occurred to jack that michele probably felt as resigned to the act as he did and there was nothing remarkable about their sexual performance nothing that would override the longerlasting impressionnamely that they hadnt really wanted to sleep with each other they had simply expected it would happen just what is so terribly universal about this place anyway michele asked him after theyd had sex and jack was touching her breasts she was lying on her back with her long arms held straight against her sides like a soldier jack guessed that she meant the name of the hotel the sheraton universalor where the hotel was located which was universal citybut before he could say something michele said i can tell you one thing thats universal about tonight and that is its a universal disappointmentlike loneliness or illness or death or like knowing youll never have children its just one big universal letdown isnt it actually its the name of a studio jack said universal studios your penis isnt too small jack michele maher said that model was simply being cruel maybe she had a nose job since i last saw her he speculated i mean shes a modelshe could have had her chin done or her eyes done ill bet she had some kind of facelift theres got to be a reason why i dont remember her oh i dont know michele said what about us in a few years this isnt going to be memorable is it so much for that expectation as he would one day tell dr garcía it would come as no surprise to dr garcía but one can appreciate what a blow it was to jack to discover how quickly michele maher could become forgettable claudias ghost bad things happened after that jacks psychiatrist tried to shed a positive light on his failure to connect with michele maher maybe this would disabuse jack of what dr garcía called his ifonly romanticism about the pastmeaning if only it had worked out with michele maher the first time he might have been spared the ensuing years of incomplete relationships you always attached too much importance to your botched opportunity with michele jack dr garcía said you never attached enough importance to what worked with claudia at least that relationship lasted only four years jack reminded her who else lasted an eighth as long jack and dont say emma the penisholding doesnt count as complete does it but jack resisted his psychiatrists efforts to shed a positive light on anything he was down he embraced the moviemagazine version of himself his badboy image jack didnt care how many models he wouldnt remember a month later he had ceased caring about what kind of nookie house he lived in too his entrada drive state of mind dr garcía called it jack was in that state of mind in may when he went to new york to make a movie he had accepted the harry mocco role in the love poeta film by gillian scott the australian director gillian had also written the screenplay harry mocco is a crippled male modelhalf a model harry calls himself his legs were crushed in a new york elevator accident he has always wanted to be an actor he has a great voice but there arent a lot of roles for a guy in a wheelchair even as a model harrys career is marginal he is often seen sitting up in bed in the morningjust his top half naked the rest of him is under the sheets these are advertisements for womens clothes the female model usually in the foreground of the photograph is already dressed or half dressed her clothes are whats being sold the top half of harry in the background is depicted as one of her accessories or if hes the one modeling the clothes you see jackasharry sitting at a desk or in the drivers seat of an expensive car he does a lot of ads for wristwatches usually in a tuxedobut the naked halfamale accessory in those advertisements for womens clothing are his specialty harry mocco doesnt really need the money he made a fortune suing the building with the elevator that crushed his legs in and around new york where the film is set jackasharry is quite a famous and photogenic cripple the modeling is more for what little remains of his dignity than it is a financial necessity he actually lives pretty wellin one of those new york buildings with a doorman naturally harrys gym is wheelchairaccessible he lifts weights half the day and plays wheelchair basketballeven wheelchair tennis jackasharry also memorizes and recites love poems or parts of love poemsnot always a welcome activity especially since hes not with anyone hes always urging his friendsgym friends malemodel friendsto woo their girlfriends with love poetry no one seems interested harry knows a lot of supermodelssome of the hottest female models in new york but theyre just friends the supermodels are unmoved by the love poetry jackasharry has sex only once in the first hour and fifteen minutes of the film to no ones surprise its a disaster his partner is a young woman who frequently dresses him for the photo shootsshes very plain and nervous an unglamorous girl with a pierced lower lip the love poetry works on her but his being crippled doesnt jack had to give gillian scott credit for capturing a sex scene of awardwinning awkwardness the voiceover which is harry moccos is all love poetry everything from the grimmest of the grim thomas hardy to philip larkin everything from george wither to robert graves there was too much graves in jacks opinion harry mocco usually doesnt get to recite more than a couplet rarely a complete stanza nobody he knows wants to hear a whole poem im not sure about the suitability of this role for you dr garcía had forewarned jack a crippled male model who hasnt found his audience isnt that coming a little close to home nor in dr garcías opinion was the length of his separation from her advisable i dont do house calls as far away as new york jackalthough i could stand to do a little shopping why dont your children if thats who they are grow older hed wanted to ask her the photographs in dr garcías office were an irreplaceable seemingly permanent collection the older husbandor her father if thats who he waswas fixed in time all of them seemed fixed in time like bugs preserved in amber but jack didnt ask her about it he just went to new york and made the movie work is work dr garcía hed said defensively a part is just a part im not harry mocco nor am i in danger of becoming him im not anybody thats part of your problem jack she had reminded him the whole movie had a fiftytwoday shooting schedule for the harry mocco part including rehearsals jack had to be in new york a couple of months he was in the habit of seeing dr garcía twice a weektwo months without seeing her would necessitate a certain number of phone calls he couldnt tell her his life story over the phone in an emergency he could talk to her but the chronologicalorder part would have to wait in dr garcías view the chronologicalorder part was what determined how jack was doing it was one thing to babble out loud about an emotionally or psychologically disturbing moment it was quite another obstacle to organize the story and tell it exactly as it had happened to an actual person in this respect the chronologicalorder part was like acting in dr garcías view if jack couldnt tell the story in an orderly fashion that meant that he couldnt handle it psychologically and emotionally jack burns put everything he had into harry mocco he remembered how mrs malcolm had tyrannized the classroom her headon crashing into desksher racing up and down the aisles in the st hildas chapel skinning her knuckles on the pews he remembered how bonnie hamilton could climb into her wheelchair or extricate herself from it the second his head was turned he never saw her slip or fall but he noticed the bruisesthe evidence that she wasnt perfect jack not only did wheelchair tricks on the set of the love poet he insisted on using the wheelchair when he was off the set too he pretended he was crippled jack wheeled around the hotel like a psycho invalid he made them load him into limos and unload him he practiced falling too he did a fantastic headoverheels wheelie in the lobby of the trump international on central park westthe startled bellman and concierge running to assist him they had a great gym at the trump jack went there in his wheelchair he would get on the treadmill and run for half an hour with the wheelchair parked alongside as if it were for another person when harry mocco has wheelchair accidents in the love poet the voiceover is heavy on robert graves a little of graves goes a long way love is a universal migraine for example or why have such scores of lovely gifted girls married impossible men simple selfsacrifice may be ruled out and missionary endeavour nine times out of ten when jackasharry is crawling on all fours from the bed to the bathroom the girl whos just slept with him is watching himrepulsed the voiceover is harrys reciting e e cummings i like my body when it is with your body jackasharry tries to win over the piercedlip girl with a love poem by ted hughes but a little of hughes goes a long way too the girl is out the door before he can finish the first stanza we sit late watching the dark slowly unfold no clock counts this harrys more selfpitying momentsrepeatedly banging his head on a bathtub drain unable to climb out of the slippery tubare pure pathos the voiceover to the bathtub scene is harrys recitation of george wither shall i wasting in despair die because a womans fair the love poet is a noir love storymore noir than love story for three quarters of the film more love story than noir at the end jackasharry meets a recently crippled young woman in his gym she is wheelchairbound too harry can tell its her first public outing in her new but permanent condition shes tentative shes being introduced to various weight machines and exercises by a blowhard personal trainer whom harry despises the girl is what wheelchair veterans like harry call a newborn leave the newborn to me jackasharry tells the trainer harry then proceeds to demonstrate every weight machine and exercise in slapstick he drops things he stages spectacular falls see this is easy he tells the newborn imitating the hearty bullshit of the personal trainer jackasharry hurls himself out of his wheelchair as awkwardly as possible demonstrating to the recently crippled young woman that nothing is going to be easy for her when they fall in love the voiceover is harrys hes reciting a e housman in a gym of all places oh when i was in love with you then i was clean and brave and miles around the wonder grew how well did i behave shame on jack burnsthat month in new york he was not as well behaved as harry mocco he met a transvestite dancer at a downtown club jack was distracted by her stronglooking hands and her prominent adams apple he knew she was a man still he went along with the seductioninprogressup to a point jack let her wheel him through the lobby of the trump and into the hotels bar she sat in his lap in the wheelchair and they sang a beatles song together the bar crowd joining in when i get older losing my hair many years from now will you still be sending me a valentine birthday greetings bottle of wine jack tried to say good night to the transvestite dancer at the elevator but she insisted on coming to his room with him all the way up on the elevator they kept singing she sat in his lap in the elevator too if id been out till quarter to three would you lock the door will you still need me will you still feed me when im sixtyfour the transvestite wheeled him down the hall to his hotel room at the door jack tried again to say good night to her dont be silly jack she said wheeling him inside the room im not going to have sex with you jack told her yes you are the pretty dancer said jack soon had a fight on his hands when a transvestite wants to have sex she feels as strongly about it as a guybecause she is a guy jack had a battle on his hands the room got trashed a littleone lamp especially yes jack was arousedbut even he knew the difference between wanting to have sex and actually having it not even he would submit to every desire look its obvious you want me the dancer said stop fighting it shed taken off all her clothes and had managed to destroy most of jacks you have a hardon she kept pointing out as if jack didnt know i get a hardon in my sleep he told her look at me she screamed i have a hardon i can see that you do jack said and you have breasts they were as hard as apples jack knew because he was trying to push them out of his face this time he saw the left hook comingand the right uppercut and the headbutt too she may have been a dancer but she was not without some other training this wasnt her first fight naturally the phone was ringingthe frontdesk clerk jack assumed there had probably been calls to the front desk from those rooms adjacent to jacks within hearing distance of the destroyed lamp and all the rest well wouldnt donald trump love this jack was thinking the trumps fabulous view of central parkfor the time being utterly ignored he heard the security guys picking at the lock on his hotelroom door but jack had a russian front headlock on the dancer and he wasnt letting gonot even to open the door her fingernails were like claws and he had to give up the front headlock when she bit him in the forearm you fight like a girl jack told her he knew that would really piss her off when she came at him jack hit a pretty good duckunder and got behind her he held her chestdown on the rug with a doublearmbar where she couldnt bite him the security guys finally got the door open there were two of them plus the night manager were here to help you mr burnsi mean mr mocco the night manager said i have a distraught dancer on my hands jack told them he had a hardon i saw it the transvestite said one of the security guys had thought that jack really was a cripple hed never seen jack out of the wheelchairnot even in the movies he wasnt a moviegoer clearly from the other security guys reaction when the three of them were forcibly dressing the dancer chicks with dicks were new to him jack never went to bed he stayed up rehearsing how he would tell this part of the story of his life to dr garcía he knew this episode wouldnt wait for chronological order jack kept a cold washcloth on his forearm where the transvestite dancer had bitten him she hadnt broken the skin but the bite marks were sore and uglylooking in the late morning when jack talked to dr garcía from the set of the love poet he told her that the unfortunate incident was out of character for harry mocco but sadly typical of jack burns jack thought he might preempt her criticism by criticizing himself you acquiesce too much jack dr garcía said you should never have let the transvestite into the elevatoryou should have had the fight in the lobby where it would have been a shorter fight for that matter you should never have let her sit in your lap in the bar it wouldnt have been a good idea to have had that fight in the bar he assured dr garcía but why did you leave the nightclub with her in the first place dr garcía asked him she turned me on i was aroused he admitted im sure you were jack thats what transvestites do isnt it they go to great lengths to turn men on but what does that lead to jack every time where does that go he couldnt think of what to say you keep getting in trouble dr garcía was saying its always just a little trouble but you know what that leads todont you jack dont you know where that goes it was july when they had the wrap party for the love poet in new york and jack flew back to la hed succumbed to harry moccos habit of reciting fragments of love poems to total strangers but in the case of the attractive stewardess on his flight from new york to los angeles this wasnt entirely jacks fault shed asked him to tell her about his next movie and jack began by explaining to her that harry mocco compulsively memorizes love poems and recites them at the drop of a hat for example do you know the poem talking in bed by philip larkin he asked her she was probably jacks age do i want to know it she asked him warily im married but he kept trying jack hadnt slept with a stewardess in years or in bertrams garden by donald justice he went on as if the flight attendant were encouraging him jane looks down at her organdy skirt as if it somehow were the thing disgraced whoa the stewardess said cutting him off i dont want to hear about it thats what happens when you ask an actor to tell you about his next movie when jack walked into his place on entrada drive he immediately called a real estate agent and asked to have the house put on the market sell the fucker jack was thinking maybe that would force me to live a little differently he headed off for his appointment with dr garcíahis first in two monthsfeeling like a new man but you havent really made a decision about where you want to live jack dr garcía pointed out arent you pulling the rug out from under your feet so to speak but if jack couldnt make up his mind about his life he had at least decided to make something happen is it the house itself that let lucy come inside dr garcía asked him is it because of your mothers lies to you or your missing father that you are an unanchored shipin danger of drifting wherever the wind or the currents or the next sexual encounter will take you jack didnt say anything think about claudia dr garcía said if you want to make something meaningful happenif you really want to live differentlythink about finding a woman like that think about committing yourself to a relationship it doesnt even have to last four years think about being with a woman you could live with for one year start small but start something you asked me not to mistake you for a dating service jack reminded her im recommending that you stop dating jack im suggesting that if you tried to live with someone you would have to live a lot differently you dont need a new house you need to find someone you can live with dr garcía said someone like claudia she wanted children dr garcía i dont mean someone like claudia in that respect but a relationship like thatone that has a chance of lasting jack claudia is probably very fat now he told dr garcía she had an epic battle with her weight ahead of her i dont necessarily mean someone like claudia in that respect either jack claudia wanted children so badlyshes probably a grandmother now he said to dr garcía you never could count jack she told him jack didnt blame dr garcía he would take full responsibility for what happened but the very idea of claudiathe reason she was recently on his mindsurely came from the claudia conversation in his therapy session with dr garcía jack was thinking about herthats all he would say in his own defensewhen he drove back home to santa monica from a dinner party one warm night that summer jack was remembering the first time claudia let him borrow her volvothe incredible feeling of independence that comes from being young and alone and driving a car he pulled into his driveway on entradahis headlights illuminating the arrestingly beautiful incontestably slaviclooking young woman who sat on her battered but familiar suitcase on jacks absurdly small lawn she sat so serenely still as if she were placidly posing for a photograph beside the for sale sign that for a moment jack forgot what was for sale he thought she was for sale before he remembered he was selling his houseand that thought would come back to haunt him because she was more for sale than jack could possibly have imagined he knew who she wasclaudia or her ghost it was a wonder he didnt lose control of the audi and drive over hereither killing claudia on the spot or killing her ghost again but how can it be claudia jack was thinking the young woman on his lawn was as young as claudia had been when hed known her or younger besides claudia had always looked older than she was and she had the habit of lying about her age god damn you jack claudia had said after i die im going to haunt youi promise you i willi might even haunt you before i die since claudia had promised that she would haunt him wasnt it forgivable that jack assumed the apparition sitting beside his for sale sign was claudias ghost a ghost doesnt usually travel with a suitcase but maybe heaven or hell had kicked her outor her mission to haunt jack had required her to have several changes of clothes after all claudia was or had been an actressand shed loved the theater more than jack had in the case of claudias ghost the suitcase could have been a prop jack somehow managed to get out of the audi and walk up to her although his legs had turned to stone he knew that driving away or running away wasnt an optionyou cant get away from a ghost but he left the audis headlights on when approaching a ghost you at least want to see her clearly who wants to walk up to a ghost in the dark claudia jack said his voice trembling oh jack its been too long she said its been forever since ive seen you she was the same old claudia only younger the same stage presence the same projection of her voiceas if even oneonone she was making sure that those poor souls in the worst seats in the uppermost balcony could hear her perfectly but youre so young he said i died young jack how young claudia you look even younger than you were how is that possible death becomes me i guess she said arent you going to ask me inside ive been dying to see you jack ive been sitting on this freakin lawn for an eternity the word freakin was new and not at all like claudia but who knew where shed beenand among the dead with whom she held out her hands and jack helped her to her feet he was surprised that he could feel her notinconsiderable weight who would have guessed that ghosts weighed anything at all but from the look of hereven in heaven or that other placeclaudia still had to watch her weight she was still selfconscious about her hips too she wore the same type of long full skirt that shed always liked to weareven in the summer she was as heavybreasted as jack remembered her in fact given what people who believed in ghosts were generally inclined to believe she was disarmingly fullfigured for a spirit jack ran to the car and turned off the audis headlights half expecting claudias ghost to disappear but she waited for him smiling she let him carry her old leather suitcase inside she went straight to jacks bedroom as if they were still a couple and shed been living with him all these yearseven though claudia had never been in that house he waited in shock while she used his bathroom the things ghosts had to do jack was deeply conflicted he both believed her and suspected her she had the same creamysmooth skin the same prominent jaw and cheekbonesa face made for closeups hed always said claudia should have been in the movies despite the problem with her weight she had a face that was wasted in the theater jack had always told her when claudias ghost emerged from the bathroom she came up to jack and nuzzled his neck ive even missed your smell she said ghosts have a sense of smell he asked jack held her by the shoulders at arms length and looked into her eyes they were the same yellowish brown theyd always been like polished wood like a lionesss eyes but there was something about her that wasnt quite the same the resemblance was striking but inexact it wasnt only that she seemed too young to be the claudia hed knowneven if shed died the day after they parted company even if death as the ghost had said did become her a thought occurs to me claudia he said holding her even at arms length jack could feel her bodys heat and all this time hed thought that ghosts if you could feel them at all would feel cold since my mother died ive been wondering about this he told her if ghosts get to keep the tattoos they had in lifei mean in the hereafter again the smilebut even her smile wasnt exactly as jack remembered it he didnt think that claudias teeth had ever been quite this white she slowly lifted the long full skirt the seductiveness in her eyes was unchanged and there high up on her inner thigh which was even a little plumper than he remembered it was the tattoo of the chinese scepterthe short sword symbolizing everything as you wish it took long enough but it finally healed she told him it was a pretty good chinese scepter jack thought but it was not as perfect as the one his mom had learned from paul harper its real the young woman said it wont rub off on your hand see for yourself jackgo on and touch it the voice her projection may have been the same but the language lacked claudias exactnessher correctness of speech her good education the go on and touch itthe casual use of the word andwas no more like claudia than the word freakin that had caught jacks attention earlier he touched the young womans tattoo high up on her inner thighher imitation chinese scepter as jack thought of it who are you he asked her she took his hand and made him touch her higher up she wasnt wearing any panties not even a thong doesnt it feel familiar jack dont you want to be back thereto be young again youre not claudia jack told her claudia was never crude and ghosts he could have said not only dont have body heat female ghosts dont get wet or do they you have a hardon jack the girl said touching him i get a hardon in my sleep he told her as if the episode with that transvestite dancer at the trump had been a dress rehearsal its no big deal its big enough the young woman said kissing him on the mouth she didnt come close to kissing like claudia but it took no small amount of will power on jacks part to stop touching her to make her stop he had to let her know that he knew who she was what would your mother say about this jack asked claudias daughter the very idea of you having sex with me that wouldnt make your mom happy would it my moms dead the girl told him im here to haunt youits what she would have wanted im sorry your mothers dead he replied but what would she have wanted i dont believe in ghosts claudias daughter said im here to haunt you because i dont believe that mom can do it whats your name jack asked her sally the girl said after sally bowles the part in cabaret mom always wantedthe part she told me you wanted too only you probably would have been better at it mom said what did your mom die of sally when did she die cancer a couple of years ago sally said i had to wait till i was eighteenso it would be legal to haunt you she looked like a woman in her early twenties but then her mother had always looked older than she was too are you really eighteen sally just like lucy wasnt lucy eighteen sally asked him i guess everyone knows about lucy jack said the lucy business was the last thing my mom knew about youit happened just before she died maybe it made it easier for her to die without you sally said like lucy sally was walking around in jacks house as if she owned it he noticed she had kicked off her shoes she walked barefoot on the wrestling mat in his gym her beige sleeveless blouse was a gauzy fabric her bra which jack could see through the blouse was the same beige or lighttan color sallys skirt made a swishing sound as she walked she paused at his desk reading the title page of a screenplay lying there that was when she picked up jacks address book my mom never stopped loving you sally said she always wondered what might have happened if shed stayed with youif you ever would have given her a child or children she regretted breaking up with you but she had to have children the way sally said children jack got the feeling that she didnt like kidsor that the need to have them wasnt as urgent an issue to her as it had been to claudia sally plopped herself down on jacks livingroom couch and opened his address book he sat down beside her do you have siblings sally are you kidding mom popped out four kids one right after the other lucky mei was the first i got to be the babysitter and your dad jack asked her he means no harm sally said mom would have married the first guy she met after she split up with you he just had to promise to give her children my dad was the first guy she met the pathetic loser why is he a pathetic loser sally he got to go to all your movies with mom what a kick that had to be for him if you know what i mean sally said of course when i was old enough i got to watch all your movies toowith mom and dad there wasnt anything she didnt tell dad about you there wasnt anything she didnt tell me about you too that trip you took to the toronto film festival how your mother tattooed her how you made mom show her tattoo to the customs agentthat was a good one how she gave you the clap she caught from captain phoebus when you were a gay esmeralda in the hunchback of notre dame how you were such a prick about it as if youd never fooled around yourself but your dad loved her jack asked sally oh he worshiped her sally said mom got as big as a cowshe completely let herself goand it was painfully evident that she never got over you but dad adored her youre very beautiful sally he told the girl you look so much like your mom i almost believed you for a moment i thought you were claudias ghost i can haunt you as good as any ghostbelieve me jack she wasnt looking at him she just kept thumbing through the pages of his address book as if she were searching for someone suddenly she flipped to the front of the book she began with the as in her mothers stage voice she read aloud the first womans name mildred milly ascheim sally said then her tone of voice became insinuating did you screw her jack are you still screwing her no never he replied uhoh heres another ascheimmyra you crossed her name out thats a pretty clear indication that you fucked her then you dumped her i suppose i never had sex with her i crossed out her name because she died sally lets not play this game jack said but she kept reading she became very excited when she got to lucia delvecchios name even mom said you must have slept with her sally said mom said she could tell you were going to sleep with her when she saw you with her in the movie jack let it go on too long sally was into the gs when the trouble really started jack knew what dr garcía would saynamely that he shouldnt have been sitting next to sally on the couch in the first place elena garcía sally said this must have registered on jacks face he clearly found this disrespectful to dr garcía whom he never called by her first name dr garcía was the most important person in this stage of jacks life and sally saw it your cleaning lady or former cleaning lady sally asked more disrespectfully you definitely fucked her shes my doctormy psychiatrist jack said i dont even call her by her first name oh yesshes lucys shrink too isnt she how could i forget that sally said ill bet lucys mom is stalking you now the girl was good she had her mothers talent if not half her training and at that moment when she was teasing him she reminded jack more of claudia than at any time when hed imagined she was claudias ghost please dont be angry with me jack sally said very much the way her mother would have said it i just miss my mom and i thought that being with you might bring her back to me jack couldnt move he just sat there in his experience women even young women knew when they had frozen you claudia had known those moments when jack couldnt resist her sally knew too she pressed herself against him on the couch she started unbuttoning his shirt he didnt stop her remember when you were john the baptist sally asked him i was just his heada small part he answered her his severed headthats all i was his decapitated head on a table sally reminded him slipping off his shirt jack didnt know when shed unbuttoned her blouse he noticed only that it was unbuttoned mom was salomé wasnt she claudias daughter asked him yes jack answered he could barely talk the girl had undressed him and herself naked she was more like claudia than claudiachinese scepter and all mom said that was the best kiss she ever gave you that was some kiss he remembered yet the damage to claudia and jacks relationship had already been done not even that kiss could undo their drifting apart jack recognized the blue foil wrapper of his favorite brand of japanese condom sally was tearing the wrapper with her teeth it seemed entirely too strange that claudias daughter would know in advance his preference for kimono microthins then he remembered that the girl had used his bathroom where shed no doubt discovered his condoms in the medicine cabinet jack looked into her darkgold eyes and saw claudia as if she were alive and young again the same wide mouth but whiter teeth the same full breasts and broad hips of a girl who would wage her own war with her weight one day like her mother sally was the kind of woman you sank into there would be no need to explain the problem to dr garcíaanyone but jack could have done the math if hed last seen claudia in june even if shed met sallys dad immediatelyand married him and gotten pregnant all in that same monthsally couldnt have been born before march in that case in july sally was fifteen in order for her to be eighteen she would in all likelihood have to have been jacks daughter as dr garcía had reminded him he never could count as it happened as sally explained to himthis was after they had sex unfortunatelyin june claudia went off to some shakespeare festival in new jersey where she met a young director and shakespearean scholar they were married that august and claudia got pregnant in september sally was born in june when she and jack had sex in his house on entrada drive sally had been fifteen for all of one month but she looked a lot older sally quickly ran a bath and sat in it with the bathroom door open she hated to have sex and run she said but she was in a hurry she had a curfew she had to get back to the georgian hotel in santa monica where she was staying with her mom and dad and the rest of her family your mom is alive shes as big as a barn but shes very healthy sally said you wouldnt have slept with me if you thought mom was alive would you jack didnt say anything he just sat on the bathroom floor with his back against a towel rack watching claudias nearperfect likeness in the tub my parents are the happiest couple i know sally was saying my mother gets embarrassed when we tease her about being your exgirlfriend but my sisters and i and my dad think its the funniest thing in the world we order a pizza and watch one of your movieswe all just howl mom sometimes has to leave the room we make her laugh so hard she has to pee pause itill be right back mom says when you won the oscar i thought we were all going to wet our pants youre how old he asked her your math is ridiculousmom wasnt kidding sally said for your selfprotection jack you ought to look up the california penal codethe part about unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor youre over twentyone im under sixteenthats really all that matters youre guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony you could go to jail for one two three or four yearsand youre liable for a civil penalty not to exceed twentyfive thousand dollars that is if i tell anybody she stood up in the tub and hastily dried herself off throwing the towel on the bathroom floor he followed her through his bedroom and into the living room where her clothes were scattered everywhere while sally got dressed jack searched for her shoes this is kind of my summer job she was explaining to him what is seducing jack burns extortion sally further explained that her dadwho was hardly a pathetic loser in sallys fond opinionmanaged a small communityoperated theater in vermont it was called the nuts bolts playhouse they did summerstock productions they ran workshops in acting directing and playwriting during the school months a nonprofit foundation funded everything when claudia and her shakespearean husband werent engaged in their theater productions and workshops they were fulltime fundraisers were a big familyfour girls sally elaborated we all have to go to college one day my parents whole life is by example we love the theater we learn to be independent we dont care about money but we always need money do you get it how much do you want jack asked claudias daughter it would kill my mom to know that i slept with you she said how much sally she grabbed his wrist and looked at his watch shit you have to drop me off at the georgian or near it i supposedly went to a movie screening where i had an opportunity to meet you damn curfew your mom and dad knew you were meeting me he asked her yes but not to have sex sally cried laughing theyre really terrific parentsi told you she gave him a brochure of the nuts bolts playhousethere were pictures of claudia and her husband and the other daughters the check was to be made payable to the nuts bolts foundation it being a nonprofit meant that jacks donation was taxdeductible sally told him for years the children had asked their mother why she didnt ask jack burns for money for their theater enterprise jack was a movie star and claudia knew him surely he would give something why didnt you just ask me for a donation he asked sally would you have given me this much sally asked hed written out a check to the nuts bolts foundation for compared to what the california penal code could cost him it was a bargain jack drove the girl and claudias old suitcase back to ocean avenue at least hed been right about the suitcase it had been a prop sallys parents were night people after they put the younger daughters to bed claudia and her husband went downstairs to have a drink in the bar thats where they would be waiting for sally to come back from the screening theyd agreed to let her go out and meet jack burns solely for the purpose of asking jack to make a donation to their efforts on behalf of claudias first and most enduring lovethe theater this must have been what sally meant by learning to be independent as for claudias old suitcase sally had stuffed it full of brochures of the nuts bolts playhousejust in case she met other rich and famous movie stars at the alleged screening sally and jack discussed whether it was a good idea or not for him to come into the lobby of the georgian with her meet her dadsay hello to claudia for old times sake sally could announce the extraordinary generosity of jacks donation gifts of were rare gifts of that size constituted naming opportunities sally told him a fellowship for a young studentactor director or playwright in jack burnss name there was a capital campaign for a new sixhundredseat theater too lots of naming opportunities apparently or you could choose to remain anonymous sally said jack opted to remain anonymous he told sally that he thought he wouldnt go meet her dad and renew his acquaintance with her mom in the bar of the georgian hotel thats probably best sally said frankly i could pull it off ive rehearsed this for freakin forever but i honestly dont know if youre a good enough actor to just walk in there and pretend that you havent fucked my brains out im probably not that good he admitted jack i think youre very sweet claudias daughter said kissing his cheek mom and dad are going to write youi know they will a big thankyou letter at the very least for the rest of your life youll be on their mailing list theyll probably ask you for money every year i dont mean another hundredthou or anything but theyll ask you for something i always thought they should ask you in the nuts bolts playhouse brochure claudia was wearing a tentshaped dress and looked bigger than kathy bates climbing into that hot tub with jack nicholson in whatever that movie was her husband was a tall bearded man who looked as if he were always cast as a betrayed king the younger daughters were as bigboned and pretty as sally when jack pulled up to the curb at the georgian hotel on ocean avenue sally kissed him on his forehead you seem like a good guy jackjust a sad one she said please give your mother my fondest regards he told the fifteenyearold thanks for the money jack it means a lotim not kidding how does this constitute haunting me he asked her i mean it was a sting a pretty good oneill give you that sally but how have you haunted me exactly oh youll see sally said this will haunt you jackand i dont mean the money he went back to entrada drivethe scene of the crime so to speak it was a crime not only according to the california penal code it felt very much like a crime to jack burns hed had sex with a fifteenyearold girl and it had cost him only jack stayed up late reading every word of the brochure sally had left with him he looked at all the pictures over and over again the nuts bolts playhouse was dedicated to that noble idea of theater as a public service a neighbor who was an electrician had installed the new stage lights for free a couple of local carpenters had built the sets for three shakespearean productions also at no charge in a small southern vermont town virtually everyone had contributed something to the community playhouse the area schoolchildren performed their school plays in the theater a womens book club staged dramatizations of scenes from their favorite novels a new york city opera company rehearsed there for the month of january before going on tour some local children with good voices were taught to sing by professional opera singers poets gave readings there were concerts too the summerstock productions while pandering to tourists fondness for popular entertainment included at least two serious plays every summer jack recognized a few of the guest performers in the summer castsactors and actresses from new york there were two pictures of claudia in both she looked radiant and joyful and fat her daughters were most photogenicselfconfident girls whod been taught to perform certainly claudia could be proud of sally for possessing both poise and determination beyond her years did claudia and her husband know that sally was a model of selfassurance and independent thinking probably did her parents also know that sally was as sexually active on her familys behalf as she was probably not claudia had made the theater her familys businessperhaps more successfully than she knew but no matter how hard jack tried to understand the financing he couldnt grasp how a socalled nonprofit foundation worked his math let him down again all jack knew was that he would be writing out checks to the nuts bolts foundation for the rest of his life regular donations of or more seemed a small price to pay for what he had done he wanted to call dr garcía but it was by now two or three in the morning and he knew what she would say tell me in chronological order jack im not a priest i dont hear confessions what she meant was that she didnt give absolution not that there was any forgiveness for his having had sex with claudias daughternot even if jack could have convinced himself that sally really was claudias ghost jack was turning out the lights in the kitchen before he finally went to bed when he saw the rudimentary grocery list he had fastened to the refrigerator with one of his moms japanesetattoo magnets coffee beans milk cranberry juice it didnt add up to much of a life he was already beginning to see how claudia had kept her promise to haunt him jack discovered that when youre ashamed your life becomes a whatif world claudias daughter sally was fifteen it wasnt hard to imagine a girl of that age having some sort of fallingout with her mom teenage girls didnt need legitimate provocation to hate their mothers what if for some stupid reason sally wanted to hurt her mom what if sally told claudia that shed slept with jack or what if later in her life sally came to the illogical conclusion that jack had taken advantage of her what iffor a host of reasons possibly having nothing to do with what had inspired sally to seduce jack in the first placethe wayward girl simply decided that he deserved to pay for his crime or that jack burns should at least be publicly exposed well jack im sure your shame is even greater than your fear of the california penal code dr garcía would later tell him but in our past dont many of us have someone who could destroy us with a letter or a phone call you dont have someone like that do you dr garcía im not the patient jack i dont have to answer that kind of question lets just say we all have to learn to live with something it was august jacks house on entrada drive was still for sale but he felt that claudias ghost had moved in to stay it was as if she were living with him wherever else he might go before or after that wretched house was sold jack had no doubt that claudias ghost would come with him krung the thai kickboxer from that longago gym on bathurst street had told him once gym rats always gotta find a new ship jackie well jack was a gym rat who would soon have to find a new ship but now he was a gym rat with a ghost jack found that you dont sleep well when youre living with a ghost he had meaningless but disturbing dreams from which he would awaken with the conviction that his hand was touching emmas tattoo that perfect vagina the notaroseofjericho which his mom had tattooed on emmas right hipjust below the panty line jack took his real estate agents advice and moved out this allowed her to empty the house of all the old and ugly furniture most of which emma had acquired for their first apartment in venice as well as the rugs and jacks gym equipment the floors were sanded and the walls were painted white the house became a clean and sparelooking dump at leastand jack moved into a modest set of rooms at the oceana in santa monica it was a thirdfloor suite with four rooms including a kitchen overlooking the courtyard and the swimming pool he could have chosen a view of ocean avenue but the oceana was a moderately priced residential hotel that appealed to families jack liked the sound of the children playing in the pool some of the families were asian or european jack liked listening to the foreign languages too he accepted the transience of staying there because jack burns was transientimpermanent almost ceasing to exist he kept next to nothing from entrada drive he gave three quarters of his clothes to goodwill and his oscar to his lawyer for safekeeping jack kept his most recent audi of course the gym at the oceana was a joke but there were two gyms in venice that he likedand from the oceana jack was even closer to dr garcías office on montana avenue than hed been on entrada drive jack registered at the oceana as harry mocco as usual the few important people in his life knew where to find him somehow it seemed fitting to a man in limbo that jack would hear from leslie oastler shortly after his move mrs oastler called because she hadnt heard from him in a whilewhich was all right with her she added quickly and just fine with dolores no doubt dolores had made such a fuss about the ongoing presence of jacks clothes that mrs oastler had donated them to st hildas where mr ramsey had happily accepted the clothes as costumes for the schools dramatic productions mr ramsey and miss wurtz had called to thank leslie for the unusual gift we never have enough mens clothes for the dramatizations caroline had explained jacks former bedroom mrs oastler told him had been converted to a studio for dolores leslies blonde must have been a poet or a paintersome kind of artist surelybut jack didnt ask as for emmas old bedroom it was now the official guest room the wallpaper was differentmore feminine leslie said the furniture and curtains were more feminine too all this was doloress doing jack guessed but again he didnt ask when youre back in town youll probably prefer to stay in a hotel mrs oastler said probably jack replied he couldnt tell why she had called any new news from or about your dad jack leslie asked no but im not looking for him jack explained i wonder why not leslie said he would be a man in his sixties wouldnt he things happen to men at that age you might lose him before you find him if you know what i mean he might die you mean he might be dead already mrs oastler said you were so curious about him what happened to your curiosity jack this was what dr garcía was always asking him ive been seeing a psychiatrist he half explained im glad youre seeing somebody leslie exclaimed but you used to be able to do more than one thing at a time what mrs oastler may mean jack dr garcía would soon tell him is that seeing a psychiatrist is not something you necessarily do in lieu of having a little natural curiosity but jack was guilty of an indefensible crime hed not only had sex with a fifteenyearold girlhe had acquiesced to it he carried an awful secret andprovided claudias daughter let himjack would bear its burden to his grave shame had robbed him of his curiosity when youre ashamed you dont feel inclined to undertake another adventureat least not right away the thankyou letter from claudia and her husband whom jack would forever imagine as a bearded betrayed king came with family photographsamong them one of sally as a little girl and one of claudia when she was noticeably thinner there was also a photo of the husband and father of four when he was cleanshaven jack could understand why the king had grown a beard should you ever be inclined to return to the theater claudia wrote just say the word a month or six weeks in vermont in midsummer a stage so small it would seem his very own his pick of the play and the part under the circumstances jack was both touched and repelled by the offer were all so grateful to you jack claudia went on and were so proud of sally for having the temerity to approach you claudias husband sallys father wrote jack would write back to claudia and her husband that he was glad to have helped in what modest way he could but he lacked sallys temerity jack wrote that he no longer had the nerve to stand alone on a stage the outofcontext moments of filmmaking which ive grown used to allow the actor room to hide whatever that meant but jack would think of their little theater often he wroteand every summer he would regret the missed opportunity of an idyllic month or six weeks in vermont in truth he would rather die jack felt claudias ghost watching over him she was all smiles when he mailed that letter immediately following this insincere correspondence jack experienced contact of another kind there was nothing insincere about caroline wurtzs phone call which woke him early one august morning from his umpteenth dream of touching emmas vagina tattoo a family from düsseldorf with whom hed been testing the limits of his exeter german were already up and swimming in the oceana pool jack burns as mr ramsey might say miss wurtz began rise and shine the wurtz of course had no idea of what a shameful thing jack had done that he would rise and go on rising seemed likely that he might ever shine again seemed unthinkable how nice to hear your voice caroline he told her truthfully you sound awful miss wurtz said dont pretend i didnt wake you but i have news worth waking you for jack youve heard from him jack asked wide awake if not exactly shining ive heard of him not from him you have a sister jack biologically speaking if his father had remarriedas it appeared that william hadit was conceivable that jack had a half sister which was indeed news to him and miss wurtz her name was heather burns and she was a junior lecturer on the faculty of music at the university of edinburgh where some years earlier shed also completed her undergraduate studies in the department of music heather was a pianist and an organist and she played a wooden flute shed done her phd in belfast on brahms caroline informed him something about brahms and the nineteenth century my dad is back in edinburgh he asked the wurtz william isnt well jackhes in a sanatorium he was playing the organ again at old st pauls and teaching in edinburgh but he has osteoarthritis his arthritic hands have put an end to his playing at least professionally hes in a sanatorium for arthritis jack asked her no noits a mental place miss wurtz said hes in an insane asylum caroline heather says its very nice william loves it there its just that its very expensive miss wurtz said my sister was calling for money jack asked she was calling for you jack she wanted to know how to reach you i told her i would call you as you know i give your phone number to no onealthough in this case i was tempted yes heather needs moneyto keep william happy and safe in the sanatorium jacks sister was twentyeight a junior lecturer at the university of edinburgh didnt make enough money to afford to have children the wurtz explained heather couldnt be expected to pay for williams confinement heather is married jack asked miss wurtz certainly not you mentioned children caroline i was being hypotheticalabout the poor girls meager salary miss wurtz elaborated heather has a boyfriend hes irish but shes not going to marry him heather merely said that her income didnt permit her to even think about starting a family and that she needs your help with william i have a sister jack was thinking that she needed his help that anyone needed him was the most wonderful news better still jacks sister loved their father according to miss wurtz heather adored william but shed not had an easy time of it nor had he after talking with jacks sister the wurtz had quite a story to tell if not surpassing or even equaling his feelings for the commandants daughter the next love of william burnss life was a young woman hed met and married in germany barbara steiner was a singer she introduced william to schuberts songs the singing of german lieder accompanied by the pianofortethe ancestor of the modern piano as miss wurtz described it to jackwas new and exciting to william it was no minor art to him nor was barbara steiner a passing infatuation they performed and taught together i have a son but i may never see him again william told barbara from the beginning jack burns was an emotional and psychological presence in her childhood heather told miss wurtzeven before jack became a movie star and his dad began to watch him obsessively on the big screen and on videotape and dvd according to the wurtz william had jacks dialoguein all the moviesdown pat william burns and barbara steiner had lived in munich in cologne in stuttgart they were together in germany for about five years when barbara was pregnant with heather william was offered an opportunity to return home to edinburgh he seized it heather was born in scotland where both her parents taught in the department of music at the university of edinburgh before her william was once again playing the father willis at old st paulsnot that the organ hadnt been altered and enlarged since hed last played it given the churchs fabled reverberation time this hardly mattered it was old st pauls scottish episcopal church which william loved and edinburgh was his city miss wurtz bless her heart too quickly jumped to the conclusion that williams life had come full circle wasnt it wonderful that for all his wanderlust and the upheavals of his younger days william burns had at last settled down hed found the right woman their daughter would give jacks father some measure of peace a sense of replacement for losing his son but it was not to be barbara steiner was homesick for germany in her view edinburgh was not a great city for classical music there was a lot of music but much of it was mediocre the climate was damp and dreary barbara believed that the weather exacerbated her chronic bronchitis she half joked that she had become a singer with a permanent cough but the cough was persistent and more serious than she knew what heather jacks sister imparted to miss wurtzin one phone callwas a portrait of her mother as a complainer according to barbara scottish men excluding william were unattractive and dressed badly the women were even less attractive and didnt know how to dress at all whisky was a curse not only for the drunkenness it caused william didnt drink it also killed the taste buds and made the scots incapable of recognizing how bad their food was kilts like lederhosen should be worn only by childrenor so barbara believed william wouldnt have been caught dead in a kilt in the summer when the weather finally improved there were too many touristsespecially americans barbara was allergic to wool no tartan would ever please her her mother heather told miss wurtz found one child such an overwhelming burden that she resisted williams wishes to have one or two more barbara was not a natural mother yet she reduced her teaching duties by half in order to spend more time with heather although time spent with an infant was torture to her barbara steiner was a child of divorced parents she had such a dread of separation and divorce that she periodically suspected william of planning to divorce her he wasnt in fact william was in heathers words slavishly devoted to his griping wife he held himself accountable for her unhappiness for taking her away from her beloved homeland he offered to move back to germany but barbara believed that such a move would make her husband so unhappy that he would be driven to divorce her all the more quickly before barbara steiners parents had separated she had cherished the family ski holidays they would takeevery winter and springto the swiss and austrian alps after the divorce the ski trips which barbara took alone with her mother or alone with her father became a form of enforced exerciseathletic stoicism and silent dinners where one or the other of her parents drank too much wine yet the names of these ski resorts in austria and switzerland were reverentially repeated to heather by her unhappy mother it was as if they were saints names and barbara had converted to catholicism st anton klosters lech wengen zermatt st christoph when theyd lived in germany barbara steiner had actually taught william burns how to skialbeit badly jack had trouble envisioning his dad a tattooed organist on skis but the swiss and austrian alps were a long way from scotland well take you skiing when youre old enough heathers mom had told her one can imagine how the wurtzs account of this had echoes of alices litany to jack but the socalled chronic bronchitis turned out to be lung cancer which barbara believed she had caught like the flu in edinburgh i wouldnt be surprised if lung cancer originated in scotland she half joked between coughs it was the death of her singing but not of her heather was too young at the time to remember anything positive about her mothers recovery from the cancer heather recalled nothing about the radiation caroline told jackand only the vomiting part and the wig part of her mothers chemotherapy heather would have been five miss wurtz speculated the child could barely remember the first ski trip of her life to klostersexcept that her mother barbara had been depressed because she was too tired to ski jack suggested to caroline that when heather was five her memory of anything was unreliable miss wurtz countered this argument although she was only five at the time his sisters most enduring memory of her mother had prevailed barbara steiner had hated how the scots drove on the wrong side of the road she cited the numerous deaths of foreign tourists in edinburgh every summer they stepped off the curb looking left instead of right if the cancer doesnt come back and kill me barbara used to say to william and to their fiveyearold daughter i swear i shall be struck down by a car going the wrong way on the street she was she stepped off the curb where it was writtenas plain as daylook right she looked left instead although shed lived in edinburgh for almost six years and a taxi killed her i believe heather said it was in the vicinity of charlotte square miss wurtz informed jack a childrens book author was reading at some sort of writers festival her mother had taken heather to the reading which was in a tent when they were leaving and about to cross the street heather reached for her mothers hand heather looked the right way and saw the taxi coming her mother looked the wrong way and stepped off the curb the taxi killed barbara instantly heather remembers that her fingers only slightly grazed her mothers hand whether jacks sister had freely divulged these painful details to miss wurtz or whether caroline had coaxed the details out of her jack didnt know he knew only that the wurtz was a tireless believer in dramatizing important informationhence the detail that barbara steiners wig flew off on impact was conveyed to jack and the fact that heather and her mom at her mothers insistence spoke only german when they were alone together that jacks fiveyearold sister was crying for her dead mother in german confused the witnesses to the accident there were many parents with children among the witnesses theyd also attended the reading by the childrens book author at the writers festival the police reconstructed the accident incorrectly a german tourist had been struck down by a car in the unexpected lane the astonishingly bald woman was carrying no identification and her fiveyearold daughter who was hysterical spoke only german actually barbara had been carrying a purse it must have been flung far away from her when the taxi hit herlost forever like the wig heather when she calmed down told a policeman in english that she wanted to go home she took the cop by the hand and showed him the way heather had walked everywhere in edinburgh with her mother and father no one in the family including heather when she grew up drove a car thus william burns became a single parent to a fiveyearold girl knowing william miss wurtz said he would have held himself accountable for the death of the poor childs mother too did heather say that jack asked of course she didnt say it jack but i know william he forgave your mother for everything but he never forgave himself and now hes crazy jack asked you should talk to your sister jack you should meet heather before its too late but did heather want to meet him he inquired of the wurtz jack wondered if he should send his sister a check first you have to call her and talk to her yourself miss wurtz said im sure you have some things in common name one caroline your mothers werent your favorite people miss wurtz said i loved my mom when i was a little boy jack pointed out goodness jack im sure your sister loved her mom when she was a little girl but with hindsight heather has at least considered what a difficult woman her mother could be doesnt that sound familiar it was the wurtzs view that jacks father had not abandoned him on the contrary william had provided for jack williams deal with alice at least made her responsible for doing all the outwardly correct things jack had gone to good schools hed worn clean clothes he wasnt beaten or abusedthat is not to alices knowledge it was also miss wurtzs viewand caroline was no fan of jacks motherthat alice had to some degree shielded jack from what the wurtz called the adult choices in alices own dark life notwithstanding leslie oastler and some of alices friends in the tattoo world you must tell me how william is when you find him miss wurtz said meanwhile be thankful you have a sister i have a sister jack repeated that was the message he would leave on the answering machine in dr garcías office because it was too early in the morning to make an appointment to see her merely discovering that he had a sister was in the category of what dr garcía called incomplete informationby which she meant that jacks news didnt merit calling her at home jack called his sister heather burns instead it was only am in santa monica am in toronto where miss wurtz had been calling from but it was already midafternoon in edinburgh there was music playing when heather answered the phonevoices and an organ maybe trumpets give me a moment his sister said turning down the volume on the cd player its jack burns your brother he told her its heatheryour half sister actually she said but i feel i know you it was almost as if i grew up with you if your brother knew you he would love you daddy said every night when he put me to bed and there was always this refrain i have a son he would shout i have a son and a daughter daddy would say it could be tiresome but i got the point i wish id grown up with you jack told her you dont know that yet she said her voice was crisp and even with less of a scottish accent than hed expected there was some irish in her accent jack thoughtthe effect of those years in belfast perhaps or the irish boyfriend above all she sounded very practical i want to meet you he told her you dont know that either jack burns heather said im not comfortable asking you for money but i need it our father needs it i should saynot that he knows he needs it he took care of me ill take care of him jack told her dont act with me mr movie star heather said say only what you mean i mean it he told her then you better come meet me lets see how that goes she said i should have been there when you had your first date jack told his sister i could have warned you about the guy dont go there as billy rainbow would say heather said i could have warned you about some of your dates too no doubt about it he told her it was another billy rainbow line that character never said anything that hadnt been said a million times before but billy said the most mundane things sincerely you sound just like him heather said like billy rainbow i mean but im not like himim really someone else jack said hoping it was true his sister made no response jack could hear the music playing it sounded like a hymn i have a sister he said it seemed to go with the hymn yes you do jack burns you have a father too but ill tell you how it is his sister said you have to go through me to get to him not for all your money mr movie star do you see him without seeing me firstnot for all the money in the world you can trust me heather you have to go through me to get to him she said again i have to trust you with him i swear to godyou can trust me he told her you swear to god are you religious jack burns no not really jack admitted well he is you better prepare yourself for that too his sister said are you religious heather not so religious that i can ever forgive your mother she told him not that religious but he is after barbara steiners death william burns and his daughter really learned to ski they went only once a year for a week or ten days to one of those sacredsounding places they eventually added davos and pontresina to the list skiing like musiclike everything they did togetherbecame a ritual according to jacks sister she and her father became halfwaydecent skiers heather told jack that shed started practicing the piano a year after her mother died when she was six years old william burns encouraged his daughter to practice for five hours a day alone as a teenager heather took up the wooden flute the flute is more sociable she explained to jack that there was a lot of irish music for the flute led her to do her doctorate in belfast the irish boyfriend was still in ireland heather held out little hope for the future of any longdistance relationship but theyd played together in a band in belfast and theyd traveled togethera trip to portugal the previous easter i like him in small doses was all heather would say about him as a junior lecturer she made a year in belfast shed paid a month for a twobedroom flat in edinburgh she paid for a single room in an apartment she shared with five roommates however heathers oneyear contract had been extended she would get a raise and be making next year for the time being heather liked edinburgh and her job if she stayed another five or six years and if she was successful in getting published shed be doing well enough to start a family but heather doubted she would stay in scotland all she would tell jack was that she had other plans her last year in belfast shed played the organ in a church one of her senior colleagues at the university of edinburgh john kitchen had been the organist at old st pauls since when william burnss arthritis had forced him to retire as principal organist for almost fifteen years william had continued to play the organ at old st paulsofficially hed been john kitchens assistant heather was the backup organist to john kitchen at old st pauls now kitchen had long been their fathers friend heather told jack he was like an uncle to her she said she played irish music on her wooden flute one night a week at the central bar a pub at the bottom of leith walk ill show you the central when youre here heather told him i want to know everything about you jack said you dont know that yet his sister reminded him jack parked the audi at the curb on montana avenue he was waiting for elizabeth dr garcías receptionist to arrive and unlock the office elizabeth would be the first to play jacks ihaveasister message jack would give her time to play all the messages on the answering machine before he asked her if he could be dr garcías first appointment jack never waited in the waiting room anymore he waited in his car for his therapy sessions with dr garcía when it was jacks turn elizabeth would call him on his cell phone then jack would put some money in the parking meter and go inside his presence in the waiting room made the young mothersand occasionally their friends or nanniesborderline hysterical dr garcía had said jack was listening to an emmylou harris cd his fingers keeping time on the steering wheel to tougher than the rest when elizabeth came into view on the sidewalk she shook her key ring at him but jack couldnt hear the keys jinglenot over emmylou ill show you tougher than the rest elizabeth said letting him into the office she was a tall hawkfaced woman in her fifties her gunmetal gray hair was always in a ponytail there was something of mrs mcquats severity in the tensed muscles of her neck i left a message on dr garcías machine jack said i heard it nice message i always access the messages from my car she explained i suppose you want the first appointment i would appreciate it elizabeth he sat in dr garcías office not in the waiting room while elizabeth made a pot of coffee jack had never been alone in that office he took the time to look more closely at the family photographs noting that dr garcía was much younger in the photos than hed first assumed if those children were hers they were grown nowprobably with children of their own how old is dr garcía he asked elizabeth when she brought him a cup of coffee sixtyone elizabeth said jack was amazed dr garcía looked much younger and the gentleman in the pictures he asked elizabeth is he her husband or her father he was her husband elizabeth said hes been dead for almost twenty yearshe died before i met her perhaps this explained the olderlooking mans spectral presence in the photographs he was a spirit who haunted the family no longer a participant she didnt remarry jack asked no she lives with one of her daughters and her daughters family dr garcía has too many grandchildren to count it turned out that elizabeth had been dr garcías patient before becoming the doctors receptionist elizabeth had been divorced she was a former alcoholic whod lost custody of her only child a little boy when she stopped drinking and got a job the boywho was then a teenagerchose to come live with her elizabeth credited dr garcía with saving her life jack sat alone with his coffee in dr garcías office he felt inconsequential in the company of her family who were frozen in time it was instructive to jack that his therapist had chosen to decorate her office with those photographs of herself and her children that predated her husbands death as if she needed to be reminded that selfpity was not allowed feeling sorry for yourself was not part of the healing process or so dr garcía told her patients live with it the photos said dont forget but forgive the past in her daughters house where dr garcía lived as a grandmothera somewhat stern one jack imaginedthere were probably newer photographs of her children as grownups of her countless grandchildrenpossibly of family pets but in her place of business where she counseled those who felt terminally sorry for themselves dr garcía had assembled an austere reminder of her earlier joy and abiding sorrow shed once told elizabeth that shed always known when she married an older man that her husband would predecease her i just never guessed by how many years shed said with a laugh with a laugh jack asked elizabeth did dr garcía really laugh when she said that thats the trick isnt it elizabeth said here was another loose arrangement that would never have been tolerated in vienna or new york where elizabeths candor to jack would have been considered unprofessionalwhere jack suspected dr garcías insistence on chronological order as therapy probably would have been considered unprofessional too but it was working wasnt it there was a prescription pad on dr garcías desk jack thought about what he wanted to say to her and if it would fit on one page of the prescription paper he decided he could make it fit if he kept his handwriting small dear dr garcía im going to edinburgh to meet my sistermaybe my father too ill put it all in chronological order for you when i get back im sorry about your husband jack then he went into the waiting room where a nanny was reading a childrens book to a four or fiveyearold in a world of loose arrangements jack had learned not to question why the young mothers didnt just leave their kids at home with their nannies the nanny looked up at jack when he came out of dr garcías office but the child didnt bother to look on a small couch one of the young mothers lay curled in a fetal position with her back to the waiting room jack couldnt hear her crying but her shoulders were shaking i left dr garcía a noteits on her desk he told elizabeth is there anything else you want me to tell her i mean in addition to the note elizabeth said tell her i dont need to see her today he said tell her i looked happy well thats a stretch how about i say happier than usual elizabeth suggested thats okay he said be safe jack dont go crazy or anything like that edinburgh jack was thirtyeight his sister heather was twentyeight how do you meet someone you should have known most of your life in jacks case he stalled he arrived in edinburgh a day before hed told heather he was coming he had his mothers business to attend to it was his father who had brought jack and heather together jack wanted to keep heather separate from his moms history in edinburgh the hotel doorman at the balmoral a strapping young man in a kilt was the first to ask jack if he was in town for the festivala question he would repeatedly be asked jack had a corner suite overlooking princes street he had a view of a chaoticlooking trampoline park princes street was clogged with pedestrian traffic people carrying shopping bags tourists folding and unfolding maps with the concierges assistance jack hired a car and driver to take him to leithalices old turf it was less crowded therenot everybodys favorite part of town apparently the drivers false teeth were too loose his name was rory and his teeth clicked when he talked jack wanted to see st thomass where alice had sung in the choirinnocently before she met william in south leith parish church st thomass no longer existed but rory whod been born in leith remembered its location and knew what it had become for more than twenty years st thomass had been a sikh temple the view of what was once leith hospital which had so depressed alice that shed left st thomass for another church was depressing still the former hospital rory told jack was only an outpatient clinic now the unused parts looked neglected and broken half the groundfloor windows were smashed jack knew what dr garcía would have said if shed been with him and rory at that moment if st thomass is gone if an entire church can let go of the past why cant you let go too jack south leith parish church where alice first sang for william made a more complex impression on jack the high walls along constitution street which were meant to keep people out of the popular graveyard stood in juxtaposition to a toppled gravestone it read here lye the remains of robert caldcleugh the date which was hard to read was among the gravestones jack saw that the most recent burial was in jack wouldnt have wanted to be buried there if you were lying in that graveyard facing south you would be looking at an ugly seventeenstory highrise for the rest of your death as for that area of leith walk where a rail bridge once joined mandelson street to jane streetaberdeen bills tattoo parlor persevere had been situated under the rumble of the trainsthere was little or no evidence of the old tenements alice had described to jack in her childhood these were mostly small shops with flats above them meeting the minimum standards of comfort and safetyor so shed said but only the railway arches remained and these were used as car garages a volkswagen repair place was prominent among them the apartments were newer here than the shabby latenineteenthcentury buildings along much of leith walknot the old tenements alice had deplored but sheltered housing for the elderly built in the late seventiesaccording to rory for widows and widowers jack couldnt find the cinema house which his mom had maintained was within a stones throw of persevere but rory remembered where the local cinema had beenit was now a bingo parlor called the mecca elsewhere on leith walk there were convenience stores which rory called corner shops while leith walk appeared largely residential there were pubs and places serving carryout food and the everpresent video stores young people seemed to live here many asians among them alice had once spoken of her excitement upon first seeing the leith central station when she was a child but the former station was now the central bar where jacks sister played her wooden flute rory said that strippers had performed there as recently as the late seventies or early eighties it was midafternoon when jack looked inside the central there were no strippers the jukebox was playing frank sinatras my way smoke blurred the tiled walls and the long mirrors and half concealed the high victorian ceiling which was heavily patterned at the intersection of constitution street and bernard street there was a bank on the corner and what looked like a shipping agency jack and rory crossed a bridge over the water of leith and ran into dock place jack remembered the song his mom sang if only when she was drunk or stonedthe song hed first heard her sing in amsterdam it was his moms mantra hed thought at the timeto never be a whore oh ill never be a kittie or a cookie or a tail the one place worse than dock place is the port o leith jail no ill never be a kittie of one true thing im sure i wont end up on dock place and ill never be a hure jacks scottish accent needed practice but he sang the song to rory who said hed never heard it before as for dock place it didnt look like such a bad place to end upnot to jack not anymore the hures if theyd ever been there had moved on rory drove jack back to the balmoral where he had a lateafternoon nap he slept for only two or three hours but it was enough to shake the jet lag after dinner at the hotel he walked out on princes street and asked the doorman to recommend a good pub in leith jack didnt want to drink but he felt like sipping a beer in the unnameable atmosphere of his mothers birthplace maybe he was pretending to be his grandfather aberdeen bill the doorman recommended two places they were both on constitution street very near each other jack took a taxi and asked the driver to waithe was sure he wouldnt be long the port o leith where he went first was small and crowded it was a very mixed bar there were the obvious regularslocals old standbysand sailors off the docks and young students having their first glass the legal age was eighteen which appeared to jack to mean sixteen the ceiling was a mosaic of flags on the walls there were ribbons from sailors hats and life preservers from ships there was a keep leith sign on the mirror the barmaid explained to jack that this was a political issuein response to an unpopular plan to rename leith north edinburgh jack declined the offered bar snackssomething called pork scratchings among themand sipped a scottish oatmeal stout farther down constitution street was a cavernous victorian pub called nobles bar it was as empty as the port o leith had been crowded but even with the mob from the port o leith nobles would have seemed empty by comparison there were no women in the bar and fewer than half a dozen unfortunatelooking mensquinty eyes pasty complexions noses of all sorts jack deliberated between ordering a newcastle brown ale and something called black douglas it didnt really matter since he knew he would finish neither jack burns couldnt remember the last time hed been in a bar and no one had recognized him now on the same night hed been in two back at the balmoral jack had a mineral water at the bar where they were playing bob dylans lay lady lay the old song which hed once liked took jack by surprise hed been saying goodbye to his mother never suspecting that nothing in edinburgh the city of her birth would resurrect hernot the way bob dylan could bring her back to him every time are you here for the festival mr burns the bartender asked actually my mother was born here he told the man i just spent a little time in her old neighborhood in leith and my sister lives here im meeting her tomorrow jack didnt say for the first time he had arranged to meet heather the next morning in a coffee shop called elephants and bagels on nicolson square this was less than a tenminute walk from his hotel and very near her office at the university the music department offices and practice rooms were in alison house on nicolson square jack walked along north bridge over the train yards for british rail he passed the big glass building on nicolson street the festival theatre and turned right into nicolson square he was early as usual in elephants and bagels jack sat at a table near the door and ordered a mug of coffee an advertisement for the coffee shop said the best hangover cure in edinburgh the walls were painted a bright yellow there were plants in the windows and a glass case filled with elephant figurinescarved stone painted wood ceramic and porcelain elephants a large round support column was covered with childrens drawingsbirds trees more elephants the coffee shop had the educational yet whimsical atmosphere of a kindergarten classroom when heather came in the shop jack didnt at first see how she resembled him she had short blond hair like her german mother but her brown eyes and sharp facial features were jacks or williams and she was both lean and compactas small and fit as a jockey her tortoiseshell eyeglasses were almondshaped she was as nearsighted as her mother had been she explained but she refused to wear contacts she hated the feeling of something in her eyes she was waiting to be a little older before trying the new laser surgery she told jack all this before she sat down they had shaken hands not kissed she ordered tea not coffee you look just like him she said i mean you look less like jack burns than i thought you would and more like our dad i cant wait to see him he told her you have to wait she said its just an expression jack explained they were both nervous she talked about her five roommates she was moving out soon with one other girl two of her flatmates directed a nonsmoking clinic they were vegans who believed that everything with a spiky shape attracted bad energy heather had started a small cactus garden in the kitchen area but this had to gotoo many spikes the vegans had also beseeched the landlord to remove the weather vane from the top of the apartment building my sister is living with lunatics jack was thinking jack explained that he was selling his house in santa monica but that he had no idea where he wanted to live heather knew he was registered at the balmoral as harry mocco she wondered why jack wanted to know what she taught at the university she taught five courseshistorical and theoretical music classes mostly to beginners and keyboard skills our department is all old men heather said goodnaturedly jack thought that his sister was a pretty girl with glasses she had an air of academic aloofness or detachment about her she wore little or no makeup but an attractive linen skirt with a fitted tshirt and sensiblelooking walking shoes jack asked to see where she worked and where she lived heather moved her fingers all the while they were walking as if she were unconsciously playing a piano or an organ the music practice rooms in the basement of alison house were like prison cells they were small cubicles poorly ventilated the walls were a dirty peasoup green and the floors were a hideous orange linoleum the lighting which was adequate was of a fluorescent variety that heather said was bad for your sanity jack thought that the word sanity might lead them into a conversation about their dad but jack and heather were experiencing the equivalent of a first date they needed to get through an unbearable amount of trivia before the more serious subjects could emerge the lecture room in alison house was more pleasant than the practice rooms the large windows let in lots of natural light although the view was a limited oneof an old stone building there were two pianos and a small organ in the room but when jack asked heather to play something for him she just shook her head and directed him to a narrow twisting staircase which led to her office jack got the feeling that she wanted him to go ahead of her up the stairs can we talk about him he asked her maybe we could begin with the arthritis if thats an easy part to talk about she stared at the blue carpet on her office floor her fingers seemingly searching for the right keys on a keyboard only she could see she plucked at her skirt the creamcolored walls had a spackled unsmooth finish there were two desksthe larger one with a computer on it the smaller with a german dictionary the stereo equipment was probably worth more than everything else in the office including the small piano there were more cds than books on the bookshelves and a bulletin board with a sepia photograph of brahms tacked to it there was also a postcard pinned to the bulletin boarda color photo of a very oldlooking pianoforte the kind of thing youd find in a museum of musical history a friend might have sent her the postcardher irish boyfriend perhapsor maybe william had sent it to her if william was capable of sending a postcard i want to get to know you a little at a time heather said still staring at the rug she had jacks thin lips her upper lip was a small straight line its a tight space but nice jack said meaning her office i dont need more spacei need more time she told him the summer is goodno teaching and i can get a lot of research done in the school year easter is about the only time i have to do my writing jack nodded glancing at the photo of brahmsas if brahms had understood what heather meant jack hadnt a clue heather turned out the lights in her office you go first she said before they started down the stairs maybe she found it easier to talk when he couldnt look at her daddy hides his hands or he wears gloves because of the deformities the disfiguration of osteoarthritic joints is quite noticeablenot just a gnarling of the knuckles but actual bumps theyre called heberdens nodes where are the bumps jack asked descending the stairs ahead of her at the far knuckles of his fingersthat junction between the middle bone of the finger and the little bone at the tip but his hands dont look as deformed as he imagines they do its mainly how his hands hurt when he plays cant he stop playing jack asked he goes completely insane if he doesnt play heather said of course he also wears gloves because he feels cold some people with fullbody tattoos feel cold jack told her no kidding his sister said he assumed that she got the sarcasm from her german mother they walked through a parking lot past more university buildings down charles street to george square heather was a fast walker even when they were side by side she wouldnt look at jack when she talked the arthritis has affected his playing for more than fifteen years she said the disease involves degeneration of cartilage and what they call hypertrophyovergrowth of the bones of the joint for a pianist or an organist theres a wearandtear factor the pain of osteoarthritis is increased by activity relieved by rest the more he plays the more it hurts but the pain makes him feel warm she smiled at this he likes that about it there must be medication for it jack said hes tried all the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugsthey upset his stomach hes like youhe doesnt eat you dont eat do you hes thin you mean to put it mildly heather said they had passed some tents for the festival and were walking through the meadowsa large park the paths lined with cherry trees a woman with a tennis racquet was hitting a ball for her dog to fetch where are we going jack asked his sister you said you wanted to see where i lived they passed bruntsfield links a small golf course where a young man without a golf ball was practicing his swing the fields heather told jack matteroffactly had been an open mass grave during the plague daddy takes glucosamine sulfate a supplementit comes mixed with chondroitin which is shark cartilage he thinks this helps she said in a way that implied she didnt believe it did anything at all and he puts his hands in melted paraffin which he mixes with olive oil the hot wax dries on his hands he makes quite a mess when he picks the wax off but he seems to enjoy doing that it fits right in with his obsessivecompulsive disorder his what were not talking about the mental part not yet his sister told him he puts his hands in ice water toofor as long as he can stand it this is a bit masochistic for someone who feels cold most of the time but the hot wax and the ice water workat least they give him some temporary relief it was a warm windy day but the way heather walkedwith her head down her arms swinging and her shoulders rolling forwardyou would have thought that they were marching into a gale all the years i was growing up daddy told me every day that he loved you as much as he loved me heather said still not looking at jack because he never got to be with you he said that every minute he was with me he loved me twice as much he said he had to love me enough for two people her fingers were playing on an imaginary keyboard of air there was no way for jack to follow the music in his sisters head naturally i hated you heather said if he had to love me enough for two people because of how much he missed you i interpreted this to mean that he loved you more but thats what kids do isnt it she stopped suddenly looking at jack without waiting for an answer she said were heremy street my building she folded her arms across her small breasts as if theyd been arguing you dont still hate me do you he asked her thats a workinprogress jack the street was busylots of small shops a fair amount of traffic her apartment building was five or six stories talla wroughtiron fence surrounding it a brightred door there were tiled walls in the foyer a woodandiron banister a stone staircase you go first heather said pointing up the stairs jack wondered if she was superstitious about stairs he went up three flights before he turned to look at her keep going she told him no woman in her right mind would want jack burns watching her go up or down stairs i would be so selfconscious i would probably trip and fall why he asked her i would be wondering how i compare to all the beautiful women youve seenfrom behind and otherwise heather said is the elevator broken jack asked theres no lift she said its a fifthfloor walkup lots of high ceilings in edinburghhigh ceilings mean long flights of stairs the colors in the hallway were warm but basicmauve cream mahogany the flat itself had the high ceilings heather had mentioned and brightly painted walls the living room was red the kitchen yellow the only indication of the five roommates was the two stoves and two refrigerators in the kitchen everything was clean and neatas it would have to be to make living with five roommates tolerable jack didnt ask how many bathrooms were in the flat there couldnt have been enough for five roommates heathers roomwith a desk and a lot of bookshelves and a queensize bedhad mulberrycolored walls and giant windows overlooking bruntsfield gardens the books were mostly fiction andas at her office at the universitythere were more cds than books and some seriouslooking stereo equipment there was a vcr and a dvd player and a television facing the bed jack saw some of his films among the dvds and videotapes on her bedside table i watch you when i cant fall asleep his sister said sometimes without the sound because of the roommates he asked she shrugged it doesnt matter to them if the sound is on or off she said its because i know all your lines by heart and sometimes i feel like saying them there was nowhere to sitonly the one desk chair or the bed it was basically a dormitory room only larger and prettier you can sit on the bed heather said ill make some tea on her desk was a framed photograph of a younglooking william burns playing the organ with heatherasalittlegirl in his lap when jack sat down on the bed heather handed him a leather photo album the pictures are reasonably selfexplanatory she said leaving him alone in her room she was kind to have left him alone she must have known hed not seen many photographs of their father and would prefer seeing so much of him so suddenly by himself the album was chronological barbara steiner was small and blond but fuller in the face than her daughternot nearly as pretty heathers good looks came from william he had kept his long hairmiss wurtz would have been pleasedand he got thinner as he grew older there were many more pictures of him with heatheras a little girl and as a teenagerthan there were of heather with her mother or of william burns with barbara steiner of course it was heathers album and she must have selected which photos to put in it she seemed to be most fond of the photographs from those fatheranddaughter ski trips postcards from wengen and lech and zermatt were intermingled with photos of heather and william on skis a cold sport for someone who was inclined to feel cold jack thought but william burns looked comfortable in ski clothesor else he was so happy to be skiing with his daughter that the feeling warmed him there was nothing complaining about heathers mothers expressions in any of the photographs nor could you tell that shed once had a wonderful singing voice there was something overposed about herespecially in the photos when she was wearing a wigand then she simply disappeared without a trace jack turned a page in the album and barbara steiner was gone he knew exactly when he had passed the moment of her death all the photographs from that point forward were of heather and her dad just the two of them or one or the other alone there had been concert brochures attached to the earlier pages but from the time heather appeared to be twelve or thirteen there had been no more concerts for william burns jack recognized the interior of the central bar wherein addition to heather playing her wooden flutethere were photos of william playing a pianotype instrument both alone and with his daughter accompanying him on her flute it was some kind of electric keyboarda synthesizer jack thought it was calledand from the look on williams and heathers faces jack doubted they were playing anything classical jack knew why his father appeared to be overdressed in many of the photosthat is too warmly dressed for the season william often felt cold except when he was skiing but even in those summervacation snapshots when william was on a beach in a bathing suit his tattoos were not very clear or distinguishable from one another music when its too small to see in detail looks like handwritingespecially to someone like jack who couldnt read music jack was ashamed hed told claudia that he never wanted childrennot till the day i discover that my dad has been a loving father to a child or children he didnt leave was how hed put it to her well jack held the evidence of that in his lapheathers photo album was a record of her love for their dad and williams love for her jack had finished the album and had composed himself sufficiently to be making his way through the pictures a second time when heather came back to her room with the tea she sat down beside him on the bed there are some places where you removed photos or they fell out of the album by themselves he said to her old boyfriends i removed them she said jack hadnt seen anyone who could have been the irish boyfriend he got the impression that the boyfriend was clearly less than the love of her life but he didnt ask he turned to the photos of heather and william burns playing their instruments at the central i went there yesterday to have a look at where you play your flute he said i know a friend saw you how come you didnt ask me to go with you i was looking around leith mostly at places i remembered hearing about from my mother jack explained he turned to the end pages of the album where their father was wearing gloves whats wrong with him jack asked i mean the mental part not the arthritis heather tilted her head it rested on jacks shoulder he held her hand in one hand his teacup in the other the album lay open on his lap with the man who looked so much like heather and jack looking up at them i want you to hear the father willis in old st pauls heather said i want to play something for you just to prepare you they went on sitting together jack sipped his tea with her head on his shoulder it would have been awkward for heather to sip hers dont you want to drink your tea he asked i want to do exactly what im doing heather told him i want to never take my head off your shoulder i want to hug you and kiss youand beat you with both fists in your face i want to tell you every bad thing that ever happened to meespecially those things i wish i could have talked to you about when they happened i want to describe every boyfriend you might have saved me from you can do all of that jack told her ill just do this for now she said you want everything to happen too fast what is he obsessivecompulsive about jack asked she squeezed his hand and shook her head against his shoulder shed had to sell the flat william had lived inwhere shed grown up in marchmont its a big student area but some lecturers live there too heather said it would have been perfect if she could have stayed there but shed had to sell the flat and find a less expensive place to pay for the sanatorium he asked heather nodded her head against him most of her things and all of williams were in storage why dont i buy you a flat of your own jack said she took her head off his shoulder and looked at him you cant buy me she said well actually i suppose you can but it wouldnt be right i dont want you to do everything for mejust help me with him i will but you havent told me what to do he said she sipped her tea shed not let go of his hand which she pulled into her lap and examined more closely you have his small hands but his fingers are longer you dont have an organists hands she said she held up her fingers to jacks palm to palm hers were longer every inch of his body is tattooed she began still looking at their hands pressed together even the tops of his feet even his toes even his hands jack asked no not his hands not his face or neck and not his penis she said youve seen his penis or did he tell you it wasnt tattooed jack asked her youd be surprised how many people have seen daddys penis heather said smiling im sure youll get to see it tooits bound to happen she had put together a smaller photo album for jack it was about the size of a paperback novel with some of the same photos from the larger album or slightly different angles of those moments in time the smaller album had no pictures of her motheronly of heather and william jack and heather sat looking at the pictures drinking their tea i could learn to ski jack said then we could all ski together then you could ski with me jack daddys skiing days are over he cant ski anymore the first thing youll think when you see him is that theres nothing wrong with himthat hes just a little eccentric or something his sister said she took off her glasses and put her face so close to jacks that their noses touched without my glasses i have to be this close to you to see you clearly heather said she pulled slowly back from him but only about six or eight inches i lose you about here she said putting her glasses back on well when you meet him hell make you believe that you could take him to los angeleswhere you would have a great time together youll think im cruel or stupid for sending him away but he needs to be taken care of and they know how to do it dont think you can take care of him if i cant take care of himand i cantyou cant take care of him either you may not think so at first but hes where he belongs okay jack said he took her glasses off and put his face close to hers their noses touching keep looking at me he told her i believe you ive seen closeups of you half my life she said smiling i cant look at you enough heather she ran her hand through her hair wiping her lips with the back of her other hand jack recognized the gesture it was the way hed removed his wig and wiped the mauve lip gloss off his lips with the back of his ski glove in my last hitchhiker in a nearperfect imitation of jacks voice heather said you probably thought i was a girl right thats pretty good he told her looking into her brown eyes this isnt a very safe place to stop heather said just the way hed said it in my last hitchhiker im sorry for the trouble but i catch more rides as a girl she went on i try not to buy my own dinner heather said with a shrug she had jacks shrug down pat too how about melody in the tour guide he asked her heather cleared her throat its a good job to lose she said perfectly how about johnnyasahooker in normal and nice no girl can get that right jack was thinking theres something you should know his sister said in that hookers husky voice lester billings has checked out im afraid hes really left his room a mess put your glasses back on jack told her getting up from the bed he went to her closet and opened the door jack picked out a salmonpink camisole and held it up by the hanger against his chest boy ill bet this looks great on you heather said just the way jackasathief had said it to jessica lee he hung up the camisole in her closet and they went into the kitchen and washed and dried their teacups and put them away in the cupboard to someone like jack the fiveroommates idea was unthinkable it must be like living on a ship he said to heather im moving out soon she told him laughing they walked back the way they had come through the meadows jack carried the small photo album in one hand although heather had volunteered to carry it in her backpack just before they got to george square they saw an old man with snowwhite hair playing a guitar and whistling he was always there every day heather told jackeven in the winter the old man was often there at eight oclock in the morning and would stay the whole day is he crazy jack asked her crazy is a relative word his sister said she talked about playing squash which she seemed to take very seriously the music department had a squash team and she was one of the better players on it she also spoke of a plague of urban seagulls urban seagulls jack said theyre all over edinburghthey attacked one man so badly he had to go to hospital heather told him they came along south bridge to where it intersected with the royal mile jack was not aware that he had looked the wrong way but as they started to cross the street heather took his hand and spoke sharply to him look right jack i dont want to lose you i dont want to lose you he told her i mean crossing the street she said jack doubted that he could have found old st pauls without a map and some detailed directions the church was built into a steep hill between the royal mile and jeffrey street where the main entrance was there was a side entrance off carrubers close a narrow alleyand an even narrower alley called north grays close where there was no entrance to the church jack began to tell heather the story his mom had told him one night shortly before midnight william was playing the organ in old st paulsa socalled organ marathon a twentyfourhour concert with a different organist playing every hour or half hourand their dads playing had roused a drunk sleeping in one of the narrow alleys alongside the church the foulmouthed downandout had complained about the sound of the organ that was as far as jack got before heather said i know the story the drunk said something like that fucking racketthat fucking bloody fuck of a fucking organ making a sound that would wake the fucking dead isnt that the story yes something like that jack said ill play that piece for you heather told him you cant hear much outside the walls of this church either the story is exaggerated or that drunk was asleep in a pew not even boellmanns toccata could wake a drunk in carrubers or north grays close while the side door to old st pauls on carrubers close was locked the front entrance on jeffrey street was open the church was empty but the oil lamps by the altar were lit they were always lit heather told jackeven when she played the organ very late at night its a bit spooky here at night she confessed but you have to practice playing in the dark why he asked her lots of interesting things begin in darkness his sister told him the easter vigil service for example you can learn to play in the dark provided youve memorized the music from the nave of the church looking toward the high altar the organ pipes stood nearly as tall as the stainedglass windows the church was not vast but dark and contained one had no sense of the season outside andexcept for the muted light that made its way through the stainedglass windows and portalsno real sense of day or night either heather saw jack looking at the latin inscription on the altar as mr ramsey had observed jack struggled with latin venite exultemus domino come let us praise the lord his sister said oh right he said youll get used to it she told him heather crossed herself at the altar and took off her backpack jack sat on one end of the bench beside her ill play something softer for you later heather said but boellmanns toccata isnt supposed to be quiet and when you hear him play it itll be louder a different church she said softly shaking her head jack wasnt prepared for the way her hands pounced on the keyboard transforming her it was the loudest most strident piece of music hed ever heard inside a church as the new chords marched forth the old chords kept reverberating the organ bench trembled under them it was the soundtrack to a vampire moviea gothic chase scene jesus jack said forgetting he was in a church thats the idea heather said she had stopped playing but old st pauls was still reverberating now go outside and tell me if you can hear it she began the boellmann again it made his heart race to hear it jack went out the jeffrey street door to the church and walked up north grays close toward the royal mile the alley was dirty and smelled of urine and beer there were broken pieces of glass where bottles had been smashed against the church and empty cigarette packages and chewinggum wrappers were littered everywhere halfway up the alley jack pressed his ear to the stone wall of the church he could barely hear the boellmann just enough to follow the tune on the royal mile you couldnt hear the organ at allprobably because of the traffic or the other street soundsand in carrubers close either a restaurants air conditioner or a kitchens exhaust fan made too much noise in the alley for the toccata to be followable the organ was a distant intermittent murmur but when jack went back inside old st pauls the sound of the father willis was deafening his sister was really putting herself into it as heather said the story about the drunk had been exaggeratedor the downandout must have been sleeping in a pew when the boellmann came crashing down on him the more important part of the story heather decided was that william burns had played the toccata so loudly that everyone inside the churchincluding alice and the organist who was waiting his turn to playhad been forced to flee from the nave and stand outside in the rain it was one of daddys bipolar moments jacks sister said i think thats what the story is really about he drove your mother out in the rain so to speakdidnt he hes bipolar jack asked no hes obsessivecompulsive heather said but he has his bipolar moments dont you jack i suppose so he said heather was playing more softly nowshe had moved on from the boellmann this is from an aria in handels solomon she said as softly as she was playing do you have bipolar moments too jack asked her the desire to never leave your side the desire to never see you again his sister said the desire to see your face asleep on the pillow beside my face and to see your eyes open in the morning when i lie next to youjust watching you waiting for you to wake up im not talking about sex i know he told her the desire to live with you to never be separated from you again heather went on i get it he said the constant wish that i never knew of your existence and that our father had never said a word to me about my having a brotherthis in tandem with the desire to never see another jack burns movie and that every scene in every film you were ever in which i have committed to memory would vanish from my mind as if those movies had never been made she had not stopped playing but her pace had quickened the organs volume was increasing too heather was almost shouting to be heard over the reverberations we just need to spend more time together jack told her she brought both hands down on the keyboard which made a harsh discordant sound she slid toward her brother on the organ bench and threw her arms around his neck hugging him to her if you see him once you have to keep seeing him jack you cant suddenly appear in his life and then go away again he loves you heather said if you love him back ill love you too if you cant bear to be with him ill despise you forever thats pretty clear he told her she pushed herself away from him so violently that jack thought she was going to hit him if youre not billy rainbow dont give me his lines she snapped okay he said holding his arms out to her when she let him take her in his arms he kissed her cheek no not like thatthats not how you kiss your sister heather said you should kiss me on the lips but not the way you kiss a girlnot with your lips parted like this she said kissing himher dry lips brushing jacks their lips tightly closed who would have thought that jack burns could ever love kissing someone as chastely as that but he was thirtyeight and had never kissed a sister they spent the night together in jacks suite at the balmoral they ordered dinner from room service and watched a bad movie on television in the backpack heather had brought her toothbrush and an extralarge tshirt which she wore as a nightgown and a change of clothes for the morning they would be getting up early shed warned jack she had planned everything including the reenactment of what shed told jack in old st pauls that desire to see his face asleep on the pillow beside her face and to see his eyes open in the morning when she was lying next to himjust watching him waiting for him to wake up heather told jack that the irish boyfriend was no one special the love of her life so far had been one of her professors in belfast shed known he was married but he told her he was leaving his wife he left heather instead jack told his sister about mrs machadoand mrs adkins and leah rosen and mrs stackpole they were the early casualties they were among the first to mark him and disappoint him in himself he told heather about emma and mrs oastler and claudia and her daughterand all the rest even that crazy woman in benedict canyonthe one who was driven mad by the screams and moans of the manson murder victims whenever the santa anas were blowing heather told jack that shed lost her virginity to one of williams music students someone who was in university when she was still in secondary school as she put it we had comparable keyboard skills at the time but im much better than he is now jack told heather that for the past five years dr garcía had been the most important woman in his life heather said that she was spending almost as much time improving her german as she was playing the organor the piano or her wooden flute shed spoken a childs german with her mother and had originally studied german because of her interest in brahms now she had an additional reason to learn the language if she taught in edinburgh for another two or three years her teaching credentials would greatly enhance her résumé by apprenticing herself to john kitchen at old st pauls she was already a better organist in two or three years time if her german was good enough she could move to zurich and get a job there why zurich jack asked well theres a university and a music conservatory and a disproportionate number of churches for such a small cityin other words lots of organs and then i could visit daddy every day instead of only once a month or every six weeks hes in zurich i never said he was in edinburgh jack i just said you had to see me first jack propped himself up in bed on his elbows and looked down at his sisters face on the pillow she was smiling up at him her golden hair pushed back from her forehead and tucked behind her small ears she cupped the back of jacks neck and pulled his face closer to hers hed forgotten that she couldnt be more than a few inches away from his facenot if she wanted to see him clearly without her glasses so were going to zurich he asked her youre going alone this trip heather told him you should see him alone the first time how can you afford to go to zurich once a month or every six weeks he asked her you should let me pay for that the sanatorium costs three hundred and fifty thousand swiss francs a yearthats two hundred and twelve thousand us dollarsto keep him in the private section of the clinic if you pay for that i can pay for my own travel she pulled his head down to the pillow beside her if you want to buy me a flat why dont you buy something big enough for both of usin zurich she suggested i was born in edinburgh i dont need your help here ill buy a whole house in zurich jack said you want everything to happen too fast she reminded him he didnt know when or if she slept when jack woke up heather was staring at himher large brown eyes close to jacks her small nose almost touching his face you have four gray hairs she told him let me see if you have any he said but heathers hair was golden to its roots no not yet you dont its because im pretty happy all things considered she said look at me i just slept with a movie star and it was no big dealno biggie as billy rainbow would say it was a big deal to me jack told her heather gave him a hug well actually it was a big deal to me tooa very big deal while jack was in the shower heather took his plane tickets down to the concierges desk in the lobby she booked his flight to zurich with a connection out of amsterdam and his return trip to la from zurich she also arranged for his first meeting later that afternoon with a team of doctors at the sanatorium kilchberg there were five doctors and one professor in all heather gave jack a brochure of the buildings and grounds of the clinic which overlooked lake zurich kilchberg was on the western shore of the lakein zurich they called it the left shoreabout fifteen minutes by car from the center of the city so jack was leaving for switzerland as soon as they finished their breakfast heather had reserved a room for him at the hotel zum storchen in zurich you might like the baur au lac better she told him but the storchen is nice and its on the river im sure it will be fine he said the doctors are excellenti think youll like them heather said she had stopped looking at him they were in the breakfast café at the balmorala few tired tourists families with small children jack could tell that heather was nervous again as they both had been when theyd first met jack tried to hold her hand but she wouldnt let him people will think were sleeping togetheri mean really sleeping together she told him being with you in public takes a little getting used to you know youll get used to it he said just dont let anything happen to youdont do anything stupid heather blurted out can you read lips jack asked her jack please dont do anything stupid heather said she looked cross in no mood to play games jack moved his lips without making a sound forming the words as slowly and clearly as he could i have a sister and i love her he told her without actually saying it out loud you want everything to happen too fast heather said again but jack could tell that shed understood him we should go to the airport now she announced looking at her watch in the taxi she seemed distractedlost in thought she was once again not looking at him when she said when youve seen him i mean after youve spent a little time together please call me of course jack said all you have to say is i love him you dont have to say anything more but dont you dare say anything less his sister said her fingers were playing boellmanns toccata or something equally strident on her tensed thighs you can relax about me heather he told her can you read lips she asked still not looking at him all actors can read lips jack said but heather just stared out the window not saying anythingher lips as tightly closed as when shed given him his first kiss as a brother it was still early in the morning when they got to the airport jack hadnt expected heather to come to the airport with him much less accompany him inside now she led him to the checkin counter obviously it was a trip she was familiar with i hope you like switzerland heather said scuffing her feet she was wearing blue jeans and a darkercolored tshirt than shed worn the day before with the backpack and her cropped hair she looked more like a university student than a junior lecturer if you didnt notice her constantly moving fingers you could discern nothing musical about her she was simply a small pretty girlmade more seriouslooking by her glasses and the determined way in which she walked near the metaldetection equipment where a security guard had a look at jacks passport and examined his carryon bag there was a plexiglas barrier that kept heather from accompanying her brother to his gate jack wanted to kiss her but she kept her face turned away from him im not saying goodbye to you jack dont you dare say goodbye to me she said still scuffing her feet okay he said with the plexiglas barrier between them jack could still see her as he started walking toward his gate he kept turning to look at her jack stopped walking away from her when he saw she was finally looking at him heather was pointing to her heart and her lips were movingslowly without uttering a word i have a brother and i love him jacks sister was saying although he couldnt hear a syllable i have a sister and i love her he said back to her not making a sound other people were getting between them jack had momentarily lost sight of heather when two young women stepped up close to him and the black girl with the diamond nosestud said you arent jack burns are you you simply cant be right ill bet you anything he isnt her companion said she was a white girl with sunburned shoulders in a tank top her nose was peeling a little they were americans college kids on their way home from a summer trip to europeor so jack guessed when he looked for his sister she was gone yes im jack burns he said to the girls jack couldnt have explained it but he felt thatfor the first time in his lifehe really was jack burns youre rightits me i actually am jack burns for some reason he was delighted that theyd recognized him but the young womens expressions radiated disbelief they were as suddenly indifferent to jack as they had at first seemed curious about him good try the white girl told him sarcastically youre not going to fool anyone into thinking youre jack burnsnot that way not what way he asked her not by being so normal the young white woman said not by looking like youre happy or something the young black woman said but i am jack burns he told them unconvincingly let me tell youyoure awful at this the white girl said and youre too old to get away with it since when was jack burns so sincere or something the black girl asked him let me hear you do noir the white girl said let me hear you say one thing jack burns ever said the black girl challenged him where was heather when he needed her jack was thinking where was his dad who allegedly had jack burns down pat the girls were walking away jack untucked his tshirt and held the bottom hem up to his chest as if he were holding up a dress on a hanger boy ill bet this looks great on you he said in no way resembling the thief whom jessica lee caught messing around in her closet give it up the young white woman called to him you know what the black girl asked jack her diamond nosestud winking in the bright airport light if the real jack burns ever saw you he wouldnt look twice its a good job to lose jack called after them but they kept walking he was so bad as melody even wild bill vanvleck would have made him repeat the line the point washe wasnt acting it was as if hed forgotten how jack still knew his lines but he was out of character he had a sister and he loved her shed said she loved him too jack had stopped acting he was just jack burnsthe real jack burns at last zurich when that last unmarked area of skin has been tattooed and their bodies become a completed notebook fullbody types dont all react the same way alice had maintained that some fullbodies simply started tattooing over their old tattoos but if you keep doing that the skin eventually turns as dark as nightthe designs become indiscernible jack once saw a client of his mothers whose arms from his wrists to his armpits were an unvarying black it was as if hed been burned in less radical instances twicetattooed skin appears to be covered with curved abstract figuresthe body wrapped in a skintight paisley shawl but for other fullbodies the completed notebook amounts to a sacred text it is unthinkable to tattoo over a single tattoo or even part of one most of williams tattoos had been done by accomplished tattoo artists but even his bad or clumsy tattoos were of music that mattered to him both the music and the words had marked more than his skin for life heather had told jack that their father had no gaps of bare skin between his tattoos the toccatas and hymns the preludes and fugues overlapped one another like loose pages of music on a cluttered desk every inch of the desk itself was covered on williams back heather said where he would have had to make a considerable effort to see it was a sailing shipa distant view of the stern the ship was pulling away from shore parting the waves of music that all but engulfed it the full sails were also marked with music but the ship was so far from shore that the notes were unreadable it was their fathers herbert hoffmann but heather said it was almost lost on a vast horizon of musica sailors grave or a last port tattoo but smaller than jack had imagined and completely surrounded by sound the piece from his dads favorite easter hymn christ the lord is risen today was partially covered by walthers wachet auf ruft uns die stimmethe top two staffs beginning where the alleluia chorus to christ the lord should have been elsewhere bachs mystical adoration for christmas jesu meine freude was overlapped by balbastres joseph est bien marié the word largo above the top staff of the bach was half hidden both the familiar words and music in the soprano aria for unto us a child is born from handels messiah ran into widors toccatafrom the fifth symphony op with even the op being part of the tattoo which included the composers full name it surprised jack to hear that the composers names were always tattooed in fullnot bach and widor but johann sebastian bach and charlesmarie widorand the names were tattooed not in cursive but in an italic font which over time and subject to fading was increasingly hard to read time and fading had taken their toll on some of williams other tattoos as wellamong them john stanleys trumpet voluntary his trumpet tune in d which marked jacks fathers chest in the area of his right lung where the bottom or pedal staff indicating the notes you played with your feet had faded almost entirely from view as had the word vivo above the first staff of alains litanies but not the quotation from alain on williams buttocks the french was tattooed in cursive on the left cheek of his bum the english translation on the right they would fade from jacks fathers skin more slowly than youth itself reason has reached its limit only belief keeps rising reason had reached its limit in william burns too evidently that was what jacks sister had been saying every inch of their dads body was a statement each of his tattoos existed for a reason but now there was no room left except for belief youll know what i mean when you see him naked and you will heather had told jack i will his sister wouldnt elaborate to say that jack was apprehensive when his plane landed in zurich would be an understatement the swiss heather had forewarned him made a point of remembering your name they expected you to remember theirs as an actor jack had confidence in his memorization skillsbut his abilities not only as an actor were severely tested by the task at hand the cast of characters he would be meeting at the sanatorium kilchberg had daunting names and their specific roles like his fathers tattoos were interconnectedat times overlapping with heathers help jack had studied these five doctors and one professor hed tried to imagine them as best he could before their first meeting but he was not acting in this performancethey were they were in charge of his dad it was jacks job to learn from them the head of the clinic professor lionel ritter was german his english was good heather had told jack and the professor took such pains to be diplomatic that one forgave him for being a bit repetitious he was always neatly but casually dresseda trim fitlooking man who took pride in the sanatorium kilchbergs year history as a private psychiatric clinic jack had envisioned professor ritter as looking a little like david niven dressed for tennis the deputy medical director dr klaus horvath was austrian heather had described him as a handsome heartylooking manan athlete most notably a skier william enjoyed talking about skiing with dr horvath who had great faith in the psychological benefits of the sanatorium kilchbergs jogging programin which william burns at sixtyfour was an enthusiastic participant jack had some difficulty seeing his dad as a fully tattooed jogger and he could imagine dr horvath only with arnold schwarzeneggers accentpossibly in combination with arnolds cheerful optimistic disposition which was best on display in that comedy where the former bodybuilder is supposed to be danny devitos twin the second german dr manfred berger was a neurologist and psychiatrist he was head of gerontopsychiatry at the clinic according to jacks sister their dad was a youthfullooking sixtyfouryearoldnot yet a candidate for dr bergers principal area of expertise dr berger in heathers view was a fact manlittle was given to speculation upon his arrival in kilchberg william burns had exhibited the kind of mood swings common to a bipolar disorder euphoric moments which crashed in anger he would be high for a whole week with no apparent need of sleep but this would end in a stuporous depression as it turned out william was not bipolar but before this diagnosis could be made dr berger had insisted on a neurological examination dr berger heather had informed jack was a man who liked to rule things out did william have a brain tumor dr berger doubted that william did but what was most dire simply had to be ruled out something called temporal lobe epilepsy could also present itself with mood swings not unlike williamsin particular his flights of euphoria and his clamorous episodes of anger but william burns was not afflicted with temporal lobe epilepsy nor was he bipolar there was no aura of discouragement about dr berger it was as if he expected to be proved wrong but he was not one to be deterred by failure jack refrained from jumping to the conclusion that the most interesting psychiatric ailments were not easily diagnosed or cured after all upon seeing his dads fullbody tattoos who wouldnt have guessed that william burns was obsessivecompulsive and that it physically hurt him to play the organ yet it drove him completely insane not to playwell who wouldnt have been depressed and subject to mood swings about that but dr berger was a fact man his role was ruling things out not zeroing in he was an essential member of the team jacks sister saidif not the easiest of the doctors to like although a german he had adopted the swiss habit of shaking hands zealously for prolonged periods of time which dr berger did with what heather called a competitive vengeance this guy confused jack in advance someone vaguely resembling gene hackman or tommy lee jones came to mind as it would turn out jack couldnt have been more wrong the rest of the team members were women in heathers view they were the most formidable dr regula huber for exampleshe was head of internal medicine she was a swiss woman in her forties blond and tireless there were many elderly patients at the sanatorium kilchberg an internist was kept busy there most of the older patients had been committed by family members these patients were not free to leave heather told jack that shed had many meetings with professor ritter and the team of doctors looking after william on every occasion dr hubers pager had gone off and shed left to attend to an emergency in the case of william burns whod been committed to the psychiatric clinic by his daughter but had stayed of his own volitionhappily without protestdr huber like dr berger first wanted to rule out a few things did their father have an underfunctioning thyroid gland this could make you feel cold no he did not did he have curshmansteinert disease thankfully no and why was william burns so thin because he didnt drink and he thought that overeating was a sin their dad kept to a strict diet as if he were a fashion model or a jockey or an actor like father like son it was dr huber who treated or attempted to treat their dads arthritis shed recently tried a new class of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that were supposed to be more stomachfriendly than the older antiinflammatories but they gave william so much gastric irritation that dr huber instead applied a conventional drug topically and it was dr huber who took the view that some socalled placebos workedthat is if the patients thought they did she raised no objection to williams fondness for hot wax and ice water or his taking glucosamine with the extract of shark cartilage william burns also wore copper bracelets except when he was playing the piano or the organ heather liked dr huber whom she called a pragmatist jack thought inexplicably of frances mcdormand one of his favorite actresses the third german dr ruth von rohr had a curiously incomplete titleshe was some sort of department head of what department was unclear or perhaps deliberately not stated she was a tall striking woman with a wild mane of tawny hair that had a silver streak which heather said looked natural but couldnt have been dr von rohr had a regal headofdepartment demeanor she usually let others speak first although her impatience was demonstrable and calculated she knew when to sigh and she had considerable dexterity in her long fingersin which she frequently twirled a pencil almost never dropping it when she spokeusually last and often dismissivelyshe turned her prominent jaw and angular face in profile to her audience as if her head were about to be embossed on a coin on the other hand she liked to begin as if she were head of the doubt departmentas if the silver streak in her hair were a banner to that gray area of every argument it was dr von rohrs job to make the others feel less sure of themselves she liked opening the door to those things that could never be ruled out everyone at the sanatorium kilchberg thought that william burns was a model patient he had to be happy there after all hed not once attempted to run away he rarely complained about the place or his treatment yes he occasionally gave in to his demons he had his rages and irrational moments but he had far fewer of these episodes in kilchberg than hed experienced in the outside world jacks sister maintained that their father was where he belonged remarkably william seemed to accept this hadnt he positively embraced the idea dr horvath had enthusiastically asked yet it was dr von rohrs department to raise the unasked question isnt hospitalism a second disease for some of our patients she would inquire just when everything seemed fine what if were too successful with william in a sense if hes happy here havent we made him dependent on us and this place im just asking she was fond of saying once a seed of doubt had been sown it was dr von rohr who would not stop asking why william often felt cold but what triggers this she frequently inquired at the sanatorium kilchberg jacks sister had told him the word triggers was hugely popular it was dr von rohr who suggested that william burns might have a narcissistic personality or even a narcissistic personality disorder he shampooed his graywhite hippielength hair daily he was very particular about which conditioner and gel he used hed had a fita runningnakedandscreaming episodebecause his hair dryer had blown a fuse and then there was the meticulousness of his tattoos not to mention how protective he was of them for the most part he concealed them he wore longsleeved shirts buttoned at the throat and long pants and shoes with sockseven in the summer yet when william burns wanted you to see his tattoos he showed you all of them it was not uncommon among schizophrenics to wear long pants and longsleeved shirts they felt so unprotected but jack and heathers dad wasnt diagnosed with schizophrenia the issue dr von rohr had raised was williams fastidiousness his vanitythe way he watched his weight for example isnt william an impossible perfectionist dr von rohr would say im just asking the osteoarthritis was the reason william burns could no longer play the organ professionallyhence his early retirement which had precipitated his mental decline but he could have kept teachingeven keyboard skills albeit to a limited degree heather had said william certainly could have continued to teach musical theory and musical history yet he had retired totally and perhaps unnecessarily a failure to live up to previous standards or expectations which can also lead to someones early retirement is a signature feature of a narcissistic personality isnt it dr von rohr had said to the team the imjustasking part was always implied if not stated a piece of work jacks sister had called her a headofdepartment type if i ever met one trying to envision dr ruth von rohr jack thought of dr garcía who was a good listener and who raised a lot of unasked questions boy was dr garcía ever a headofdepartment type last but not least was the sixth member of the teaman attractive young woman authoritative but selfcontaineddr annaelisabeth krauerpoppe she always wore a long starched hospitalwhite lab coatseemingly not to assert her medical credentials but to protect her fashionable clothes she was swiss but her clothes werent heather had claimed like the two unambiguous hyphens in her name dr annaelisabeth krauerpoppe was as perfectly assembled as a vogue model in paris or milan she seemed too chic to be swiss although shed been born in zurich and her knowledge of the city was as irreproachable as her command of her field dr krauerpoppe was head of medication at the sanatorium kilchberg where it was everyones opinion that she knew her prescriptions as well as she knew her clothes it had frustrated her that william was not treatable with those new and socalled stomachfriendly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and that he could tolerate only the topical solution his hotwax routine made dr krauerpoppe cringe not least for what a mess william made of what he was wearing when he picked the dried wax off and to see him with his hands plunged in ice water must have made dr krauerpoppe want to change her entire ensemble as for the copper bracelets she couldnt even look at them the glucosamine particularly the extract of shark cartilage she dismissed as a folk remedy but when it came to william burnss obsessivecompulsive disorder dr krauerpoppe had prescribed an antidepressant the medication had had a calming effect shed tried two drugs in fact zoloft and seropram each one had its merits both being selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors used to treat depression as for the side effects heather had said their father had tolerated the dizziness the dry mouth the drowsiness and the loss of appetite the latter was the most persistent problem but william was so devoted to being thin that his loss of appetite probably thrilled him hed complained about occasionally painful and prolonged erections and there were certain changeswhich heather had not specified to jackin williams sexual interest and ability but over time william burns appeared to have toleratedor at least acceptedthese side effects too the drugs did not impair williams motor functions his keyboard skills were unaffected by the antidepressants the music hed committed to memory remained intact and he could sightread music as quickly as ever dr krauerpoppe had worried that williams ability to concentrate might suffer and he admitted to being more easily distracted it took him longer to memorize new pieces and he occasionally complained of fatigue which was unusual for him he was used to having more energy he said on the other hand he was sleeping better dr krauerpoppe had also watched william closely for signs that prolonged administration of the drugs might make him feel indifferent or less emotional this was sometimes referred to as the poopout syndrome dr krauerpoppe said but william had shown no such signs according to heather their father was indifferent to nothing or no oneand he was regrettably as emotional as ever dr krauerpoppe thought that in williams case the antidepressants had been successful she noted that his sexual changes did not include impotence another possible side effect she called the drugs an acceptable tradeoff dr krauerpoppe was a woman at ease with hyphens apparently no one like her came to jacks mind jack couldnt wait to meet these people and he was relieved that he was meeting them firstthat is before he would see his father william burns had been twentyfive when he met jacks mom hed been twentysix when jack was born at that age how long would jack have stayed married to anyone and what if hed fathered a child at twentysix when he and emma were burning the candle at both ends in la what kind of dad would he have been jack knew what dr garcías answer would beher lessthanoneword response hmm jack checked into the hotel zum storchen on the weinplatz his room overlooked the limmat where he watched a tour boat drifting past the hotels riverfront café he was staying in the old towncobblestoned streets many of them for pedestrians only the church bells seemed to ring every quarter hour as if zurich were obsessed with the passage of time he shaved and dressed for dinner although it was still only midafternoon in the taxiat the airport in klotenjack had considered going directly to the sanatorium kilchberg but his appointment with professor ritter and the others wasnt until late afternoon he didnt want to risk running into his father before hed met with the doctors although he wasnt expecting jack william would surely have recognized him jack had questioned the clinics decision not to tell his father that he was coming but both heather and the psychiatric team had thought it best if jacks dad didnt know if he knew he would be too anxious nor had dr krauerpoppe recommended upping williams dosage of the zoloft or the seropram whether they told him about jack or not even dr von rohr had refrained from making her usual ontheotherhand argument in fact she said that giving william more antidepressants might make him nearcatatonic or completely out of it for his sons first visit dr horvath the hearty austrian and deputy medical director who often jogged with william had told his patient to expect a special visitor since it was too soon for more visiting time with his daughter william was probably expecting someone from the world of musica musician from out of town a fellow organist making a guest appearance at a concert or playing in a church in zurich such distinguished visitors occasionally came to kilchberg to pay william burns their respects jack had asked the concierge at the storchen to recommend a restaurant within walking distance of the hotel william would be allowed to have dinner with his son although professor ritter or one or more of the doctors at the clinic would accompany him better make the reservation for three or four people heather had told jack they wont want you to take him away from the sanatorium alone and believe me jack you wouldnt want to do thatnot the first time anyway the conciergea laconic man with a hoeshaped scar on his forehead probably from hitting a cars windshield with his headhad booked a table for four at the kronenhalle it was an excellent restaurant and a pleasant walk the concierge had assured jack and because youre jack burns i actually managed to get you a tableeven on such short notice jack went outside the hotel and watched the swans and ducks swimming in the limmat he checked the time on his watch against the clock towers of the two most imposing churches he could see from the weinplatz where he could also see a taxi stand it was only a ten or fifteenminute drive to kilchberg from the storchen and he didnt want to be early or late jack felt guilty about how much he had blamed his mother for everything if shed been alive and jack were waiting to meet her for the first time he believed he would have felt as nervous and excited about that as he felt about meeting his dad it suddenly seemed ridiculous that he couldnt forgive her in fact jack missed her he wished he could call her but what would he have said it was miss wurtz who was waiting to hear from him it was caroline jack should have called but all he could think about was talking to his mother hi momits me he wanted to tell her im not doing this to hurt you but im on my way to meet my dadafter all these years got any advice jack took a taxi out of town along the shore of lake zuricha nice drive the road passing close to the lake the whole way a theater festival had set up tents along the waterfront it was sunny and warm but the air was drymountain air not nearly as humid as it had been in edinburgh there were these sudden dramatic moments when jack could see the alps beyond the lake everything was clean almost sparkling even the taxi kilchberg was a community of about seven thousand because of all the sailboats on the lakeand the stately homes many with gardensthe town somewhat resembled a resort jacks taxi driver told him that the right shore of the lake was slightly more prosperous europeans prefer to face west he said kilchberg on the left shore of lake zurich faced east but jack thought kilchberg was charming there was even a small vineyard or at least what looked like a working farm and the sanatorium was high on a hill overlooking the lake with a spectacular view of zurich to the north to the south were the alps most of the patients take the bus from the bürkliplatztheres a sanatorium stop in kilchberg his taxi driver told him i mean the patients who are free to come and go he addedlooking warily at jack in the rearview mirror as if he were certain that jack had escaped you might want to consider taking the bus next timethe number onesixtyone bus if you can remember that the driver was middle eastern or possibly turkish hed mentioned europeans with evident distaste his english was much better than his german which was as clumsy and halting as jacks when theyd first tried to speak german together jacks driver had quickly switched to english instead jack wondered why hed been mistaken for a patient at the clinic the taxi driver was not much of a moviegoer maybe not so the preternaturally thin young woman in running shoes and a jogging suit who greeted jack in what he thought was the main entrance to the hospital part of the clinic there was a waiting room and a reception desk where the young woman was pacing back and forth when jack came in a fitness expert he assumedperhaps she was the nurse in charge of physical therapy or a kind of personal trainer to the patients she should put on a little weight jack was thinking one can take the athleticlooking thing too far stop she said in englishpointing to him there was no one else in the entranceway or the waiting room there was no one behind the reception desk either jack stopped a nurse appeared emerging hurriedly from a corridor pamela er ist harmlos the nurse said of course hes harmlesshes not real pamela said the medication is working you dont have to worry about that i know hes harmlessi know hes not real she sounded american yet the nurse had spoken to her in german and shed understood the nurse maybe the thin young woman had been a patient in the clinic for a long timelong enough to learn german jack speculated es tut mir leid the nurse said to jack leading the young american woman away im sorry she said you should speak english to him pamela said if he were real he would speak englishlike in his movies i have an appointment with professor ritter jack called after the nurse ich bin gleich wieder da the nurse called back to him im coming right back they had disappeared down the corridor but jack could still hear the toothin patienther voice rising it registered as a kind of insanity on his part that hed mistaken her for someone who worked at the place they dont usually say anything pamela was telling the nurse normally they just appearthey dont talk too god maybe the medication isnt working das macht nichts the nurse told her gently it doesnt matter she said jack burns was a movie star in a psychiatric clinic not surprisingly the first patient who saw him thought he was a talking hallucination not a bad definition for an actor dr garcía might have said when the nurse came back she was shaking her head and talking to herselfalmost inaudibly and in german were it not for her uniform and if he hadnt seen her before jack would have believed that her selfabsorbed muttering marked her as a patient she was a short woman in her fifties stout and brusque with curly gray haira former blonde jack guessed its funny that the first person you of all people should meet here is our only american the nurse said bleibel she added vigorously shaking jacks hand excuse me waltraut bleibelim telling you my name oh jack burns i know professor ritter is expecting you weve all been expecting you except for poor pamela they went outside the building and walked across a patio there was a sculpture garden and a shallow pond with lily pads nothing anyone can drown in jack was thinking most of the buildings had big windows some of them with those black silhouettes of birds painted on the glass our antibird birds nurse bleibel said with a wave of her hand you must have them in america i guess i went to the wrong building jack told her a womens ward wouldnt be my first choice for you nurse bleibel said the grounds were beautifully maintained there were a dozen or more people walking on the paths others sat on benches facing the lake no one looked insane there must have been a hundred sailboats on the lake i take william shopping for clothes on occasion the nurse informed jack ive never known a man who likes shopping for clothes as much as your father does when he has to try things on he can be difficult mirrors are a challengetriggers dr von rohr would call them but william is very well behaved with me no fooling around generally speaking they went into what appeared to be an office building although there were cooking smells maybe a cafeteria or the clinics dining hall was in the building jack followed the nurse upstairs noting that she took two steps at a time for a short woman in a skirt this required robust determination he could easily imagine his dad not being inclined to fool around with waltraut bleibel they found professor ritter in a conference room he was sitting all alone at the head of a long table making notes on a pad of paper he jumped to his feet when nurse bleibel brought jack into the room a wiry man with a strong handshake he looked a little like david niven but he wasnt dressed for tennis his pleated khaki trousers had sharply pressed pant legs his tan loafers looked newly shined he wore a darkgreen shortsleeved shirt ah you found us the professor cried er hat zuerst pamela gefunden nurse bleibel said he found pamela first she told him poor pamela professor ritter replied das macht nichts pamela just thinks its her medication again the nurse said as she was leaving merci vielmal waltraut prof ritter called after hera bilingual many thanks in french and swiss german bitte bitte nurse bleibel said waving her hand as she had at the antibird birds on the big windows waltraut has a brother hugo who takes your father to townon occasion professor ritter told jack but hugo doesnt take william shopping for clothes waltraut does a better job of that she mentioned something about mirrors jack said she called them triggers or she said one of the doctors did ah yeswell get to that professor ritter said he was a man used to running a meeting he was friendly but precise he left no doubt about who was in charge when the others filed into the conference room jack wondered where theyd been waiting on what signal which he hadnt detected had they been summoned forth they even seemed to know where to sitas if there were place cards on the bare table where they put their almost identical pads of paper theyd come prepared they looked positively poised to take notes but first jack had to endure the obligatory handshakeswhich in each case went on a shake or two too long and each doctor as if their meeting had been rehearsed had a characteristic little something to say grüss gott dr horvath the hearty austrian criedpumping jacks hand up and down your onscreen persona may precede you mr burns dr berger the neurologist and fact man said but when i look at you i see a young william first of all on the other hand dr von rohr said in her headofdepartment way should we presume that we know jack burns because of our familiarity with william im just asking dr huber had a look at her pager while shaking jacks hand im just an internist she was telling him you know a normal doctor then her pager beeped and she dropped jacks hand as suddenly as she might have if he had died she went to the telephone in the room which was just inside the door huber hier she said into the phone there was a pause before she added ja aber nicht jetzt yes but not now jack was sure that he recognized dr annaelisabeth krauerpoppethe fashion model who protected her clothes in a long starched hospitalwhite lab coat she looked knowingly into his eyes as if trying to discern what medication he was onor what she thought he should be taking you have your fathers good hair she observed if noti hope nothis obsessions im not tattooed jack told her shaking her hand there are other ways to be marked for life dr ontheotherhand von rohr remarked not all obsessions are unhealthy ruth dr huber the internist said it would appear that mr burns adheres to his fathers diet dont we all approve of how william watches his weight his narcissism do you mean dr von rohr asked in her headofdepartment way are you seeing a psychiatrist mr burns dr berger the fact man asked or can we rule that out actually i have been seeing someone jack told them ah well professor ritter said its nothing to be ashamed of the deputy medical director dr horvath shouted i dont suppose you have any indication of osteoarthritis dr huber said youre too young she added mind you im not saying that williams arthritic hands are anything you need to worry about you dont play the piano or the organ do you no and i dont have any symptoms of arthritis jack said any medications we should know about dr krauerpoppe asked i dont mean for arthritis no nothing he told her she looked somewhat surprised or disappointedjack couldnt be sure now now professor ritter called out clapping his hands we should let jack ask us some questions the doctors cheerfully tolerated professor ritter jack could tell the professor was head of the clinic after alland he doubtless bore lots of responsibilities of a publicrelations kind which the doctors probably wanted nothing to do with yes pleaseask us anything dr horvath the skier said in what way are mirrors triggers jack asked the doctors seemed surprised that he knew about the mirrorsnot to mention triggers jack had a conversation with waltraut about taking william shopping for clothes professor ritter explained to the others sometimes when william sees himself in a mirror he just looks awayor he hides his face in his hands dr berger said sticking to the facts but other times dr von rohr began when he catches a glimpse of himself he wants to see his tattoos all of them dr horvath cried it might not be the appropriate time and place for such a detailed selfexamination professor ritter explained but william seems not to notice such things occasionally when he starts taking off his clothes he has already begun a recitation a what jack asked his body is a tapestry which he can reciteboth a history of music and a personal history dr huber said her pager beeped and she went back to the phone by the door huber hier noch nicht she said annoyed not yet the problem for someone with your fathers meticulousness is that he can never be meticulous enough professor ritter told jack hes proud of his tattoos but hes very critical of them too dr berger said william thinks that some of his tattoos are in the wrong place he blames himself for a lack of foresighthe has regrets dr horvath elaborated other times dr von rohr chimed in its a matter of which tattoo should have been closest to his heart but you can have only a limited number of things that are truly close to your heart dr krauerpoppe interjected he has marked his body with what he loves but he has also recorded his grief the antidepressants have calmed him have made him less anxious have helped him sleep but they dont do much for the grief dr von rohr said bluntlyturning her headonacoin profile to jack not enough anyway dr krauerpoppe admitted it might be overwhelming to discuss specific diagnoses right away for now lets just say that your father has suffered losses professor ritter told jack the ringhof woman the german wife but first of all you he is an absurdly emotional man dr berger said shaking his headwishing that william burns were more of a fact man apparently the antidepressants have helpedthats all im saying dr krauerpoppe said keeping him away from mirrors helps dr von rohr remarked in her silverstreaked headofdepartment way are there other triggers jack asked the team ah well professor ritter said maybe jack should meet his father first the team jack could tell didnt think so bach dr horvath roared anything by bach bach buxtehude stanley widor vierne dubois alain dupré dr berger recited handel balbastre messiaen pachelbel scheidt dr von rohr interrupted and anything to do with christmas or easterany hymn dr huber added she was glaring at her pager as if daring it to go off music is a trigger or even the names of certain composers jack asked music and the names of certain composers dr krauerpoppe answered and when he plays the piano or the organ jack asked ah well professor ritter said when the pain starts dr krauerpoppe began when his fingers cramp dr huber interjected when he makes mistakes dr von rohr said with what sounded like finalityat least in her mind with almost everything she said dr von rohr spoke with the emphasis and certainty of a concluding remarkthis in tandem with the way as a tall person she was always looking down at others dr von rohr seemed no less tall sitting down when hed shaken her hand jack had observed that he came up to her shoulder yes mistakes are triggers professor ritter worriedly agreed williams meticulousness once again dr berger pointed out and albeit only occasionally when he sees your movies dr von rohr said looking at jack particular lines of dialogue mainly professor ritter said but for the most part the movies help him dr krauerpoppe insisted but other times dr von rohr started to say ah well professor ritter said i think jack should see his father hear him play talk to him in what order dr berger asked perhaps sarcastically jack couldnt tell dr hubers pager beeped again she got up from the table and went to the phone by the door dr krauerpoppe covered her face with her hands maybe we should tell jack a little bit about williams schedule professor ritter asked talk about meticulousness dr horvath cried your father likes to know in advance what hes doing every day dr von rohr explained every hour dr horvath shouted just tell him the schedule dr krauerpoppe said maybe it will help huber hier dr huber was saying into the phone by the door ich komme sofort im coming right away she came back to the table an emergency she told jack shaking his hand noch ein notfall another emergency jack had stood up to shake her hand all the others stood up too the team and jack minus dr huber prepared to leave the conference room dr huber had left in a flash wake up hot wax ice water breakfast dr horvath was saying as they marched down the stairs jack realized that the recitation of his dads schedule had begun finger exercises in the exercise hall immediately after breakfast dr berger explained finger exercises jack asked what william calls playing the piano for the dance class because he is blindfolded and plays only the pieces he has memorized dr von rohr told him why is he blindfolded jack asked there are mirrors in the exercise hall professor ritter said lots of mirrors william always wears the blindfold there orsometimes at nighthe plays in the dark jogging after the finger exercisesdepending on the weather dr horvath carried on or sometimes a trip to town with hugo we havent really talked about hugo professor ritter told the others must we talk about him dr von rohr asked maybe not now im just asking sometimesi mean after the finger exerciseswilliam needs more ice water doesnt he dr berger asked it seems to help dr krauerpoppe said with resignation lunchi mean after the jogging dr horvath continued or after the hugo business dr berger said shaking his head not now manfred dr von rohr said more hot wax after lunch dr krauerpoppe noted more ice water too william often does this while he watches a movie one of yours actually dr berger told jack a different jack burns film every afternoon and another one in the evening dr horvath cried always a movie before bed youre jumping ahead klaus dr von rohr said they entered the building with the exercise hall which was outfitted like a dance studio barres and mirrors ran the length of the interior walls a piano a c bechstein shone a glossy black in the lateafternoon lightlike the coat of a wellgroomed animal for the finger exercises both the morning and the afternoon sessions dr krauerpoppe said pointing to the piano he plays again after the movie in the afternoon this time not for dancersits a yoga class the music he plays is more atmospheric softerlike background music you might say but hes always blindfolded if theres any daylight in the room the fingercramping can be disturbing to the yoga class dr berger interjected less so to the dancers even if william is in obvious pain he hates to have to stop playing dr krauerpoppe said he pushes himself ah well professor ritter said after the yoga class we have the ice water readyand the hot wax too if he wants it and the ice water again dr berger stated he was making sure that jack had all the facts in proper order calisthenics dr horvath continued waving his arms especially if theres been no jogging just some abdominal crunches some lunges some jumping dr horvath was demonstrating the lunges and the jumping his big feet thudding on the hardwood floor of the exercise hall we have group therapy three times a weekthe patients discuss dealing with their disorders your fathers german is quite good professor ritter told jack and his concentration is improving just so long as no one starts humming a tune dr berger interjected william hates humming another trigger jack asked ah well professor ritter said we have a movie night every other wednesdayin this case usually not a jack burns movie dr berger stated once a week we have an evening of lotto which william doesnt like but he loves the storytelling caféthis is when we read stories out loud or the patients do and we have a night when our younger patients visit the gerontopsychiatric ward william is very sympathetic to our patients who are growing old some nights we bring the older patients to the exercise hall where they like to hear william play the piano in the dark dr von rohr said i like it too dr horvath cried we have patients with schizophrenic or schizoaffective manifestations dr krauerpoppe told jack i mean those who are in a relatively stable remission phase the ones who have sufficient ability to concentrate well youd be surprisedthe schizophrenics like listening to your father play the piano in the dark too and the pianoplaying seems to soothe our patients who suffer from panic attacks dr berger said except for those who suffer from panic attacks in the dark dr von rohr pointed out jack saw that she was conscious of the light from the windows catching the silver streak in her hair are there other patients in kilchberg who have been committed by a family memberi mean for life jack asked ah well professor ritter sighed its highly unusual for a private patient to stay here for a number of years dr berger said we are expensive dr von rohr cut in but worth it dr horvath bellowed and william loves it here im not concerned about the cost jack said i was wondering about the longterm effect hospitalism do you mean dr von rohr asked in her justasking way what exactly is hospitalism jack asked the disease of being in a hospitala condition in addition to your reason for being here a second disease dr berger stated but in such a way that he didnt seem to believe itas if hospitalism were a speculative illness of the kind dr von rohr was just asking about an almost dreamy disease which a fact man like dr berger generally ruled out theres no medication for hospitalism dr krauerpoppe saidas if the disease didnt really exist for her either but william is happy here dr horvath insisted hes happier in st peter dr von rohr corrected dr horvath die kirche st peterthe church she explained to jack your father plays the organ theremonday wednesday and friday morning at eight oclock jack can hear him play tomorrow morning dr horvath cried that should be worth the tripeven all the way from los angeles dr berger told jack one of us should go with jackhe shouldnt go with william alone professor ritter said william never goes to st peter alone dr von rohr exclaimed they shouldnt go with hugo either dr krauerpoppe suggested one of us should go with jack and william thats what i meant professor ritter said in an exasperated voice i can take them dr horvath shouted your father will be excited to play for you he told jack too excited maybe dr krauerpoppe said i should go toojust in case theres a need for medication a sedative might be in order too excited can be a trigger dr berger explained can be usually isnt dr von rohr told jack annaelisabeth and i will both go to st peter with them nothing can happen that were not prepared for dr horvath said assertively your father is special to us jack its a privilege to take care of him professor ritter said it is an honor to protect him dr von rohr counteredin her hairsplitting way and what does he do with hugo when they go to town jack asked the team dr horvath jumped on the floor of the exercise hall professor ritter restrained himself from saying ah well for once dr krauerpoppe emphatically folded her arms across the chest of her lab coat as if to say there was no medication for what william and hugo did in town dr von rohr uncharacteristically covered her face with her hands as if she momentarily thought she were dr krauerpoppe sometimes they just go to a coffeehouse professor ritter started to say they go to look at women but they just look dr horvath maintained is my father seeing someone jack asked hes not oblivious to women dr krauerpoppe said and hes very attractive to women that hasnt changed not a few of our patients here are attracted to him but we discourage relationships of that kind in the clinicof course is he still sexually interested or active jack asked not here we hope dr horvath cried i meant in town jack said on occasion dr berger began in his factual way hugo takes your father to see a prostitute is that safe jack asked dr krauerpoppe who he imagined might have prescribed some medication for it not if he has sex with the prostitute but he doesnt dr krauerpoppe said these visits are unofficialthat is we dont officially approve of them professor ritter told jack we just unofficially approve of them dr von rohr said she was back to her headofdepartment self sarcastic and ontheotherhand to her core hes a physically healthy man dr horvath cried he needs to have sex naturally he shouldnt have sex with anyone herecertainly not with another patient or with someone on the staff but you said he doesnt have sex jack said to dr krauerpoppe he masturbates when hes with the prostitute she told jack theres no medication required for that like a picture of a woman in a magazine i supposeonly shes a real woman instead of a photograph dr berger said like pornography jack asked ah well professor ritter said again william has those magazines too dr von rohr announced disapprovingly the magazines are safe sex arent they dr krauerpoppe asked and the prostitute is safe toothe way he sees her i get the picture jack told them im okay about it we believe your sister is okay about it too professor ritter said were just not officially okay about it is there a logic im missing in being unofficially okay about it dr von rohr asked dr horvath was doing lunges across the exercise hall the floor creaking bitte klaus professor ritter said does my dad always see the same prostitute or is it a different woman every time jack asked for those details perhaps you should ask hugo dr berger told him must he meet hugo im just asking dr von rohr said dr berger was shaking his head whether here in kilchberg or in the outside world we all eventually must meet a hugo professor ritter said theres no medication for a hugo dr krauerpoppe said leider nicht dr von rohr remarked unfortunately not well unless its a bad time i think id like to meet my father now jack told the team its a good time actually dr horvath cried its our reading hour william is a good reader dr berger said its our quiet time dr von rohr said i believe hes reading a biography of brahms dr krauerpoppe said brahms isnt a trigger jack asked reading about him isnt dr berger said matteroffactly your father has two rooms plus a bath in the private section professor ritter told jack hence expensive dr von rohr said i made a dinner reservation for tonight jack told them i dont know who else wants to come along but i booked a table for four at the kronenhalle the kronenhalle dr horvath boomed you must have the wiener schnitzel or the bratwurst there are mirrors at the kronenhalle dr krauerpoppe said one by each entrance and another one over the sideboard surely they are avoidable professor ritter said to her the one in the mens room isnt dr horvath said whos going to go with them dr berger asked i cantnot this evening i can go dr krauerpoppe said i had a date but i can break it that would be best annaelisabethin case william needs some medication professor ritter said im sure that hugo is also available dr von rohr suggested id rather not go with hugo ruth dr krauerpoppe said the kronenhalle isnt exactly hugos sort of place i cant go to the kronenhalle tonight and to st peter tomorrow morning dr horvath exclaimed maybe i can goill check my schedule professor ritter said or perhaps dr huber can go it makes sense to go to a restaurant with an internist dr berger remarked in case anyone gets sick no one gets sick at the kronenhalle dr horvath cried dr huber has too many emergencies dr krauerpoppe said if she gets called away im alone with william and jackand the mirrors besides there should be another manin case william wants to go to the mens room but ill be there jack reminded her i mean another man who knows your father dr krauerpoppe said ill check my schedule professor ritter said again dr von rohr had a headofdepartment look on her face but she was smiling the smile was something new to jack but the others seemed familiar with it what is it ruth dr krauerpoppe asked her colleague you couldnt keep me away from a trip to the kronenhalle with william and jack burnsnot in a million years she said you couldnt keep me out of the mens room not if william went therenot if you tried dr krauerpoppe covered her face with her hands there was no medication that could keep dr von rohr away from the kronenhalle apparently dr berger was shaking his head again okay that settles it professor ritter said uncertainly anyone but hugo i guess dr krauerpoppe who had recovered herself said philosophically ruth and i will go with them then i cant tell you how im looking forward to it annaelisabeth dr von rohr said i think id like to go home and get ready for dinner dr krauerpoppe announced to professor ritter of course the professor said they all watched dr krauerpoppe leave the room she was so beautifully dressed not even her lab coat looked out of place i cant wait to see what annaelisabeth will wear tonight dr von rohr said after her colleague had gone shes going home to get dressed and i dont mean to change her lab coat she had a date with her husband tonight dr berger told everyone shes probably going home to break her date in a nice way jack felt sorry that hed caused dr krauerpoppe to change her plans dr von rohr on the other hand seemed pleased to have changed hers dont worry dr horvath told jack pounding his shoulder whatever else happens tonight youre going to the kronenhalle i just want to see my father thats why i came jack reminded them we just want to prepare you for seeing him dr berger stated dr horvath had stopped pounding jacks shoulder but he was massaging the back of jacks neck with his big strong hand i have a favor to ask you if youll indulge me the austrian said of course what is it jack asked him if you could say somethingi mean the way billy rainbow says it i know you can do it dr horvath urged him no doubt about it jackasbilly said after the episode in the edinburgh airport he was relieved he could still act wunderschön dr horvath cried beautiful how embarrassing klaus dr von rohr said i hope youll forgive me she said to jack but billy rainbow gives me the creeps hes supposed to jack told her i must tell you jack professor ritter said william says that line the exact same way you say it your father has made quite a study of you dr berger told him you should prepare yourself jackwilliam knows more about you than you may think dr von rohr said dr horvath had stopped massaging jacks neck but dr von rohr had put her arm around jacks shoulders in a comradely way yes heather told mehes memorized all my lines jack said i didnt mean only your movies jack dr von rohr cautioned him i think thats enough preparation ruth dr berger stated ja der musiker dr horvath shouted to jack yes the musician its time for you to meet the musician the musician there was a serenity to the private section of the sanatorium kilchberg which jack may have underappreciated on his first visit he was not in a serene state of mind the building itself which was white stucco with shutters the same grayblue color as the lake looked more like a small hotel than a hospital his fathers thirdfloor corner roomsoverlooking the rooftops of kilchbergfaced the eastern shore of lake zurich the alps rose in the hazy distance to the south of the lake the hospital bed where jacks father lay reading was cranked to a semireclined position the bed and the fact that there were no carpets on the noiseless rubberized floors were the only indications that this private suite was part of an institutionand that the man reading on the bed was in need of care while the windows were open and a warm breeze blew off the lake william was dressed as if it were a brisk fall daya thick flannel shirt over a white tshirt corduroy trousers and white athletic socks if jack had been dressed that way he would have been sweatingalthough it instantly made him feel cold to look at his father the bedroom which opened into another roomwith a couch and a card table with a couple of straightbacked chairswas not cluttered with furniture or mementoes jack saw only photographsmassive bulletin boards crammed with overlapping snapshots there were also movie posters hung on the peachcolored walls of both rooms they were posters of jack burnss movies at a glance jack thought that his dad had framed and hung all of them jack could see that the surrounding bookshelves displayed a more balanced collection of cds and dvds and videocassettes and actual books than hed seen in his sisters office or in her bedroom the team of doctors together with professor ritter and jack had entered his fathers attractive but modest quarters in the utmost silence jack first thought that his dad didnt know they were there william had not looked up from his book butas indicated by the door from the corridor which had been ajarliving in a psychiatric clinic had made jacks father familiar with intrusions william was accustomed to doctors and nurses who didnt necessarily knock jacks dad was aware of their presence in his bedroom he had deliberately not looked up from his book jack understood that his father was making a point about privacy william burns did indeed love the sanatorium kilchberg as the hearty dr horvath had maintained but that didnt mean he loved everything about it dont tell melet me guess jacks father said staring stubbornly into his book youve had a meeting remarkably youve come to a decision oh what joyyouve sent a committee to tell me your most interesting thoughts william was still refusing to look at themhis copper bracelets glowing in the dull lateafternoon light william burns had spoken with no discernible accent as if those years in foreign cities and their churches had replaced whatever was once scottish about him he certainly didnt sound american but he didnt sound british either it was a european english spoken in stockholm and stuttgart in helsinki and hamburg it was the unaccented english of hymns of all voices put to musicfrom the citadel church the kastelskirken in frederikshavn to the oude kerk in amsterdam as for williams sarcasm jack realized that his sister heather might not have inherited hers from her german mother as hed first thought dont be childish william dr von rohr said you have a special visitor william dr berger said jacks father froze he wasnt reading but he wouldnt look up from his book your son jack has come all this way to take you out to dinner professor ritter cried to the kronenhalle dr horvath thundered william closed the book and his eyes it was as if he could see or imagine his son better with his eyes shut jack couldnt look at him that way he looked instead at the photographs on the nearest bulletin board waiting for his father to open his eyes or speak well leave you two alone professor ritter said reluctantly jack had expected to see photographs of himselfchiefly the ones snipped from movie magazines all the film premieres the redcarpet crap and the academy awards but not the personal snapshots of which there were many there were more of jack than of heather there he was in one of miss wurtzs many dramatizations at st hildas naturally he recognized himself as a mailorder bridethat pivotal and bloodsoaked performance in mr ramseys histrionic production miss wurtz and mr ramsey must have taken the pictures jack was pretty sure it was caroline who had sent his dad the photographs but that didnt explain the photos of jack with emmathough lottie must have taken the ones in mrs wicksteeds kitchen there were more pictures of jack with emma in mrs oastlers houseor the ones of jack with chenko in the bathurst street gym or the ones of jack wrestling at redding had leslie oastler sent william photographs had jacks mother relented if only a little but mrs oastler and jacks mom had never been to redding had coach clum sent those wrestling pictures to william there were exeter wrestling photographs too maybe coach hudson and coach shapiro had also been messengers jack heard the door to the corridor close softly when he looked at his father on the hospital bed williams eyes were open and he was smiling jack had no idea how long his father had been watching him jack had barely glanced at one of the dozen or more bulletin boards hed seen only a fraction of the photographs but enough to know that his dad had surrounded himself with images of jacks childhood and his school years it explained something about heathers anger toward jacknamely that jacks past was more of a visual presence in their fathers confined quarters than hers i was afraid youd forgotten me his dad said it was one of billy rainbows lines jack had always liked that line and his father delivered it perfectly jack made a feeble gesture to all the photographs i was afraid youd forgotten me he blurted outin his own voice not billy rainbows my dear boy his dad said he patted the bed and jack sat beside him you dont have children of your own when you do youll understand that its impossible to forget them jack only now noticed his fathers gloves they must have been womens glovesclosefitting and of such thin material that william could turn the pages of his book as well as if he were barehanded the gloves were a light tan almost skincolored my hands are so ugly jacks father whispered they got old before the rest of me let me see them jack said william winced once or twice pulling the gloves off his fingers but he wouldnt allow jack to help him he put his hands in his sons hands jack could feel his father trembling a little as if he were cold the room now felt hot to jack the gnarling of his dads knuckles was so extreme that jack doubted his father could slide a ring on or off his fingerswilliam wore no rings and the bony bumps heberdens nodes which had formed on the farknuckle joints disfigured his fathers hands more than jack had anticipated the rest of me is okay jack his dad said he held one hand on his heart except here on occasion he put the index finger of his other hand to his temple as if he were pointing a gun at his head and in here he added giving jack a mischievous little smile how about you im okay jack told him it was like looking at himself on a hospital bed in clothes he would never wearas if jack had fallen asleep one night when he was thirtyeight and had woken up the next day when he was sixtyfour william burns was thin in the way that many musicians were with his long hair and the smallboned feminine prettiness of his face he looked more like a rock musician than an organistmore like a lead singer or one of those skinny androgynous men with an electric guitar than a keyboard man as heather had called him are we really going to the kronenhalle jacks father asked yes whats so special about it jack asked him they have real art on the wallspicasso and people like that james joyce had his own table there and the foods good william said were not going with dr horvath i hope i like klaus but he eats like a farmer were going with dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe jack told him oh what joy william said as he had beforesarcastically theyre two of the bestlooking shrinks youll ever seeill give them thatbut a little of ruth goes a long way and annaelisabeth never takes me anywhere without bringing some medication along jack was struggling against the feeling that his sister had warned him he would have his father seemed almost normal to him or not half as eccentric as hed expected william certainly wasnt as wound up as professor ritter or as obstreperous as dr horvathnor was he a third as intense as dr berger or dr von rohr or dr krauerpoppe in fact among the team attending to william burns only dr huber had struck jack as normaland she was an internist not a psychiatrist a pragmatist heather had called her you have so many photographs jack said to his dad of me i mean well yesof course william cried you should have a look at them you never knew that some of them were being taken im sure jack got up from the bed and looked at the bulletin boards his father following him in his socksas closely and silently as jacks shadow there were more wrestling photostoo many jack thought who could have taken them all there were as many as ten of the same match this was true of one of his matches at redding and two at exeter jack wasnt aware that hed had such a devoted admirer at either school of course jack knew that his father had paid the tuition both at exeter and at redding perhaps william had felt entitled to ask someone to take pictures of jack wrestling but who jack felt his fathers arms around his chest under his own arms the long knobby fingers of williams small hands were interlocked on his sons heart jack felt his father kiss the back of his head my dear boy his dad said it was so hard to imagine my son as a wrestler i simply had to see it for myself you saw me wrestle i promised your mother that i wouldnt make contact with you i didnt say id never see you he cried your wrestling matches were public even if shed known and she didnt she couldnt have kept me away you took some of these photographs jack asked him some of them of course coach clum was a nice man if not a very gifted photographer and coach hudson and coach shapirowhat wonderful people your friend herman castro is a great kid you should keep in touch with herman i mean more than you do jack but i took many of the wrestling pictures myself yes i did william seemed suddenly irritated that jack looked so stunned well i wasnt going to go all that way and not take a few pictures his father said with a measure of indignation in his voice what a pain in the ass it is to go to maineand its not a whole lot easier to get to new hampshire jack was thinking that heather had just been born when he was first wrestling at redding william might have traveled to maine when barbara was pregnant or when heather was an infant and when william had come to new hampshire when jack was wrestling at exeter heather would have been a little girltoo young to remember those times when her father was away but had those wrestling trips been difficult for barbara jack wondered first shed had cancer then she was killed by a taxi and thered been no more trips on one of williams bulletin boards there was a snapshot of jack at hama sushithe way he was smiling at the camera only emma could have taken the photograph and another of jack with emma in his lap he remembered emma taking that one they were in their first apartment their half of that rateaten duplex in venice there was also a photo of jack dressed for his waiters job at american pacific only emma could have taken that one too emma sent you these jack asked his father i know that emma could be difficult at times his dad replied but she was a good friend to you jackloyal and true i never met her in personwe just talked on the telephone from time to time look here his dad suddenly cried pulling jack to another bulletin board your friend claudia sent me pictures too there they were claudia and jackthat summer they did shakespeare in the berkshires hed wanted to be romeo but had played tybalt instead and there were photos from the theater in connecticut where both claudia and jack were women in that lorca playthe house of bernarda alba no pictures of the foodpoisoning episode thankfully did you ever meet claudia jack asked his dad only on the telephone alas william said a nice girl very serious but she wanted babies didnt she yes she did jack said you meet some people at the wrong time dont you his dad asked i met your mother at the wrong timethe wrong time for her and for me as it turned out she had no right to keep you away from me jack said angrily dont be such an american his father said you americans believe you have so many rights i met a young woman and told her i would love her forever but i didnt in fact i didnt love her very long at all to tell you the truth i changed my mind in a hurry about herbut not before i had changed her life if you change someones life jack what rights should you have didnt your mom have a right to be angry his father seemed as sane as anyone jack had ever met why is my dad here jack kept thinking although heather had warned him against thinking any such thing there were photographs of jack as a kit kat girl the summer both he and claudia wanted to be sally bowles in cabaret and a bunch of pictures from the summer of when jack had met bruno litkins the gay heron whod cast him as a transvestite esmeralda in the hunchback of notre damethus sending jack down a questionable career slope but one he had survived with his heterosexual orientation mostly intact you were good as a girl his dad was telling him butquite understandably as your fatheri preferred seeing you in male roles there were pictures of jack with his mother and leslie oastler and one of him and his mom in daughter alice had mrs oastler or a tattoo client taken that photograph emma thought i should see what her mother looked like his dad explained because she worried about what hold her mother might have on you i dont mean a wrestling hold did mrs oastler send you photographs too jack asked did you ever talk to her on the telephone i got the feeling that leslie sent me pictures or called me only when she was angry at your mother jacks father explained probably when mom was unfaithful to her jack said i never inquired about your mother jack i only asked about you there was a photograph of jack with miss wurtz that time he and claudia took her to the toronto film festival miss wurtz looked radiant in her formerfilmstar attire claudia must have taken the picture but there was no mistaking the way the wurtz was smiling seductively at the camera caroline clearly knew that either she or claudia would be sending the photo to william and there was one of jack and claudia which miss wurtz had to have taken jack couldnt remember if it was the night before the mishima misunderstanding or the night after it theyd successfully crashed a private party because the bouncers had mistaken miss wurtz for a celebrity in the snapshot claudia is looking fondly at jack but his eyes are elsewhere hes not looking at her or the camera knowing jack he was scanning the party to see if he could spot sonia braga how did you find me dear boy his dad asked heather found me she called miss wurtz caroline always knows where to find me dear caroline william said as if hed been meaning to write her a letter talk about meeting someone at the wrong time i was just in edinburgh with heather jack told him shes a bossy little thing isnt she his dad asked i love her jack said so do i dear boyso do i there were more photos of jack with emmafor so much of his life emma had been there in the bar marmont around the pool at the skybar at the mondrian hotel on sunset boulevard and in one of those private villas on the grounds of the sunset marquis in west hollywood there were shots of jack holding the steering wheel of his audi of one audi after another he knew now that emma had snapped all of these but hed never paid much attention to anyone taking his picture because it was always happening there were photographs of heather and her mother toosome were duplicates of those photos heather had shown jackand there were more skiing pictures but most surprising was the number of times that alice appeared in the photographs of jack he wondered why his father hadnt cut her out of the pictures jack would have and some of these photos were from jacks first trip to those north sea ports when hed been four and was still inclined to hold his mothers hand there they were on the nyhavn in front of tattoo oles either ladies man madsen or ole himself had to have taken the picture and in stockholm posing by a ship from the archipelagoit was docked at the grand had torsten lindberg taken that one jack would never forget that hed met his father but he hadnt known it in the restaurant of the hotel bristolin oslo where william had never slept with ingrid moe but who had taken the photograph of jack holding his moms hand in front of the domkirke the oslo cathedral from his grave jack would not fail to recognize the american bar in what was now the lobby of the hotel torni but which of those lesbian music students in helsinki had snapped that shot of jack and his mom going up the stairs they were always climbing the stairs because the elevator was never working and they were alwaysas they were in the snapshotholding hands why hadnt william burns removed every trace of jacks mother from his sight jack was staring so intently at the pictures from amsterdam that he hadnt noticed how close to him his father was standing or that william was staring intently at his son there was a photograph of jack with his mother and tattoo theo and another of jack with tattoo peterthe great peter de haan with his left leg missing below the knee tattoo peter had the same slickedback hair that jack remembered but in the photo he seemed more blond tattoo peter had the same woody the woodpecker tattoo on his right biceps too tattoo peter was only fifteen when he stepped on that mine william was saying but jack had moved on he was looking at himself as a fouryearold walking with his mom in the redlight district cameras were not welcome there the prostitutes didnt want their pictures taken yet someoneels or saskia probablymust have had a camera alice was smiling at the photographer as if nothing were the matter as if nothing had ever been the matter how dare you look at your mother like that his father asked him sharply what my dear boy shes been dead how many years and you still havent forgiven her how dare you not forgive her did she blame you she shouldnt have blamed you either jack cried de mortuis nihil nisi bonum hows your latin jack william clearly knew that jacks latin wasnt strong speak nothing but good of the dead thats a tough one jack said if you dont forgive her jack youll never have a worthwhile relationship with a woman in your life or have you had a worthwhile relationship that im unaware of dr garcía doesnt count emma almost doesnt count he even knew about dr garcía jack hadnt noticed when his father had started to shiver but william was shivering now he paced back and forth from the bedroom to the sitting roomand into the bedroom again with his arms hugging his chest are you cold pop jack asked him he didnt know where the pop came from not billy rainbow thankfullynot this time what did you call me his dad asked pop i love that william cried its so american heather calls me dad or daddyyou cant call me that too its perfect that you call me pop okay pop jack was thinking that his father might let him off the hook about his mom but no such luck its time to close the windowsits that time of the evening william was saying his teeth chattering jack helped him close the windows although the sun hadnt set the lake was a darker color than before only a few sailboats still dotted the water his father was shaking so violently that jack put his arms around him if you cant forgive your mother jack youll never be free of her its for your own sake you knowfor your soul when you forgive someone whos hurt you its like escaping your skinyoure that free outside yourself where you can see everything william suddenly stopped shivering jack stepped a little away from him so that he could see him better williams mischievous little smile was back once more transforming him uhoh jacks father said did i say skin i didnt say skin did i yes you did jack told him uhoh his dad said again he was beginning to unbutton his flannel shirt but he unbuttoned it only halfway before pulling the shirt offover his head whats wrong pop oh its nothing william said impatiently he was busy taking off his socks skin is one of those triggers im surprised they didnt tell you they cant give me antidepressants and expect me to remember all the stupid triggers on the tops of both feet where it is painful to be tattooed were jacks name and heathersjack on his fathers right foot heather on his left since jack couldnt read music he didnt know what the notes were but their names had been put to music by now jacks father had taken off his tshirt and his corduroy trousers too in a pair of striped boxer shorts which were too big for himand which jack could not imagine his father buying on one of the shopping trips with waltraut bleibelhis dad appeared to have the body of a former bantamweight at most william weighed onethirty or onethirtyfivejacks old weight class the tattoos covered his fathers sinewy body with the patina of wet newspaper doc forests tattoo stood out against all the music as vividly as a burn the words which were not as near to his heart as william would have liked them marked the left side of his rib cage like a whiplash the commandants daughter her little brother its not the tattoos my dear boy jacks father said standing naked before himthe shocking white of williams hands and face and neck and penis being the only parts of him that werent an almost uniform blueblack some of which had faded to gray its everything i truly heard and feltits everything i ever loved its not the tattoos that marked me for a small man he had overlong armslike a gibbon perhaps you should put your clothes on popso we can go out to dinner jack saw that messy music a wrinkled scrap of a page on his dads left hip where jacks mom was once convinced that beachcomber bill had marked himthe tattoo that had failed in the planning phase according to tattoo ole jack got only a glimpse of those notes that curled around the underarm side of his fathers right biceps most of that tattoo was lost from view either the chinamans mistake or the beachcombers and that fragment of a hymn on his left calfthe breathe on me breath of god both the words and the musicwas every bit as good as tattoo ole had said it had to be charlie snows work or sailor jerrys as for his dads favorite easter hymn christ the lord is risen today it was upside down to jackbut when his father sat on the toilet william could read the music since this tattoo was strictly notes without the words jack knew it was christ the lord only because of where it was and it was upside downand of course jack remembered that aberdeen bill had given it to william as heather had told jack this longago tattoo had been overlapped by a newer one walthers wachet auf ruft uns die stimmethe top two staffs beginning where the alleluia chorus to christ the lord should have been his father was leaping up and down like a monkey on the bed with a remote which william held in one hand he had lowered the hospital bed to a flat position it was hard to get a definitive look at all his tattoosfor example to ascertain exactly which lengthy and complicated phrase by handel was in the area of williams kidneys jack knew only that tattoo ole had done that one more christmas music ole had said dismissively but jack got a good enough look to guess that this was the soprano aria for unto us a child is born from handels messiahand in that case widors toccata was right next to it all but lost in an ocean of music herbert hoffmanns disappearing ship was even more difficult to see because of williams monkey business on the bed and there on his fathers right shoulder jack recognized another tattoo oleit lay unfurled like a piece ripped from a flag it was more bach but not the christmas music jacks mother had thought it wasneither bachs weihnachtsoratorium nor his kanonische veränderungen über das weihnachtslied it was tough to see his dads shoulder clearly with all the bouncing up and down but jacks exeter german was getting better by the minuteder tag der ist so freudenreich jack also caught pachelbels name if not the particular piece of music andin a crescent shape on his fathers coccyxtheo rademakers cramped fragment wir glauben all an einen gott the composer was samuel scheidt bachs jesu meine freude jesus my joy which tattoo peter had given jacks dad in amsterdam was indeed missing part of the word largoas his sister had said the balbastre tattoo joseph est bien marié which was newer and only slightly overlapped the bach was not by a tattoo artist jack could identify jacks french which was nonexistent gave him fits with duprés trois préludes et fugues pour orguenot to mention messiaens dieu parmi nous which followed the roman numeral ix did that mean god is among us jack was wondering i have a son his father was shouting as he bounced up and down on the bed thank you godi have a son dad dont hurt yourself pop his father corrected him better be careful pop you can give yourself a headache trying to decipher the tattoos on a naked man whos leaping up and down on a bed jack was trying to identify the bach tattoo sami salo was alleged to have given william on his backsideand the notes that trond halvorsen the scratcher gave him in oslo where halvorsen also gave william an infectionbut jack was making himself dizzy with the effort do you know what toccata means jack no pop it means touch basicallyalmost a hammered kind of touch his father explained he wasnt even out of breath jack saw no evidence that dr horvath had been right about the psychological benefits of the sanatorium kilchbergs jogging program but the aerobic benefits were obvious stanleys trumpet tune in d which marked williams chest in the area of his right lung seemed to make a visual proclamation didnt you need good lungs to play the trumpet and there was that fabulous alain quotation in french and english on his dads bare assnot that william was standing still enough for jack to be able to read it pop maybe you should get dressed for dinner if i stop ill get a chill dear boy i dont want to feel cold his father shouted for professor ritter and the doctorsthey were listening outside in the corridorthis must have been a familiar enough utterance to give them a signal there was a loud rapid knocking on the doordr horvath probably perhaps we should come in william professor ritter called it wasnt really a question vielleicht jacks father shouted perhaps william bounded off the bed he put his hands on the rubberized floor and bent over facing jack while he lifted his bare bottom to the opening door when professor ritter and the doctors entered william was mooning them reason has reached its limit only belief keeps rising i must say williamthis is a little disappointing professor ritter said only a little jacks father asked hed straightened up and had turned to face them naked william this is not what you should wear to the kronenhalle dr horvath admonished him i wont have dinner with a naked manat least not in public dr von rohr announced but jack could see that she instantly regretted her choice of words es tut mir leid she added im sorry she said to jacks father the other doctors and professor ritter all looked at her with dismay i said i was sorry she told them in her headofdepartment way i think i heard the word naked william said to his son smiling talk about triggers i said i was sorry william dr von rohr told him oh its nothing jacks father said irritably but jack saw the first sign that his dad felt cold againa single tremor its just that ive told you im not naked you know thats not how i feel we know william dr berger said youve told us but jack hasnt heard this professor ritter joined in dr von rohr sighed if shed been holding a pencil in her long fingers she would have twirled it these tattoos are your fathers real clothes jack dr von rohr said she put her hands on williams shouldersrunning her hands down the length of his arms which she then held at the wrists he feels cold because so many of his favorite composers have died most of them are dead in fact arent they william cold as the grave jacks father said nodding his head he was shivering and what is here and here and here and everywhere dr von rohr asked pointing to williams tattoos repeatedly nothing but praise for the lordhymns of praiseand prayers of lamentation with you everything is either adulation or mourning you thank god william but you mourn almost everyone or everything else how am i doing so far she asked him jack could tell that she had calmed his father down but nothing could stop the shivering dr horvath was trying rubbing williams shoulders while attempting to pull a tshirt over his shaking headmore or less at the same time youre doing a very good job jacks father told dr von rohr sincerely he was too cold for sarcasm his teeth were chattering again your body is not naked william it is gloriously covered with hymns of jubilation and with the passion of an abiding love of godbut also an abiding loss dr von rohr continued dr horvath went on dressing jacks father as if william were a child jack could see that his dad had completely succumbed not only to dr horvath dressing him but to dr von rohrs litanywhich william had doubtless delivered to her on more than one occasion you are wearing your grief william dr von rohr went on and your broken heart is thankfulit just cant keep you warm not anymore and the musicwell some of it is triumphant jubilant you would say but so much of it is sad isnt it william sad like a dirge sad like a lamentation as ive heard you say repeatedly the repeatedly was sarcastic ruth jacks father said you were doing fine till then dr von rohr sighed again im just trying to get us to dinner on time william forgive me if im giving jack the abridged version i think i get it jack told dr von rohr he thought shed done a good job under the circumstances i get the idea popi really do pop was heisst pop dr horvath asked what is pop amerikanische umgangssprache für vater professor ritter told him american colloquial speech for father he doesnt need to wear a tie klaus dr von rohr said to dr horvath who was struggling to knot a necktie at williams throat jacks not wearing a tie and he looks fine but its the kronenhalle jack was certain dr horvath was going to yell however dr horvath put the tie away and was silent theres more to life than grieving and singing praise to god william dr berger intoned i mean factually speaking i wont use that word i used again william dr von rohr said carefully but allow me to say that you cant go to the kronenhalle wearing only your tattoos becauseas i know you know williamtheyre not socially acceptable not socially acceptable jacks father repeated smiling jack could see that being socially unacceptable pleased william burns and that dr von rohr knew this about him i want to say that i can see what good care youre taking of my dad jack told them all i want you to know that my sister and i appreciate itand that my father appreciates it everyone seemed embarrassedexcept william who looked irritated you dont need to make a speech jack youre not a canadian anymore his dad told him we all can be socially acceptable when we have to well maybe not hugo his father added with that mischievous little smile jack was getting used to have you met hugo yet jack noch nicht jack said not yet but i suppose theyve told you about the nature of the little excursions i take with hugo on occasion his father said the mischief and the smile disappearing from his face as if one wordnot necessarily hugo but the wrong wordcould instantly make him another person theyve told you havent they he wasnt kidding i know a little about it jack answered him evasively but his father had already turned to professor ritter and the others dont you think a father and his son should have those awkward but necessary conversations about sex together william asked his doctors bitte william professor ritter started to say isnt that what any responsible father would do jacks dad went on isnt that my job to talk about sex with my sonisnt that my job why is that your job we thought that jack should be informed about the hugo business william dr berger said we didnt know you would bring the matter up with him factually speaking william said calming down a little we can talk about it later pop perhaps over dinner his father said smiling at dr von rohr who sighed speaking of which you should be leaving dr horvath cried but when they started for the corridorhis father bowing to dr von rohr who preceded himdr horvath grabbed jack by both shoulders holding him back which of the triggers was it the doctor whispered in jacks ear even dr horvaths whisper was loud das wort he whispered the word what was it skin jack whispered it was the word skin gott dr horvath shouted thats one of the worst onesthat one is unstoppable im glad some of the triggers are stoppable jack told him naked for example dr von rohr seemed to stop that one ja nakeds not so bad dr horvath said dismissively but you better not bring up the word skin at the kronenhalle and the mirrors he remembered with a gasp keep william away from the mirrors is a mirror one of the unstoppable triggers jack asked a mirror is more than a trigger dr horvath said gravely a mirror is das ganze pulver what jack asked him he didnt know the phrase das ganze pulver dr horvath cried all the ammunition their evening at the kronenhalle began with william complimenting dr von rohr on the silver streak in her tawny hairhow it had always impressed him that she must have been struck by lightning one morning on her way to work by the time she met with her first patient he imagined she was acutely aware of that part of her head where the lightning bolt had hit hermainly because the lightning had done such extensive damage to her roots that her hair had already died and turned gray is this actually a compliment william dr von rohr asked they had not yet been seated at their table which was in a room with a frostedglass wall theyd entered the kronenhalle from rämistrasse dr von rohr who was much taller than jacks father purposely blocked any view he might have had of the mirror by the bar they passed both the womens and the mens washrooms which harbored more mirrors but these mirrors were not within sight of the corridor they followed to their glassedin room the mirror over the sideboard was in another part of the restaurant william was looking all around but he couldnt see past dr von rohrhe came up to her breastsand dr krauerpoppe held his other arm jack followed them his father was constantly turning his head and smiling at him jack could tell that his dad thought it was great fun to be escorted into a fancy restaurant like the kronenhalle by two very goodlooking women if you werent so tall ruth william was saying to dr von rohr i could get a look at the top of your head and see if that silver streak is dyed all the way down to your roots theres just no end to your compliments william she said smiling down at him jacks dad patted the little purse dr krauerpoppe carried on her arm got the sedatives annaelisabeth he asked behave yourself william dr krauerpoppe said william turned and winked at jack dr horvath had dressed jacks father in a longsleeved black silk shirt because williams arms were long but his body was small every shirt looked too big on him his silver shoulderlength hair which was the same glinting shade of gray as dr von rohrs electric streak added to the feminine aspect of his handsomenessas did the copper bracelets and his gloves his evening gloves as william called them were a thin black calfskin the way his father bounced on the balls of his feet reminded jack of mr ramsey as heather had put it william burns was a youthfullooking sixtyfour ruth alas is no fan of billy rainbow jack william said as they were being seated alas she told me jack said smiling at dr von rohr who smiled back at him even so jacks father said clearing his throat i gotta say were with the two bestlooking broads in the place he really did have billy rainbow down pat youre such a flatterer william dr von rohr told him have you had a look at ruths purse jacks dad asked him indicating dr von rohrs rather large handbag it was too big to fit under her chair more like a suitcase if you ask memore like an overnight bag william said winking at jack his father was outrageously suggesting that dr von rohr had prepared herself for the possibility of spending the night at the hotel zum storchen with jack its not every day you meet a man who compliments a womans accessories dr von rohr told jack smiling dr krauerpoppe didnt look so sure nor was she smiling despite her supermodel attire dr krauerpoppes dominant personality trait radiated medication jack also knew that dr krauerpoppe was married and she had young children which was why his father had focused his embarrassing zeal for matchmaking on jack and dr von rohr she was no longer married but had been heather had said she was a divorced woman with no children jacks been seeing a psychiatristfor longer than ive known you two ladies william announced hows that been going jack i dont know if theres a professional name for the kind of therapy ive been receiving jack told them a psychiatric term i mean it doesnt need to have a psychiatric term dr krauerpoppe said just describe it well dr garcíashes this truly wonderful woman in her early sixties with all these children and grandchildren she lost her husband some years ago arent most of her patients women jack his dad interrupted i had that impression from one of those articles i read about the lucy businessyou remember that episode the girl in the backseat of jacks car william asked his doctors both she and her mother were seeing the same psychiatrist jack was seeing from the sound of it youd think there was a shortage of psychiatrists in southern california william let jack describe his therapy for us dr von rohr said oh his father responded it gave jack a chill that his dad said oh exactly the way jack did well dr garcía makes me tell her everything in chronological order jack explained both doctors were nodding their heads but william suddenly looked anxious what things jacks father asked everything that ever made me laugh or made me cry or made me feel angryjust those things jack told him dr krauerpoppe and dr von rohr werent nodding their heads anymore they were both observing william closely the idea of what might have made his son laugh or cry or feel angry seemed to be affecting him his dad had moved his right hand to his heart but his hand hadnt come to rest there he appeared to be inching his fingers over the upperleft side of his rib cageas if feeling for something under his shirt or under his skin he knew exactly where to find it without looking as for what might have made william burns laugh or cry her name was karin ringhofthe commandants daughter as for what might have made him cry and made him feel angry that would have been what happened to her little brother it sounds as if this therapy could be quite a lengthy endeavor dr krauerpoppe said to jack but shed not taken her eyes from williams gloved handblackonblack against his shirt touching the tattoo she knew as well as jack did the commandants daughter her little brother from the pained expression on his fathers face jack could tell that william had his index finger perfectly in place on the semicolonthe first and probably the last semicolon doc forest had tattooed on anyone your therapy sounds positively booklength dr von rohr said to jack but her eyeslike those of her colleaguehad never strayed from his father youre putting in chronological order everything that ever made you laugh or made you cry or made you feel angry his dad said grimacing in painas if every word he spoke were a tattoo on his rib cage or in the area of his kidneys or on the tops of his feet where jack had seen his own name and his sisters all those places where jack knew it hurt like hell to be tattooed yet william burns had been tattooed therehed been marked for life everywhere it hurt except for his penis and has this therapy helped dr von rohr asked jack doubtfully yes i think it hasat least i feel better than when i first went to see dr garcía he told them and you think its the chronologicalorder part that has helped dr krauerpoppe asked in her view jack could tell putting the highs and lows of your life in chronological order was not as reliable as taking medication yes i think so jack started to say but his father interrupted him its barbaric william shouted it sounds like torture to me the very idea of imposing chronological order on everything that ever made you laugh or cry or feel angrywhy thats the most masochistic thing ive ever heard of you must be crazy i think its working pop the chronologicalorder part keeps me calm my son is obviously deluded william said to his doctors jacks not the one in an institution william dr von rohr reminded him dr krauerpoppe covered her pretty face with her hands for a moment jack was afraid that the word institution might have been a trigger the doc forest tattoo on the upperleft side of his fathers rib cage was clearly a trigger but a stoppable oneor so it appeared jacks dad had returned both his hands to the table just then their waiter materializeda short man bouncing on the balls of his feet as vigorously as william or mr ramsey ever had although the waiter was fat he had a small mouth and an overlarge mustache which seemed to tickle his nose when he spoke was darf ich ihnen zu trinken bringen he inquired it sounded as if what may i bring you to drink were all one word fortuitous jacks father said meaning the timely appearance of the waiter but the waiter thought that william had ordered something bitte the waiter asked ein bier jack saidpointing to himself to avoid further confusion a beer i didnt know you drank his dad said with sudden concern i dont you can watch me i wont finish one beer jack told him noch ein bier his father told the waiter pointing to himself another beer william you dont drinknot even half a beer dr von rohr reminded him i can have what jack has william said acting like a child not with the antidepressants you shouldnt dr krauerpoppe said i can unorder the beer jack suggested das macht nichts jacks german will improve over time william said to his doctors jacks german is fine william dr von rohr told him you see she likes you jack his father said i told you that was an overnight bag the doctors choosing to ignore him ordered a bottle of red wine william ordered a mineral water jack told the waiter that hed changed his mind would the waiter bring them a large bottle of mineral water pleaseand no beer no no have the beer william said taking jacks hand in his gloved fingers kein bier jack said to the waiter nur mineralwasser no beer only mineral water jacks dad sat sulking at the table making an unsteady tower of his knife and spoon and fork fucking americans william said he looked up to see if that would get a rise out of his son it didnt dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe gave each other a look but they said nothing dont have the wiener schnitzel jack his father continued as if the menu which hed just that second picked up had been all that was on his mind from the beginning why not pop they butcher a whole calf and put half of it on your plate william said and dont have the bauernschmaus he added a bauernschmaus was a farmers platter of meats and sausages it was very popular with austrians and sounded like something dr horvath would have ordered but jack could see that it wasnt even on the kronenhalles menu and above all dont have the bratwurst its a veal sausage the size of a horses penis ill stay away from it then jack told him dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe were talking rapidfire swiss german it was not the high german jack had studied in schoolschriftdeutsch the swiss call it meaning written german schwyzerdütsch jacks father said contemptuously they speak in swiss german when they dont want me to understand them if you didnt talk about horses penises maybe they wouldnt have to talk about you pop i think you should find a new psychiatrist jack someone you can talk to about things as they come upnot necessarily in chronological order for christs sake jack was surprised by the for christs sake and not because it was exactly the way jack always said ithe only occasionally said itbut because jack had never said it in any of his films as dr berger had told him william had made quite a study of his son as dr von rohr had warned jack she didnt mean only his movies interesting what he knows isnt it dr von rohr asked jack the waiterthat timely bouncing fat manwas back to take their orders jacks father unhesitatingly ordered the wiener schnitzel william i know how you eatyou cant possibly eat half of it dr krauerpoppe said to him im just like jack with his one beer william said i dont have to finish it and i didnt order the pommes frites that come with itjust the green salad und noch ein mineralwasser bitte he told the waiter jack was surprised to see that the liter bottle was empty slow down william dr krauerpoppe said touching the back of his blackgloved hand william pulled his hand away from her the restaurant was lively but not too crowded their reservation was on the early side of when things get really busy at the kronenhalle or so the concierge had told jack but everyone in the restaurant had recognized jack burns look around you william said dr von rohrher voice as commanding as the silvergray lightningbolt streak in her hair be proud of your famous son but william wouldnt look and all these strangers who recognize jack cant help but see that you are his fatherthey are recognizing you too william dr krauerpoppe said and what must they be thinking william asked there is jack burnss old man with what must be his second or third wifethat would be you ruth william said to dr von rohr because youre obviously the older of the two lovely ladies at this table but youre clearly not old enough to be jacks mother william dont dr krauerpoppe began and what must they be thinking about you annaelisabeth william asked who is that pretty young woman with the wedding ring she must be jack burnss date they havent figured out the part about ruths overnight bag dad pop his father corrected him lets just have a normal conversation pop would that be the sexwithprostitutes or the hugo conversation william asked dr krauerpoppe opened her purse with a snap okay ill stop im sorry annaelisabeth jacks dad said i was looking for a tissue william i have something in my eye dr krauerpoppe said i wasnt even thinking about your medication not yet she opened a small compactit held a tiny mirror no doubt although jacks father couldnt see itand dabbed at the corner of her eye with a tissue perhaps we could talk about the time we all woke up at two in the morning and watched jack win the oscar dr von rohr said taking williams gloved hand he looked at her hand holding his as if she were a leper you mean emmas oscar ruth william asked her that screenplay had emma written all over it didnt it jack jack didnt respond he just watched dr von rohr let go of his fathers hand when the food comes william ill help you take those gloves off she told him its better not to eat with them ich muss bald pinkeln jacks dad announced i have to pee soon ill take him jack told the two doctors i think i should come with you dr von rohr said nein william told her were boys were going to the boys room just behave yourself william dr krauerpoppe warned him jacks dad stuck his tongue out at her as he stood up from the table if youre not back in a few minutes ill come check on you dr von rohr said touching jacks hand jack your father cried when you won the oscarhe cried and he cheered dr krauerpoppe said he was so proud of youhe is so proud of you i just meant that emma must have helped him william said he was indignant you cried and cheered williamwe all did dr von rohr replied it slowly registered with jack when he was walking with his father to the mens roomthat if theyd watched jack burns at the academy awards in his father had been in the sanatorium kilchberg for more than three years no one not even heather had told jack how long william had been there of course emma helped me pop jack admitted she helped me a lot i didnt mean i wasnt proud of you jack of course im proud of you i know you are pop in the mens room jack tried to block his fathers view of the mirror but william planted himself in front of the sink not the urinal they did a little dance william tried to look over jacks shoulder at the mirror when jack stood on his toes to block his dads view william ducked his head and peered around his son they danced from side to side it was impossible to prevent william from seeing himself in the mirror if mirrors were triggers they didnt affect jacks father in quite the same way as the word skin had this time he didnt try to take off his clothes but with every glimpse he caught of himself his expression changed do you see that man jacks dad asked when he saw himself it was as if a third man were in the mens room with them things have happened to him his father said some terrible things jack gave up trying to shield his dad and looked in the mirror too the third mans face kept changing jack saw his father as william might have looked when he first caught sight of jack as an infant before the boys mother had whisked him awaya kind of expectancy giving way to wonder on williams suddenly boyishlooking face jack saw what his father must have seen in a mirror that day in copenhagen when they pulled niels ringhofs body from the kastelsgravenor when william learned that alice had slept with the boy and then abandoned him his dad was slumping in jacks arms as if william wanted to kneel on the mens room floorthe way hed dropped to his knees at the waterfront in rotterdam when els had to carry him to femkes car or when the policeman had brought heather homeand the cop told william the story of how theyd mistaken barbara his dead wife for a german tourist who looked the wrong way crossing the street at charlotte square that mans body is a map william said pointing at the slumping man in the mirror should we look at the map together jack maybe later pop not now nicht jetzt his father agreed you said you had to pee pop jack reminded him oh jacks father said stepping away from his son i think i have they both looked at his pants william was wearing khaki trousers with the same pleats and sharply pressed pant legs that professor ritter favored but williams were stained dark his feet were standing in a puddle of urine on the floor i hate it when this happens his dad said jack didnt know what to do dont worry jack dr von rohr will be coming to the rescue what did you think her overnight bag was really for william turned abruptly away from the mirroras if the third man in the mirror had insulted him or made him feel ashamed seemingly part of his fathers daily schedule there came a headofdepartment knock on the mens room door herein william called come in dr von rohrs long arm reached into the mens room she was offering jack her oversize handbag without showing them her face danke jack said taking the bag from her hand its different when he sees himself in the mirror without his clothes she warned jack letting the door close jack undressed his father and wiped his body down with paper towels which he soaked in warm water then he dried his dad off with more paper towels william was as accepting of this treatment as a wellbehaved child jack was able to guide him out of sight of the mirror but when william was standing there nakedwhile jack searched for the change of clothes in dr von rohrs big baga welldressed gentleman entered the mens room and he and jacks father exchanged stares to the gentleman who looked like a middleaged banker jacks dad was a naked tattooed man to william burns if jack could read his fathers indignant expression the welldressed banker was an intruder moreover he was intruding on a tender fatherandson moment furthermore to the gentleman william burns was a naked tattooed man with gloves onand there was no telling what the gentleman might have made of the copper bracelets the banker gave jack an overfamiliar iknowwhoyouare look he had come to pee but hed walked into some twisted movie er ist harmlos jack said to the man remembering what nurse bleibel had told poor pamela hes harmless the banker clearly doubted this jacks dad had filled his lungs and proceeded to puff out his chest like a rooster he made two fists and held out his gloved hands jack reached back for his exeter german hoping for the best keine angst er ist mein vater he told the banker dont be afraid hes my father and this was the hard part ich passe auf ihn auf im looking after him the banker retreated not believing a word of it then the man was gonethe only actual third man to have momentarily shared the mens room with jack and his dadand jack dressed his father trying to remember how efficiently and gently dr horvath had dressed william in the clinic it seemed to soothe his dad to explain musical notes to jack william must have known that his son knew nothing about music quarter notes are colored in with stems his father told him eighth notes are also colored in with either flags or beams joining two or more together sixteenth notes are colored in and they have a double beam joining them together what about half notes jack asked half notes which are whitefacedwell in my case you could say fleshcolored his dad said he abruptly stopped flesh theyd both heard it but was it a trigger as unstoppable as skin maybe dr horvath might have said half notes which are whitefaced jack prompted his father to make him move on whitefaced and what whitefaced with stems jacks dad replied haltinglyflesh perhaps flickering in the halflight halfdark of his mind where all the triggers lay half asleep or half awake whole notes are whitefaced and have no stems stop hold everything jack suddenly said pointing to his fathers right side whats that one the tattoo was neither words nor music it more closely resembled a wound in williams side worse at the edges of the gash there was a bloodred rimlike a ring of blood as for the blood jack should have known but hed been only four at the time that is where our lord was wounded jacks father told him they put the nails in his hands he said holding his blackgloved hands together as if in prayer and in his feet and herein his side william said touching the tattoo on the right side of his rib cage one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear who did the tattoo jack asked his dad some scratcher jack expected him to say but jack should have known there was a time jack when every religious person in amsterdam was at least tempted to be tattooed by a man named jacob bril maybe you were too young to remember him no i remember bril jack said touching the bloodedged gash in his dads sidethen drawing his fathers shirt over the wound it was a great restaurant the kronenhalle jack had been foolish to order only a salad but he ate two thirds of his fathers wiener schnitzel william burns was a finicky eater at least jack brought his appetite to dinner william dr krauerpoppe scolded him but both william and jack were in a fairly upbeat mood they had weathered the word flesh which turned out to be in the stoppable category of triggersnot in the skin categoryand while jack had seen a third mans sorrow on his fathers face he knew that they had also escaped the mens room without confronting the worst of what mirrors could do to his dad it was different when william was naked in front of one or so dr von rohr had said jack guessed that was das ganze pulverall the ammunition which dr horvath had spoken of jack would get to see it one day and that day would come soon enough tonight in the kronenhalle jack was quite content to wait they talked briefly about the younger nurses at the sanatorium kilchberg how they virtually stood in line or took turns to shave his dad every morning how william was such a flirt you dont shave yourself jack asked him you try it without a mirror his father said you should try it with the younger nurses too jack if you dont behave yourself william im going to put waltraut in charge of shaving you dr von rohr told him just so you dont put hugo in charge of it ruth jacks dad said that was how william managed to steer their conversation back to hugo and the sexwithprostitutes subject dr von rohr in her headofdepartment way was smart enough to see it coming but she couldnt prevent it it is chiefly hugo whom these lovely ladies object to jack his dad began not the prostitutes sighing from dr von rohr of course the headinherhands thing from dr krauerpoppe you said prostitutesplural you see more than one jack asked his father not at the same time william said with that mischievous little smile of his forktwirling spoonspinning knifetapping from dr von rohrs part of the tableand dr krauerpoppe had something in her eye again im just curious to know pop if you see the same two or three womeni mean one at a timeor a different prostitute each visit i have my favorites his father said there are three or four ladies i keep going back to youre faithful in your fashionis that what you mean william dr krauerpoppe asked isnt there a song that goes like that shed had more red wine than dr von rohr or have i got the translation all upfucked all fucked up annaelisabeth dr von rohr corrected her and its safe jack asked his father i dont have sex with them if thats what you mean william answered with that nowfamiliar tone of indignation in his voice i know i meant is it safe in every way jack asked the place for example is it dangerous i have hugo with me his dad cried i dont mean in the same room with me of course of course jack said the silverware which dr von rohr had set in motion came crashing down wait till you meet hugo dr krauerpoppe told jack your father is safe with hugo then what is it you object to about him jack asked both doctors wait till you meet him was all dr von rohr would say dont pity me jack his dad said dont think of me as resigning myself to masturbation with a prostitute it isnt an act of resignation i guess i dont understand what it is jack admitted they all saw williams right hand reaching for his heart again once more the fingers of his blackgloved hand inched their way toward that tattoo with the semicolon in it he had with dr von rohrs assistance removed the gloves to eat but now that hed finished his meal the gloves were back on i have had women in my life that i wanted to haveif not for as long as i wish id had them william began sadly i couldnt do that again i cant go through losing someone else the doctors and jack knew everything about the tattoo william burns had for karin ringhof and where it was but jack didnt know if his father had a tattoo for barbara his german wifeor where it was if he had it maybe that one was in the music jack would ask heather about it i get it pop i understand jack told him he wondered if william ever touched his rib cage on the other side where jacob bril had pierced him and made him bleed jack wanted to know if that tattoo was ever as tender or sensitive to his fathers touch as the tattoo of the commandants daughter and her little brother he hoped not of all his dads tattoos jacob brils rendition of christs blood was the only one with any color its time for us to be going along william dr krauerpoppe told him gently what are you going to play for us tomorrowfor jack and me and dr horvath it was a good trick and jacks father seemed to be unaware of it his right hand drifted away from the area of his heart and the upperleft side of his rib cage he spread the fingers of his blackgloved hands on the white tableclothhis feet shuffling under his chair as if he were familiarizing himself with the foot pedals you could see it in his eyesthere was a keyboard in his mind there was an organ the size of the oude kerk in his heart when jacks dad shut his eyes he could almost hear it you dont expect me to hum it for you do you annaelisabeth william asked dr krauerpoppe she hadnt fooled him after all in fact she held her breathas jack and dr von rohr didbecause they all knew that hum was a possible trigger as dr berger had warned jack his father hated humming although maybe it was the humming itself and not the word he hated why not wait and surprise them in the morning william dr von rohr suggested im just asking why not jacks dad said he was looking tired i have a little something to make you drowsy in the car dr krauerpoppe told william jacks dad was shaking his head he was already drowsy im not going to be happy to say goodbye to jack william said testily ive said goodbye to you beforetoo many times dear boy ive said goodbye to you here his father said the gloved hand touching his heart again and here he said pointing to his eyes and in here william was weeping now holding his index finger to his temple youre going to see me in the morning pop jack held his fathers face in his hands youre going to see me again and again jack promised him i intend to keep coming here heather and i are buying a house in zurich william instantly stopped crying and said you must be crazy its one of the most expensive cities in the world ask ruth ask annaelisabeth tell him he shouted at the women i dont want my children to bankrupt themselves he moaned wrapping both arms around his chest and hugging himself as if he were cold sehr bald wird ihm kalt werden dr von rohr said to her colleague very soon hell feel cold mir ist nicht immer kalt jacks father argued i dont always feel cold dr krauerpoppe had stood up and put her hand on williams shoulder he sat shaking in his chair open up william she said if you take this you wont feel coldyoull just feel sleepy jacks father turned his head and stuck his tongue out at her jack realized that he might have misunderstood when his dad had done this before dr krauerpoppe put a pill on the tip of williams tongue she raised the water glass to his lips and he swallowed ill just see if hugo has the car here he was supposed to dr von rohr said leaving the table professor ritter has a home in one of those overpriced monstrosities across the lake from the sanatorium jacks father started up again as soon as hed swallowed the pill dr krauerpoppe had given him its in zollikon or küsnachtone of those precious places its in küsnacht williamits very beautiful dr krauerpoppe assured jack that side of the lake gets more sun my taxi driver told me jack said but do you know what it costs jacks father asked him four million swiss francs and for what a house of three hundred or four hundred square meters and you pay more than three million dollars thats crazy the house has a view of the lake it has a garden too dr krauerpoppe explained the garden must be a thousand square meters william its still crazy jacks dad said stubbornly at least he wasnt shivering dr krauerpoppe stood behind williams chair massaging his shoulders she was just waiting for the pill to kick in william jack could buy a small house in townsomething not that expensive dr krauerpoppe said im sure he doesnt care if he can see the lake everything in zurich is expensive jacks father declared william you go shopping for clothes and prostitutes what else do you go shopping for in zurich dr krauerpoppe asked him you see what im up against jack its like being married his dad told him william saw that dr von rohr was back to both of them believe it or not hugos here with the car dr von rohr announced he actually remembered youre too hard on poor hugo william said to dr von rohr wait till you meet him jack hes a herman castro kind of fellow a heavyweight in other wordsjack could tell at first glance when he saw hugo hulking over the black mercedes hugo was shining the hood ornament with the sleeve of his white dress shirt he was attired more in the manner of a waiter than of either a limo driver or a male nurse which he was buteven in a longsleeved white dress shirtjack could see that hugo had the sculpted bulk of a bodybuilder whereas his older sister waltrautthe other nurse bleibelwas short and stout hugo was unambiguously huge he had made himself huge hed developed those powerful shoulders and his bulging upper arms hed worked to make his neck nearly as big around as williams waist and hugo had shaved his head unfortunatelythough it was not unthinkable that this might have been an improvement his face had the flat blunt purposefulness of a shovel the one gold earring signifying nothing drew your attention to the fact that the other ear was missing a lobe an encounter with a dog in a nightclub jacks dad had told him on their trip into zurich from kilchberg but dont feel sorry for hugo his father had said the dog got the worst of it hugo had killed the dog for eating his earlobe dr horvath would later tell jack it was easy to see what dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe held against hugo he was not the sort of young man women of education and sophistication liked nor was he a man most women would feel attracted to alas hugo had not only the appearance of a bodyguard he had the personality of one as well at kilchberg those younger nursesthe ones who stood in line to shave jacks fatherwouldnt have given hugo the time of day the older women therehugos sister and the doctors includedprobably bossed him around hugo was a thug he knew no other way to behave but at least jack had met someone who could tell him where a good gym was in zurich and jack saw in their first meeting that hugo doted on william for a young man who consorted with prostitutes hugo by his association with a handsome older gentleman like william burns had doubtless upped his standing in that community of ladies hugo jacks father hailed the big brute like an old friend i want you to meet my son jackden schauspieler the actor william called his sonexactly as hed introduced jack to everyone on the number onesixtyone bus william had insisted that jack and dr von rohr ride with him from kilchberg into zurich on the bus jacks dad was proud of his knowledge of the publictransportation system and he wanted jack to see how he usually rode to and from the cityon his shopping trips with waltraut and his other shopping trips with hugo the black mercedes was for nighttime travel only most of the passengers on the bus seemed to know jacks father and to all of them william had said i want you to meet my son jackden schauspieler ive seen all your movies hugo said introducing himself to jack william and i have watched them together they never get old he cried shaking and shaking jacks hand jack saw the look that passed between dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppeas if old were a trigger maybe or in certain contexts perhaps could be but not this time jacks dad was smilingpossibly swaying on his feet more than he was bouncing on them either old was not a trigger or the pill that dr krauerpoppe had given william was taking effect im not saying goodbye to you jack his father told him william put his arms around jacks neck his head fell on jacks chest as lightly as a babys you dont have to say goodbye to jack william dr von rohr said just say bis morgen to him just say until tomorrow to him youre seeing him in the morning bis morgen pop bis morgen his dad whispered i am already imagining that im tucking you into bed dear boy or maybe youre tucking me in im afraid its time for hugo to tuck you in william dr krauerpoppe told him oh what joy jacks father said releasing his son jack kissed his father on the moutha dry kiss just brushing his dads lips with his own lips tightly closedthe way heather had taught him william kissed jack the same way i know what youve been up to dear boy i can tell youve been kissing your sister jack took a chance but he felt it was the right time after all hugo and the two doctors were with themin case anything went wrong i love you pop jack told his father heedless of whether or not love was a trigger i love every inch of your skin i really mean it hugo looked as if he might punch jack dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe closely watched william how was skin going to affect him they all wondered were they in unstoppable territory orin this contextwas skin suddenly acceptable say that again jack his dad said i dare you i love you and every inch of your skin jack told him william burns put his blackgloved hands on his heart and smiled at hugo and the doctors not looking at jack hes got balls hasnt he his father asked them thats not an area of my expertise dr von rohr answered i just do medication william dr krauerpoppe said but jacks father was fine he was holding his heart because he wanted to feel it beating i love you and every inch of your skin dear boy please dont forget to call your sister suddenly william seemed exhausted hugo helped him into the backseat of the mercedes where william burns looked as small as a child on his way to his first day of school the bodybuilder had to buckle the seat belt for him andbefore he got into the drivers seathugo came up to jack and shook and shook his hand again jack thought that hugo might pull his arm off youve got balls as big as der mond hugo told jack youve got balls as big as the moon then hugo got in the car and they drove away bis morgen dr krauerpoppe called after them now im taking a taxi home dr von rohr said i live in another part of the city she explained to jack there was a taxi stand in the vicinity of the bellevueplatz where dr krauerpoppe and jack waited with dr von rohr until she found an available taxi the two women kissed each other on both cheeks and said good night i assure you jack i was never struck by lightning dr von rohr said when they shook hands not on my head anyway i think your father has hit me with a lightning bolt not on my head but in my heart jack walked with dr krauerpoppe over the quaibrücke they walked back to the hotel zum storchen together are you sure i cant walk you home he asked her i live near your hotel she said but youd never find your way back the streets are small and go every which way your children are how old he asked her it was a beautiful night with the lights from the city winking up at them from the limmat they are ten and twelve both boys dr krauerpoppe told him if i ever had to say goodbye to them the way your father had to say goodbye to you i would kill myself or if i were lucky i would be in a place like the sanatorium kilchberg i dont mean as a doctor i understand jack said to her i love your father and every inch of his skin she said smiling will he ever get better jack asked her he can be much worse than he was with you tonight he was on his best behavior for you she told him but he will neither get worse nor get better william is what he is hes very lucky to be with all of you in kilchberg jack said to her you have to thank your sister for that jack she has made her share of sacrifices dr krauerpoppe told him are you serious about buying a house here yes very serious he answered my husband knows something about real estatehe can probably be of some help to you im just in the medication business they were back in the weinplatz in front of the storchen are you sure jack started to ask her again about walking her home yes im sure she interrupted him ill be home in bed while youre still talking on the phone to heather dont forget to call her but dr krauerpoppe stood there not leaving jack could tell there was something more she wanted to say but perhaps she felt that she didnt know him well enough to say it youre not going home annaelisabeth he asked she covered her face with her hands again for such a serious and such a beautiful woman it was a curiously girlish gesture what is it he asked her its not my businessyou have a psychiatrist she said please tell me what youre thinking jack said to her im thinking that you should finish this chronologicalorder therapy she told him and when you do finish you should ask your doctor about a little something she might give you you just wouldnt want to take this while you were still trying to put everything in chronological order you mean a pill he asked her yes a pill dr krauerpoppe said its not unlike what we give your father but its newer and a little different from zoloft or seropram its cipralex its like the seropram we give william but this one has a new agent in it escitalopram you get a more rapid onset of actiona week compared to two or three weeksand because of the higher potency a normal dosage would be ten milligrams instead of twenty its an antidepressant jack asked of course it is she said i think the brand name is lexapro in the states but dr garcía would know with escitalopram there were supposed to be fewer side effects but not all studies have shown that this is true you might not like the loss of libido possible impotence or prolonged ejaculation dr krauerpoppe paused to smile at him you definitely wouldnt like what it might do to your ability to tell the story of your life in chronological order jack so first finish what youre telling dr garcía then try it do you think im depressed annaelisabeth what a question she said laughing if youre putting in chronological order everything that ever made you laugh or made you cry or made you feel angryand if you are truly leaving nothing outthen of course youre depressed im surprised youre not in a place like the sanatorium kilchberg yourself jack i dont mean as a visitor but how will i know when im finished it just goes on and on he said to her youll know when youre finished jack dr krauerpoppe said it ends when you feel like thanking dr garcía for listening to you it ends when theres someone else you feel like telling everything tosomeone who isnt a psychiatrist oh gott she said who would have thought the way someone said oh could be genetic dr krauerpoppe shook jacks hand walking away with her high heels somewhat unsteadily navigating the cobblestones she called over her shoulder ill meet you right where youre standing in the morning jack ill take you to the church william will come with dr horvath bis morgen he called to her then he went into the hotel and called his sister on the little pad of paper for messageson the night table next to the telephonejack recognized his handwriting in the morning cipralex mg lexapro in the states ask dr garcía what had professor ritter said your father has suffered losses the losses alone were enough to make anyone feel cold maybe williams tattoos had nothing to do with it the conversation with heather had gone well even though jack woke her up she was happy that he called well i finally met him it took long enough ive been with him for several hours jack began dr von rohr and dr krauerpoppe and i took him out to dinner at the kronenhalle i met hugo of courseand all the others just say it his sister yelled i love him he told her quickly thats all you have to say jack she said she started to cry i love him and every inch of his skin jack told her my godyou didnt say the word skin did you she asked him in the context of telling him i loved him i got away with it jack said he thought i had balls for saying it ill say you have balls heather cried there were just a few episodesnothing too terrible he explained there will always be episodes jack i dont need to hear about them are you okay about the prostitutes he asked her are you okay about them jack jack told her that he was all things considered he cant get in trouble if hugos with him was how he put it they talked about whether or not jack should tell miss wurtz about the prostitutes jack was eager to call caroline and tell her everything maybe not everything jack heather had cautioned him maybe save the prostitutes for a later conversation they asked themselves if hugohaving lost part of one ear to a dog in a nightclubcould have conceivably done anything more preposterous than dangle a gold earring from his remaining earlobe do you think hugo wants to draw attention to the earlobe the dog bit off heather asked jack he could have put the earring in the top part of the damaged ear and not worn anything in the good one jack suggested heather wondered if jack might meet the particular prostitutes their dad was in the habit of visitingthat is if hugo would introduce him just to see if theyre nice and to ask them to be nice to him jacks sister said he has very little privacy as it is jack said they agreed that you have to give the people you love a little privacy even if youre afraid for their lives dont you love them all she asked him i mean his doctorseven professor ritter ah well jack started to say of course i do he told her will you call me every day his sister asked of course i will if i forget you can call me collect he said she was crying again i think youve bought me jack ive completely sold myself to you she cried i love you heather i love you and every inch of your skin she said jack told heather how their dad had thrown a tantrum over how expensive zurich was and that the issue of his children buying a house there had struck him as crazy this objection from a man who had no idea how expensive the sanatorium kilchberg wasor that the money had run out to pay for his care which was why heather had contacted jack in the first place jack and his sister also talked about mundane thingsthose things jack had imagined he would never talk to anyone about the specific details of the house they were going to share in zurich for example the number of rooms they needed how many bathrooms for christs sake exactly as william would have said it it seemed too obvious to put into words but jack realized that when youre happyespecially when its the first time in your lifeyou think of things that would never have occurred to you when you were unhappy what a morning it was first the light streaming into his room at the storchen then having coffee and a little breakfast in the café on the limmat simple things had never seemed so complex or was it the other way around jack was as powerless to stop what would happen next as he had been that fateful day william burns impregnated alice stronach and standing in front of the hotel zum storchenon the same cobblestones where jack had stood when hed called bis morgen to her in the weinplatzwas that supermodel of medication dr annaelisabeth krauerpoppe once again she was wearing something smashing jack could understand why she wore the lab coat in kilchberg just to tone herself down they walked uphill on the tiny streets to st peter one day he would know the names of these streets by heart jack was thinking schlüsselgasse opposite the veltliner keller and weggengassehe would hear them in his head like music its a beautiful morning isnt it dr krauerpoppe asked him she was nice about it when she saw that he couldnt speak st peter has the largest clock in europea foursided clock on its tower she told him making small talk as they walked would you like a tissue she asked reaching into her purse jack shook his head the sun would dry the tears on his face he wanted to tell her but the words wouldnt come jack kept clearing his throat by the bluegray church there was a small paved square with lots of trees there were plants in the window boxes of the surrounding shops and houses some construction workers were renovating what looked like an apartment building the building was across the square from the church and the workers were standing on the scaffoldingworking away a hammer was banging two men were doing something complicated with a flexible saw a fourth man was fitting pipesto build more scaffolding probably it was the pipefitter who first spotted dr krauerpoppe and waved to her the three other workers turned to look at her two of them applauded one whistled i guess they know you jack said to annaelisabeth relieved that he had found his voice or are they just like construction workers everywhere youll see she told him these workers are a little different it seemed strange that there were people going into the church and it was not yet eight on a weekday morning was there some kind of mass jack asked dr krauerpoppe no the kirche st peter was a protestant church she assured him there was no massonly a service every sunday we cant keep them away dr krauerpoppe said st peter is open to the public more people were walking up the broad flat stairs to the church they looked like locals not tourists jack saw men in business suits like the banker his dad had surprised in the mens room at the kronenhalle he saw women with young children and whole families there were even teenagers they all come to hear him play jack asked annaelisabeth how can we stop them she asked isnt it what sells books and movies what you call word of mouth i think the kirche st peter was packed there was standing room only youre not going to sit down anyway dr krauerpoppe told jack and youre going to leave just before your father finishes william doesnt want you to see the end of itnot the first time the end of what jack asked her why would i leave before he finishes please trust me annaelisabeth said klausdr horvathwill take you outside he knows the right moment she covered her face with her hands again we all know it she said with her face hidden the stone floor of the church was polished gray marble there were blond wooden chairs instead of pews but the chairs stood in lines as straight as pews the congregation faced front with their backs to the organas if there were going to be an actual service with a sermon and everything jack wondered why the audience didnt turn their chairs around so they could at least see the organist they had come to hearso faithfully as he now understood it the organ was on the second floor to the rear of the churchabove the congregation the organ benchwhat little jack could see of itappeared to face away from the altar the organist looked only at the silver organ pipes framed in wood which towered above him how austere jack was thinking the organist turns his back to the congregation and vice versa a black urn of flowers stood beneath the elevated wooden pulpit above the altar was an inscription matth iv du solt anbätten den herren deinen gott und ihm allein dienen it was a kind of oldfashioned german jack had to ask dr krauerpoppe for a translation you shall worship the lord your god and him only you shall serve she told him i guess my dad is what youd call a true believer jack said william never proselytizes annaelisabeth said he can believe what he wants he never tells me or anyone else what to believe except for the forgiveness part jack pointed out to her hes pretty clear on the subject of my forgiving my mother thats not necessarily religious jack dr krauerpoppe said thats just common sense isnt it she led jack outside the church again and they went in a door and up some stairs to the second floorwhere the organ was it was a smaller organ than jack was used to seeingvery pretty with lightcolored wood it had fiftythree stops and was built by a firm called muhleisen in strasbourg jack looked down at the congregation and saw that even the people who were standing were facing the altar not the organ nobody wants to see i guess he said to annaelisabeth just leave with dr horvath when he tells you dr krauerpoppe told him after william plays he will need some ice water and then the hot wax and then more ice water if you come out to kilchberg in the late morning maybe you can go jogging with himand with dr horvath later this afternoon you can hear him play blindfoldedfor the yoga class or you can watch one of your own movies with him she said excitedly just leave when its timeokay im not kidding okay jack said to her when dr horvath and jacks father came up the stairs to the second floor many people in the congregation turned their heads to look at william burns william was all business he acknowledged no one not even jack his dad just nodded at the organ jack felt dr krauerpoppe brush against his arm annaelisabeth wanted jack to know that this was how william was before he played how had she put it the night before william is what he is there was no applause from the congregation to acknowledge him there wasnt a murmur but jack had never heard such a respectful silence dr horvath was carrying the music there was what looked like a lot of music normally he plays for one hour dr horvath whispered loudly in jacks ear but today because youre here hes playing a half hour longer naturally dr krauerpoppe overheard him perhaps everyone in the congregation could hear dr horvath whisper do you think thats a good idea klaus annaelisabeth asked dr horvath is there a pill to make me stop jacks father asked dr krauerpoppe but jack could tell that his dad was just teasing her his mischievous smile was intact when william sat down on the organ bench he looked into jacks eyesas if jack had told him at that very moment how much he loved him and every inch of his skin did you remember to call your sister jack his dad asked him of course i called her we talked and talked dear boy was all william said his eyes had drifted to the keyboard jack could hear his fathers feet softly brushing the pedals annaelisabeth had taken the music from dr horvath and was looking through it i see fingercramping possibilities williamlots of them she told him i see music william said winking at her lots of it jack was nervous and counted the chandeliers they were glass and silver he counted twentyeight of them later well go jogging dr horvath told jack im going to dinner with you and william tonight well give the girls the night off greatim looking forward to it jack told him unfortunately its not the kronenhalle dr horvath said but its a special little place the owner knows me and he loves your father they always cover the mirrors when they know williams coming dr horvath whisperedfor everyone to hear how brilliant is that bitte klaus dr krauerpoppe said jack could see that she was going to turn the music for his dad who appeared ready to play no one in the congregation was looking in their direction now the congregation faced that stern command from the gospel according to saint matthew you shall worship the lord your god and him only you shall serve william held his hands at shoulder level above the keyboard jack heard him take a deep breath by the way the congregation straightened their backs jack could tell that theyd heard his father tooit was a signal here comes said dr horvath he bowed his head and closed his eyes williams hands appeared to be floating on a body of warm rising airlike a hawk suspended on a thermal then he let his hands fall it was a piece by bach a choral preludeliebster jesu wir sind hier blessed jesus we are here tranquillo dr horvath said with surprising softness in italian after that jack just listened to his father play jack couldnt believe how william kept playing or how no one in the congregation lefthow they never moved a muscle they were standing dr horvath and jackdr krauerpoppe stood the whole time too jack couldnt speak for the others but his legs didnt get tired he just stood there absorbing the sound william burns played on and onall his favorites what heather had called the old standards william played for over an hour they heard handel and everyone else when his dad began bachs toccata and fugue in d minorthe famous piece that had been such a crowdpleaser among the prostitutes in the oude kerk in amsterdamdr horvath nudged jack we are almost leaving dr horvath said naturally jack didnt want to go but he saw that annaelisabeth was watching him jack trusted her he trusted them all it was a hard piece of music to go down the stairs to but dr horvath and jack quietly descended his father was too busy playing to see them go it was warm in the church all the doors were open and the windows that would open were open too the sound of the bach poured into the little square it came outdoors with them the bach was not as loud outsidein the trees or on the stone stairs leading away from the churchbut you could hear every note of it almost as clearly as you could hear it in st peter that was when jack saw all the people in the open windows and doorways of the surrounding buildings everywhere he looked there were peoplejust listening of course its not quite like this in the winter dr horvath was saying but still they come to hear him play jack stood at the bottom of the church stairs in the middle of the little squarejust listening and looking at all the people there wasnt a sound from the construction workers who had long ago stopped working they were standing at attention on the scaffolding their tools at restjust listening the man whod been wielding the hammer had his shirt off the two men whod been working with the flexible saw were smoking the fourth worker the pipefitter held a small piece of pipe in one handlike a baton he was pretending to be a conductor conducting the music those clowns dr horvath said he looked at his watch no fingercramping episodes so far the bach sounded like it was winding up or down theres more jack asked another piece after this one more dr horvath said nodding jack realized from the way they were standing that the construction workers on the scaffolding knew the program as well as dr horvath knew it they looked as if they were getting ready for something suddenly the bach was over it happened simultaneously with a puzzling exodusfamilies with children were leaving the church some of the mothers with younger children were running only the adults and the teenagers stayed cowards dr horvath said contemptuously he kicked a stone get ready jack ill see you laterfor some jogging jack realized that dr horvath was preparing to leave him jack also realized that he knew the last piece in his case hed just heard heather play it in old st pauls how could he ever forget it it was boellmanns horrormovie toccata the construction workers knew the boellmann tooperhaps william burns always played it last the construction workers clearly knew everything that was coming it wasnt at all like not being able to hear it when jack had stood outside old st pauls what poured out of the kirche st peter was deafening jack was not familiar enough with the boellmann to detect his fathers first mistake the first fingercramping episode but dr horvath obviously heard it he winced and made a fist of one hand as if hed just shut his fingers in a car door time for me to go back inside dr horvath cried there came a second mistake and a third now jack could hear the errors his fingers he asked dr horvath you cant believe how the boellmann hurts him jack dr horvath said but he cant stop playing jack thought of those prostitutes within hearing distance of the oude kerk no matter how late at night or how early in the morning now he knew why they couldnt go home if william burns was playing at the fourth mistake dr horvath was off running i like to be there when he starts undressing he called to jack taking the stairs three at a time the music raged onthe soundtrack for a chase scene to end all chase scenes jack imagined in his next movie there might be such a scene maybe he could get his dad to play the boellmannmistakes and all the errors even jack could tell were mounting the construction workers were poised on the scaffolding i have a son jack heard his father yell over the deteriorating toccata i have a daughter and a son his dad shouted then williams fingers lockedhis fists came crashing down on the keyboard a flock of pigeons exploded from the clock tower of the kirche st peter and the construction workers started singing i have a son they sang they had even learned english listening to william burns i have a daughter and a son they sang out they had more enthusiasm than talent but jack had to love them venite exultemus domino his father sang the way you would sing or chant a psalm one might assume that ordinary construction workers in zurich wouldnt necessarily know latin but this wasnt the first time these men had listened to william burns andas annaelisabeth had told jackthese workers were a little different venite exultemus domino the four workers sang back to jacks father the man whod earlier been hammering now held his hammer in one hand his arm high above his head the two workers with the flexible saw held it aloft as if they were offering a sacrifice the pipefitter had seized a long length of pipe which he held straight uplike a flagpole venite exultemus domino jacks dad and the workers sang out together jack knew the latin only because hed just been at old st pauls with his sister come let us praise the lord their father was singing i have a son i have a daughter and a son come let us praise the lord the construction workers went on singing with william people were coming out of the churchnow that the boellmann no longer thundered on now that there was no impending collision jack knew that his dad had taken off all his clothes or he was in a partly undressed phase of the process back at the sanatorium kilchberg nurse bleibeleither waltraut or hugowould be getting the ice water ready and then the hot wax and then more ice wateras annaelisabeth had explained soon william burns would be standing naked in the kirche st peter if he wasnt naked alreadyhis fullbody tattoos his only choir and then both gently and efficiently dr horvath would begin to dress himor both dr horvath and dr krauerpoppe would dress him after that they would be on their wayback to the clinic the concert was over but the construction workers were still applauding that was when jack knew that he and his father had always been playing to an audience of more than onealthough it had helped jack as a child to believe that he was performing only for his father jack and his dad would have to have a conversation about williams dispute with the wurtz over the word audiencethat and many other conversations jack walked away from the square down those narrow streets some of his fathers congregation were in the streets they walked along with him it was quite a wonderful feeling to know that zurich was where jack belonged at least until william burns was sleeping in the needles jack was thinking that he would go back to the hotel zum storchen and change into something more suitable for jogging it was after midnight in los angelestoo late to call dr garcía at home but jack didnt need to have a conversation with his psychiatrist he would call her office and leave a message on her answering machine thank you for listening to me dr garcía jack would tell her it was fourthirty in the morning in toronto or some ungodly hour like that caroline would still be sleeping but she wouldnt mind a wakeup call from jacknot if it was about his father her dear william in fact jack couldnt wait to tell miss wurtz that he had found him acknowledgments in toronto helga stephenson bruce smuck dr martin schwartz detective ray zarb debbie piotrowski in
