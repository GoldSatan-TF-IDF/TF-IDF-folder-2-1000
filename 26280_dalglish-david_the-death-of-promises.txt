the death of promises david dalglish prologue patient devil arent you jerico whispered as he knelt by a shallow stream running through the rocky terrain he scooped handfuls of water and drank doing his best to forget that the orcs often urinated along the banks the last tribe he had seen was downstream but the gray scoundrels bred like rabbits in the vile wedge most likely hundreds of orcs had relieved themselves into that very same water far upstream he spat out what little he had not swallowed well now im thirsty sick and still annoyed as the abyss he said he shifted his left shoulder adjusting the leather straps wrapped around his forearm a thick rectangular shield hung across his back emblazoned with the emblem of the golden mountain that shield protecting nearly every vital part of his body kept him calm enough to keep his back turned to his unknown stalker he looked past his broken reflection in the water for two days he had felt a gentle voice of warning in his mind it was the voice of ashhur his beloved deity the one he served in full devotion despite what had happened despite the fall of the citadel despite believing himself the last paladin of ashhur he had survived longer than the others had because ashhurs voice was strong in his ear and he never doubted it this time it screamed that death followed him like a shadow youre no orc he said aloud his patience tiring he hadnt slept in nearly two days youre too patient for an orc so stop hiding if you want to kill me come and try you want to talk come and talk if its neither then please go with ashhurs blessing and leave me be i do not think ashhur would ever grant me his blessing came the reply from behind him for i have killed too many of his failed faithless children the paladin stood the voice was too far away to be within striking distanceyet another dog of karak i assume he asked my name is krelln worm ive killed three just like you weak in faith afraid did you think you could flee to the wedge and hide amidst the orcs and the ogres you dont much look like a goblin failed paladin jerico turned and faced his mocker a young man even younger than he such a shame to see souls corrupted so early jerico thought he wore heavy platemail akin to jericos except krellns armor was black and charred as if it had come from the bowels of the abyss failed paladin jerico asked scanning the young mans face scars lined every inch of it a bold claim considering youve never met me before what did i fail twice i have seen you grab your mace and not once has it glowed your faith in ashhur is nothing he drew his blade and held it with both hands it was enormous with a serrated edge and a carved lion head as a hilt black flame rolled up and down the length of steel as you can see my faith remains strong jerico laughed shifting his left hand in the straps that held his shield tight across his back one pull and itd be at the ready do you plan on killing me dark paladin he asked your head will be a grand gift to his majesty keep still your weapon and i will be merciful you dont know what mercy is boy mercy doesnt exist in karaks twisted world krelln charged across the yellow grass he swung his blade with all his strength jerico took two steps back drew his mace in his right hand and smoothly parried the curved tip of krellns sword a grin crossed his face should save your strength he told the younger man the second swing came straight down trying to cleave the paladin in half jerico took a single step to the side and let the attack smash a deep indent in the ground the black flame charred the grass around it jerico twirled his mace in his hand his shield still carefully tucked across his back you dont have the faith to fight me krelln snarled and you dont have the skill to fight me go back to where you came no one has to know you found me the dark paladin spat onto his blade the saliva sizzled in the flame confidence is nothing faith is everything is that so lets find out jerico hooked his mace to his belt and stood unarmed try to strike me down i wont draw my weapon your sword will falter krelln glanced about suddenly nervous he suspected a trick but didnt know what you lie lyings not my style the dark paladin licked his lips his hands shifted their grip on the sword hilt jerico watched it all waiting waiting krelln swung jerico yanked with his left hand freeing his shield he took a step closer thrusting his shield into the path of the blade right before the blow connected the metal of jericos shield burst with brilliant white light krelln cried out as his eyes burned when the sword struck he felt his arms jolt in pain a loud crack echoed in the valley it was as if he hit a stone wall jerico shoved aside the blade and approached still unarmed krelln thrust only to have it blocked the contact jarred his arms and shoulders he felt his heart skip and his lungs quiver the black flames on his sword dwindled to a shadow of their former size your faith is untested jerico said lunging forward his shield leading krelln swiped upwards a desperate defense the paladin met it with the bottom edge of his shield a soft cry of pain escaped krellns lips sparks showered the ground untested and built on anger and ignorance you say youve killed three of my brethren ive killed nine of yours krelln the young man tried to lift his blade but his arms refused to move jerico kicked it from his hands krelln staggered back terrified of making contact with the awful glowing shield the others will find you he said his voice growing hoarse with fear once krieger finds out lathaar isnt the last hell hunt you down and make a necklace from your guts jerico halted where he stood who is lathaar he asked krelln tried to flee before he could take a step jerico slammed his shield deep into his back the dark paladin screamed as his cursed armor melted he collapsed his face smashing hard on the dirt smoke sizzled as the melted metal burned his flesh he felt a foot press atop his back amidst the pain and the heat tell me who is lathaar jerico asked again i dont know krelln gasped heshes just another paladin we thought he was the last another paladin of ashhur jerico whispered lord be praisedanother lives he lifted his foot the man squirmed to a stand and glared blood ran down his face from a broken nose his hair was disheveled and he weakly sucked in air while clutching his numb arms to his chest jerico waved him away go he said i will show you the same mercy you offered me bastard krelln spat before turning to run jerico watched him for a few seconds before unhooking his mace three good men died to his hand he whispered to it fly true bonebreaker he flung the mace end over end through the air it struck krelln in the back the powerful magic within the weapon activated white light flared and then krellns spine shattered to pieces he fell limp making only a soft confused cry before death took him jerico slowly walked over and retrieved his mace karak take you in his arms he said while kneeling beside the body and after an eternity may ashhur forgive you and save you from that fate he buckled the mace and his shield and then prepared to dig he would leave no man not even a dark paladin to be feasted on by the carrion creatures besides he needed time to think things had changed after all the years the nightmares of the citadel falling and the brutal battles with dark paladins that sought total victory against his kind he suddenly knew he was not alone lathaar he said repeating the name krelln had spoken where are you now lathaar how have you lasted when all others have fallen well not all others he thought he had survived and there was nothing special about him i guess thats not true he chuckled patting his shield before digging with his hands it took the rest of the day to bury the corpse it was hard work but he was used to such things at the setting of the sun he decided it was time to leave the vile wedge forgive me ashhur if i endanger your priests he told the last sliver of light falling behind the horizon but i must go to the sanctuary i must find him as darkness came he felt the gentle touch of ashhur on his heart and knew the path he had chosen was the correct one that didnt mean it would be easy or guaranteed to succeed but it was the right path and he held faith in ashhurs guidance in the end that was what truly mattered part one it was a sad place this small clearing encircled by thin trees with branches that hung low to scratch at their faces as they entered death haunts these woods the frail man whispered to his lover i know said the girl beside him be silent i want you to see she stepped away from his arms and into the clearing her long black hair hid much of her naked body only the soft pale white of her legs and arms was visible in the darkness qurrah the girl asked softly yes tessanna do you love your lover of course he said i believe you she said her back still to him but i must know i must she spread her arms wide dirt floated upward on a silent wind as all about the creatures of the night fell silent qurrah watched as she placed her hands together and arched back her head dark magic sparkled on her fingertips the wind ceased tessanna sighed she knelt to the grass turning slightly so that qurrah could see what she had done a rose qurrah whispered he stepped closer mesmerized by the sight indeed it was a rose but not one of leaf and petal it was white and ethereal shimmering above the ground with a sad drooping head it is a ghost tessanna said a strange twinkle in her eye a ghost of a rose i was not aware soulless beings could have ghosts all things have a soul qurrah even flowers and trees and the creatures of the forest in death they are more understanding than we but there are times very rare times that a tragedy too great can befall them and bind them here tessanna swirled the dirt beneath the floating rose her smile faded and a black substance glazed over her eyes a few whispery commands tore pieces of an ancient corpse up from the earth the pieces whirled together mingling with the essence of the rose the stem became bone the petals rotted strips of flesh a single flash signified the union of the two the girl took the rose and held it before her naked chest her eyes peering at her lovers a slow smile crept across her thin angular face her eyes solid black with only a hint of white at the edges held him mesmerized she offered him the rose he took it without a thought thorns of bone pierced qurrahs flesh blood ran down his wrist he opened his mouth to speak but no words would come all he saw was twisting red petals of a long dead flower do you love me qurrah the girl asked her voice was thunderous in the silence yes he gasped would you give your life to me would you die so that i may live the redness swirled faster the whole world was flowers he tried to speak but the powdery taste of petals numbed his tongue would you qurrah the girl asked suddenly shy and quiet would you the petals vanished and he saw his lover standing before a vast emptiness the sight lit his heart aflame when she vanished within the dark the flame died in painful agony yes he gasped my life is yours and i give it gladly the thorns withdrew from his flesh the owls and the cicadas began songs anew tessanna knelt before qurrah who had collapsed to his knees she took the rose from his hand and held it to her chest blood qurrahs blood ran between her breasts im sorry qurrah she whispered what did you do to me he asked his strength slowly returning he couldnt believe the incredible relief he felt when the rose was taken from his hand it is the rose of the maiden she said only those who are truly in love can touch it without feeling its anger those ruled not by love but by anger or fear or hatred or vengeanceit brings those to the dirt for the forest to consume you were testing me qurrah said tessanna crushed the rose and dropped the pieces to the ground the softly luminescent ghost appeared once more hovering between them slowly it drifted downward resuming its perch just above the earth the young woman grabbed qurrahs hands and pulled him to her it will be the last time she said pressing her lips to his it has been many years before love was made before this rose would you qurrah would you let this be our wedding the rose our priest the forest our witness the halforc kissed her once more let it be done and they wed themselves there upon the cold hard earth their love bright and alive the ghost of the rose watched and approved when the two lovers awoke it was gone having long faded with the dawn it will be getting colder qurrah said we must get you some clothes there is a village nearby the girl said i saw the smoke of their fires then let us take what we must the sanctuary is still many weeks of travel q urrah left the forest alone tessanna remaining back to linger among the trees not far from the forests edge was the village nestled beside a small stream that qurrah followed he waited there at the stream feeling certain someone would soon come for water he expected a woman but twenty minutes later a gruff man with a bent back approached he held a bucket in one hand and a worn rake in the other his face and skin were the color of mud the man kept silent as he neared and outwardly he showed no signs of surprise or worry qurrah could sense his fear it was small and well contained surprised by such strength in a simple farmer the necromancer felt his curiosity climb we have no need for a priest here the farmer said falling to his knees beside the stream he put down the rake dipped the bucket into the water and let it fill not because you worship the lion mind you we have little money and even less food i am no priest qurrah said the man looked at him the right corner of his mouth turning upward in a subdued smile then youre a murderer a liar or a thief dont think wed appreciate any of those in our village either qurrah laughed i come in need of aid farmer my lover and i have had many trials and we need supplies for the winter your name the man asked he cupped some water with his hand and drank tell me your name orcblood qurrah tun well qurrah tun im craig but friends here know me as badback you dont have any money to barter with do you didnt think so lets be honest qurrah i said you were either a liar a murderer or a thief tell me which of the three is it the halforc glanced back to the forest angry at how uncomfortable he felt before the farmers eyes the man who owned these robes was a priest he died at the hands of an elf and i took them from his body i am none of what you say the farmer chuckled qurrah sensed the fear within him tightening but still masterfully controlled you stink of death halforc you are a necromancer just as i am a farmer and you toil with blood no different than i toil the soil if i turn you away will you kill me the halforc glared at badback who ignored him as he looked at tessanna peering out from the forest qurrah couldnt shake the feeling that something was amiss the farmer took his bucket in one hand and his rake in the other as he stood qurrah pulled down the cloth in front of the mans chest and then spat at what he saw you pick a strange spot to live priest qurrah said all deserve to hear the word of ashhur badback said even the poor farmers of the land i should kill you for what transgression have i harmed or insulted you now answer my question yes qurrah said i would kill you if you refused badback leaned against the rake his eyes stared straight into qurrahs then you are a child lashing at those who do not relent to your desires i would give you the cloak off my back if you asked in humble nature i still will what supplies do you lack clothes qurrah said again caught off guard and hating it my lover travels naked and will freeze at the first snow i will see what we have badback said he turned toward the village wait here i would hate to have you startle anyone he returned much later holding a bundle of clothes and supplies instead of his rake and bucket he handed them to qurrah the clothes should hide her nakedness he said the blankets should keep you warm at the night and the food will satisfy your worldly hunger for a time i thought you had little to spare qurrah said and we spare it anyway you have never understood have you qurrah do you think us weak sacrificing meager provisions to a man in need you know this not to be true why do you mock me the halforc asked i do what i do for the sake of my village now go he purposely put his crooked back to the necromancer and returned to his town qurrah clutched the supplies in his arms feeling his anger boil he was being played the fool he just didnt know how or why and not just that he was being treated the inferior he could strike the man dead with a thought but here he was made to seem the beggar and the fool what is the name of your village he asked using magic to heighten his voice to a shout for his throat was too frail to do so on its own the priest turned and cupped his hands to his mouth i think it best you not know that was the last he saw him qurrah swore to return once he had the spellbook of darakken once his promises were fulfilled he would burn the entire village to the ground qurrah tessanna had ventured from the forest her naked body a startling oddity among the dying grass and cold air the halforc handed her the clothes which she held out to look at fairly simple she said and the skirt is far too long im sure youll make it fit the halforc said tessanna slid the dress on it was rough and prickly but it was still something she took her dagger out from qurrahs robe and used it to cut a thin strip from the bottom she then tied it as a sash and tucked the dagger within this done she looked at qurrah and giggled you just cant stand kindness for kindnesss sake can you she asked qurrahs glare was answer enough t he food dried and salted venison did well to sate their hunger tessanna ate little for she wore a simple wooden ring that allowed her to survive on a single meal every ten days while in the forest they had lived on deer and squirrel but there was little to hunt on the grassy hills and plains they now crossed some days they walked but other days should we ride tessanna asked the next morning blankets wrapped about her body the ground is getting colder qurrah sighed while badback had given them clothes he had forgotten shoes for tessanna to wear the travel was wearing on her feet and some nights she would rest by the fire with blood soaking them from toe to heel she never complained and by morning the blood was gone and the cuts nothing but scars the ground had steadily grown rockier and their travel slower yes he said i guess we can this day tessanna smiled she let the blankets drop the cold air bit her skin but she held in any shivers with her hands above her head she started swiveling her hips in a small circle weaving to some unheard music she placed one foot in the ashes of the previous nights fire the ash sprang to life burning although it had no fuel tessanna twirled her other foot stepped in the fire and then it roared high above her knees it did not burn her qurrah watched mesmerized as he always was by the summoning her movements grew slower and slower every twirl of her hips and gyration of her back intensely erotic the first time she had ever shown him she had been naked he had immediately made love to her afterward seletha she whispered into the morning air the fire sprang like a river into the grass before her pooling and growing her spell lashed it together lifting the fire higher into the shape of a large horse she slowly drifted her hands downward magic flaring across her palms the fiery form solidified growing muscle and bone when her hands reached her sides the creature was whole and the summoning complete the horse lowered her head and raised one bent leg her way of bowing she snorted plumes of black smoke blowing from her nostrils qurrah pulled his robes tighter about him fighting against the fear that always filled his gut at the sight it wasnt the supernatural aspect of the creature that bothered him before their first ride he had admitted to tessanna his fear of horses it took all his willpower to sit atop the magical being without panicking the gods bridges are close seletha the girl said gently patting the horses head think you can get us there by nightfall she clomped a hoof and nodded good lets go qurrah of course the halforc said he had ridden seletha twenty times since fleeing the confrontation with his brother he had hoped to get over his fear but of course he hadnt and tessanna struggled to hold in her laughter as he placed a hesitant hand atop selethas back youve always been so good at mounting me silly tessanna said surely you can mount a horse without too much difficulty the halforc rolled his eyes and then climbed atop the giant beast the two rode atop seletha bareback one of the other reasons qurrah tried to ride as sparingly as possible by nightfall his legs and back would ache and hed swear any hope of producing children was lost to him tessanna arced back her head and levitated herself onto selethas back both legs bent and tucked on the right side i hate this damn thing qurrah said shush and enjoy the ride she replied the girl whispered to the horse and then they were off so great was selethas weight that deep hoof prints marked their passing across the earth the centers of each one lined with a tiny flare of dying flame qurrah hunkered beside the fire a deep scowl covering his face he pulled his hood low over his head and muttered about the pain in his lower back tessanna cuddled beside him quietly singing each note was slow and soft her voice as cold as ice atop a river we were made for joy we were made for suffering we feel love and we hate who we love and this is not real until we cry love swirled within his chest and in such a manner he touched her face as she sang but she was the girl of apathy and her face was stone against his touch i will not cry til i die and i will die when you come for me come for me make me real she ended her song her eyes staring up at the sky for the longest time she remained silent qurrah brushed her face again not hurt by the lack of emotion she showed to him ever since aulliennas death her love for him had come and gone much like her personalities he knew given time she would return his affection if she didnt hed take her and give her no choice but to love him sometimes he wondered if that was what she preferred the most the stars are beautiful tessanna said qurrah did not respond so she continued i used to wish upon them when i was a little girl id wish for a bear to come and eat my father and then a great black hawk to come and let me ride on its back do you know what i wish for now qurrah the halforc shook his head she stared at him wanting to see his reaction i wish for a way to replace what was lost the girl you killed you desire a child he asked fighting anger at the guilt she cast his way one of your own womb i do she said her voice was perfectly calm yet a tear ran down the side of her face but i know i cant have one no life sparkles inside me so what am i to do qurrah what am i to do qurrah kissed her lips and then used his thumb to wipe the tear away even if it takes all my life i will repay you for my mistake for my brothers pride perhaps in time i may give you a child tessanna finally smiled you just want me more often he laughed any more than we already do i may injure myself she laughed the apathy within her melting away underneath the ice a smoldering fire flared how about tonight she asked always worth a try isnt it he kissed her again as he removed her dress in the light of the campfire her body was perfect he could not see her scars or the bones of her ribs her slender hands removed his sash and parted his robe she crawled atop him her lips and tongue flitting across his neck qurrah moaned and arced his back and as he did he saw the men watching them tessanna he said his entire body suddenly tensing im sorry the girl said i should have sensed them sooner and then they were atop them pulling tessanna off a boot pressed hard against qurrahs neck another crushed his right hand two men each held tessanna by an arm they all wore brown coats and grey trousers hold them steady one man said to the others seems theyre both all riled up and ready to go the man the leader of the bunch by the way he yelled at the others knelt next to qurrah and spat the halforc swore death as the saliva covered his eyes looks like you wont get to have too much fun but your girl there a toll one man shouted and his cry was quickly repeated by the others a toll a toll they jostled the naked girl this way and that her slender frame lacking any strength to resist yet despite their cries and their looks she did not appear afraid instead she let out a tiny moan as she moved her hips back and forth qurrah forced himself to open his eyes he needed to know how many had attacked them he counted only four two holding tessanna another restraining him and then the leader daggers were attached to their belts but so far they remained undrawn for what should we pay a toll qurrah asked his free hand crawled across the ground and tightened about the handle of his whip which lay atop the fabric of his cloak nearly invisible in the darkness to cross the gods bridges of course said the leader torys boys own it now own the whole bloody delta if you want to cross you pay a toll we have no coin he said glancing at tessanna he wondered if he should act or wait for her the ruffians had no clue what they held in their arms no clue at all well aint that a shame said the leader standing up and walking to tessanna he cupped her face in his hand turning her chin this way and that but id say this pretty girl does have something of value doesnt she boys all four cheered and whistled touch her and die qurrah said shut up said the man towering above qurrah pressing harder against his neck with his foot close your eyes and keep them shut we gonna take our toll the leader grabbed tessannas hair and pulled her head back she moaned louder a smile creased her face you like that he asked her you want a real man dont you not some bony little orc runt you couldnt handle me she said youd only end up hurt he laughed the others only smirked and chuckled they knew what was coming tessanna wasnt the only woman to sass off when they took their toll oh is that so he asked before backhanding her across the face as she spat blood onto one of her captors he drew his dagger and held it to her neck you keep that pretty mouth of yours shut he whispered ive humped corpses before you little whore and wed all have hours of fun with yours before you turned cold qurrah watched his lover smile even as blood ran down her lips he tightened his grip on the whips handle knowing the one who held him was far too interested in tessannas body to pay him any attention the girl was playing games with them with all of them itd be more than hours tessanna said licking the blood with her tongue im fire you naughty little boy pure fire id burn you the second you put that little weed you call a prick inside me sparks of flame burst within her eyes the leader glanced around for the first time realizing he was not dealing with normal travelers qurrah saw this and chuckled about damn time what the abyss the leader said pressing harder against her skin with his knife her hair caught flame then her shoulders her chest and her neck the fire hid her nakedness the men who held her screamed the flesh of their hands seared black the leader thrust his dagger only to have the cheap metal shatter fire leapt across the broken blade burning a thin line up his arm he tried to run but tessanna was not done she whispered a few words of magic paralyzing him where he stood the man holding qurrah fled qurrah whirled immediately fire consuming his whip he wrapped it about the fleeing mans legs tumbling him to the ground the man screamed as the fire burned his ankles to the bone shut up qurrah said the necromancer hooked his fingers in bizarre directions and let his dark power flow the bones in the mans ankles snapped the broken pieces tore out the black mess of flesh animated with dark power with a thought he ended the mans screams shredding his throat with his own bones qurrah picked up his robe and put it back on he tied the sash while he watched tessanna have her fun the two men that had held her had long fled into the night only the leader remained held sway by the beautiful sorceress she ran a hand down his face smiling as one of his eyeballs popped do you still want to bed me she asked tears ran from his good eye and he tried to speak but all that came out was a pathetic whimper good you interrupted my fun so ill have to have fun with you she pressed her body against his her arms wrapped about his body and pulled him closer she ground her crotch against his leg she slipped a finger inside his mouth his clothes burned away as did his flesh still she caressed him still she held him against her at last she pulled back and cried out in ecstasy she released him from his paralysis his throat and mouth was so charred and burned he could not even scream nothing but a blackened mess he collapsed to the ground bled and died the fire left her bodyat least the outward fire qurrah wrapped his whip around his arm amused at how aroused his lover was i told him he couldnt handle me she giggled t he next morning qurrah was first to awake his whole body shivered underneath his blankets he pulled them tighter about himself and attempted to return to sleep but the groaning of his stomach refused to let him rest he had eaten nothing the previous day their provisions were running low and he meant to stretch them as far as they could go i should have made her teach me that spell he muttered thinking of the banquets his brothers wife aurelia had conjured seemingly at will the spell most likely required some sort of component to cast but whatever it had been qurrah knew it would be easier to carry and obtain than his current stock of food tessanna stirred at his voice getting hungry again she asked rubbing the sleep from her eyes he didnt answer as he opened the dried meats brown wrapping he tore off a chunk and ate grimacing at how salty it was he immediately craved water the girl watched him absently picking at her lip do we ride today she asked qurrah shook his head the bridges are near i want us to be prepared in case our welcome is as kind as last night the halforc took another bite couldnt aurelia summon water too he thought he remembered her soaking his brother once or twice in such a way the elf was a walking supply caravan he thought here he was able to manipulate shadow bone and blood and he would trade it all for the ability to conjure a tiny bit of water along with a sweetroll or two he finished the rest of the meat and then cast the wrapping to the dirt tessanna raised an eyebrow someones being a pig where will we get more those men that attacked us last night must live nearby he said he pooled saliva in his mouth and then spit imagining it full of salt most likely a village if we meet them at the bridges well find out and take what we need murder for supplies she wrapped the blankets around her so that only her head peeked out thats low even for us isnt it qurrah opened his mouth to speak then stopped it was wasnt it they attacked us first he decided if they dare touch us again well would you blame me for taking what they will no longer need after i send them to the abyss the girl shrugged she pulled the blankets above her nose will they try to hurt me again i dont like it when people do that qurrah offered her his hand and was not at all surprised that she shrunk back from it she had slipped into her childlike state she seemed more like a sixyearold girl than the young woman she really was ill protect you whether you need the protection or not he told her now get dressed those men likely saw our fire from their post at the eastern bridge so we cannot be far qurrah yes tessanna she smiled an unseen smile behind the blankets what are the gods bridges like ive always heard theyre pretty come with me he told her once more offering his hand and we shall see together he took her hand and pulled her from the blankets she kissed his cheek before putting on her dress together she said i like that when they were ready qurrah scattered the last few ashes of their fire and led them west the bridges had been constructed centuries ago by the gods karak and ashhur after they had celestia split the land of dezrel with the great rigon river just before reaching the ocean the rigon river forked in two creating a large delta each god had placed a bridge just south of the fork each had hoped this crossing would allow them to claim the fertile delta and it was their twin claims that led to their war karak had built his bridge across the eastern fork and it was this bridge that qurrah and tessanna first saw oh qurrah tessanna said smiling it is beautiful twin lions carved of stone flanked the entrance they were reared back on their hind legs their front paws raking the air their mouths were forever open in a roar of battle three arches made of giant stones wedged together formed the bridges structure the first arch began where the ground sloped toward the river and the third ended atop the bank on the far side two giant pillars marked where the arches met above the water qurrah had heard that the hand of karak himself lifted and placed the stones into the water and seeing its size he held little doubt to its truth carved into the pillars was a giant man standing beside another lion qurrah recognized the image for he had seen a similar one when he visited the priests of karak back in veldaren the top of the bridge was smooth flat stone along its edges were three more arches significantly smaller than the ones underneath the entire bridge was a chalky white though in patches throughout there remained the golden color it had once been pelarak mentioned this in his journal qurrah said as he and tessanna stared in awe he wrote that many of his order came here to study the bridge and learn its secrets those arches in particular interest them pelarak claimed their strength is far beyond the mere stone that makes them i dont care about its secrets tessanna said but i must see it closer she led the way and qurrah followed twelve men waited at the bridges entrance they wore the same brown coats and gray trousers as the men who had accosted them the previous night a couple had swords attached to their belts while the rest carried daggers all qurrah could think was of how pitiful the men looked compared to the stone lions on either side of them the men drew their weapons as qurrah and tessanna neared one man perched at the foot of the left lion called out to them stop now he shouted thats close enough to talk we dont wish to talk qurrah said using magic to strengthen his voice so the others could hear if he tried to shout hed tear an old wound and blood would pour down his throat we wish to cross well thats the problem the man said tossing a dagger up and down in his hand were not sure we want you crossing not after what happened last night and i said to stop moving the couple continued anyway the other ruffians grew nervous at their boldness while the apparent leader kept tossing his dagger qurrah eyed him closely his hair was cut much shorter than the others and he wielded the weapon with an ease that implied many hours of practice if it came to killing that man needed taken out first fine then guess shouting isnt too civilized is it the man said hopping down from the lions foot my name is tory its nice to meet such a lovely couple qurrah grabbed several bone pieces from his pockets and held them in one hand his other caressed the handle to his whip we wish to cross and find supplies within the delta qurrah said letting them look into his eyes and see the lack of fear within and we will not be stopped you killed a few of my men tory said however i believe they were acting boorish so unlike the example i try to set for them for that i apologize accepted qurrah said now will you let us pass no not yet tory said pacing between the lions see i heard some crazy stories about a girl made of fire killing my men now i dont see any fire but what we see is hardly what we get is it he gestured to tessanna are you more dangerous than what you appear ive killed more than you she said her voice meek and shy ten times more does that make me dangerous tory laughed but qurrah detected a bit of nervousness the other men were getting antsy they had gotten a good look at tessannas eyes and they wanted no part of her thats what i thought tory said such a beautiful thing too are you both in such a hurry that you cannot stay with us in our friendly town riverend may not be the largest of places or the most civilized but the ale and food are excellent he looked at tessanna a charming smile on his face surely we could become better acquainted jealousy flared within qurrah how dare you we could tessanna said offering him a flirty smile back but as i told your dead men youd die the moment you touched my flesh the charming smile faltered so be it he said he snapped his fingers the men around him reached back and pulled out loaded crossbows from behind the lion statues qurrah tensed his knuckles white no one insults me tory said the dagger in his hand twirling so fast it was a metallic blur no one before the men could fire qurrah tossed the bones into the air dark power flowed from his hands giving them life the pieces hovered in a small circle shining a phantom gray you cannot win this qurrah said his fingers outstretched put down the bows and i will let you live theyre scared tessanna said her hands remained at her side and she appeared bored of the situation theyre scared so they threaten then lets remove their ability to threaten qurrah whispered he formed a fist igniting the power of the bones the shards flew through the air aimed straight for the crossbows they punched holes in the wood broke the fingers that held them and snapped the strings a couple fired but the shots were erratic qurrah opened his hand once more half of the bone pieces returned hovering before his face do you think your swords will kill me he asked do you think you will get close enough to try a few men grabbed their daggers but tory waved them off you may cross the man said you are the stronger without question he gave one last longing look at tessanna a shame too the group of men parted granting the couple passage the western bridge is not far tory said as they passed my men will let you through without hassle try not to keep them waiting qurrah grabbed tessannas arm and walked across the bridge silent were not going to the other bridge tessanna said once they were beyond earshot and were not going just because he said he wanted us to youre such a child we need supplies qurrah said keep telling yourself that she said kissing him once on the cheek but you wont be fooling me id never try to he said glancing back at tory but i think i might kill him the next time we meet try to make it painful tessanna said her tiny mouth grinning all he could think about was raping me the entire time we talked tory couldnt decide why but the horrific laughter he heard from the two as they left the bridge formed a knot deep in his gut one that would take many drinks to loosen r iverend was a quaint little town at least to tessannas standards it thrived off the crops it harvested from the fertile land that stretched for miles in all directions but many travelers crossing between the two countries also stopped to rest and purchase supplies and coin from all nations was welcome the two passed a couple of stores vague places that offered a few odds and ends blankets and waterskins tessannas beauty and qurrahs robes gained them immediate attention though no one dared approach most just gawked from afar we have a problem qurrah said as they stopped before the towns sole tavern it was one floor with a raindamaged roof and no windows beside the door hung a wooden sign with a crudely drawn mug overflowing at the top i have many problems tessanna said her hands curled around his elbow as she ignored the curious stares but what is yours we have no coin and no items to barter with we need food water and something for your feet what exactly are we to offer tessanna gave him a dirty smile and immediately qurrahs face flushed we are not offering you no matter how much it would gain us he looked back to the tavern if we rest for a night and then take what we want from their stores none here could stop us and if they try tessanna asked qurrah shrugged earning himself a glare and a jab from her elbow if you wont let me sleep with some lonely farmer for our supplies i am most certainly not letting you kill for them then what else do we do the girl tugged on his arm for now we go and get a drink inside the dirt floor was tightly packed and trodden upon two tables filled the right half of the room while the left was made of a tiny bar with several carved stools there was no one inside evidently drinking is not as popular here as elsewhere qurrah murmured oh it is said a man coming up behind them wiping his dirtcovered hands on his trousers he slipped past them and went behind the bar its just all the drinkers here are also hard workers and if you havent noticed yet the sun isnt even halfway through the sky qurrah smiled at the man and the man smiled back he was far older than qurrah and his face was gruff but he seemed rather amused by his early customers his hair was tied behind his head in a bushy gray ponytail when he smiled it seemed to pull his entire face to the sides and his bushy unibrow actually separated i have noticed but neither of us are hard workers might we have a drink sure thing take a seat the man took out two wooden cups and filled them underneath the counter from a container they could not see he set them down in front of them at their table my name is erik enjoy before we drink qurrah said pointing to the cups i must say that we have no coin to pay for these i still would very much like a drink and i would also like to pay you isnt that how the world always works erik said waving them off you can have the first drink free consider it a welcome to our town im afraid the rest of the town wont be so friendly to your problem though he plopped down at a seat behind the bar not unless youre ready to work for a few coins but neither of you looks like the sort to bend your backs in the sun those robes you a priest no qurrah said sipping from the cup he felt the burning liquid on his tongue fiercely bitter he swallowed as quickly as possible just a traveler tessanna dipped her finger into the drink and then put it in her mouth sucking off the liquid just travelers erik said watching tessanna you didnt arrive here just last night did you when neither answered the old man nodded see last night i heard a bunch of ruckus while i was sleeping he pointed at the floor behind the bar that is where my old bones rest and that is where i woke up to two scared hogs begging for a drink qurrah took another sip as the old man leaned closer they told me the craziest story about this girl of pure fire beautiful as a goddess and as dangerous as a snake said she just started burning and then killed one of their friends now i hope i dont imply an insult fair lady but you do look as beautiful as a goddess im not poisonous tessanna said her finger pressed against her teeth as she grinned but i do burn people why do you tell us this qurrah asked because a girl like that well she could do a lot of things that people here might appreciate might even reward them for doing these things qurrah finished his drink and slid erik the cup what things which bridge did you cross the eastern qurrah replied weve come from neldar we traveled through omn too quickly to supply ourselves adequately before we reached the delta the barkeep nodded it was a story he heard often most desperate travelers had run afoul with the law at some point in either neldar or omn and thought to start a new life in the west did you meet tory when you tried to cross the eastern bridge he asked when they both nodded he continued he moved in here with a group of thugs from mordeina started charging a toll to whoever crossed the bridges if anyone was well armed hed just let them go by he was smart like that thing is he started getting more and more money and hes acquired a healthy collection of all things drunkards love up in his little shack north of town got to the point where even those with bodyguards had to start paying his tolland the tolls themselves got much higher erik walked around the bar and to the door he glanced outside to ensure no one was nearby when satisfied he turned around and approached their table were neutral territory with the stigma of the war hundreds of years ago no country will touch us torys started taking whatever he wants from the towns in the delta and its not just food he looked pointedly at tessanna he wanted you didnt he she nodded i could tell she said i always can youre older than hed prefer erik said qurrah watched as the old mans hands gripped the table to stop their shaking but youre beauty was enough to sway his tastes weve sent our daughters south to haven but not always in time and hes begun to go there now erik had made this offer many times before to travelers passing through his little town never once had he seen such rage as he saw in tessannas eyes little pissfire comes here with men and weapons and thinks he can take what he wants she said her eyes staring into nowhere do the girls live after he is done he keeps them erik said he gripped the table harder a few tears trickled down his cheek he was too old and tired to hold them all in keeps them until theyre all used up my granddaughter she he turned and wiped his nose on his sleeve she was never the same she threw herself into the river one night said she was certain tory would come for her again and she couldnt do it shed rather die tessanna stood her hands took the old mans and pulled them from the table she gently kissed his shaking fingers ill drown them she said in their own blood i promise hell still be at the bridges erik said if hes not return and i will lead you to his hovel we need food water warmer clothes and shoes for tessannas feet qurrah said have it ready when we return the old man nodded go with ashhurs blessing to this qurrah smirked we come bearing death ashhur will grant us no blessing s hould we wait until nightfall qurrah asked as they headed into the lush fields north of town that were in various states of final harvest before winter tessanna shook her head her lips were thin and pulled tight against her teeth it was rare for her to be so angry but the abuse of such young girls appeared to be one of the things that could pierce her apathy i wont give him a chance to take another she answered he might have a girl waiting for him just waiting like a little gift when he returns with his men i wont let him i wont it took only an hour before the bridge grew within sight the small gray shapes of torys minions littered the construction they must have spotted them for at once they rushed across the bridge and lined the near side they fear us dont they tessanna asked they are right to qurrah said theyre not afraid enough not yet tessanna did not slow as she neared seven men remained of the original twelve that greeted them earlier tory did not appear to be one of them as the guards leered and made their crude comments tessanna grabbed the nearest ruffian by the throat and shrieked the force of her yell knocked them to the ground all but the one she held his flesh turned gray his hair shriveled white and the cartilage of his nose and ears curled inward to the bone on and on her shriek continued a horrific wail of death the flesh peeled off his skull and his teeth cracked free from their gums she let him go he fell to the ground looking freshly dug from the grave twenty years after his death where is tory she asked the others as they lay stunned none answered for they could not hear through the ringing in their ears she grabbed the shirt of another man and pushed magical energy slammed against his chest tumbling him off the bridge and into the water below where is he she screamed west one said he was curled against one of the arches that lined the side of the bridge his hands were pressed against his ears blood covered them if youre looking for tory he went west to the other bridge we havent done anything we swear tessanna stared into his eyes the black orbs peering into his soul did you ever take one to be your own she asked in a voice so calm and soft it seemed impossible to have been the same voice shrieking louder than thunder as the man stared back he felt claws within his mind feasting on his thoughts like a ravenous being through it all a single question pulsed like a heartbeat and he knew what it was she asked no he said it just wasntno tessanna released him and turned to her lover lets go she said do we let them live qurrah asked pointing to the men that were slowly getting to their feet only the one with the bloody ears the others forfeited their lives long ago qurrah opened his pouch of bones the men saw this and fled racing across the bridge like scared children only the one remained perched against the side with his eyes still locked on tessanna he watched mesmerized as bones flew past his face and into the necks and skulls of his comrades when qurrah turned around he saw a swirling black portal hovering above the ground tessanna stood before it her eyes shimmering purple there are shadows in the trees she said enter he did as he was told she followed him in the portal closed behind them leaving only the stunned survivor to flee back to riverend deaf but alive t hey stepped out underneath a great canopy of trees all around qurrah saw sturdy brown trunks tessanna grabbed his hand and together they weaved through the trunks and brush that scratched at their legs and tore their clothes the light grew brighter the trees grew thinner and then they exited the forest directly east of ashhurs bridge it looked similar to karaks but instead of three arches on the bottom it had five and the upper side were formed into a single triangular mountain giant stone soldiers flanked the entrances to the bridge wielding a sword in one hand and an hourglass in the other standing between these two statues was tory surrounded by ten of his men he is deadly with knives qurrah said glancing at his lover i would hate to see you cut so be careful you see me cut all the time tessanna replied she started walking toward the bridge qurrah took out his whip and followed you took longer than i expected tory shouted as they approached he seemed jovial at sight of them clearly unaware of what had transpired at the eastern bridge qurrah uncoiled the whip from his arm and let it burst into flame tessanna held her arms at an angle from her sides magic pooling about her fingertips all white left her eyes as ethereal black wings stretched from her back tory took a startled step backward placing bodies between them i said you can pass he shouted theres no need to fight i know what it is you need tessanna said her voice pulsed and changed with each syllable coupled with her wings she seemed an otherworldly demon furious and beautiful none had the strength to face her torys men turned and fled wait he screamed flaming leather snaked in around his ankle he screamed as the fire bit in deep he screamed again as tessanna hooked her fingers toward his men and hissed in a language he had never heard before screams of the others joined his own his paid lackeys fell where they stood covering the bridge with blood that poured out their eyes mouths and nostrils the whip left his leg the skin there was black and blistering and pain flared throughout the right side of his body desperate he drew his dagger and hurled it at the girl with black wings she never moved his aim was poor and instead of piercing her throat it stabbed into her left breast blood poured across her dress staining the brown fabric a deep red qurrah snarled in anger but the girl reached out her hand to calm him she showed no sign of pain no sign of injury just anger you could have lived she said pulling out the dagger and dropping it she passed by the two statues gently touching one as she stepped onto the bridge people take what they can when they are the stronger every city every land even in nature this is done but you took what never should be yours to take you took what i cannot forgive when her wings brushed the sides of the bridge they parted like smoke only to reform on the other side tory fell to his knees crying from the pain in his ankle please i didnt do anything he begged i never harmed you i never harmed you i never her fingers brushed his lips he quieted you cut me she whispered through her fingers he felt his life pass the cut on her breast closed its bleeding halted upon his own chest he felt a searing pain and the wet sensation of blood he pounded the bridge with shaking hands pleading as his bladder let go kill him qurrah said disgusted he begs worse than a dog not yet tessanna whispered she knelt close so close her warm breath blew against torys ear where is your home dog where do you keep your girls outside riverend he said in between sobs ill show you please just dont kill me crawl there she said on all fours just like what you are tory did he crawled like a dog across the grass and dirt as tears streamed down his face he had looked back at the bridge only once but it was enough to send a fresh wave of terror through him his shack was a mile southeast of the bridge it was a long crawl when tory reached the building he collapsed and clutched his burned ankle his crying had become soft continuous sobs the shack while large appeared in poor condition no noise came from within mind if we take a look inside qurrah asked tory gestured toward the door but said nothing the necromancer yanked it open and went in tessanna following on one side was a large bed stuffed with feathers on the other was a stack of barrels filled with alcohol in the middle was a large table poorly carved and cut laying on the table her arms and legs bound behind her back was a girl no older than twelve she was naked her dress torn and bunched at the waist bruises covered her body between her legs was a dried pool of blood she was gagged and blindfolded at the sound of their entrance she quivered and sobbed quietly qurrah approached the table feeling his own revulsion rising he had killed children before but always it had been quick and merciful what he saw now would result in the same outcome but far from quick and far from merciful its alright qurrah said his raspy voice only startled the girl further so he reached out and removed her blindfold she looked at him with brown eyes that were already filled with tears its alright he said again were here to help you she will hurt for years tessanna said removing the gag i doubt she will conceive children what is your name girl julie her lower lip quivered and she appeared on the verge of losing control tessanna shook her head and put her finger to the girls lips be strong now i made a promise and i always keep them youre scared arent you scared hell return i know how to fix it i know how to make things right she glanced at qurrah bring him inside julie closed her eyes and turned away when tory came crawling in bruises covered his hands and knees sweat poured from his face he kept his eyes to the floor look at him tessanna said wrapping the little girl in her arms and rocking her side to side open your eyes and look at him he wont hurt you anymore julie did look her legs squirmed instinctively closing her knees and thighs tight she was yet to speak but tessanna sensed within her a toughness that made her proud how many days she asked when the girl did not answer she looked to tory how many days dog i dont know he said qurrah wrapped his whip about torys neck and pulled it tight i could set it aflame he said as the man gagged for air fifteen he gasped through clenched teeth qurrah released the whip tessanna stroked the girls hair fifteen days fifteen days of being a toy for so many men taken again and again as blood pooled between her thighs and her bruises darkened drowning is too good for you tessanna whispered but it will have to do she released the girl and placed her hand atop the table as she whispered a few words of magic the blood that had dried suddenly turned wet and sticky it ran down a table leg collecting in a small red puddle on the floor thin ropes of it stretched out and wrapped around torys hands and feet as he let out a cry of shock a long red tendril wrapped around his neck and choked in his scream watch julie tessanna said larger and larger the blood puddle grew pulsing with frightening strength watch how even your monsters can die you arent helpless not to them not to anyone the tendrils dragged tory by the neck toward the pool from which it stretched the mans head hovered an inch above it his mouth open and gasping for air as the blood swirled qurrah crossed his arms and watched fascinated he had seen blood magically enhanced and controlled but this was something special do you remember everything he did to you tessanna asked julie as she held out her hand the girl took it as she nodded then will you be strong for me strong for yourself again the girl nodded tory fought against the bonds but they were too tight he was losing feeling in his hands and his head felt as if it would explode put your hand here tessanna said she held julies hands in her own gently guiding them atop torys head she pressed it firm a shiver went through her now kneel down and whisper to him just one word will you do that for me whisper just one word julie looked back and forth her teeth chewing hard on her top lip but something about tessannas eyes soothed her and so she nodded again i will julie said tessanna knelt down and whispered the word to her the girl seemed to understand she left tessannas arms and knelt beside tory her hand still atop his head the mans face was above the pool of blood his chin dipping in and out of its disturbingly warm surface julie looked the man in the eyes remembering how he had hurt her remembering the other men that had taken her beaten her and shouting things she did not understand when he looked back at her she saw no shame no remorse just cowardice and fear she found the courage to say the word drown she said and then she pushed the tendril snapped down torys face smashed into the pool julie yanked back her hand as blood splashed in all directions he shook and struggled his head completely submerged screams bubbled up from beneath tessanna held julies hand as they watched when he was dead qurrah pulled his head out from the blood his face was smashed and broken tessanna smiled even as her emotions faded away into apathy youre safe now she said to julie you were strong and now youre safe lets bring her back to erik qurrah said wrapping up his whip and opening the door to the shack he can find where she belongs tessanna took julies hand and walked her home e rik was waiting for them at the entrance to his tavern he had dragged a stool outside and propped it next to the door at sight of julie he straightened in his seat and a grin spread across his face heshe is isnt he the old barkeep said ashhur be praised ashhur had nothing to do with this qurrah said glancing down at the girl she has been tortured for days if anything he should be cursed for allowing such a thing to happen we all see things as we wish erik said offering his hand to julie come with me child youre from haven arent you the girl nodded and accepted his hand erik smiled and gestured to a burlap sack bundled next to him food water and shoes for your lady he said should last you at least two weeks it will last us far longer qurrah said hoisting it onto his back light eaters erik asked very tessanna said giggling at his quizzical look she knelt before julie and placed her hands on either side of her face you be strong now she whispered be strong and the hurt will go away i will julie said sure you folks cant stay a night or two erik said he gestured about people will be in a festive mood hearing the young devils dead a lot of parents here got daughters that can finally return from haven and plenty others that already buried their own would love to toast your health we must move on qurrah said digging through the pack and there we are he pulled out a pair of rough leather moccasins and offered them to tessanna she put them on and smiled much better she said might i ask where youre headed erik said as the two prepared to leave to the sanctuary qurrah answered do you know the way a semblance of a road leads out from the western bridge erik said his hand on julies shoulder follow it until it turns completely north farther west youll see some mountains the sanctuarys built into their base youll have no trouble finding it many thanks again qurrah said q urrah and tessanna camped miles past the western bridge having crossed out of the delta and into the land of ker they had ridden seletha to make up for the time they had lost and the ache in qurrahs back constantly reminded him why he hated doing so the stars were blocked by a line of clouds that had come rolling from the north fearing rain the two huddled close their backs against the trunk of a giant tree that sprouted like a lone fixture amid the great pasture what did you think of her tessanna asked breaking the silence they had shared for the past hour who the girl qurrah asked julie i like that name so simple and pretty why do you ask me this tessanna turned and buried her head in his chest because she would have been a good daughter i would have understood her and she would have understood me we could have kept her qurrah said no one would have known tessanna smiled you know we cant not yet were going to do some fighting at the sanctuary arent we the halforc stroked her hair if we must lathaar told tarlak that few there knew of the tomes existence they should be unprepared for our arrival lathaar left far before we did if he warns them then more will die than id prefer they quieted for a bit tessanna stared at the clouds her mind drifting far away hes almost there she said her voice dreamy he doesnt know we follow but he fears it he doesnt know about aullienna if he did hed ride faster hed know we chased she wrapped her arms around qurrahs neck i would have been a good mother for her she whispered do you believe me he kissed her forehead of course i do she pressed her face back against his chest hiding the few tears that dripped down her cheeks then whyd you kill aullienna she whispered as the rain drowned out her words why l athaar rode down the welltrodden path branches flashing by either side of him he knew he should be patient but the forest was nearing its end he held his sword high using its light to see in the darkness rain had come and soaked the ground the cold tried to chill his bones but he refused to let it fire and blankets awaited him after weeks of riding he was about to arrive at the sanctuary the trees grew thicker their branches intertwining above his head the leaves had long since fallen and in the glow of his sword they appeared crisscrossing veins marring sight of the sky not long he thought not long at all he let out a whoop as his horse suddenly burst through the trees and into open air towering before him were the elethan mountains shining purple in the reawakening stars cut into the stone was the sanctuary the entrance was built of wood harvested from the nearby forest and used to form the doorways and the roof beyond chiseled in the rock were circular pillars and great square sides a lantern shone from a window in each of the four towers that stretched up from the corners lathaar swatted his horse on the rump and urged her on there was a single door to the building roughly the size of a man and reinforced with bars across the front a small window filled its center also protected by bars lathaar hopped off his horse and banged just below the window with his fist he waited a few minutes then banged again after the second time he heard commotion from the other side of the door and then a voice spoke through the window whats all the fuss the voice asked speak your business so an old man can get some sleep i am a weary traveler searching for shelter lathaar said might i enter whats your name in answer the paladin drew his sword and let its light shine across his face good lord youre back the person on the other side exclaimed weve been hoping for your return lathaar heard bolts being slid from the door followed by a loud crack the door swung inward an old man dressed in white robes stood there a large medallion shaped like a mountain hanging from his neck his hair was in a frazzled mess lijah the man shouted come get his horse and take it around back a young boy appeared from further in his face was scarred with acne and his left hand a tangled mess with his good right arm he reached out for the reigns lathaar handed them over smiled at the boy and then outright grinned at the old man been a long time keziel i see your hair hasnt fallen out yet still your tongue and get in here keziel said i have a guest thats been dying to meet you keziel grabbed his arm and pulled him inside the hallway was cramped but the ceiling was incredibly high torches decorated both sides lighting the place well the priest turned and hurried past a few doors to a sharp right turn the place rapidly expanded into a great room a fire roared in a giant oven and various rugs made of animal skins lined the floor sitting on one before the fire turning pages to a small book was a man dressed in platemail upon seeing lathaar he startled to his feet and grabbed his mace which rest next to him against the wall draw your sword the man said flicking his head so his long red hair did not block his vision what nonsense is this keziel shouted put that down i said draw your sword the stranger insisted his free hand reached back and grabbed a handle on the shield that hung from his back lathaar grabbed the hilt of his sword and drew it holding it before his eyes so that the blue glow illuminated the features of his face it is drawn he said now what is it you wish from me to his surprise the stranger suddenly relaxed and he lowered his mace ashhur be praised he said its been so long whats going on here keziel lathaar asked he remained still as a stone tensed for a trap this is all just a misunderstanding jerico did you have to get him all riled up the man lathaar assumed to be jerico pulled his shield off his back and held it before his chest lathaar paladin of ashhur he said a huge smile overcoming him you are no longer alone and then his shield flared with the light of ashhur as equally bright as the glow that surrounded lathaars sword your name lathaar said his mouth dropping open in shock jerico of the citadel paladin of ashhur the more attractive of the two last paladins lathaar was still too stunned to argue as his mind tried to wrap around the joyous fact that he was no longer the last s o how did you survive lathaar asked once the two were seated comfortably before the fire lathaars armor was piled into one corner waiting to be cleaned jericos was beside it with the square shield propped atop each held bowls of warm soup that keziel had brought them i dreamt of the citadel falling jerico explained in between sips from the bowl it tasted of potatoes and broth and he loved the warmth down his throat it was too real to be just a dream i would have thought it a warning from ashhur but it was too sad toofinal i wasnt far from mordeina at the time and i assure you that was not a good place to be all the priests and paladins for karak came out in force in far greater numbers than youll ever see in neldar ive fought plenty lathaar said blowing against the steam that hovered above his own bowl i spent much of the past two years either with tarlak or the priests here ive got quite a tale for you once you have the time to hear it i have a few of my own jerico assured him but keziel has already told me much of what youve done slaying darakken eh and whats this nonsense i hear about an elholad lathaar grinned and pulled out his sword at his command it shone pure white so bright and powerful that the metal seemed to vanish away within the glow when he sheathed the blade jerico gave him a few joking claps it seems ashhur had a plan sparing the two of us although i cannot claim such amazing exploits as you i returned to the citadel after six months just to be sure no dog of karak waited for me it was there i found bonebreaker he pointed to his mace do you remember jaeger big guy hair redder than mine that was his mace i found it just laying in the grass abandoned i took it and then fled to the vile wedge killed a few orcs maimed a few goblins and just roamed didnt know why or what i was waiting for but then a young paladin of karak mentioned your name before i killed him ive become something of an obsession for them lathaar said a bit of joy leaving his eyes especially one in particular but that is for another time he slurped down the rest of his bowl for now i need sleep amen to that jerico said im glad you arrived though ashhur brought us here for a reason i hadnt seen keziel since the citadel fell and when i return you show up within days of my own arrival im not sure i want to imagine why lathaar said grinning ive seen what hell throw at just one of his paladins what does he think the two of us can handle jerico laughed ill pray for both of us good night lathaar you too jerico jerico left for the only spare room while lathaar curled his blankets tighter and scooted closer to the fire after the month of riding he finally felt at home still sleep proved elusive his mind kept drifting back to tessanna black wings arching out her back as she howled in the rain he had seen that face before he had seen it on mira come the morning he planned on finding out just what keziel knew p rayer dominated all the morning rituals of the sanctuary and the sound of worship to ashhur was constant keziel being the eldest attended the youngest at the prayers and counseled those who were troubled lathaar remained patient letting him complete his rounds before he would take him aside to talk to pass the time the two paladins sparred the ground was rough and cold but relatively flat on the north side of the sanctuary so they scraped a rough circle into the dirt lathaar wielded his longsword and shortsword while jerico twirled his mace while his shield remained on his back been a long time since i sparred with a paladin lathaar said stretching his arms brings back plenty of good memories you were mornidas pupil werent you jerico asked thought so i remember hearing all this nonsense about prodigy and whatnot some whelp of a kid five years younger than me that lolathan died healing he was not punished by ashhur lathaar said easy there didnt say he was but i remember the whispers lathaar grabbed his ankle and stretched going to ready your shield jerico shrugged i dont tell you when to draw your swords do i very well neither wore their armor at lathaars insistence it was just a harmless sparring match not a competition and he trusted each other to be skilled enough with their weapons with a nod they began lathaar slashed with his longsword keeping his shorter blade back and ready jerico parried it aside grinning as he did when the shortsword thrust in straight for his gut he had already stepped to the side as it passed his exposed skin he slapped it away with his mace so you survived all those fights how he asked surely not battle prowess amusing lathaar stepped closer swinging both blades in a high arc jerico blocked the first with his mace angling the hilt of his weapon to push the second hit down so that it passed harmlessly before his leg when the shortsword cut back and thrust jerico finally pulled down his shield the fine edge turned against the brightly glowing surface if he had been of evil nature lathaars arms would have jolted in pain but instead he felt just a mild push at the contact jerico placed the shield before him covering all but his feet and the top of his head lathaar could not see but he knew the way the paladins eyes were glinting that he was smiling i may not be the best fighter jerico said from behind his shield im probably not even good at it but im harder than the abyss to kill well see about that lathaar feinted twice and neither time budged the giant shield he thrust both his swords from one side hoping to curl around the right edge of the shield jerico shifted smashing away the swords as if they were nothing lathaar felt his arms pushed back from the contact he gave his opponent no rest again his swords slashed out this time from either side again the shield pushed them away batting left and right his swords accomplishing nothing he tried a new tactic he slammed his entire body against the shield hooking the hilts of his swords against the edge his body shook with the contact he spun off pulling with his swords to toss jericos shield out and wide finally his opponent was exposed and so was he the two were so close that lathaar had no time to react before the ridged edges of jericos mace rested against his neck you were doing so well jerico teased and then you had to do something stupid i dont know what to do lathaar said pushing the mace away with his fingers ive never seen anything like what your shield has become no one has i asked keziel as well lolathan and mornida at the citadel no paladin has been given the blessing that i have its always the weapon we hold that projects our faith and gains ashhurs blessing i guess for me ive always viewed my shield as my greatest weapon id never outlast you lathaar said spinning his swords and youll never make a mistake thats how you lived all these years isnt it jerico kicked the dirt and blushed a little you make me sound so much better than i am i have a big shield and ashhurs made it glow lets not get carried away here lathaar smashed his swords together showering sparks to the ground again ill figure out how to beat you i just need some time youre welcome to try jerico said hoisting up his shield so that his eyes just barely peered over ashhur knows its been awhile since i had some competition lathaar tensed thinking over several routines for attack when suddenly jerico lunged his shield leading before he could move the gleaming object slammed against his arms he braced his legs to stop but he was off balance and jerico knew it the shield lowered and too late lathaar understood why a foot swept underneath taking out lathaars legs the paladin hit the ground gasping as the air was knocked from his lungs jerico stood over him grinning thats to make sure you dont get comfortable he said dont think im going to sit here all day letting you hack at me understood he clipped his mace at his belt and offered his hand lathaar took it shaking his head as he stood i thought wed practice and maybe id teach you a thing or two guess its going to be the other way around isnt it jerico tapped his forehead with his forefinger i had five years of training at the citadel beyond what you were given and dont think youve fought any more or suffered any worse than i have since the citadel fell normally id try to be gentler about this but were the last we have no chance for error and no room for pride the next time we spar we wear armor understood yes master lathaar said doing his best to swallow his bruised pride come on now jerico said smacking him on the arm with an open palm no pouting and no master or teacher or whatever else you can think of im your brother in ashhur and thats more than good enough for me lathaar stood sheathing his swords and then brushing off the dirt from his clothes you going to be alright jerico asked him yeah yeah he bowed to the other paladin i just expect a bit more maturity from myself well spar again tomorrow and itll be far closer than today i assure you jerico grinned now thats more like it l athaar searched inside the sanctuary but it was outside that he found keziel i wouldnt think the cold air would be good for an old man like you he said bowing before his elder the airs cold everywhere and a walk amid nature does me far better than the dim light inside he continued to shuffle along you have something on your mind child out with it have you thought about the curse on the girl i told you of last night lathaar asked if calan cannot cure it and believes that i cannot as well then i trust his judgment keziel said but you knew this before you ever came to me what is it that really bothers you its about mira he blurted i think theres more to her than what you told me i told you everything you needed to know keziel said his eyes fixed firmly ahead shes a special girl one rarely born upon our world protect her keep her safe and nothing else should matter but ive found another lathaar said the old man halted his walk and stared at lathaar with disbelieving eyes you shouldnt lie to an old man no lie i have seen another by the name of tessanna i witnessed her magic and even fought against her she rivals mira in power and she may well be her twin keziel resumed his walk what i can tell you will not ease the fears in your heart he said and it will not aid you in choosing your next path are you sure you want to hear it i must know lathaar said i made a promise to a friend keziel sighed and scratched his long white beard i dont think even mira knows what she really is few do are you sure you want to hear lathaar nodded very well the old man said with another sigh then listen carefully the paladin did listen and when keziel was done lathaar knew a lot of riding awaited him in the coming months tarlak needed to be told mira too and keziel was right his fears were not eased not in the slightest w here is it you think youre going jerico asked him as lathaar saddled up his horse stonewood forest lathaar replied pulling tight one of the leather straps i need to find mira and bring her to veldaren whos mira you have a love i dont know about lathaar chuckled shes a young woman she helped me defeat darakken not so long ago whats so important about getting to her too long a story to tell the paladin hoisted up a rucksack just behind the saddle and began tying it on at least at this moment anyway so i finally find you and now youre going to leave me so rude lathaar i expect better from a fellow paladin lathaar laughed i assumed you would come with me whether or not i asked you jerico leaned back against one of the wood beams that made up the stall you assume wrong he said im still needed here ashhur has been quite clear about that during my prayers if you bring this mira girl here after you find her ill travel with you to veldaren the two paladins embraced i know what you mean lathaar said i hear his warnings too five days is all i ask stay safe until then and throw me a prayer or two toss me a few as well i cant imagine what need i have here in the sanctuary but if something or someone is crazy enough to attack here i may need all the help i can get at this lathaar turned hiding the trouble on his face jerico caught the look and refused to let it pass you know who approaches dont you he asked five days lathaar said his back still to jerico four if i leave now and ride hard they should not have caught up to me but if they did just be careful he mounted his horse and grabbed the reins jerico frowned displeased with how much he was being kept in the dark as lathaar rode south jerico decided he and keziel needed to have a nice long chat o nce he was several miles from the sanctuary lathaar closed his eyes and did his best to clear his mind as he rode along a faded road once traveled by pilgrims seeking healing from the clerics of ashhur it was many miles between them but mira had communicated beyond farther can you hear me he whispered in his head no voice responded the sound of his horses breathing grew louder in his ears the clomps of the hoofs were like thunder mira can you hear me ive returned his eyes flared open as a female voice suddenly pierced into his mind in a cascading shriek oh goddess help me he awoke still atop his horse the sun had set and when he looked around he realized he had traveled many miles since he could last remember he rubbed his eyes it felt like knives shredded everything within his skull the fear in miras voice lingered within him he remembered what keziel had said and his gut sank further please help her lathaar prayed keep her safe until i arrive he stopped his horse and dismounted there was no time to build a fire so he pulled out his blankets wrapped them about his body and laid down to sleep he let his mount wander in search of food and water knowing she was welltrained enough to return before sunrise the surrounding landscape was full of hills and plenty of springs ran between them lathaar thought of calling out to mira again but the ache behind his eyes deterred him he needed rest and he needed to hold faith in his god that she would be well when he arrived he offered another prayer for her safety before succumbing to sleep j erico had hounded keziel much of the day until finally the old man promised to tell all he knew once the sun was down and the rest of the sanctuary was asleep the paladin waited by the fireplace polishing his shield to pass the time when the priest finally entered carrying a plate with bread butter and a wide knife he sighed at jerico thrilled as i am to find another paladin alive you certainly arent helping me forget the worries of this world he said thats what i am here for jerico said putting away his cloth prayers arent enough for what i do i carry my shield and mace for a reason and thats because this world is trouble in trouble really keziel said sitting in a wooden chair next to the fire he cut a slab of butter with his knife and began slathering it across the bread something is coming some event that all three gods have been preparing for my heart tells me mira has her part to play who is mira jerico asked how you speak of her i guess my question should be what is she mira is a daughter of balance granted life by celestias own hand she has been made in the goddesss image our order has written of several daughters of balance and they always have pure black eyes and long hair dark as the night their mothers conceive without need of a lover and then die in birth these daughters are barren at least we believe so for none are ever recorded as being with child jerico shifted by the fire trying to imagine what one such girl would look like why does she make them he asked because celestia represents the balance between ashhur and karak she wants their war to wage eternally in punishment for their transgressions against her and her world as she sleeps amid the weave of fate she can sense turning points in time when the world would turn too far to the side of either brother god she gives her power to a mortal girl a girl whose entire fate is devoted to preventing any disruption to the balance so this mira girl shes one of these daughters keziel took another bite of bread i am certain of it i once thought that her purpose was the slaying of the demon darakken and i still may be correct but if lathaar is correct and a second daughter has been born then something far greater is at stake why would it matter jerico asked if miras was to prevent things from descending too far to darkness why couldnt this other girl be to do the same with the destruction of the citadel it would seem likely keziel said licking butter from his lips but not once has anyone recorded two daughters of balance existing within fifty years of another let alone at the same time let me show you why he cleaned the butter off his knife and then balanced it on the tip of his finger with subtle twists of his wrist the knife began to teeter imagine the left side being ashhur and the right karak he said as jerico watched intently our world constantly shifts between the two as is the nature of such a war but sometimes things are not even such as when the citadel fell he shifted his finger more so that the knife was perilously close to falling off the right side of his finger it is then a daughter of balance is born as jerico watched keziel tapped the left side of the knife with his other finger the knife rocked back and forth for a moment and then settled down into a gentler balance as you can see once a daughter of balance intervenes everything is chaotic the future is uncertain for a brief stretch of time and if a second daughter exists he smacked the knife with his finger so that it began to rock violently and then hit it a second time the knife careened off his finger to the stone floor the clear ring piercing the quiet hall both stared at the knife not saying a word keziel took another bite of bread chewing it as he thought i fear celestia has grown desperate the world may be approaching a point where one side must win karak or ashhur if this is true then mira may well be the key to victory i respect the goddesss desires and commands but i would greatly prefer ashhur to take control of this world than let it descend into karaks madness jerico grabbed one of his blankets wrapped it about his body and lay down upon the stone and this other girl he asked the one lathaar met in veldaren isnt it possible she too has her part to play for good or ill im sure she does keziel said rising from his chair but from what he told me she is far from a beacon of light she is dangerous a wild creature go with lathaar when he returns to veldaren he will need your help to deal with the threat she might pose again jerico remembered that look on lathaars face and as he watched the flickering flames he prayed that the five days passed quietly he found sleep in the simple logic that whoever this other daughter of balance was she couldnt possibly have reason to venture across the rivers to come to the sanctuary in that simple but proud building of wood and stone he could think of nothing anyone might want nothing at all but keziel could s eletha halted at tessannas gentle insistence the road they traveled had turned sharply to the north and sure enough a great chain of mountains loomed to their west the peaks were purple and red and tessanna commented on their beauty we are not far qurrah said it is only a twoday ride given selethas speed shes a good girl tessanna said brushing her side with her fingers arent you seletha the horse snorted bits of flame and black smoke came from her giant nostrils they had ridden the entire morning and still the creature showed no sign of exhaustion qurrah did not know how tessanna had learned to summon the creature but it surely was an amazing gift give me your arms qurrah said the girl obeyed circling her hands around his waist he took them and held on as tessanna nestled her face against his neck and sighed i could stay like this forever she said will you settle for a couple hours i will with a kick from qurrahs heels the giant steed galloped on straight for the sanctuary t hat night as tessanna slept in qurrahs arms beside a dying fire she first heard the voice it wasnt like the others in her mind the ones she heard and knew were her own it also differed from the calm powerful voice she heard rarely the one that seemed to know so much about her and called her daughter no this one was an intruder a frightened one at that help me please please help it hurts so much tessanna tilted her head to one side as if to listen more intently who hurts you she whispered quiet so she did not wake her lover he hurts me hewho are you she felt a squirming in her head as if this foreign presence was realizing for the first time who she was inside tessanna latched on trying to visualize who spoke with her at once she saw and she felt a similar spark of recognition within the voice crying for aid my reflection my reflection the presence in her mind pulled free easily breaking tessannas grip in her shock she had seen herself in her mind yet so different she wore a faded green dress of the elves her skin was healthy and tanned and most of all her mind was not broken and for that alone she hated her she started giggling she couldnt help it back at the eschaton tower she had smashed her face into the lone mirror of her room she hadnt understood then but now she did shatter your reflection the voice had commanded shatter ill see you soon she said a strange pleasure swarming through her body mommy said i have to and so i will i always do what mommy says and i think she wants me to kill you qurrah stirred and asked groggily kill who nothing lover tessanna said her voice warm now sleep he did she stroked his face the image of her equal locked in her mind she didnt know where she was or how she would find her but she held faith they would meet she could be patient as she imagined plunging her knife through that other girls chest another swirl of pleasure overtook her body let the conflict wait she thought the pleasure of the imagining was enough for now she slept and for once aullienna did not torment her qurrah made little complaint about riding seletha the following days tessanna thought she knew why the sanctuary was so close and within was a tome rumored to be of such power that it could sunder mountains turn mere mortals into demons and even put together the fractured pieces of a girls mind she wondered if he doubted his abilities to fix her he probably did he had begun to doubt many things since aulliennas death understandable she thought she too had doubted since then how many promises had her lover made how many had he broken too many she thought but not enough she wrapped her arms tighter around him as they rode through the day she would keep forgiving keep forgetting every broken promise his love was the first she had ever wanted and she was terrified of losing it if each promise led to death if she had to suffer pain to keep his love well my life has been pain she said to qurrah do you think that is a lie no qurrah said glancing back at her why do you ask because i lie to myself sometimes she said i lie so the voices behind my eyes will leave me alone qurrah laughed he had no idea the thoughts running through her mind she was just speaking nonsense the craziness she often hid coming out in full bloom she knew he thought this and her shy self took over her face flushed with embarrassment im sorry she said pressing her face against the cloth on his back just stay with me alright forever and always he said as the two rode on that night they huddled together as a cold rain pelted their bodies their fire should have died long ago but a gentle exhale from tessannas lips every few minutes sent it roaring to life in defiance of the rain in the distance they could see torches burning in the towers of the sanctuary the two stared at them as if in longing of the calm and warmth they represented when will we take the tome tessanna asked as she huddled with her head in qurrahs lap using his body for shelter tomorrow night let the priests be sleeping and unaware what will we do qurrah stroked her head with his hand not far is a graveyard the priests use to bury their dead im sure you sense it as well as i do there should be a few salvageable corpses there i dont know how strong the priests will be but id prefer to gauge their strength on my undead before risking harm to you or i tessanna leaned closer to the fire and blew across it as the flames soared higher she whispered her question do we have to do this qurrah nitted his eyebrows as he stared down at her i doubt they will hand over darakkens spellbook willingly thats not what i meant she said i mean me us am i really so bad my mind that broken i made a promise qurrah said and i would free you from it qurrah stroked the side of her face with the back of his fingers as an image of tessanna and aullienna playing in the grass outside the eschaton tower smoldered in his mind the price he said a sudden weight overcoming his words the price we have paid is already too high to turn back now i will not make what we have lost be for nothing but no qurrah said pressing his fingers against her lips tessanna shook her head freeing herself from his hand do not think you can make up for her death the girl said her black eyes seething no spell no action and no promise will wash it away do what you think we should do not what you think will atone for your sins qurrah stared at her waiting for the anger to melt away into shyness or apathy it didnt his guilt flared under her stare and he turned unable to face her i must have the spellbook he said to the ground give me a chance to at least keep the promises i have made and not yet broken gently she pulled his lips to hers even as the angry fire still burned in her eyes of course i will she whispered into his ear after their kiss ended keep loving me and i will give you anything of me you wish to take the rain poured down harder but they held each other tighter and weathered it as they always had t he sanctuary had once been two buildings separated by a dirt path a mile long the younger clerics lived in the southern estate while the older clerics lived and taught in the northern one after the gods war and the world became a far more dangerous place the priests had built upon the northern rooms with wood enlarging it to accommodate the younger brethren the other building was torn down and salvaged the graveyard beside it though was left where it was in time the travel down the dirt road south was viewed with pride and reverence an inevitable walk they would all someday take as qurrah and tessanna traveled down that road mountains looming to their right they could feel a great weight on their shoulders so many feet had walked where they now walked carrying upon their shoulders the enclosed body of their dead brethren do you feel it tessanna asked as they walked hand in hand not ghosts qurrah said his eyes flitting left and right nothey do not linger in anger or sorrow they hallow this road and ashhur grants their souls leave to gaze upon those who walk it they watch for their brothers and fellow priests she laughed i dont think they like us being here then they really wont like what i will soon do to their own bodies wooden stakes outlined the graveyard each one with a small symbol of the mountain across the top smoothed stones marked the graves they had no writings atop them just a single image of the mountain carved in the stone qurrah counted the rows trying to gauge the number of graves i dont know how many bodies will be usable he said when he finished but well get a hundred if were lucky were not lucky tessanna said her own eyes closed as she counted in a different way and you will get only fifty qurrah nodded trusting her judgment fifty will do he spread his arms closed his eyes and inhaled deeply the words came easily for they were attached to so many memories how many had he brought to life when velixar first taught him the spell eight qurrah smiled as his eyelids fluttered he had grown stronger since and now was the time to prove it he did not voice the concern but tessanna knew it anyway fifty corpses might be usable but how many could qurrah actually bring back and control he spoke the words driving all his strength into them dark magic poured out his throat seeping into the dirt of the graveyard in it was a single command strong in its insistence rise come and play children tessanna said dancing from gravestone to gravestone she pirouetted on one the tips of her toes circling above the symbol of ashhur as rotten hands and feet tore from the earth the girl saw the movement and laughed i count twentyseven she said blowing her lover a kiss rotten bodies in white robes that had faded gray continued their climb from their graves tearing at the dirt that covered their eyes and mouths far more than eight qurrah said his eyes still closed he could sense more lingering underneath the ground awake but not obeying he sent his will to them their revulsion to his desire angered him greatly more than eight he said again before falling to his knees tessanna twirled in between the dirtcovered minions words escaped from her lips soft and slippery at once the earth about them erupted into turmoil as bodies freed themselves from their graves pleased the girl danced her way to qurrah who was gasping for breath how many he asked unable to lift himself to his feet seventy more she answered you said only a coughing fit interrupted him he hacked against his fist pretending not to see the flecks of blood that speckled it you said only fifty here were usable he said tessanna poked him in the shoulder fifty usable that you could raise you disappointed me bad qurrah his pale skin flushed red give them to me he said i can control them the girl sent her undead out of the graveyard in a chaotic march amid the sounds of their shambling she crossed her arms at her lover and sighed im not worried about your pride im worried about you now get up before i steal away the ones you do control the halforc snarled his fingers clawing into the dirt he pushed to his feet fighting away the sudden vertigo that accompanied his stand tessanna just giggled at his glare and turned away i want night to come she said sounding so very happy i want to go play with our new pets can we play now qurrah i dont want to wait dark will come soon enough he told her trying to ignore the nagging humiliation he felt in his chest surprise is our greatest weapon no tessanna said twirling once more amid the graveyard now a torn mess of open graves and scattered stone i am w hen the sanctuary was dark and torches burned in the towers jerico slipped out the front doors he wore no armor though he kept his mace and shield buckled and ready so many years hunted by servants of karak had taught him such he walked to the southern side wishing to be away from the doors he stared at the stars as he walked surprised at how accustomed he was to their light the other priests knelt beside their beds in prayer but he needed something different something larger he slammed his shield down and knelt beside it his mace he shoved headfirst to the dirt bracing his weight against the handle in the calm he prayed his neck tilted back so his pleadings could reach the sky he always felt ashhur was up there somewhere amid the stars so to them he prayed for the safety of lathaar for guidance in his difficult life and for the strength to continue his walk of faith sometimes he heard ashhurs gentle voice in answer sometimes he didnt that night however he heard his words like a clear bell ringing in his head arm yourself the fallen brother comes jerico lurched to his feet his shield braced against his arm and his mace in hand his heart pounded the leather surrounding his weapons handle growing sticky against his sweating palm he looked all about but saw no foe fallen brother he asked the night he was given no answer his heart ordered him to remain to await whatever it was that approached but his mind kept lingering on his suit of armor piled near the fireplace within the sanctuary as the cold air chilled his skin he ran to the doors he slammed them open charged through the hallways and then found his armor piece by piece he buckled it on lathaar knew someone was coming he said as he pulled on one of his gauntlets that rascal knew it and didnt tell me i swear next time i see him im going to do more than just whallop him with my it was then he felt it because of his close relationship with ashhur he was attuned to those things his master hated more than all else like a thorn in his mind he sensed them their number so large his chest tightened and his stomach twisted more than a hundred undead were near burn it all to the abyss he said looping his arm through the leather straps of his shield before grabbing the sturdy handle near the side finished he took his mace and slammed it against his shield soft bluewhite light covered its surface just as bright as it had always been armored and ready jerico turned back to the hallway and it was then he heard the great explosion of shattering wood and metal inside his head he heard ashhurs cry of warning loud and constant the undead were inside the sanctuary jerico turned into the hallway knowing his time was short the clerics were asleep and not prepared for battle if too many rushed in they could flood the building slaughtering everyone he would not allow it down the thin passage he could see the remnants of the door now nothing but tiny pieces that had been blasted inward pouring inside were the skeletal shapes of the dead a few doors on the sides of the hall had been pushed open and from within he heard the briefest of screams this is holy ground jerico shouted bracing himself in the narrow hallway and i will remove your blasphemy no matter how many you are only he protected the deeper parts of the sanctuary his shield shone bright he could not fall the wave of undead slammed into him rushing forward with mindless energy the paladin gasped as his braced legs slid along the smooth stone gritting his teeth he pushed with all his strength while crying out the name of his god the light on his shield flared and the flesh of the rotting skeletons sizzled and burned bones broke flesh peeled and the unholy creations shattered one after another as they crashed against his shield awake brethren jerico shouted as he took a step forward pressing against the throng karak has come to call his shield flared with light again knocking the undead back several feet in the brief respite the paladin pulled back his shield and charged bonebreaker already swinging the first to feel its touch exploded every bone in its body now chalky white powder he hacked a second and a third grim satisfaction on his face from each kill he was halfway to the door and the flood entering had completely halted his shield smashed the closest skeleton once twice bashing it back so that it collapsed atop the undead behind it jerico put his foot on its chest while he kept his shield braced high before him be gone from here he said holy power in his words the boot sank inward as the undead shrieked the dark magic animating it unable to withstand his command jerico removed the boot took a step back and then peered over his shield at the door bonebreaker was ready for another swing but the wave had retreated the undead shambling out into the night voices called out from behind him the clerics had woken and come jerico he heard keziel shout the paladin glanced back seeing the old man in nothing but a long white bedrobe what is going on jerico turned to the door and held up his hand to silence them a man appeared before the entrance shrouded in dark robes deep red eyes flared from within the cowl of his cloak this is most amusing the figure said his voice was a frail hiss that echoed off the walls with unnatural strength but i did not come here to play give me the book or more will have to die jerico heard soft crying behind him as the clerics entered the bedchambers that the undead had broken into keziel placed a hand on the paladins shoulder you have our blessing the priest said with those very words jerico felt every hint of exhaustion flee his body his shield and mace weighed nothing he looked at the strange figure at the door and laughed how many undead do you have necromancer i think more litter our floor than fill your army as i said the figure hissed i am not amused a ball of flame formed around his hands jerico pulled keziel behind as he lifted his shield the ball flew down the hallway and struck his shield with such force that he was lifted from his feet his bulk knocked the cleric against the wall and together they fell dazed to the floor look out jerico shouted as he struggled to his knees a second ball of flame roared down the hallway and this time nothing stood between it and the clerics desperate jerico freed his shield from underneath his body and then flailed bonebreaker upward the very tip of the mace touched the ball of flame and that was enough he rolled against keziel and covered both of them with his shield as the fire ignited when the bright light vanished it left behind a great amount of smoke but no dead is that the best you can do jerico asked as he pushed against the wall to stand he glanced back at the priests get as deep as you can into the sanctuary no arguments not the best the figure at the door said just a warmup if you will forgive the pun not forgiven jerico shouted in the very back there is a room carved into the stone of the mountain keziel said latching onto jericos arm and using it to pull himself up we can hide within go he told them all of you now the paladin faced his attacker fire swirled around both his hands and in the demonic glow his face was visible a tired gray visage with horrific eyes he doesnt want us keziel said as the rest of the clerics hurried down the hall what he wants is hidden within the fireplace do not let him get it ashhur be with you jerico said now get your ass out of here keziel smiled but it was sad and tired he turned and ran so honorable the stranger said if you surrender i will spare all their lives even yours i just want what i have come to claim sorry to tell you this but i dont surrender jerico said readying his shield never have never will especially to someone whose name i dont even know qurrah tun the stranger said fire still surrounding his hands jerico of the citadel a pleasure two more balls of fire flew down the hallway roaring with power when the first hit his shield he grit his teeth and bore the pain when the second hit he gasped for air and felt his entire body slide back a foot the heat was incredible and he had to keep his head ducked behind the shield to keep it from being burned if you burn off my hair not even ashhur will keep me from you he muttered he peered over his shield as he took a step to the door his foot stepped on a long leg bone and for an agonizingly long moment jerico thought he would to lose his balance and fall to his rear then the bone caught and halted qurrah saw this and laughed you say youve defeated half my army he said let me show you how shallow your victory was words of magic echoed down the hallway the bones of the undead the ones not made dust by bonebreaker snapped erect they swirled around jerico in an elongated sphere the paladin kept turning kept positioning his shield but he knew there was little he could do die well qurrah said the bones shot as his body from every direction jerico closed his eyes and dropped to his side his shield hiding his face and neck the bones smashed against his legs but were unable to penetrate his armor the first barrage over jerico tucked his knees to his chest and shifted his weight he kept his face down and hidden a small finger bone slipped past his defenses and struck his cheek blood ran down his face he used the pain to focus he could banish undead back to their plane with his sheer will could he do the same with their bones in the name of ashhur and through his power i command you to be gone from my presence he shouted his will unshakable all around him the animated bones halted their movements qurrah snarled trying to grasp them with his mind but it was as if they had grown slippery to his touch again jerico shouted out his command this time the bones flew away as if a great wind poured out of him the bones clacked against the wall and ceiling all power gone from them the paladin stood his shield readied before him no dying yet he said he wiped blood from the wound on his face and gestured to it with his mace and what was that about shallow such a terrible pun qurrah said just learning from you hemorrhage the light on jericos shield flickered for a moment before resuming its steady glow did you really think your spells could make it past my shield the paladin asked he laughed when qurrah did not respond you havent fought many like me have you youre forgiven its what i do after all forgive people beacon of light and all the red eyes narrowed tessanna qurrah said remove this insect a young woman appeared in front of the door her shadowy silhouette curling about qurrahs body as you wish lover he heard her say she turned toward him in the starlight he could see very little of her but then brilliant yellow light arced between her hands he saw her eyes he saw her hair keziels words rang loud in his mind pure black eyes and long hair that is dark as the night not right he said before diving into one of the side rooms a bolt of lightning shot down the hallway accompanied by a deafening thunderclap the paladin scrambled to his feet doing his best to ignore the sight of a dead priest torn in two lathaars daughter of balance the one he had seen in neldar had come to the sanctuary dont want to play he heard the girl ask down the hallway but what if i want to play with you from nowhere she appeared before him giggling like a little girl jerico shouted in surprise bonebreaker swung out of instinct the image broke when the weapon touched it fluttering away in a thousand butterflies made of shadow jericos mind raced trying to think of an advantage he could gain against spellcasters distance was his enemy in the narrow corridor he could not dodge only brace for impact and trust his shield he knew that his greatest chance of victory involved close quarters combat but the idea horrified him another bolt of lightning tore through the hallway gigantic in size his fear of her only grew get it together he told himself help me ashhur im not sure how to get out of this one he took his shield positioned it facing the door and then leapt into the hallway tessanna was waiting for him still standing beside qurrah black tendrils shot from her fingers electricity swirling around them two wrapped around his ankles two more found his waist and then rest tried to wrap about his shield the holy light burned them away but the ones around his body remained the paladin screamed as dark energy poured into him his heart pounded faster and faster so much that he feared it would explode the momentum from his leap slammed him against the wall on the other side of the hallway with all his energy jerico lurched forward unbalanced he fell to the floor his shield leading the gleaming surface struck the other tendrils that stretched out from tessannas fingers severing them the paladin gasped for air as the pain slowly faded if she was upset by this turn of events the girl did not show it come dance with me jerico she said come play she entered the hallway he put one leg underneath him and pushed he stood tottering precariously his arms shot out pushing against the walls for balance labored breaths poured in and out of his mouth as he stared at the girl with blackest eyes you want to dance he said then come inside and dance he turned and ran further into the sanctuary coward qurrah murmured taking out his whip no tessanna said only a fool would stand there and let me strike at him she waved her hand and at once the rest of the undead began entering the sanctuary that should keep him defensive do you know where the spellbook is id prefer not to have to kill everyone inside qurrah closed his eyes and let his mind grow attuned to the darker world he could feel the spellbook nearby pulsing with a black energy as to where exactly he did not know i need to be closer he said follow me im leading this dance tessanna said twirling in front of him so you follow me again he felt his ego bruise but the girl just laughed at him laughing as she danced amid the broken bones and dead bodies that littered the hallway w hen jerico neared the fireplace he remembered keziels request book huh he said glancing about the room he saw nothing so he assumed it hidden what the book could be he didnt know given the power of the two intruders it most likely was not some mundane object the clacking sounds of approaching undead jarred him from his thoughts the sharp turn into the room was his best strategic point so he sprinted for it his shield leading he didnt even slow when the first undead turned the corner his shield flared as he crushed three skeletons against the wall their bones almost melting to its touch jerico spun swinging bonebreaker in a wide arc it shattered the spine of the closest undead then hooked upward to knock off the head of a second a swift kick and he was off the wall and back into the room with the fireplace more undead came but he smashed them one after another they wielded no weapons or armor and against the magic of his mace they could not withstand him bodies began to pile at his feet and he used this to his advantage he took a step back and when an undead stumbled over the pile he lunged forward and smashed it with his shield the pile grew larger sing song sing a song if you have a song to sing he heard tessanna call as she approached the paladin shook his head trying to shake the fear of her from his mind he had fought casters before powerful ones even she was no different but when you sing a song until its done the song sings no more tessanna turned the corner bonebreaker smashed the side of her face her skull cracked against the wall the girl slumped against it blood pouring from her nose and mouth her cheek was cut and mangled her black eyes stared at him frozen in surprise as a trail of blood painted the wall tessanna qurrah shouted a whip snaked around the corner wrapping around his wrist before bursting into flame the metal of his gauntlets glowed red and jerico screamed as the fire burned his flesh he twisted his wrist dropped bonebreaker and then madly flailed at the buckles just as a strong tug came from the whip he flicked it free the gauntlet flew around the corner taken by the whip jerico reached for his weapon with his bare hand but changed his mind when the whip lashed the ground beside it unsure the paladin took a few steps back his mind racing he looked at the girl still slumped against the wall before his pile of undead he thought she breathed but the wound on her head was horrendous her left eye was covered with blood even the iris filled with burst veins he could see her teeth through the tear in her flesh her cheekbones were a shattered mess celestias going to be mad at me he said before breaking into nervous laughter the whole while he backed away from her body he had his shield and in many ways he could still use it as a weapon but would it be enough when qurrah walked around the corner and he saw the rage in the halforcs eyes he knew it wouldnt not even close you qurrah said his entire body quivering with anger you dared scar her face he lashed his whip against jericos shield youre a greater fool than i imagined never claimed to be the smart one the paladin said taking another step back there was just enough room to get some momentum before reaching the necromancer perhaps if he charged qurrah gave him no time a bolt of pure shadow flew from his hands crackling with energy jerico braced his legs and let his shield take the blow the power of it jarred his shoulder and his elbow screamed in pain another bolt hit then another he had taken so many spells with his shield and while the holy enchanted metal bore no mark his own flesh was another matter his entire left side turned numb as the shadow power slammed against him he staggered back collapsing against the wall behind him the heat of a fire warmed his legs alerting him to its presence you are weak flesh and bone qurrah said lashing out with his whip do you know why you still stand let me show you spidery words left qurrahs lips a fleeting image of white mist rising from his armor graced jericos eyes you were blessed with strength not your own qurrah said do you feel it now how strong you truly are a lash of the whip knocked his shield an inch to the side exposing his face the whip curled back and then lashed inward burning his already bleeding cheek the paladin cried out his balance fading he tried to raise his shield knew his life was exposed but his arm refused to cooperate as he collapsed before the fire he heard the halforc speak hemorrhage he felt the rupture just above his wrist blood exploded out of it splattering across his face and chest dizziness claimed his mind that which was not occupied with his screaming qurrah came and stepped upon his bleeding wrist his heel grinding into the agony listen to me and listen carefully the halforc said his voice quiet and cruel you have scarred my beautiful lover you will make amends and if i dont jerico asked in between labored breaths qurrah placed his knee on jericos other shoulder and knelt down so his face was inches from the paladins i will slaughter every single priest hiding in this building it will be slow and it will be painful if you heal her i will spare their lives either way youll kill me afterward jerico said how can i trust you not to lie qurrah stood grinding his heel in semicircles you sacrifice your life in the hope to save others is that not how your order works does it matter if i follow my word if you do all in your power to save the innocents that cower in fear of me the paladin nodded trying to ignore the horrible pain spiking up his arm qurrah walked to where tessanna lay slowly jerico stood keenly aware of the black energy sparkling on qurrahs fingertips any false move and he would die she is celestias daughter jerico said as he took an uneven step toward her perhaps ashhur wont be too upset if i heal her quit speaking nonsense and do your duty qurrah said though his eyes had narrowed at the mention of the elven goddess he watched as jerico knelt and pressed the palm of his shaking hand against the wound he himself had created daddy she asked her eyes closed and her voice drowsy shush tess qurrah said you hurt me again didnt you daddy ashhur forgive me if what i ask is wrong but give me the strength to do what must be done jerico prayed healing light surrounded his hands pulsing unsteadily tessanna moaned as it poured into her flesh her broken bones snapped together her torn skin pulled tight she let out a gasp as dizzying waves filled her head be healed jerico told her as he removed his hand both men observed his work the shape of her jaw was back to normal amid the drying blood ran a single scar from ear to chin when she opened her eyes even the burst vessels had closed good man qurrah said he waved his hand a wall of energy slammed into the paladin throwing him across the room he collapsed in a heap of armor and muscle the halforc knelt beside his lover his pale hand slowly tracing the scar how do you feel he asked her the girl looked up at him and smiled i feel awful i dreamt my daddy hit me did he no qurrah said kissing her lips just a dream youre fine now the paladin rolled to his side eyeing a door a few feet to his right beyond it was the deepest parts of the sanctuary where the clerics of ashhur had hid if he could reach them he tried to stand but his entire arm remained numb he could see blood pooling underneath his body he would die if he lost too much more the wound needed closed and he lacked the strength to do it with his good arm he pushed grinding his teeth to focus against the pain he stood where are you going qurrah asked sounding amused forgive my rudeness jerico said touching his shield with his other hand but i should go the light from his shield flared a brilliant white blinding the halforc he shielded his eyes with his arm but it did no good when the light ended the door was open and the paladin was gone qurrah stood to chase but tessanna grabbed his ankle no she said let him go take what we came here for qurrah rubbed the tears from his eyes blinked a few times and then accepted the girls request very well the book is very close hidden where he stopped when he saw the burning fire a smile crossed his face clever he said very very clever a wave of his hand scattered the logs they rolled across the floor spilling ash as their flame died qurrah reached into the black pile where the fire had been ignoring the heat that burned his fingers deep within the ash he felt it excitement sparked inside his heart with a cry of victory he tore the tome free the fire tessanna asked the book is impervious to it he explained wiping ash off with his blistered fingers otherwise the priests would have burned it themselves he stared at his treasure it was large but that seemed its only special quality the bindings were plain leather with a strap connected to an iron buckle to keep the pages closed but within lets go he said offering his hand to tessanna who took it and used his strength to stand i must begin reading the pages so many mysteries inside tessanna kissed him on the cheek go on without me she said ill be right there qurrah so enamored with his prize nodded and let her go through the door she went heading after the fleeing paladin j ust your wrist jerico muttered as he staggered down the hallway youve been stabbed how many times and youre going togoing to bite it from a silly wrist cut silly or not he could see the veins pulsing in his arm and the blood pouring from the grievous wound he kept his left hand clamped just above the wound if he had the time he would have asked ashhur for the power to heal it but he dared not stop his frantic running the walls abruptly changed from wood to stone the hallway turned a sharp left before descending five feet of stairs jerico staggering along as he was did not notice the change his foot hit air where stone should have been and then he was falling headfirst he had a brief moment to swear a multitude of punishments against lathaar before his head cracked against the cold stone at the bottom knocking him out cold tessanna found him there his arms and legs sprawled about and his head atop a pool of blood not far from the bottom of the stairs was a solid wooden door barred from the inside the clerics hid within she knew she could smell their fear so close yet none dare come to your aid she said kneeling beside his unconscious form did they hear you come do they know it is you here she took his bleeding wrist in her hand and blew across it fire burned within her breath sealing the wound finished she smiled and kissed his cheek qurrah didnt tell me but you fixed my face she whispered into his ear but you also broke it youve left me a scar paladin so i shall leave you scarred as well she kissed his face her tongue flicking against his skin as she pulled back her lips her tongue remained the flesh underneath it blackened and burned under its touch she ran her tongue across his face so that a long black line marred him from ear to cheek my scar will fade in time she whispered they always do will yours she kissed him on the lips thrusting her tongue into his mouth it did not burn him the girl sighed as she tasted blood reluctantly she pulled back and climbed the stairs may we meet again she said then glanced at the sealed door all life draining from her face your champion is dying at your door she shouted are you so cowardly you will hide within while he perishes she turned and left not caring if they emerged qurrah was waiting for her at the entrance to the sanctuary is he dead he asked her tessanna glanced at him and then at the book he carried does it matter she asked no qurrah said i guess it doesnt they left as the last few undead under their command collapsed into lifeless piles of bone flesh and rot t he stonewood forest was a thoroughly unwelcoming sight the trees were black as coal and stubborn against any fire the branches stretched high interlocking into a thick canopy above lathaar knew that come nightfall not even the stars could penetrate the thick blanket of leaves deep within the forest loomed elfspire which had once been the tallest of the nearby mountains now it was a cracked and broken sight rent in two by the release of the demon darakken much of the stonewood forest had been destroyed in the ensuing battle the outer edges remained and it was there lathaar hoped mira waited he dismounted upon reaching the forests edge he had ridden as fast and as far as he dared and he was proud of his mount go rest he told her patting her neck the horse neighed and then trotted away wanting no part of the forest the paladin drew his sword and held it before him mira he asked his eyes closed mira can you hear me lathaar im here just outside the forest he said are you hurt hes been waiting dont come dontlathaar her voice silenced in his mind what keziel had told him haunted his thoughts every daughter of balance has died horribly the priest had said they are not meant long for this world survive a little longer mira lathaar said cutting away the first of many branches in his path not you not yet he had six hours before dark he could make it if he hurried s illy girl the big man said his plated boot still resting atop of miras head i can tell when youre talking to him right outside this forest is he the man tossed another log onto their fire they were outside miras meager home which was a small hut built around the top branches of a tree there appeared to be no markers or paths leading to where they were but that didnt worry him he knew lathaar well and he knew that he would do all he could to arrive before the sun fell below the mountains he beat you mira said her voice was slurred as if she were drugged she lay just inches from the fire her hands tied behind her back with a barbed piece of metal the man laughed the sneer on his face vile did he he never even drew blood dear girl so id hardly call that a loss he tapped his fingers against the sides of her face pointedly reminding her of the tongue trap he had placed within her mouth it was made of two pieces of metal one lay horizontal and was split in the middle so that her tongue could be pulled through its interior was lined with sharp teeth the ends of the piece were two sharp spikes that dug into the sides of her cheeks a second strip of metal wrapped around the first the lower end designed to shred her tongues sensitive underbelly while simultaneously digging into the bottom of her mouth the other end ran to the back of her throat where another spike jutted upward so any motion would cause her to gag on her own blood youve been a good girl he said crushing the sides of her face with his hands mira held in her cries best she could knowing they would only make it worse the man tilted her head down so all the blood poured from the small constant hole in her lips the contraption created youve behaved but lathaars going to be here soon he drew out a long piece of wire and held it in front of her face see the edges he asked her mira nodded having quickly learned it best to humor the man he gently ran his finger across it then showed her the drop of blood it had drawn incredibly sharp with lots and lots of teeth you havent tried casting any spells to escape not after that first one he chuckled as he traced his bleeding finger along the bloody scar on miras abdomen but you might get brave when your friend shows up im going to wrap this around your fingers itll cut you but keep your hands still and the pain should go away try to wiggle a finger or two well he jammed the wire inside her lower lip and jerked mira did her best to choke down her scream lest the contraption within her mouth tear her tongue to pieces blood poured down her neck the pain throbbing with each beat of her heart the man looped the wire around her fingers a bizarre mesh that burned like fire even worse her hands were beginning to shake against her will she had eaten too little and lost too much blood over the past week the fire on her hands burned brighter pass out if you want the man said smiling in satisfaction at his handiwork the false paladin has awhile to go before he arrives im sure youll be awake by then the girl projected a single thought across the forest before she collapsed lathaar felt his entire chest tighten as the words struck his mind kill me a s lathaar neared miras home he grew more and more certain of who had taken her few people knew of the girls existence and fewer still possessed the power to capture and torture her without being destroyed the vile presence permeating the forest from her direction only confirmed his belief be with me he prayed as he walked keep her safe and give me the strength to fight to win he would need every prayer every aid of ashhur krieger had come to finish their duel he approached her home without any worry of ambush the dark paladin had a sense of honor about him and burying a sword in his back would prove nothing and thats what it was all about proof of faith all the trees surrounding miras home had been cleared years ago allowing plenty of space to train live and play only a sliver of the sun peeked over the mountains when lathaar arrived flooding the area with shadows and thick beams of orange mira lay beside a giant bonfire her green dress torn and covered with bloodstains standing over her his foot atop her face was krieger greetings oh great and powerful lathaar he said bowing with all his weight atop of mira you almost disappointed me nightfall is much closer than i anticipated id hate to have an unfair advantage krieger was a giant man the sides of his face lined with scars without them he might have been handsome his long blond hair he had tied into a short ponytail behind his head the bones of his face were sharp so when he sneered his lips pulled back across his teeth as he flashed his feral grin he pressed his foot down harder lathaar drew his swords horrified by the blood that poured out of miras mouth she has done you no wrong he said thats why i had so much fun krieger replied drawing his own swords they were twin sabers each fully consumed by black fire he twirled them once in the air while he stared at the other paladins weapons youve managed to keep your faith this time excellent i would hate to be bored i will kill you lathaar said you deserve no better and darakken is dead krieger continued as if he had not heard a word he paced around miras body the girl made no movements lathaar could sense the dwindling life within her like a dying fire in need of wood he could heal her if given the time dead which is an impressive feat krieger continued youve grown much stronger lathaar last paladin of a false god finally worthy you have no idea lathaar said elholad both his weapons flared with brilliant white light and their weight nothing in his hands he expected surprise or worry from the dark paladin but instead he laughed karak tan my hide and burn me forever youve even attained the holiest of blades ashhur must like youor he has no choice with all his followers dead and rotting he gestured around like a grand performer before an audience this is our stage this is our arena i will prove the weakness of your god by slaughtering the last life that still clings to him like a frightened babe lathaar smashed his blades together remembering his one weapon of surprise he still carried youre wrong krieger he said tensing his legs for an attack im not the last krieger paused his entire act halted and that was all lathaar needed he lunged his blades thrusting together in a sheer beam of white when the black scimitars parried they showered sparks across the grass the contact was a test of their faith and it was lathaars that was the stronger kriegers swords recoiled desperate the dark paladin twisted backward the light of the blades mere inches from his armor the closest parts sizzled and faded gray the dark paladin continued his twist while lashing out with his right hand lathaar ducked under the attack then slashed with his longsword it cut through kriegers armor as if it were cloth a shallow cut in his side poured blood the man showed no pain instead he laughed and laughed another he cried even as he retreated again and again from lathaars attacks karak be praised i have another to slaughter to test and torment his name paladin tell me his name jerico lathaar said and you wont live to meet him it is my faith that is stronger your swords cannot withstand my own krieger halted with his back against the giant tree in the center of the clearing his grin was maniacal his eyes heartless the false order of ashhur has fallen he said chaos has filled the void and from that chaos true order will come your faith is stronger lathaar but your god is still a failed god you have no idea how strong my faith is im not afraid of you lathaar said give me time krieger said felhelad he slammed his scimitars together and at their contact they burst into giant blades of pure shadow and fire the fading sunlight sucked into the swords darkening the entire clearing the dark paladin grinned at lathaars stunned look our gods are brothers he shouted did you think one would have a toy the other would not it doesnt matter lathaar said narrowing his eyes and preparing for combat but it does krieger mocked the great and powerful lathaarstill not as special as he wishes to be not as strong this is the duel ive sought all my life this is the fight dont disappoint me lathaar he held up his fist and showed a glowing orange jewel encrusted into his gauntlet a similar jewel is inside miras mouth with a thought i can activate its magic splattering both of us with her brains kill me or i kill her lathaar readied his swords so be it m iras eyes fluttered open at the sound of battle her entire mouth ached her tongue was swollen from all the cuts causing the sensitive flesh to press harder against the ridges of the device even breathing caused her pain she did her best to ignore it for lathaar had arrived he had his swords drawn and they shone with the light of the elholad krieger was there too his own black blades pulsing with power she tilted her head just a little so she could better watch their duel the two charged and in the twilight their godblessed blades met lightning crackled at their touch both opponents glared at the other their hatred open and growing krieger took the offensive first alternating attacks with his left and right hand lathaar blocked each one not bothering to parry they wanted to test their strength each time their swords made contact their faith fought mira knew kriegers bordered on fanatical he would not falter and he would not repent lathaar howevershe had seen him doubt she had seen him lose his faith stay strong she said in her mind she wanted to project the thought to lathaar but she dared not interrupt his concentration please lathaar stay strong for me lathaar knocked aside a dual thrust by the dark paladin then stabbed with his short sword krieger leapt back slammed his foot against the tree behind him then kicked forward the two collided in a flashing explosion sparks covering both their bodies a glowing blade tore another cut across the front of kriegers black armor in return a burning scimitar gashed the inner part of lathaars arm the blood sizzled atop their weapons mira knew them evenly matched neither would dare turn their attention to her or the knifeedge they fought upon would balance toward the other if she was to escape now was the time slowly she opened her mouth as wide as it could go the spikes tore into the sides of her cheeks but at least she could no longer feel the edges pressed into the roof of her mouth and the upper part of her jaw she took a breath and then another the spell she had in mind would require no movements of her hands just the verbal components she doubted she could pronounce them with her swollen tongue but she had to try kel the first part came easy just a hard sound from the back of her throat the tiny tilt of her tongue for the el filled her mouth with pain lak again the ridges tore into her tongue but she could manage she took a deep breath the next syllable vral was what she meant to say but when she closed her mouth the piece attached to the back of her tongue gagged her the involuntary wretches reopened the many wounds in her mouth she wanted to vomit but knew it would destroy what remained of her tongue blood poured down her lips and across her chest the pain was horrible with blurred vision she watched the two paladins they seemed like statues locked in battle and bathed in light and fire the hair on her neck stood as she wondered if ashhur and karak were watching channeling their power into their champions to fight their petty brothers feud anger stirred in her breast she would defy them she would deny them their game regardless of the cost kel she whispered s o how did this jerico survive krieger asked they had fought for several minutes and still his breathing had not turned heavy did he cower in some hole as the rest of his brethren were slaughtered cowering in holes never works lathaar said thats where your kind breeds the dark paladin slashed twice with his main hand then curved a thrust low with his other lathaar blocked the first two then parried the third away with his short sword krieger snarled closing the distance between them while jamming both his blades at lathaars stomach have you forgotten where i first found you krieger asked as their weapons clashed once more cowering in a pathetic inn among beggars and drunkards and the lowliest of the low that just proves my point lathaar said shoving the dark paladin away your faith was nothing then krieger said you think you can stand against me now my faith has been tested lathaar said has yours trust me he answered putting one foot forward while rearing back with his blades seeing you alive tests me greatly krieger struck with all his strength a mammoth blow of unholy power lathaar crossed his swords and met them determined to prove his own faith thunder crackled between them as the blades connected the clearing had turned dark and in that twilight the glow of lathaars swords fought against the sucking greedy blackness of kriegers fire regular steel would have shattered but neither possessed regular weapons they bore the weapons of their gods flesh bone and will would break first each paladin fought on determined that it would be the other that felt his earthly body fail m ira took a deep breath and tried to clear her mind four times she had tried but an involuntary gag or a shaking of her swollen tongue ruined each incantation through blurry eyes she watched the paladins they were nothing but their swords now to her black and white healing and hurting kel she said tears streaming down her cheeks lak vr the spike pressed against the back of her throat tearing but she had to ignore it she forced the syllable out no longer caring the damage that might result vral she said feeling the magical power beginning to flow from her body one more syllable just one blood trickled down the back of her throat but she swallowed it too much hesitation and the magic would leave her now or never she thought now or never den she gagged kellak vralden shadow mist her flesh drained of all color becoming a shifting form of gray smoke the wire and rope surrounding her hands fell through her body as did the awful contraption within her mouth the metal plummeted down her throat and to the ground a horrific sight of blood and torn skin attached to it was a small yellow gem that glowed bright in the growing darkness her body returned to flesh mira coughed and gagged relieved beyond all description to have her mouth free of the device clever she said recognizing the yellow gem for what it was she immediately regretted speaking her tongue was still swollen and sore all she could taste was blood her fingers were a swollen mess but nothing compared to her mouth krieger had been far more worried about what spells she might cast verbally he had assumed removing semantic components would be far easier with her bound by rope and wire for the most part he had been right but now she was free she pulled the gem from the device and rolled it in her hands neither combatant knew her free focused as they were on their fight that would end no more games she whispered no more fights this torture is over she said a word of magic and then hurled the gem with all her might h e was starting to slip his strength while great was not enough the light around the two swords faded only a little but it was visible to both and both knew what it meant lathaar was about to break is this it coward the dark paladin cried ramming even harder against lathaars defenses he slammed down with his swords again and again the weapons crackled now the only light underneath the canopy of leaves i would prove my strength but you prove your weakness lathaar wanted to say something to counter with his own words but his arms could no longer bear the weight the twin scimitars came slashing in the black fire surrounding them as strong as ever he blocked but his arms shrieked against the weight the power from the blow knocked him from his feet his short sword fell from his grip darkness enveloped it as it left lathaars touch the other faded in much of its brightness no longer an elholad his faith was still strong but lathaars will had been weakened and his resolve shaken he no longer felt certain he could win and in their fight that was all that mattered krieger saw this and knew he held his weapons high gloating in their darkness the gems on his gauntlets flared i want you to know he said i want you to see just how much ashhur has abandoned this world he pressed the yellow gem beside his third knuckle as the magic enacted and he looked to where mira had lain he saw her resting against the tree in the center pure hatred on her face boom she mouthed to him as the gem attached to the small of his back detonated krieger howled as fire exploded around his waist his armor twisted and shrieked amid the blast the force took his legs out from under him and in the air he spun and fell blood pooled underneath his body he tried to move but his legs felt strange and foreign to him lathaar gave him no reprieve he took to his feet and ran his sword ready you were beaten krieger spat as the other paladin hovered over him his blade poised for a killing blow but i wasnt abandoned he said nothings fair krieger said nothings right but your death will be he slammed his right hand against the dirt breaking a hollow jewel atop his gauntlet lathaar thrust his blade deep into the earth below but it was too late krieger vanished in a puff of smoke and shadow the sword passing harmlessly through the afterimage of his body furious lathaar pulled free his weapon and kicked at the dirt coward he shouted lathaar mira said still resting against the tree i need you please she slumped against its base laid her head against the bark and then smiled at him i stopped the game she said i stopped by the time lathaar reached her she had closed her eyes and fallen into a much needed sleep k rieger reappeared deep within the forest from a pouch on his side he drew out a silverblue vial and drank its contents then broke the vial on a root beside him that damn sorceress he said between grunts of pain he could feel his legs again that was good i proved you weaker he continued i was the stronger i proved i provedkarak is the true god you wretch he fell back his hands clasped around his waist it would take months before he was back at full fighting shape but the girl was free and with her at lathaars side there was no way for him to fight a fair duel because of her you think you are not abandoned he seethed because of her you think your god saved you you cannot win by your own strength so you coddle to others and act as if they were divine intervention he sheathed his swords and struggled to his feet his legs were uncooperative and he walked as if he were incredibly drunk at least they did work however poorly if his back had been broken no amount of potion would have saved him come to me demonwail he said rubbing a red ruby on his gauntlet black smoke pooled at his feet growing thicker and thicker while taking the shape of a demonic steed the creature neighed in greeting its hooves fire its eyes shimmering ash krieger cast aside the broken pieces of his armor knowing the weight would only slow him down he used all the strength in his upper body to mount the creature gasping in air at the pain it caused ride on he told demonwail out of the forest we ride to karaks hand m ira dreamt of a field of roses the vibrant red petals swaying in a soft breeze a small patch of grass in the center was her bed the sky was clear everything was at peace its waiting for you she heard a voice say everything is well the mirror must be shattered mira she saw a dagger appear floating above her breast in the hands of an unseen assailant it twirled and then plunged into her heart she felt no pain peace pure peace flooded her as it must a shadow fell across the land heavy rain clouds covered the blue sky as the roses wilted and died she heard their cries a swan song of crimson petals a hand shimmered into view still clutching the dagger crawling upward the shimmer revealed more and more of her attacker mira saw a shadow twin of herself holding the dagger she remembered the mind she had touched the chaotic being that had heard her psychic pleas tessanna she said her voice a whisper thunder rolled through the clouds shattered said the other girl with a gruesome cry she twisted the dagger and tore it through flesh t essanna she screamed waking from her nightmare lathaars arms were around her instantly his long brown hair falling down about her face she buried herself in his chest sobbing its all right he told her gently rubbing the back of her neck everythings all right mira sobbed still hearing the shrieking of the flowers lathaar continued to stroke her head but his mind had latched onto her cry of a name she had no business knowing troubling as it was it was a departure from obsessing about krieger and his mind needed the distraction ive healed you as best i can he told her keziels abilities make mine look like a childs just a few days ride and youll feel right as rain thank you she told him as her sobs slowed thank you for coming for me the paladin nodded but kept silent about his own guilt she had suffered greatly all as a ploy to bring him to fight her mouth and hands were both terrible sights all across her body he found cuts and bruises worst of all he had let the man responsible escape mira he asked how do you know that name what name she asked wiping tears from her face you screamed it as you awoke he insisted do you remember what it was tessanna the girl said i dont know who justi know the name i think its important lathaar bit his lower lip keziel had been right the two girls were identical you need to come with me to the sanctuary he told her keziel has things you need to hear to understand he knows what you are mira your eyes your magic he can explain mira accepted his hand as she stood im afraid to hear it she said the world beyond my forest is a mystery to me but i sense in your heart you feel it best so i will go thank you lathaar said standing the two embraced lets go he told her when they separated im sure jerico will be thrilled to meet you whos jerico she asked taking his hand jericos a paladin like me he said hes a bit older carries this enormous shield you know my swords well his shield they walked and talked as lathaar told her all about the redhaired paladin who at that moment was receiving a soft burning kiss from the girl with the blackest eyes s everal miles away as the sun was just beginning its rise above the horizon tessanna touched selethas mane and whispered for her to stop she readily obeyed qurrah leapt off the horse ignoring the sharp pain in his back daylight was finally upon them enough so he could read the words of the tome he clutched to his chest will it be dangerous tessanna asked as she levitated to the ground reading it i mean stories tell of many who went mad looking upon its pages qurrah said as he stroked the cover with his fingers if this is true my will is more than sufficient to overcome it be careful the girl said crossing her arms and twisting her body side to side i dont want to see you hurt itd make me sad and i dont want to be sad if i appear to be in pain or suffering do not disrupt me he told her if my concentration is broken i might be lost to madness at least youll be with me amid it tessanna said qurrah was unsure if she was joking or not so he let the comment pass he put his back to the mountains and faced the rising sun he undid the straps around the book tossed them aside and opened it his entire body tensed and he sucked in a single breath tessanna watched her black eyes timid and curious for a few moments he remained quiet and still his eyes flicking over the page qurrah she dared ask lies he said exhaling but this doesnt appear to be spells this is he turned a page and read his eyes darting over the words tessanna watched curious but not wishing to intervene he flipped another page then another his jaw dropped as he read and his face locked in a stunned expression this isnt a spellbook not in the standard sense he said no magical enchantments protect it and it contains no inherent power he looked up at his lover it has spells many in fact but all the stories all the legends were wrong what is it if not a spellbook tessanna asked there is only one person who could have written these words qurrah said holding the book before his face as if it were made of gold this is velixars private journal telling of the very creation of man s teady demonwail krieger told his horse as they neared the stone structure seven obelisks formed a circle around a faded carving of a roaring lion before the lion was a giant pit filled with ash the statue seemed almost alive in the dim light of dusk ready to devour those who came before it without proper sacrifice kneeling before it was a man clothed and hooded in black robes the dark paladin dismounted wincing in pain from his wound he had not stopped to bandage them like he knew he should have krieger limped to the altar his hands on his sword hilts priests of karak used to meet here at every full moon the man at the altar said not moving from his knees and his head still bowed they would cast a thief or murderer upon the flame burning the chaos from his flesh when did they stop coming when did the rituals of old lose their power the world is losing faith in rituals and gods krieger said even those who follow our ways are losing perspective its been so long since karak and ashhur walked this world that doubt has grown like a plague the bowing man nodded in agreement i do not blame the commoner he said we are responsible for shaping their minds they will believe what we tell them if our faith is strong truth comes from faith i seek aid krieger told him for your wounds i am no weakling needing aid of a healer the dark paladin said harsher than he meant neither am i the other man said he stood kissed his fingers and then pressed it against the nose of the lion watch your anger it gives you strength in battle but you do not war against me forgive me i would never insult the hand of karak krieger said that is a name i have not known in many years the man said turning to face the dark paladin his eyes glowed a fierce red and his face continually shifted its features so that every time krieger blinked he would be unsure of what had changed and what had remained everything but the eyes they never changed you are the hilt krieger said the hand of karak and his eternal prophet what name do you prefer velixar the man with the everchanging face said velixar will suffice forgive me then velixar but i do not need healing i will bear the scars of my failure willingly youve faced lathaar many times i expected him dead by now the girl interfered krieger said that is why i come velixar pulled his hood tighter about his face as the sun continued its rise the daughters of the whore are well known to me if you are asking me to kill her then i must decline she aids ashhur the dark paladin insisted the balance is tilting to our favor and she has already stopped it once by slaying darakken darakken was a reckless whelp velixar said his deep voice rumbling in anger he deserved his fate and you did not listen carefully to me krieger you said the daughters weredaughters theres more than mira the man in black laughed a wicked gleam in his burning eyes there is another by the name of tessanna that is why we let them be the balance is not just threatened my dear friend it is spiraling out of control the two still have their parts to play mira and tessanna have intertwining destinies and i will not act until i know how they will end krieger kneeled and crossed his arms over his chest very well what would you ask of me stay at my side there are two i wish for you to meet who are they krieger asked standing out of his kneel the other daughter velixar said and my apprentice he is the one krieger with his aid we can open the portal and free karak from his prison i would be honored the dark paladin said the man in black laughed his deep voice an ugly contrast to the beauty of the morning amid the stones and the pile of ash he seemed as if he had always belonged q urrah had slept little since obtaining the journal tessanna remained quiet trusting her lover to inform her of what she needed to know she wondered absently if he would still possess the ability to heal her mind perhaps he would perhaps he wouldnt it didnt bother her much but she knew it would upset him and she preferred him happy they prepared a fire not at all worried that jerico or the priests might be giving chase other than tessannas wound which had healed into a faded scar they had thoroughly dominated the followers of ashhur besides qurrahs desire to read overwhelmed caution and stealth unbelievable qurrah said at last he placed the journal upon his lap justunbelievable is it what you wanted tessanna dared ask him he nodded not understanding her question velixar lied to me he claimed that karak and ashhur came here to make a better world than their own he never mentioned they were fleeing like cowards tessanna snuggled against his side locking her arms around his side and resting her chin on his shoulder tell me she said there were more brothers qurrah said staring at the cover as he tried to process all that he had learned from velixars own quill karak was the god of order ashhur of justice then there was thulos god of war they were to keep him from overstepping his bounds they failed miserably thulos slaughtered the other gods and seized control of their world karak and ashhur fled to dezrel hoping in its calm they could atone for their failure instead they warred against each other tessanna said closing her eyes and sighing as she cuddled her lover it seems a bit of their brothers blood got into theirs evidently thuloss war demons began going to other worlds conquering all who would oppose even now they conquer but velixar seemed sure they could not make it here why not the girl asked something celestia did after the other two gods arrived i still have much to read but he refers to it as the great secret only in absolute emptiness is there order is the mantra he recites but that is what he calls the truth the great secret is the quest i dont know what it is for velixar does not say he claims karak learned of it a few years after his imprisonment by celestia karaks desire has always been to be freed tessanna said you know that as well as i do but why keep the secret hidden qurrah asked the girl shrugged perhaps hes found a way one he doesnt want put at risk the halforc scratched his chin it would make sense he said ive recently found where velixar talks about his apprentices they aid him in the quest though he does not say how only that celestia must be weakened his apprentices needed to possess enormous power to succeed you were one of them tessanna told him one of his apprentices shame he is dead now he could explain what it was he wished you to do yes qurrah said feeling a darkening in his heart he glanced at his lover tessanna he said im not so sure he remains dead she kissed his lips hes lived a long time i wouldnt be surprised if he still does youll introduce me to him wont you qurrah laughed if we do somehow meet him yes i would introduce you as my lover and as my wife will that suffice the girl batted her eyes and shied away from him ive always wanted to meet him she said he always sounded like someone i would like if he hadnt died i never would have met you qurrah said then he died at the perfect time maybe hell live again at the same perfect moment the idea seemed so simple it horrified him tessanna saw this and only laughed and crawled into a ball beside the fire to sleep the halforc watched her realizing just how tired he was the secrets of the journal could wait he decided he lay in the grass beside her his arms curled about her waist together they slept as the sun rose higher into the sky q urrah recognized the feeling a cold sensation of being seen and judged his dreams crumbled and broke he startled awake his heart beating at a furious pace tessanna sat beside him tracing images in the grass by charring it with her fingers which sparkled crimson with magic the sun was high in the sky he shook his head clearing the sleep from his mind while his lover began to talk hes almost here she said her eyes not leaving her carving it cant be anyone else the man without a face i will not cower before him qurrah said clutching the journal to his chest tessanna glanced up at him her face calm i know prove how strong you are the halforc shifted the journal to one arm and prepared his whip in the other as he stood there staring about the hills he felt a chill crawling in the back of his skull he wore velixars robes he held velixars private thoughts he wielded velixars weapon everything he was everything he seemed to be had been shaped by the man with the ever changing face and now with his presence hovering about him he felt nothing but fear i am strong he said his hissing voice just a whisper and he will not show anger at seeing what i have become there he is tessanna said pointing to their south was a twin set of hills and walking between them appeared velixar and another man wearing the black armor of a paladin of karak they appeared to be talking if they saw the two lovers they did not show it they just marched on coming ever closer tessanna slid over to qurrah wrapping her arms about his waist the halforc patted her hands reassured by her presence if anyone could match velixar in power it was her at last velixar looked up and nodded at the two he waved a hand at the dark paladin who obediently ceased talking they crossed the final distance as qurrah nervously cracked his wrists waiting to hear what his master would say qurrah tun velixar said the halforc felt his heart tremble at the sound of his voice he had forgotten how deep it was how powerful come to me the halforc glanced back at tessanna who nodded her head and released him from her grasp he took two steps forward his heart raged in chaos he should kneel he had always kneeled but his pride had grown with his power and now he didnt know if he could velixar stared at him his arms crossed and his red eyes blazing the halforc bent one knee and bowed to his master velixar reached down his hand and pulled the halforc to his feet stand he said a smile spreading across his face no longer should you bow to me in my absence you have grown much stronger than you would have at my side i was a coward qurrah said my weakness caused your death i did not lie the man in black said i said i would not die and i remained true to my word and you survived qurrah cowardice or not if you had died however bravely then all i have fought for would have been lost the halforc shrugged his shoulders not fully believing the logic but accepting the release from guilt nonetheless he felt so young and foolish then not sure of what to say or do before the ageless man thankfully velixar ended his confusion by pointing to tessanna who stood quiet with her hands clasped in front of her waist this beautiful girl behind you he said she is tessanna correct she is qurrah said though i ask how you know her name even the gods know her name velixar said stepping past the halforc to offer his hand to her tessanna stayed where she was seemingly struck paralyzed by her nervousness velixar was not offended he took another step and offered his hand again as if approaching a shy animal the girl kept her head low her hair hiding her face from that black curtain she peered out unsure and embarrassed tessanna velixar said have you taken my pupil to be your lover i have she said finally reaching out and taking his hand it was cold and dry but she was not disturbed and i have taken his heart and soul hes mine now all mine are you angry at me velixar laughed do you know who i am he asked her youre the lions mouth she said and qurrahs to be your teeth again he laughed krieger he said come introduce yourself the man stepped forward and bowed on one outstretched leg i am krieger dark paladin of the stronghold i have come to see the daughter of balance and velixars chosen apprentice and so you have qurrah said are we what you expected i expected a champion and a goddess i see an orc in the prophets clothing and a skinny woman too shy to say her own name velixar narrowed his eyes and watched he had known krieger since he was a child heralded as a prodigy within the stronghold but qurrah was his pupil and his chosen he would see how he reacted qurrah reached out with his free hand his face slowly darkening youve been wounded he said and i am no orc krieger felt the blood on his back growing hot with energy in one blinding fast motion he drew his sword and placed it an inch from qurrahs throat the black flame blistered his skin but qurrah did not falter you are a grayskinned mongrel krieger said velixars pupil or not youre still a child compared to me you have no faith in karak your lacking is a stink i can smell from here i have faith in nothing qurrah said he clenched his fist the blood on kriegers back burst outward he screamed in anger and swung his sword tessanna moved between them her bare hand catching the blade her skin was uncut by the edge her flesh not burned by the fire the dark paladin stared in wonder as the girl laughed bad paladin she said no murder for you today and youre on fire she waved her hand the blood on his back erupted into flames that swirled about his entire body he fell to the dirt and rolled to extinguish the fire another wave of tessannas hand and the fire vanished the burns were mild on his body though he coughed and gagged from the smoke and heat that had seared into his lungs velixar clapped his vile laugh booming throughout the countryside ive met many like you he said to her but never one as amusing come both of you have much to hear he turned to krieger and smirked i assumed you would react as such you judge too harshly with your eyes these two will usher in our greatest victory alert the stronghold and the priests in veldaren the great purge will soon be upon us krieger stood and glared at qurrah i will tell them he said as he touched the jewel on his gauntlet to summon demonwail but i do this out of my faith in you velixar nothing else karak wills it velixar assured him now ride the dark paladin mounted his horse and then rode northwest velixar did not watch him go seemingly fascinated with tessanna you lied to me qurrah said once krieger was gone he pointed to the tome everything you told me about the gods was a lie i have not lied velixar said his face turning rigid as stone i do many things qurrah tun but i do not lie you heard what you needed to hear you have read much of what i held secret i believe you ready now tell me thoughwhere is your brother the halforc sighed and pulled his hood lower about his face that he said is a long story they walked aimlessly among the hills as qurrah talked velixar listened intently as qurrah detailed the happenings after the man in blacks death he told him of joining the eschaton and of meeting tessanna his story continued on to harruqs wedding to aurelia he spoke of the gradual change that had overcome his brother feeling shame in his heart when he reached xelraks part he glanced at velixar his anger rising karak used him to turn my brother against me qurrah said he tore my life asunder to achieve some twisted desire he expected velixar to be angry at his words instead the man looked at him and spoke as calm as ever karak used him to show you that your brother was already against you velixar said the conflict was inevitable he just drew it to a head before you felt yourself ready karak did not make your brother react as he did it is a shame to lose such strength but we shall persevere qurrah chewed on his lower lip as he thought about velixars words it made sense in a way the man in black could see this and decided to further solidify his belief tell me he said all that anger you felt was it truly at karak or was it at your brother whom you loved and cared for would you rather hate karak than your brother yes he said taking tessannas hand into his own as they walked yes i would then give karak a chance to prove his loyalty we must travel to the vile wedge i will explain in time but that is our destination but what is the reason qurrah dared ask why the conflict what is the quest that you hide so tightly velixar chuckled come evening i will tell you he said these are things that the daylight must never hear will you tell me something tessanna said speaking for the first time since they had begun their travel will you tell me what it is i am velixar thought a moment and then nodded when the night comes and you know what i desire then i will reveal what you are you both deserve to know qurrah wasnt sure if he wanted to hear the truth about his lover but he would not deny her that right they traveled in quiet until the sun dipped below the horizon qurrah was not asked to continue his story and for that he was glad he did not want to tell of his niece and how at the whim of tessanna he had broken her mind so they might obtain darakkens spellbook in exchange for a cure at velixars command they built a fire and gathered around to hear what the man in black had to say what you have read is true velixar said as the last glimpse of sunlight faded karak and ashhur did come here fleeing thulos the war god is a powerful deity and he consumed his home planet in a bloody conflict that lasted ages he now goes from world to world seeking nothing more than glorious war he cannot come to dezrel though celestia has protected it with all her strength it is why she now sleeps her power drained in protecting us from those that traverse the realms youve sought to weaken celestias power qurrah said you wish to remove that barrier velixar laughed and far away a wolf howled in agony quite astute he said that barrier must be shattered but why the halforc asked is karak somehow trapped because of it no velixar said his voice lowering no that is not it karak has learned something during his imprisonment something that i myself have shown him tessanna nestled her head against qurrahs chest as she spoke what did the dark god learn she asked chaos velixar said before order can be established there must be chaos and death karak has seen his true goal a world of perfect order i will grant you an honor i have given no other i will show you this perfect world he reached across the fire and placed a hand across each of their foreheads at first they felt icy cold and then the images came sharp and unstoppable the ground was a barren eternity of blackened rock burnt by fire long extinguished marching in perfect rows were legions of undead they were men women and children of every race from orc to elf overhead the sky was naked nothing to protect them from the searing sun over the land they marched no apparent goal than to move ever further standing amid them was velixar red smoke pouring from his eyes as he commanded each and every one of them the image faded with the removal of velixars hands the two lovers stayed silent as the last of the black land faded from their mind that is an ugly world tessanna said breaking the silence ugly i want no part of it you seek the end of all life qurrah said everything burnt or turned to mindless undead order will be restored velixar said everything will obey do you understand now thulos is everything karak needs his war demons will kill all life and then our god will follow in his footsteps establishing true order from the rubble you need thulos to free karak first qurrah said suddenly understanding you will unite the brothers with their combined might we can slay ashhur velixar said his voice quickening as excitement flooded him celestia will be powerless to stop us dezrel will be ravaged and burned made to the world that you saw and then they will continue on bringing world after world to order he pointed to the journal qurrah kept on his lap within there is the spell needed to open the portal incredible strength is required to cast the spell as well as two people i am strong enough but for centuries now i have searched for another to aid me you wish me to destroy everything all that i know just to free the dark god qurrah asked darakken was strong enough but he turned against me becoming the demon instead he buried that tome within his flesh so i could not obtain it you have it now qurrah just as you were always meant to everything is in place to bring thulos into this world i have found the final key and what is that qurrah dared ask her velixar said pointing at tessanna she is a daughter of celestia granted enormous power by the sleeping goddess she is destined to keep the balance from tilting too far to karak or ashhur but we can use her power as celestia never would have imagined she can aid us in opening the portal not even the goddess will be able to stop us the girl shied back into qurrahs arms as she heard those words i dont like your world she said theres nothing fun just the dead and the ash velixar laughed that is why you do not have to live within it once thulos has arrived we can create portals to hundreds of other worlds you may go into any one of them with my promise that until your deaths the war machine of order will not follow you can live peacefully until the end of your days qurrah carefully shifted tessanna beside him and then stood i need to speak with you in private he told him velixar waved to the emptiness beyond their campfire after you he said the halforc kissed tessannas lips and then ventured away from the firelight her mind is broken qurrah said once he was certain she could not hear i promised her i would mend the pieces you thought darakkens spellbook would have it velixar said there are many powerful spells within my journal but not one such as that qurrah sighed he glanced back at his lover a horrid ache in his heart then my word is broken once more no velixar said a glint in his eye i do not have the powerbut thulos and karak are gods qurrah karaks power is chained by celestia but he and ashhur created your kind healing her mind is well within their power aid me in inviting thulos and i promise she will be healed the halforc looked up at the stars hating himself he remembered the rows of marching dead his brother would be amongst them as well as his wife did they deserve such a fate he glanced back to the fire tessanna sat beside it her dagger drawn as she viciously slashed into her arm she was more nervous than she let on he realized only the dripping blood revealed her worry he thought of the scars that lined her arms and the chaos that swirled behind her eyes no he thought his brother might not deserve to walk among the rows of the dead but his lover deserved the pieces of her mind to be made whole i will help you he said at last and tessanna will as well velixar clapped him on the shoulder a smile creasing his face ive always been proud of you qurrah he said and you have made me prouder still what do we do the halforc asked gesturing with the journal should we begin not yet velixar said we must cast the spell where karak and ashhur first entered this world that is where the barrier is weakest and where is that the man in black grinned a bloodthirsty hunger smoldering in his eyes at the seat of the throne in veldaren i have not laid siege to it over the course of the centuries without reason with its fall we will be ready but first we need an army we go to the vile wedge you made the orcs fight for you before qurrah argued but you cannot expect them to trust you now you let them die upon the cities gates just so you could raise them as the dead i do not need trust velixar said and i do not need obedience the world is changing qurrah and we are the catalyst once they were servants of karak it is time to restore the old order of things the man in black offered his hand to qurrah the halforc bowed and clasped it in his own two hands my life for you he said and for her sleep now velixar said i will give you privacy come the morn we ride with a fading of black mist he was gone and qurrah knelt alone in the darkness he returned to the fire where tessanna sat with her dagger in hand tears streamed down her face shatter my mirror she said the voice broken by the lump in her throat not just that shatter everything he says shatter everything and still you lie still you hide and aullienna floats above it floats floats shush qurrah said wrapping his arms around her she rejected his comfort instead shrieking and flailing at him with the dagger he leapt back narrowly avoiding the bloodied edge the girl stared at him wildness in her eyes when this is over we leave she said her lower lip quivering we leave velixar we leave your brother we leave the gods and the goddess we leave dezrel and we live together just us no plans no destiny no promises you hear me lover will you come with me when all this is death i will burn this whole world to ash qurrah told her as he gently pushed the tip of her dagger with his finger i will keep my promises how romantic tessanna said her tears flowing once more the edge left her voice how romantic and how insane youre acting like me now just like me just like me she collapsed beside the fire sparks flickered into the air as the girl sang in a voice distant and lost run kittykitty she sang big dogs coming and hes coming for you with a vicious kick qurrah scattered the fire he let the darkness consume him consume them both as his eyes adjusted he spoke to where tessanna lay insane or not i am damn tired of breaking my promises tessanna so i will see this to the end whatever that end may be i know tessanna whispered i just fear the end we bring shatter my mirror shatter it down qurrah lay beside her and wrapped her in his arms he placed his head on her neck and let his warm breath comfort her the night would be cold without the fire but they had blankets he could deal with the cold he just couldnt stand the light he didnt belong in the light not anymore the light was for his brother forgive me harruq he whispered not caring that tessanna heard forgive me for aullienna forgive me for your wounds and now forgive me for this he closed his eyes and dreamt of a dead world where the mindless occupants marched forever a t long last the sanctuary appeared in view lathaar smiled relieved at its sight curled in his lap lay mira her arms wrapped around his neck and her legs tilted to one side as she slipped in and out of dreams he had done much to heal her wounds but krieger had left scars all across her body and he dared not try to heal her mouth and tongue the clerics excelled at healing he would leave such miracles to them were here he said to mira even though she slept praise ashhur were finally here his joy faded as the sanctuary grew closer he could see the shattered remnants of the front door and in his heart he knew who had come damn you qurrah he said spurring his horse on damn you to the abyss jerico sat beside the door with his mace and shield at his side he wore no armor a long red scar ran from his ear to his chin when he saw the two approach he waved and got to his feet about bloody time jerico shouted to the approaching couple i hope you had fun because i had a he stopped when he saw miras wounds what happened he asked grabbing the reins of lathaars horse take her lathaar said shifting the girl off his lap and holding her jerico reached out and accepted her frail form his mouth locked in a frown as he scanned her wounds her lips were scabbed and bloody cuts lined her face and neck her fingers were swollen and red all about her dress were torn holes in the fabric and at each one was a fading wound as he examined her he fought a shudder at how similar she appeared to the girl who had scarred his face by ashhur what happened to her he whispered inside he said find keziel ill explain once shes been healed im already here the priest said emerging from the building and i think we both have stories to tell we had a visitor lathaar the spellbook lathaar said tell me was it taken jerico glanced at miras wounded face unable to meet the other paladins eyes yes he said it was taken lathaar shook with anger whohowdamn it all he slammed his fist against the sanctuary jerico put the girl down on the grass and let keziel kneel beside her healing magic already glowing on his hands watch your anger and your tongue jerico said now tell me who did this and then i will tell you who came for the book lathaar told him of how he had found krieger and then of their battle he skipped nothing when he finished jerico smacked him across the shoulder he sounds a lot tougher than most dark paladins he said dont worry miras still alive and thats what matters as for your book well he glanced at mira and pointed two nights ago her twin showed up with a necromancer dressed in black they attacked while we slept i held them off at least until most of the clerics could escape in the back you think you did poorly in your fight he pointed to the scar across his face i passed out mere feet away from where the priests hid one of them did this to me as i lay there but did not kill me looks like it hasnt been a good few days for either of us amen to that the two stopped their discussion and looked to keziel whose back popped several times as he stood shell be fine the cleric said shes already healed a remarkable amount no doubt thanks to celestias power give her a day or two and i wouldnt be surprised if even the scars are gone whats the plan jerico asked we going to give chase not yet lathaar said i need to keep a promise and return to veldaren once miras better well begin you in course i am jerico said i think ashhur gave us a solid lesson on the need to stick together amusing keziel said now help me bring her inside unless you think she should sleep on the grass in the dead of winter lathaar how could you jerico said faking shock and indignation lathaar rolled his eyes picked up the girl and carried her into the sanctuary as all the while jerico tried to laugh away the worry that squirmed in his gut o n the western bank of the rigon river just before it emptied into the thulon ocean stood karaks counter to the citadel it was the stronghold a giant black tower with four obsidian lions guarding its corners while lathaar and jerico waited for mira to heal krieger rode night and day until he arrived at his refuge in the chaotic world of dezrel the sun was high in the sky and the young apprentice watching the door threw open the gates and knelt in respect as the dark paladin arrived home the stronghold welcomes you the apprentice said his head bowed normally he would have offered to stable kriegers horse but he had seen before the magical properties of demonwail and would not be made a fool where is carden krieger asked the brethren are assembled for his sermon the apprentice said it is the sixth day then he is in his study the true god be with you you as well krieger marched inside as the great doors slammed shut behind him the first room of the stronghold was designed with invasion in mind all about the door were perches for higher ground angled so that a trio of men with spears could hold off wave after wave of intruders farther back was a single barrier with four crossbows bolted across the top spikes protruded out of the barrier toward the door so any charging the crossbowmen would impale themselves on the spikes first the floor sloped downward so that if any went around they would find themselves still on lower ground behind all the defenses was a large staircase leading both up and down krieger rubbed one of the spikes as he past the barrier a habit from when he was a young apprentice a thief had had the audacity or more likely insanity to try to rob the stronghold krieger had caught him and at the age of nine took his first life by slamming the thief against the spikes while he crept in the dark ever since he had touched the spikes to remember the blood that had flown from them and the initial thrill of watching another die at his own hands the second floor was more ornately decorated gold weavings covered the walls showing ancient battles between karak and the followers of ashhur each wall had a marvelous lion shining gold with bared teeth made of silver what wasnt gold or silver was red from the floor to the ceiling krieger loved the room the gentle persuasion the dark paladins called it royalty and dignitaries were brought there to see the wealth and wisdom of karak if that failed then they were taken to the hard persuasion which was beneath the first floor much as he loved the gold and red the blood that bathed the floor of that other room always made krieger smile beyond that were rooms for sleeping storage and training the dark paladin kept climbing for he could hear the rough chants of his brethren every sixth day those at the stronghold gathered for worship of their deity and to hear a sermon by the high enforcer the dark paladins were deep within the chant of loyalty after that was the chant of obedience and then the sermon on the sixth floor he joined his armored brothers in karak they knelt before a giant stage covered with a crimson curtain there were no chairs just wood floor the stone walls and the stage to kriegers right was a small door he knocked twice then entered inside was a grayhaired man dressed in polished black armor a painted lion skull covered his chest made deep crimson by the blood of his enemies the man held his helmet in his hands an ugly thing with the horns of a goat curling around the sides the high enforcer stood to greet his visitor welcome back krieger carden said clasping the mans hand and shaking it his voice was deep and old it was a voice to be respected if not feared it is good to see you safe and well forgive me for not joining the chants krieger said but i bring matters that cannot wait we have time carden said sitting back down in his carved chair i have spoken with the eternal prophet the dark paladin said darakkens spellbook is in the hands of his chosen apprentice as we speak they march toward veldaren the time has come carden ashhurs city will soon be burned to the ground karak be praised carden said a great smile lighting up his face i prayed it would be within my lifetime that veldaren fell and at last velixar is ready for it to come to pass there is one problem krieger said lathaar rides to stop them and he is not alone another paladin has escaped our purging one by the name of jerico i want their blood decorating my armor when we march victoriously through veldarens gates we can send all our forces to guard the gods bridges carden said should they try to cross we will slaughter them no said krieger give me ten of my brothers and we will kill them ourselves lathaar is mine i shall have the privilege of slaying him and it is you that let him live carden said as he stood from his chair though he stood a foot shorter he still seemed a larger presence in the confined room in your pride you sought an equal fight the death of all paladins proves karaks greatness krieger not your own physical prowess the balance tilts in our favor because we are the stronger it is karak about to escape his prison not ashhur krieger knelt to one knee feeling his face flush with blood forgive me high enforcer i thought he was the last of his kind and i underestimated the danger carden waved him off and now he is with another the paladins of ashhur were a worthy adversary krieger you have not seen them in battle as i have i remember this jerico an oddity with a shield blessed by ashhur we cannot let them continue to live just to satiate your pride the old man collapsed in his chair and leaned back an amused look came over his face and his eyes twinkled i have spoken with pelarak he said theyve begun daily sacrifices to strengthen karaks followers a cloud of fear encircles the city so soon so very soon the chant of obedience began to echo through the walls just three words but they were spoken with power and conviction by all in attendance over and over in perfect synchronization i will obey i will obey i will obey do you hear them carden asked yes i do they seek a leader the old man said their faith is strong but many are young a guide that is what they need a strong believer whose skill is unmatched carden motioned to the door behind him that led to the stage give them your orders the high enforcer said lead us to karaks freedom i will not disappoint krieger said bowing deeply he walked to the door strangely proud of his damaged armor and wounded back he bore signs of battle and that was what mattered as his hand wrapped around the handle carden called out his name krieger he said make sure it is the will of karak and not your pride that guides you now the dark paladin did not reply he opened the door and stepped onto the stage as the final chant ended thirty men all dressed in gleaming black armor knelt facing him krieger looked at each face as a heavy silence overtook the room some were young brimming with faith bordering fanatical others were older than he heavily scarred and bitter to the world but a few stared at him with excitement twinkling in their eyes they were the strong the intelligent they knew what kriegers ascension to the stage meant i have fought a paladin of ashhur krieger said his voice shattering the silence and still he lives that is the nature of our enemy wounded yes bleeding yes but still he lives another has joined him lathaar and jerico paladins of the citadel their survival blasphemes against karak their very breath insults our dark god as he talked he walked about the stage shifting side to side so that the gruesome wounds on his back could be clearly seen his voice grew louder and his speech faster when the citadel fell we thought our victory complete we have purged many but the true faith is not restored not until karak walks among us again can we say our purpose has been fulfilled and he will his prophet approaches veldaren and at long last our gods freedom is assured but the paladins he drew his sword and held it before him letting all see the great black fire that surrounded his blade only carden could claim a stronger flame the paladins give chase they travel with a witch of celestia the goddess who imprisoned our mighty god krieger saw hatred growing among his audience good he thought anger was very good he pointed to the front row where the youngest dark paladins knelt you seven will be given chance to prove your faith to karak he said pointing at each and every one of them you march for the gods bridges the paladins are wounded as is their whore when they arrive show them your faith he spread his arms wide waving to the rest as for us veldaren will burn our time for war has come at last we will march through the gates and join our priests of karak as we cloud the city in fear and bathe it with blood we will fight as the prophet sunders this world and at long last victory becomes ours the dark paladins drew their swords and held them high the room darkened as the black flame flared from blade and axe for karak they shouted for karak for karak krieger beamed the shouts causing the hairs on his neck to stand and a tight shiver to crawl up his spine arm yourselves he shouted and prepare your provisions time is our foe and every foe must be beaten carden said joining him on stage he strutted out with familiarity and an aura that made all in his presence bow krieger is the new high enforcer of the stronghold the old man said his deep voice losing no strength from age you will follow his commands for they are the words of karak himself now rise make ready the time for war is now the dark paladins cheered his name and clanged together their weapons as they left to prepare the old man turned to krieger and smiled a sufficient speech he told him though your energy and conviction made up for your lack of grace it is how i fight krieger said as he sheathed his sword and it is how i speak will you come with us my bones are old but my faith is still strong he said as if to prove his point he drew his own sword and plunged it two inches into the stage veldaren will crumble like a house of straw krieger said carden tore his sword free and held it high and we will be the fire that consumes it as it falls m ira had no horse of her own but she was light and lathaars horse bore her weight with ease she sat in front his arm around her waist to hold her steady jerico rode several paces ahead scanning the horizon for any sign of qurrah and his book they had been riding for several days and after the fifth lathaar finally told her everything keziel knew about the daughters of balance she said little mostly listening during their ride the next morning she finally spoke are you sure what he says is true she asked about what i am i find no reason to doubt him lathaar said mira leaned against his chest closed her eyes and then tilted her head so it rest sideways against his armor killing darakken was my purpose wasnt it she asked we dont know that and if i do have another purpose what if she said no more lathaar stroked her hair with his free hand after twenty minutes of silence she spoke again ive had dreams she said good dreams peaceful dreams and in each one i am dying she felt lathaar tense up at her words that isnt your purpose he said you arent supposed to die i wont let you be a martyr evermoon taught me to pray to celestia she said i know the sound of her voice the dreams come from her lathaar that girl the one like me tessanna yes i think she is to kill me the path led them into a large forest where the tree trunks were thick and the space between was large enough that they could stay mounted they still had to be careful of footing lest they injure their horses lathaar guided his mount side to side as he thought over his words celestia wants you to keep everything the same he said gently pulling on the reins to slow his horse she may want you to die to prevent more good i wont allow it mira i wont let you die just so shejust so the girl smiled up at him and pressed a finger against his lips i can read your mind remember she said he nodded trying to look calm as his face flushed a deep red careful back there jerico shouted i think i upset a gophers home lathaar checked the ground and sure enough found a deep collection of holes prepared like a deadly trap he guided his horse around glad that jericos horse hadnt injured its leg when the dirt collapsed underneath it i missed you mira said missed you too lathaar said the girl turned around and kissed his neck just above the top of his breastplate just as quick she turned back nestled comfortably in his arms and remained quiet for the rest of the day jerico looked to make sure they had avoided the pitfall and as he did he noticed how red lathaar face had grown what the abyss is wrong with you he asked nothing lathaar said nothing at all well hurry still have a good week to reach the bridges this little shortcut through the forest will save us time but not much oh and lathaar may i remind you that while ashhur doesnt require us to take an oath of celibacy he does frown upon needless necking while my back is turned lathaars face turned even redder as jerico rode on muttering something about youngsters m ira stopped them when the western bridge was finally in view she had grown increasingly quiet as their journey progressed to the point she said almost nothing to jerico and only the occasional comment to lathaar she cuddled him on his horse slept at his side near the fire and did little else so when she held out her hands and ordered them to halt it was their surprise not her words that made them stop short what is it mira lathaar asked whats wrong cant you feel them the girl asked waiting like snakes jerico closed his eyes and let his mind listen for the soft voice of ashhur dark paladins seven of them someone isnt happy about our return to neldar this is worse than you think lathaar said frowning atop his horse qurrah was never in league with karaks knights if theyre here then more is at stake than we know neldar must be in danger what do we do jerico asked they could see the magnificent arches of the bridge in the distance from their perch atop a hill a small patch of trees filled the distance between them and the bridge his eyes were good and he could see waiting beside the arches were seven men in distinctive black armor we cant go around lathaar said our horses cannot swim across water that fast and our armor isnt exactly light i can get us across mira said staring at the bridge yeah i guess you might know a floating spell or two jerico said as his face perked up no mira said her face darkening you misunderstand we will cross waityou want to meet them head on lathaar asked theres only seven of them jerico said scratching at his chin theyre dark paladins not virgin squires seven is more than enough to be dangerous i will get us across mira repeated now move or i go without you the two paladins glanced at one another apprehensive about the idea but lathaar had seen mira fight darakken he would trust her down the hill they trotted through the woods toward karaks bridge they were spotted the moment they left the forest the dark paladins formed a line across the front of the bridge eager for a fight arrogant lathaar muttered no hiding their numbers and no attempt at ambush its as if they want us to fight them or turn away theyre young mira said her eyes rolling back in her skull their faith is maniacal blind she flitted from one mind to the next none are afraid they think our deaths will give them favor with the dark god i havent met a paladin for karak i cant beat up down and sideways jerico said and no young pups will change that either you stay back mira said her black eyes staring at him they dont know who i am i will show them show them what she smiled at jerico the goddess mira leapt off lathaars horse before he could spur his mount faster her bare feet were already hovering an inch above the grass an unseen wind pushed her forward as if she weighed nothing her arms trailed at angles behind her like masts holding an unseen sail hey wait jerico shouted spurring his own horse on as the other two left him behind dont have fun without me mira saw that lathaar was closing so she flew faster her hair flailing wildly as the wind at her back soared stronger the bridge approached at frightening speeds but she knew that she appeared far more frightening to the dark paladins that waited she slipped in and out of their minds whispering echoing words as she did the goddess is coming you are to die mortals die to the goddess fear my eyes my hair my fire the goddess is here she felt their fear growing and to that she smiled she had tried a similar ploy to lathaar and he had only grabbed her presence in his mind and demanded to know her name silly dark paladins she thought all faith but no courage fire swirled around her hands as she came to a halt before the line of platemail axes and swords i am a daughter of the goddess she told them as they stared frozen in place by fear and indecision and i demand passage will you grant it it is the will of krieger and of karak that none shall pass the one in the center answered while the others had long hair cut past the shoulder or tied in ponytails he was completely shaven we are the embodiment of his will and the goddess shall not break the will of karak mira laughed as the edges of white in her eyes vanished very well lets test karaks will a ring of fire rose from the ground around her blazing hot the seven raised their shields testing the heat a razor blade of whirling air shot from miras fingers slicing one in half at the waist his body fell blood and intestines spilling everywhere she turned to another who braced his shield again she laughed shut up bitch the man said the lion skull on his shield gleaming in the sun mira clapped her hands together above her head lightning struck from the clear sky swirling its power around her the other dark paladins dodged but the one who had cursed her kept his place arrogance mira thought she pointed at his chest and winked lightning shot from her finger crashing through his chest and out the other side the blast lifted him into the air before flinging him off the bridge we will not fall the bald one shouted holding an axe in both hands he prayed for aid from his dark god and his request was granted the black fire that surrounded his blade spread to all his flesh protecting him from miras fire the girl turned toward him smiling as if it were a game she remembered the times she had trained against flowers and later on the rest of the dorual even ten at a time she had won and those demons were far quicker and stronger a wave of her hand and a wall of ice surrounded her when the bald man shattered it with the hilt of his sword a great flash of light blinded his eyes mira clapped again and the horribly bright light struck them once more the others charged her fire wall dissipated she twirled blasting one with a solid ball of water and hitting a second with a chunk of earth she tore from the ground a third swung his sword at her waist desperately praying to karak that it would tear flesh instead it passed through empty air for mira was no longer there she reappeared on the far side of the bridge waving as if all was friendly between her and men she had just injured as the dark paladins glared death they heard the heavy sound of hoof beats they turned and saw lathaar and jerico riding at full speed toward them and with opponents on both sides they knew their error kill the paladins while we can the bald one ordered close combat at all times the girl will not risk hurting her companions the five charged their weapons high and their shields ready none of you are krieger mira said her bright smile fading just a bit but i feel better just the same she twirled her hands opening a portal she stepped through and appeared in front of the dark paladins before they could react she knelt and punched the bridge another wall of ice rose up blocking jerico and lathaar from reaching them mira she heard lathaar shout from the other side im fine she told his mind please trust me she stood elegant and powerful ice swirled around her hands she grabbed a mans throat and then the ice found a new home frost shards exploded outward piercing his windpipe as the dark paladin dropped the bald one stepped in and slammed his shield across her forehead mira fell her vision swimming she used her arms to roll to one side as an axe struck where she had been where is krieger she asked them as she let loose a blast of pure white energy from her hands her target raised his shield and tried to block but it just disintegrated the metal then his armor and finally blasted a hole in his flesh his body sailed off the side and into the water where is krieger she repeated to the final three he left us here for you the shaved man said said a daughter of the whore would be coming and here you are your name she asked fuck you mira pressed her palm flat against the bridge and let her magic flow into it the entire bridge rumbled on its foundations the shaved man stumbled and then she cast her second spell two cylindrical streams of water rose from either side of the bridge spinning in the air one hit his upper body while the other took out his legs he hit the ground cracking his head hard on the stone the remaining two cried out the name of their god and charged wanting karak to think them brave and not cowards when they met him in his abyss y ou know any way to get across lathaar asked as the two paladins stood dismounted before the ice wall your girl has problems jerico said as he pressed his shield against the ice you do know that right shes never like this he said shes shy and lonelywhat are you doing knocking down the wall he shifted his arms and pushed with all his might the light around his shield flared brighter and brighter lathaar stepped back and crossed his arms youre doing what oh you of little faith they heard the sound of a thunderclap sounds like your girl got another one he clamped his teeth together and grunted the muscles in his entire body tightened the light surrounding his shield grew even brighter a long crack split the wall another joined it arcing inward from the left corner lathaar felt his jaw drop as third crack appeared spiking from the jericos shield to the lower right corner not right he muttered as jerico burst through the ice wall crumbling to pieces around him jerico raised his shield above his head as the pieces fell several hefty chunks hit atop it but he weathered them with ease when the commotion was done the two saw mira standing over a lone dark paladin his face and hands were charred red and his right eye looked like a blackened piece of fruit where is krieger they heard her ask magic swirled around her hands tell me you think ill tell he said with a pained laugh she struck his other eye with a blast of lightning the man screamed and his back bent upward in a wicked jerk he gasped for air as smoke escaped his open mouth tell me she said where is krieger mira stop it lathaar shouted sheathing his blades and running to her he grabbed her wrists and spun her around her entire body tensed like a cat before a pounce lightning crackled in her eyes but then she saw him and stopped her hands unclenched the magic left her fingers im sorry she said as lathaar let go of her wrists she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her face against his chest her tears ran down his armor im sorry jerico stood over the dying blind paladin he hooked his mace onto his belt slung his shield over his back and then hoisted the bald man onto his feet the man had no strength to resist as jerico pushed him to the edge of the bridge where the rigon river roared beneath them why do you aid qurrah he asked him what has that halforc offered you who is qurrah the dark paladin asked jerico narrowed his eyes all paladins of ashhur could innately sense a lie and he knew the man spoke truth he didnt know who qurrah was karaks army marches for veldaren he said now give me an honorable death sure thing he pushed him off the bridge in his heavy armor the man sank straight to the bottom dont do that again jerico said to mira revenge is too hard for a heart as soft as yours he left to retrieve his horse lathaar wrapped his arms around her as she continued to cry i tortured him he heard her say in his mind celestia help me i tortured him just like hehe youll be okay he said ive neveri have all this power and i lost control youve fought before killed before but never this please forgive me michael never this lathaar kissed her forehead and held her tight she had called him by his original name before he had passed the trials and become a paladin it reminded him of just how young she still was and how young she had been when he first met her alone in a dark forest with only a demon to keep her company i forgive you he said pulling her back and taking her hand now lets get away from this place go back to my horse she sniffed smiled a little and then did as she was told lathaar pushed the remaining three bodies into the river feeling grim satisfaction with each one five less servants of karak in this world he said five less drops in a river but even rivers one day run dry jerico said from atop his horse he held lathaars reigns in his right hand mira rode atop the horse amen lathaar said taking his seat on the saddle behind mira e ntrances into the vile wedge were few the citadel had guarded the lower portions of the rivers when it had still stood preventing the dangerous inhabitants within from crossing by boats no bridges remained across the bone ditch the orcs name for the great chasm lining the eastern side scouts for mordan sailed down the rigon river on the west reporting to the wall of towers than stretched for miles and miles but to one skilled with dark magic even the challenge of the giant rivers proved surmountable have you even been inside the wedge velixar asked as they stared at the slowly flowing river whose surface reflected back the stars in a beautiful display qurrah and tessanna both shook their heads as they stood beside him marvelous place the man in black said smiling the orcs rule the majority but it is a tenuous hold hyenamen wolfmen goblins even the birdmen have their places all castaways from the great war they were made by the gods then forgotten when their usefulness ended but it is time to end their chaos he turned to tessanna my lady would you be so kind as to grant us passage across but im not she stared at the opposite shore over two hundred feet away i dont know if i can qurrah felt a spike of jealousy as velixar put a hand on her shoulder her and gently nudged her closer to the water you are as powerful as you are beautiful he said and if you do not know if you can then it is time you learned you are the daughter of a goddess your limits are your own to discoverand then exceed tessanna looked back to qurrah who only nodded very well she said i could float us across but you know that this is a test i dont like tests my apologies but i do velixar said tessanna laughed arent you so polite wisps of white ether floated like smoke from her hands velixar stepped beside qurrah and whispered to him as a sudden wind screamed in from the south how much have you seen of her power he asked him more than enough qurrah replied no velixar said there is never enough there is always more tessannas black hair danced in the wind her hands spread wide the white mist growing thicker and swirling around her fingers she let out a tiny moan as her body lifted a foot off the ground and her head arched back as she let loose her power with a savage cry she slammed her hands together a white beam sliced through the river accompanied by a great roar of moving water she spread her hands the ground shook the river growled and tossed and then a pathway opened dry and barren she could do more velixar whispered as both stood in awe and i will push her to it whether she wants me to or not the blocked river tried to overflow its banks but tessanna curled her fingers and enclosed it a white wall blocked both sides stretching to the sky the magical dam captured the water and pressed it ever higher despite the enormous power of the river the girl walked through the pathway she had made with little sign of exhaustion dont hurt her qurrah said before walking through just dont hurt her i promise velixar pulled his hood low and followed and i keep my promises when they reached the other side tessanna turned and smiled wave byebye to the river she said before either could react she relaxed her body the white wall vanished the roar of the water was deafening as it collapsed downstream overloading the banks and crushing trees that grew along its edge the girl giggled at the destruction she caused i may not like tests she said but that was fun velixar once again placed his hand on her shoulder and led her on truly magnificent he said i t was velixars decision that they travel by day secrecy was no longer necessary for two days they followed the river north at the start of the third day velixar revealed a portion of his plan there are three main orc tribes he explained as they walked the mug tribe is the biggest followed by the dun and the glush tribes a fourth tribe however has sworn off worshiping animals somehow they learned of their elven heritage and now worship celestia hoping the goddess will remove the curse that poisons their blood they are a blasphemy against karak and must be dealt with accordingly they came upon a crude banner made of two sharpened sticks thrust together in the dirt draped over the front was what appeared to be the skin of a wolf weve entered their territory velixar said it wont be long before we find one of their camps why a wolf skin qurrah asked as they passed by the banner the wolfmen to the north often raid their homes for food the orcs here use their skin to make their banners blankets and huts tessanna started laughing bad doggie she said as they passed by a similar banner when both men gave her a funny look she only laughed louder the sound hollow among the quiet dangerous land they traveled over the dry yellow grass until the encampment was within sight there velixar said pointing karak has whispered of them for many years but at last i see them with my own eyes hundreds of tents covered the nearby hills on each and every one was a triangle two lines stretched outward from the bottom a tree qurrah realized drawn in the blood of animals was a tree the old symbol the elves used for celestia for the first time qurrah saw orc females their sex no longer hidden behind heavy war armor their breasts were flat and more muscle than milk children ran about wrestling and playing games with rocks and toys carved from wood in the center of the camp was a tent far larger than the others with red trees on each side of the entryway how have they not been conquered by the other tribes qurrah asked that is the mystery velixar said he licked his lips somehow they have held off any and all attacks the other tribes talk of how a goddess protects them this sort of blasphemy is dangerous my disciple it changes the order of things and renders the land even more chaotic follow me we will show them their place velixar walked down the hill his arms held at his sides in an apparent gesture of peace guards lined the exterior of the camp and when they spotted him they raised a ruckus in their native tongue orcs flocked together qurrah and tessanna approached hand in hand the halforc had never felt more conscious of his gray skin he could feel his tainted blood coursing within him and for the first time he saw their civilization i could have been their god he whispered their deity and i could be a goddess in any place i choose tessanna whispered but that is not my place in this world and these huts are not yours a wall of spears surrounded them velixar halted his hands still held high and wide his hood had fallen low to cover his eyes but beneath lingered his smile beyond the ring of orcs qurrah saw women holding their young watching he was shocked when he realized many of them were praying a particularly large orc broke through the ring and shouted at velixar in the orcish tongue the man in black laughed and then spoke back in the same guttural language the orc seemed surprised at this and began questioning those around him what is going on qurrah asked before velixar could answer the big one turned toward the giant tent and shouted the same word three times darnela darnela darnela darnela tessanna asked at last i understand velixar said his grin growing an elf priestess of celestia came and tamed them shes filled their head with dogma of forgiveness and pathetic begging in hopes of revoking of their orcish blood keep ready both of you i find it unlikely we will get along in the distance they saw a sleek feminine form exit the main tent she wore a cloak made of wolf skin her tunic and breeches were made of leather she carried a scepter in one hand and a jeweled sphere in the other she seemed a strange cross of elf and orc elegance and roughness all throughout the camp orcs parted to grant her passage bowing their heads as she passed shes beautiful tessanna said yes velixar said and as dangerous as she is beautiful i know this one she has changed her name since we last met qurrah felt his whip curling on his arm bits of flame flickering from it even though he gave it no such order tessanna chewed on her fingernails as the girl approached she had long hair so long that it floated past the small of her back and beyond the length of her wolf head cloak it was a dark brown the same color as her eyes when she saw velixar a frown marred her beautiful face the last of the orcs parted and she stood before the trespassers to her camp greetings fionn velixar said bowing low it has been too long since we last met the scepter shook in the elven priestesss hand i am darnela now she said do you bring your war and hatred to my orcs they seek peace dark prophet and forgiveness from the goddess we are not interested in whatever sins you bring your name used to be beautiful and pure velixar said ignoring her question yet you now claim a name meaning war and anger all while preaching peace to the orcs celestias cursed and abandoned qurrah winced as the whip tightened so much that his fingers tingled from the pressure he dared not remove it though not with so many orcs with spears and swords desperate to attack be gone she said karaks taint is leaving their blood we all see it plain as day indeed velixar said still grinning thetaintis leaving darnela took a step closer glaring at the visage beneath the black hood i swore to kill you and i did she said celestia forgive me for thinking you would give dezrel a gift and stay dead now leave qurrah velixar suddenly shouted show our beautiful hostess here your weapon slowly the halforc let the whip uncurl and fall into his hand the leather pooled upon the grass and then burst into flame he watched darnelas face and he saw her rage grow all around the wall of orcs grew larger as guards from every corner of the camp gathered i also made a promise velixar said i would use your husbands whip to return the favor for what you did to me but not yet you think these orcs your pets you think they believe what you feed their minds i speak the truth darnela and even these shallow beings can feel and understand that he turned his back to her and gestured to the crowd his voice boomed impossibly loud every word he spoke thundering in the ears of those who heard orcs of the wedge hear me i am velixar and i speak with the voice of karak himself silence darnela shouted the man in black turned and glared at her for a moment they stared their eyes locked when the priestess did not attack velixar continued his shouting qurrah noticed he shouted in the common tongue of man yet the orcs appeared to understand what you have been told is true you were once elves you were cursed by the elven goddess but that curse did not make you what you are today karak gave you the strength that saved you from extinction karak bound you together for war and through him you crushed your enemies and fought for a place in this world you feel that strength fading now dont you it is celestia who cursed you celestia who abandoned you and now you cry out to her like a dog licking the boot that just kicked it all around orcs began shouting some in defiance of what he said others in response to their old bloodlust stirring as qurrah looked around he could see velixar spoke truth few orcs were as muscled as the orcs he had watched assault veldaren years ago do not listen darnela shouted magically strengthening her own voice as well he is a speaker of lies a preacher of death he would make you kill for his own gains and when you died he would bring back your bones to fight again he is chaos he is slaughter and he is the reason your kind was first cursed by the goddess more shouting more posturing with crude weapons tessanna clutched tightly to qurrahs waist as she glanced about im scared she said her face buried into his shoulder just stupid beasts with sticks qurrah told her you can defeat every one of them with a lift of your finger but theyre all scared she said theyre hurt theyre confused and they dont know what to believe the goddess weeps for them qurrah cant you hear it i come offering what your kind has always embraced velixar continued i offer you war against those who drove you to this wretched land you act as if your blood is a curse but i call it a boon embrace your strength embrace your bloodlust darnela seeks only to pacify you and make you weak he lies darnela shouted remember her own lessons let them show my truth she wanted you to throw down your weapons end your fighting and turn away from all you once knew you are a stones throw away from being massacred by wolfmen hyenamen even the weakest of the goblin tribes the elves have always wanted you dead they know they cannot do it in war but if they poison you from within look at yourselves warriors of karak look at yourselves tessanna began to weep as a deep rumbling swept the camp darnela herself sensed the change she had worked valiantly to redeem the souls to the goddess she had preached over and over forgiveness and humility and now at the booming words of the man in black it would crumble you will die one day the elf said to him and when that day comes i hope to look down from celestias paradise and laugh at your torment in the fire and darkness should that day come velixar said his voice back to its normal volume i will rule as a prince and even there i will seek to break the will of the goddess and storm your wretched home make them stop tessanna whimpered please qurrah make them stop you will be buried underneath a wave of those you sought to make docile velixar said he smirked at darnelas anger fitting dont you agree the priestess slammed her scepter and orb together flames consumed both and a yellow pillar of fire fell from the sky orcs scrambled away as the pillar consumed her swirling about her body as she prayed ceaselessly to her goddess kneel to me velixar shouted all who bow and confess their lives to karak will live those who refuse will die by my hand dark magic swirled around his hands he kissed the air as darnela prepared her assault hold yourself together qurrah said grabbing his lover by the arms what is the matter with you no tessanna screamed shoving him aside she leapt in between velixar and darnela her right hand faced the elf the left pointed directly at the man in black she looked each in the eye as the orcs cried out in anger and confusion pure magical essence curled around her fingers throbbing with her heartbeat if either of you moves i will leave nothing but dust for the wind to spread she said wisps of black smoke floated from the corners of her eyes of course my lady velixar said seeming unsurprised by her actions are you mad girl darnela asked her hair danced inside her pillar of fire do you know what he is you travel with him yet still defy his will i dont need to know she answered let those who believe velixars words leave your camp in peace the rest may stay under your command is this clear i accept your proposal velixar said bowing not your command for the first time a bit of anger flickered in his eyes but tessanna was unconcerned she looked to the elf as the magic on her fingers crackled with dark lightning do you accept she asked her you are a disgrace to the goddess darnela said her jaw clenched tight but i will accept take the faithless and go velixar looked around the camp almost half the orcs knelt their heads bowed as the others nearby beat them and cursed the prayers they prayed the man in black lifted his hands and called out to them come east children of karak abandon your weakness for it is your blood that shall unite the tribes against neldar hundreds of orcs took up their possessions and did as they were told tessanna remained between the two powerful casters until the stream of orcs had fully left the camp i will see you again darnela velixar said as he bowed i still have a favor to repay you the priestess only turned and stormed off the pillar of flame dissipating into fading embers in the air when she was far enough away tessanna closed her hands and let go of the spells she had prepared velixar immediately grabbed her by the wrist we will talk he said his red eyes seething i know she replied almost casually he let her go and stormed away qurrah took her in his arms holding her as her resolve vanished shush he said stroking her hair as he guided her east you did no wrong here i know she said drying her tears against his robe but i risk what we have when i do this he needs me and he needs you but hes patient qurrah so patient so dangerous whyd you do it then he asked her she looked up to him kissed his lips and then held his hand as they walked she did not answer very well qurrah said i do not need to know the reason i will still defend your choice to my death i know she said gripping his hand tighter but its good to hear you say it anyway v elixar was no stranger to leading armies especially one made of orcs they had little supplies no food and over three hundred mouths to feed if they were to survive they had to pillage he marched throughout his small army shouting and encouraging he knew he needed a warchief so he looked for the biggest and the strongest he found his perfect candidate in a one armed mountain of muscle named gumgog his eyes were yellow and his nose flattened upward like a pig celly wanted us to be nice he said when velixar asked why he left darnelas camp gumgog dont like to be nice gumgog like smashing so you let me smash me lead like you say velixar grinned liking the orc already where his arm had once been was now a giant club with a stone tied to the end to call attention to himself gumgog took the second arm in his other hand and used his entire body to slam it to the ground gumgog speak he shouted and all around orcs quit their squabbles to listen velixar laughed he had traveled with several warchiefs some appointed by him others already in power when he enlisted their service he easily liked gumgog the most we going to the mugs gumgog shouted to the three hundred we going to make them help us maybe swear allegiance to us then we go to the duns and the glushes and make them do the same we make an army and we follow the human in black all hear me when an orc near him raised a hand to speak gumgog gripped his giant club and swung in a great heaving motion that used his entire waist and chest the stone connected against the orcs skull with a giant crack the limp body flew ten feet before crumpling along the grass any others need help hearing me gumgog bellowed no help needed all understood w e can travel at least a day without food velixar said as he joined qurrah and tessanna by their fire ive got several hunting and butchering any animals we find but the wedge is pitiful for living off the land however that should buy us time until we reach the first of the mug camps who leads them qurrah asked lummug velixar said at least he did last i was here you never know with orcs do you the man in black chuckled no and you never know about how children of a goddess will react either you cost me troops tessanna even worse you went against my will i never swore my life to you tessanna said she sounded sleepy and her eyes drooped as she stared at the fire i swore it to qurrah and how many troops did you lose a hundred two velixar narrowed his eyes those that died i would have brought back he said at least six hundred would march by my side how many orcs are there in all the tribes tessanna asked how many thousands you whine like a child she laid her head against qurrahs shoulder and closed her eyes the halforc looked to his master trying to gauge how much of his anger was truth and how much was bluster he doubted velixar had ever been challenged as he had been by tessanna will the other tribes swear allegiance to you qurrah asked hoping to shift the topic of the conversation in times past i have enlisted the aid of their warchief to keep the orcs in line the time for such trickery is past the orcs will swear their loyalty to me and karak or they will die he pointedly looked at tessanna does that please our princess the girl smiled yes master but dont worry about pleasing me im here to please you isnt that right qurrah the halforc stammered an unintelligible response tessanna laughed and buried her face into his robes velixar stood and turned his back to them and in the light of the fire he seemed a hunched angered demon sleep well the mug tribe will not follow not until we show them our strength you will kill tomorrow both of you be ready for it yes master qurrah said and qurrah velixar shifted his head there is a world beyond you and your lover never forget that he left them to the dwindling light of the fire t essannas arms were empty when she awoke she pushed herself up on her elbow and glanced around the morning was still early with only a sliver of the sun climbing above the horizon the orcs were still asleep qurrah she asked rubbing away the tiredness from her eyes she saw a hunched form far from the camp sitting crosslegged with his back to her she stood pulled her thin clothing tight about her and started walking in the cold she could easily see her breath the sky was gray and overcast she wondered if it would snow the lone figure shifted and as she neared she could see it was qurrah busy reading velixars journal her slender mouth frowned at the sight of him cold and shivering with the book on his lap you should be by a fire she told him the halforc looked up from his reading the cold helps me focus he said velixar was right tessanna that damn specters always been right she sat beside him and wrapped an arm around his waist whats bothering you love ive become passive he said slamming the book shut i do as commanded as expected i disappoint him thats easy to fix she said brushing away his bangs to kiss his forehead take charge give your opinion whether he wants it or not you are no fool and no weakling even the wisest would listen to your advice i plan on doing more than that qurrah said as they stood together much more he returned to the camp in her heart she wanted to follow but she knew qurrah needed to find the answer on his own the life he had shared with velixar was unknown to her so she stayed and watched the sun rise letting the little warmth it offered seep into her pale skin and sad black eyes north of the camp velixar waited also watching the rise of the sun he sensed qurrahs approach but did not acknowledge him where is the next camp qurrah asked the man in black crossed his arms and remained quiet i asked where is it several miles north about four hundred orcs just a pittance of the mug tribes numbers why do you ask when we arrive i will recruit them i know what will make them bow i have led many armies qurrah velixar said raising an eyebrow and i have had thousands of orcs swear allegiance as my puppets have you i have the blood of orcs in my veins the halforc said and i will make them respect it they will swear to you all of them they will swear to karak velixar corrected i dont care i dont do this for him the man in black chuckled and gestured back to the camp yes i know you do it for her for tessanna whether she wants it or not she does qurrah insisted how many will you kill to heal her mind velixar continued you would sacrifice this entire world just for that and what happens qurrah what happens when karak comes and rids her of the child of the apathy of the wild animal will you recognize the girl that remains will the lives you have ruined be justified the halforc glared at velixar meeting the burning red eyes without fear you question what i do you question the very acts you yourself wish me to commit it is not the end qurrah it is the means that matters velixar insisted it is what we do every bit of it that defines who we are i do not want you as my disciple if your allegiance to karak is only of convenience he quieted as he turned back to the sunrise qurrah looked to the ground remembering what he had told his brother when he questioned their killing of children take pride in everything you do he had told him so did he take pride in what he did now marching alongside orcs in a campaign to release a war god into his world you were so promising velixar said breaking their silence for a time you saw what karak offered everything you have now karak gave you all you desired was power and the skill to use it and i gave you both in my absence you lost your way youve succumbed to womanly flesh forgetting that it is a pleasure not a purpose what is it you want from me qurrah asked velixar turned and the force in his eyes sent qurrah to one knee i want you at my side but not for her not to mend a mind that is beautiful in its chaos i want you to relish and worship every second of what you and i are and what we are meant to do you once relished the thought of neldar burning i want you to feel that excitement once more what of my brother qurrah dared asked ashhur has corrupted him i made a choice him or you you were always my disciple and he your bodyguard without you i have no need of him so i chose you the halforc stood a sudden fear piercing his gut he met velixars gaze what do you mean you made a choice he asked his voice nearly shaking with kindling rage i killed harruqs child he said each word pierced qurrah like a burning arrow i sent her into the woods and told her to play it needed to be done you qurrah said his fists shaking you turned my brother against me you tore apart our lives like we were your playthings i did it with a heavy heart velixar shouted back i had to make you see what you yourself were in danger of becoming harruq turned his back on karak i would not lose you as well a terrible silence fell between them qurrah felt all he knew flailing in a cyclone he remembered the pain on tessannas face and how she had shrieked against him in her sorrow do you understand now velixar asked aullienna died because you thought of nothing else but your lover you felt your end justified your means but the truth is your actions should justify themselves i will kill thousands but i do it for my god without remorse without pity you will kill as many but what phantom do you do it for you think me a disappointment qurrah said his soft voice gradually rising in anger and volume but i will show you the strength i have gained when we reach the camp i will make them bow and serve karak i will not cheapen my sacrifices velixar i will not regret what i have done he stormed off the man in black watched him go his calm facade turning into pride welcome back qurrah he whispered to the morning air tessanna found him an hour later marching north with nothing but his whip and velixars journal his breath was labored and weak and his stride unsteady but his eyes were wide with fury and determination why did you leave me she asked him as she dismounted from seletha do you want what i have offered qurrah said whirling on her and grabbing her shoulders do you truly want your mind made whole i want what you want she said shying away from him no qurrah shouted not caring that he spit blood as he did what is it that you want do you want me to change what you are the girl bit her lip and shook her head i like myself qurrah i thought you liked me too the halforc collapsed to the ground and buried his face in his hands then what is it you want he asked for what reason can i justify the massacre of thousands i was to sacrifice this world for you tessanna i still will but i march with the murderer of my brothers daughter karak has guided my life as if i am a pet trained to fight and kill but for what reason the shyness vanished as tessanna heard his words velixar killed aullienna she asked the halforc nodded she knelt down and pulled his face up so they could look eye to eye do you know what i want she asked tears filled her eyes as he shook his head i want to live in a world where i dont feel my mother watching every step i make preparing me for a fate i dont want i want to live where no god will meddle in our lives and kill those we love to ensure our paths how qurrah asked i would accept that so desperately but how velixar offered us escape she said thulos can send us away from dezrel we keep our promise and he keeps his that is what i want but what we do is it wrong tessanna crossed her arms and frowned at him since when do you care about right and wrong too many people are suffering i dont want us to be one of them the halforc reached out and this time she did not shy away he pulled her close and kissed her lips before you i wanted nothing but power he said and you still should she whispered i like it when youre strong i always have dont change on me now for the first time since aulliennas death he felt the confusion that had clouded his mind finally lift he kissed her again nearly shoving his tongue down her throat as he held her tight ive almost forgotten what it means to be stronger he told her when their lips parted what it means to take a life and truly enjoy the taking i will remember today come with me the camp is not far weve already passed several of their banners velixar and his orcs are not far behind she told him we dont need them he said taking her hand not when we are together the girl smiled thats the qurrah i fell in love with hand in hand they marched north feeling warm despite the cold winter air t he mug tribe was the largest and the strongest of the orc tribes with numbers in the thousands their territory was spread across the vile wedge occupying more than a third of all the land between the two rivers camps waving the image of a bloodied wooden cup of ale dotted the entire wedge each one ruled by a warleader who in turn pledged allegiance to lummug so what is the plan tessanna asked as they walked through a small valley hills stretched to either side of them with towers built atop each waved a banner of a bloodied mug despite the drunkenness of the sentries within it would not be long before one glanced down and spotted them they will not expect attack during winter qurrah said food is poor and the cold is vicious against morale our campaign will be swift and short and velixars undead will need little food at the end of the valley was the camp wooden palisades surrounded it their tops carved into spikes a giant door made of tree trunks remained wide open two guards slumbered in the cold i know we have surprise tessanna said what are we to do with that surprise make them kneel the halforc said grinning so dramatic she said how about specifics no plan qurrah said so no specifics i will show them my power and i will make them obey the orcs are brutish children they need to believe their lives are at stake when i tell them to bow nothing else matters tessanna clutched his arm and kissed his cheek its going to snow soon she said will you be warm enough in these robes no qurrah said but i will survive prepare your magic i think we have been spotted a horn sounded from one of the towers a moment later the other tower joined with its own horn the guards at the gate readied their spears as hundreds of orcs joined them howling and bellowing the air was cold the morning dull and the idea of combat both warmed and awakened them they had armor made of leather weapons of crude iron and animal skins for warmth qurrah cast a spell and then shouted to the camp his booming voice sounded like a deity taken the form of a spider or a serpent look upon me orcs of the mug tribe i have the blood of orc in me just as you we come bearing an offer karak is returning to this world his power will not be denied an age ago your kind wielded swords and axes at his side that is where you gained your strength that is where you gained your bloodlust i am a servant of karak as you once were kneel and cry out his name and i will give you everything i will give you war against the humans i will give you land to pillage and fields to burn cast off your worship of the wild animals of this world karak is your god will you serve him the leader of the camp a smaller brother of lummug pushed his way to the front while he might have been smaller than lummug he still towered above the nearby orcs by a solid foot trummug bows to no one he shouted as he raised a mighty axe high above his head others bow to the mugs you take your god and leave we not want him you will serve qurrah said or every one of you will die go get em boys trummug shouted whoever brings me his head gets the girl a hundred orcs charged whooping and hollering qurrah laughed despite the danger at last a foe who relishes combat he said at last a fight where neither side regrets the bloodshed dark magic flared across his fingertips its about damn time i will keep us alive tessanna said a shy smile on her face you have your fun the first group of orcs neared foaming at the mouth as they waved their weapons high for the mugs they screamed maniacal bloodlust coursed through their veins the two strangers were unarmed and weak in form they should have been an easy kill then the halforc began casting a black circle stretched from qurrahs feet consuming the grass from the circle hundreds of tentacles crawled sparking with electricity six orcs died shrieking as the tentacles lashed at their faces and chests pushing aside the weapons they held up to defend themselves as if they were made of cloth the gruesome sight slowed the charge and that time was all qurrah needed to cast another spell the bones from the dead orcs tore from their bodies showering blood in a gruesome rain kill the demon trummug shouted kill him now yes qurrah said kill the demon the bones he commanded pelted the orc force tearing at their eyes and exposed throats tessanna giggled at the carnage it caused qurrah she said i want to have a little fun myself her hands waved in circles that glowed a deep crimson two orcs collapsed blood spurting from every orifice she took control of the blood giving it rigidity and energy she stretched it into a long bladed weapon the bloodsword lashed through the orcs mutilating flesh and severing limbs the tentacles vanished their power spent a band of orcs charged furious at seeing so many of their brethren massacred qurrah knelt placed his palms against the dirt and spoke the words of a spell when he pointed a finger a shadowy ghost of a face rose from the earth with black holes for eyes and a gaping maw that seemed infinite in depth then it shrieked the sound slammed into the orcs like a physical force shattering bones they fell writhing convulsing dying no more need to die the halforc shouted even as another wave of orcs neared orcs have fought orcs for long enough karak offers the greatest war imaginable will you serve him he received his answer in the form of a communal roar the halforc latched his hands together and pushed two black orbs shot from his wrists merged together and then grew to the size of a boulder it rolled through the air its surface shimmering like a bubble the first orc to touch it watched his entire arm dissolve into gray sand the next hapless orc had his entire upper body broken to the tiniest of pieces which fell like dust atop his collapsed legs orcs dove out of its way but three more found pieces of their body vanishing do you see his power qurrah asked the power of karak tessanna punctuated his comments with a shockwave of her own she laughed and that laughter shook the ground all the way to the towers it was as if dezrel laughed with her sharing in its contempt for the grayskinned creatures all around the orcs fell to their knees only qurrah and tessanna remained standing like gods among them bow qurrah shouted bow to those who would slay you without thought so you may slay thousands of others shut your trap trummug screamed slamming his axe into the dirt and using it to pull himself to his feet we seen your kind before you promise us stuff to fight gold land but you never keep those promises you want us to fight and die and then you move on while we lick our wounds and lose half our numbers to the winter fairly eloquent for an orc qurrah muttered he is correct tessanna said you know he is i do not bring the promises of men qurrah shouted the rest of the orcs were getting to their feet but they were not charging they wanted nothing more than the two dead but they would wait for their leader to give the order what do you bring trummug asked the promises of karak the promises of a god you are beloved in his eyes he gave you strength and power he saved you from extinction prove it trummug said have him speak the halforc glanced to tessanna a bit of worry crossed his face what is it lover she asked him i can give him his request he said i can but she understood she put her hand on his lips and kissed his forehead do not fear him perhaps you needed this you need to see what life you might lead he nodded then turned to trummug very well have your men lay down their arms do not harm me and i will let you hear his words the big orc gave the command qurrah walked the distance between them feeling an evertightening knot in his stomach he had never done this before not once he felt vulnerable naked dark one he prayed as he walked accept this as a step of faith do not betray me orcs grumbled and swore as the halforc arrived trummug snorted so im not hearing anything kneel qurrah said then you may hear you want to make me a fool the big orc snarled barely containing his growing rage cut me in half if you hear nothing qurrah said i will make no motion to stop you the girl she will not stop you the anger had spread throughout all his body but he held it in check he slammed down his axe then knelt as he gripped its handle before he could move qurrah thrust his hands against trummugs face and met him eye to eye karak god of order he silently commanded speak show him your paradise at first trummugs eyes widened as if he suspected qurrah of some sort of treachery but then the glaze came over a strong ringing filled both their ears the sky went dark the world was a haze qurrah had asked for communion and his request was about to be answered j ust under a mile away his orc rabble marching behind him velixar broke into hysterical laughter he is learning he cried an enormous smile on his face give it to him karak give him his desire all around orcs shied away from his horrific laughter laughter that shivered their spines and struck dead the few birds that flew overhead laughter of a dead man laughter of an insane man and none there could describe the pleasure he took within it f rom the ringing came a soft blowing of wind past the entrance of a cave trummug and qurrah were lost within the sound as if all time were halted what you do to me trummug asked though his lips never moved qurrah had no chance to answer you sought my presence said the voice of karak their entire world shook the darkness recoiled and spikes of red and violet danced within you wanted proof of my promise you wanted my words my voice you are my children cast away and given to me by the goddess accept my power as you always have let the orcs become my banner carriers we will obey trummug said still without moving his lips qurrah thought the darkness would end and the moment pass but karaks presence remained his message not yet done forgive my prophet child forgive the loss of your brother i have not yet turned my back on him though he has turned his back on me velixar loves you as you once loved him trust respect the time will come when your power will surpass even his and that time is not far away i want freedom from this qurrah said i want a life with her and nothing more your freedom comes with mine but once you have tasted the fire i offerwill you be so ready to flee it red lightning consumed the dark the black grew ever distant until qurrah realized he stared into the eyes of trummug the giant orc stood his entire body shaking what he say boss the orc to his right asked trummug did not respond so we get to kill them the same orc asked drawing his sword and turning toward qurrah the halforc did not move trummug reached out and crushed the life from the orcs throat all while still staring at qurrah boys he shouted his voice gained strength as he talked the mugs got a god smiling at us all us orcs do we gonna leave the wedge and we leave it forever get the war drums prepare the horde we march to war qurrah turned to tessanna and nodded the girl smiled but it was a nervous smile she didnt like the way her lover looked it was as if his face had darkened a reverse glow that sucked in all light and denied it freedom but he had his army far larger than the one velixar ruled he walked over and wrapped his arms around her waist i love you he said what did you hear she asked him he opened his mouth to answer then paused it doesnt matter he said nothing matters but us and we are one step closer to our freedom she kissed his cheek it was colder than ever when he kissed her back a shiver traveled up and down her back as his arms closed about her she felt the chill subside karaks presence had faded qurrahs heart and soul were hers once more v elixar and his orcs arrived at the camp expecting war but instead they were greeted like long lost friends the mug orcs cheered and offered ale and food to which the exhausted and starving orcs gladly accepted qurrah waited for velixar by the gate tessanna next to him with dagger in hand you spoke with him velixar said when he arrived not only that you invoked his name for the first time you put your trust in karak do you see now that when faith is measured the reward is greatest for those who believe without hesitation the orcs are yours qurrah said and trummug will unite all the other mug camps we come across in his name only lummug can overrule him once the mug tribe is in our hands the rest of the tribes will step in line the question is who will be their hordemaster i thought gumgog velixar said he seems capable enough make him warmaster qurrah said but trummug has heard the voice of karak he should be the hordemaster velixar pondered over the decision as he did he watched tessanna slice into her arm the vicious cut splattered her dress with blood tears ran down her face but she made no sound when she caught him looking at her she smiled the cold makes it hurt more she said her voice like the purr of a cat but the pleasures still there indeed velixar said glancing back to qurrah but will lummug bow to his younger brother i ask of course not qurrah said we are instituting a new era for the orcs the old must go lummug will die and trummug will rule with all the orcs worshipping the name of karak velixar chuckled very well i will concede to your decision prepare the orcs to march we have several more camps to collect before we reach lummugs of course master qurrah said with a bow the man in black bowed back feeling his joy increasing his apprentice had finally gained the confidence to argue back to disagree and not out of arrogance his plan was a sound one any orc blessed enough to hear the words of karak deserved to rule well done qurrah velixar said as they entered the orc camp g umgog and trummug didnt just get along they took to one another like brothers the two were giants compared to the other orcs and after an initial arm wrestling match fist fight and drinking competition they were as close as any orcs would ever get when qurrah took them both aside to explain his plan for gumgog to be warmaster and trummug to be hordemaster both were thrilled beyond measure they were also drunk beyond measure which enhanced their reactions but what what about me brother trummug asked he not like me being higher than him when me be smaller and him older and he got this giantwhat was me saying your brother will bow to your reign qurrah said or you will kill him in karaks name those are his choices ill beat him over the head for you gumgog offered one good whack kapow he smacked their table with his wooden arm the weighted stone at the end smashed right through you you a good friend orc trummug said as he guzzled down his twentieth glass good good he vomited all over his chest good friend kapow qurrah left as each shouted for more a short sweaty goblin dragged over a barrel and filled their glasses the two raised them in a toast as the halforc exited the tent kapow they shouted in unison before slamming their mugs together kapow t he next several camps quickly submitted to trummugs command grabbing all their supplies and weaponry before stepping in line at qurrahs request they did not mention the required loyalty and worship to karak that would be for a later time when trummug was solidified as hordemaster with numbers nearing a thousand they planned their assault on fortress mug i say smash through by force trummug shouted slamming an open palm against the table no sneaking and no talk brothers not gonna give up and i dont want any rumors about me stabbing him in the back there will be no rumors qurrah insisted his voice soft and reassuring in the cramped tent trummugs shouts were painful to his ears and he preferred to keep them to a minimum any who question your strength will die by the sword we cannot risk failure though and the last thing you want is a prolonged war you call me a coward trummug asked his eyes bulging i said nothing of the sort you dare say me scared of war war is what i live for youre trying to reason with him velixar said chuckling from the corner i think we all can guess whether or not you will be successful very well qurrah said plopping into his chair at the table tessanna sat beside him with her knees curled against her chest and her hands clutching the sides of the chair she rocked back and forth as if she were mesmerized by the sounds around her the halforc gestured a finger toward velixar show me the wiser path velixar stood his grin dark and wide beneath the cowl of his hood trummug crossed his arms confident he could not be convinced his small weaker council wanted him to sneak past the guards at night and slaughter his brother he in his orcish sense of honor wanted to attack the city at dawn with drums and horns announcing his arrival he wanted to take the title of hordemaster by force and war not stealth or trickery you say you are not afraid of war velixar said pacing on the opposite side of the table from trummug i believe you tell me trummug who should rule the orcish tribes the strongest yes yes velixar said his grin growing more smug the strongest and who is stronger my dear friend you or lummug me trummug smashed the table with both fists and flexed his enormous muscles bulging under his armor of course i would not have allied with you otherwise so if the strongest orc should rule and you are the strongest how do we go about proving that by me chopping off lummugs head thats how velixar clapped his hands and laughed as if he had never heard such a brilliant idea youre right so it doesnt matter if lummug has ten guards or ten thousand you should rule youre the strongest thats right he poked his chest with his thumb im the strongest then all the fighting and war you want is just a waste of time the real test the only part that matters is the fight between you and your brother so the smart thing to do is to fight lummug alone right trummug scratched his head deep inside he could feel a throb he had never felt before dark and sinister he had felt it ever since he had heard the words of qurrahs god and now it pulsed with agreement the man in black spoke truth he didnt know how he knew but he knew aye it be the smart thing trummug said so let us get you your brother the more orcs that live the more that join your army you do want a grander army than lummug ever had dont you i will smash everything he thinks hes done trummug shouted get me to him once his heads in my hands all orcs will call me hordemaster velixar winked at qurrah who only threw up his hands in surrender that is how you do it the man in black said as he sat across from his disciple you just need to think simpler less arguing more coercing you should fight his war tessanna said her voice muffled by her knees you could bring the dead back so no loss would matter less to feed true my dear velixar said but the orcs that live i can bring back the dead when slain will stay dead and raging orcs are far superior in combat to the mindless dead and food will not be a problem fortress mug has plenty of livestock for us to slaughter so tomorrow we kill trummug shouted bored of the conversation tomorrow me be hordemaster if karak wills it yes velixar said smiling at the orc but only if he wills it they left the tent to sleep come the morning they would prepare their army if all went according to plan they would not need it but all there in that tent knew that things rarely went according to plan f ortress mug was like all the other orc forts surrounded by wooden palisades with sharpened tips covered with banners and possessing a single gate to enter fortress mug however differed by how enormous it was encircling giant fields full of pigs and goats a tent five times the height of any orc loomed in the center surrounded by hundreds of other tents home to the orcs that swore allegiance directly to lummug over three thousand lived there by velixars estimate a grand army if united have we been spotted qurrah asked velixar as they stood at the outskirts of their camp and looked upon the fortress im sure we have velixar said the walls are bristling with orcs the question is will lummug still be inside his tent he wont leave until the fighting begins qurrah said velixar glanced at his disciple and raised an eyebrow do you know that for sure the halforc shrugged i wouldnt bet my life on it id bet yours though the man in black laughed summon trummug he said when his laughter died it is time the orcs worshipped karak once more qurrah went to fetch him leaving velixar to grin alone he had been in a joyous mood for days everything was proceeding without a hitch and the inevitable release of karak seemed closer than ever me ready to kill trummug bellowed to signify his arrival velixar turned to him his smile growing larger a fine sight you are he said and he meant it the orcs armor was cleaned and polished massive amounts of gray muscle bulged underneath on his head he wore a helmet made of iron surrounding it was six pairs of antlers positioned so that tens of sharp points stretched out from his eyes and mouth toward his enemy two sharp spikes stretched out from his shoulders an addition made by velixar his gauntlets also made of iron were stained red from blood almost ready the man in black said admiring the sight but now you must accept the rewards karak offers to those who keep his faith he placed a hand on trummugs chest and closed his eyes the orc fidgeted unsure of what sorcery was about to take place then he felt the power flood into him his muscles bulged the armor which had hung loose on him by qurrahs demand suddenly latched tight and firm he held his giant axe in one hand though he had always needed two to lift it karak made me strong he shouted his voice carrying further than it ever had qurrah smiled a sad smile he remembered how harruq had looked when infused in a similar manner even trummug with his armor and muscle paled in comparison always bless his name velixar said his voice captivating trummug let every kill honor your god when you are hordemaster may every orc in dezrel know the strength karak offers trummug held his axe high above his head and bellowed out a war cry send me to fight he screamed ill go crazy if i dont kill velixar slammed his hands together and whispered words of magic a black portal tore into the air its destination unknown enter he told the giant orc slay your enemy and take your place as ruler with a mindless roar trummug leapt inside his axe high and ready qurrah followed with a silent tessanna coming shortly after velixar entered last but only after commanding gumgog to prepare his army for battle if the armies of the mug fortress poured forth they needed to be prepared we be ready gumgog said saluting with his club arm velixar smiled failure would be most unwise he said before vanishing within the swirling darkness q urrah was lucky enough to have ducked when he entered the portal for otherwise a wild swing by trummug would have taken off his head the orc was storming about the giant tent in the center of fortress mug screaming for challengers qurrah crouched lower and stepped back cursing their luck lummug was not in his tent get back dullard he said hooking his fingers and pushing them in the air an invisible force pushed trummug away from the portal so his axe did not harm tessanna and velixar when they appeared we must find him quickly velixar said as he looked around and realized the problem trummug nearly foaming at the mouth with rage did not wait for council he stormed out of the tent and shrieked at the top of his lungs where lummug orc guards saw him and fled wanting no part of the angry giant trummug raised his axe and chased lopping off any heads within reach again he screamed for his brother and throughout the entire fortress his voice thundered keep him alive velixar ordered as he held open the flap of the tent for qurrah and tessanna but make sure he strikes the killing blow against lummug at first it didnt appear to be that difficult a task orcs fled in all directions wanting no part of the strangers that had magically appeared within their gates the curious or the slow found their heads chopped or their chests shattered then a giant swarm of orcs approached from the north gate shrieking with battlelust within the mass was lummug his shield and sword held high take out his entourage velixar said qurrah chuckled is that what we should do i might never have guessed he prepared his magic as velixar glared boys boys tessanna said as she prepared her own spells behave before i spank you both trummug charged the orcs headon as if he were impervious to any wounds qurrah and velixar accompanied his charge with twin blasts of bones torn from the nearby corpses guards crumpled to the ground gagging from torn throats and clutching massacred eyes tessanna kissed the palm of her hand and blew red smoke swirled like a snake through the air past trummug and into the lungs and noses of the orcs those that breathed it in dropped their weapons and gagged their eyes immediately swelling red with blood two dropped without uttering a sound a third vomited his intestines the rest fell their stomachs bursting open and pouring blood across the grass a magnificent spell velixar said thank you tessanna said her voice calm and emotionless but i have better with their leader near the rest of the camp had the courage to attack the three frail forms that stood seemingly unprotected the girl twirled her arms dancing through the air orange light shone from her fingertips the blood of the dead orcs ran across the grass and pooled at her feet like a spider it latched upon her legs and climbed swirling and covering her exposed legs when it reached her dress it spread wide and covered it as well so she appeared to have one long skirt of blood with each of tessannas heartbeats it pulsed with life disturbing qurrah said but what does it he stopped when tessanna violently wrenched her body like some vicious dancer the skirt spread wide cracked and then flew from her the blood becoming snakes that flew with open mouths and dripping fangs the snakes latched onto the gathering orcs sinking their fangs into their necks and faces upon biting the snakes dissolved back into normal blood their poison spent orcs shrieked and scratched at their skin like it was on fire they tore out their eyes so the pressure behind them would subside they gnawed on their fingers stabbed themselves with their swords and writhed on the ground in unbearable agony by the abyss qurrah muttered watching the macabre display i stand corrected velixar said that is a magnificent spell your pet tessanna said still quiet and apathetic she pointed to where lummug and trummug fought hes in danger the two men turned having forgotten their reason for being there the orc brothers were deep in combat and it appeared lummug had the upper hand despite his magical strength trummug was a much worse fighter in terms of skill he swung wild and crazy with his axe trying to use sheer strength to win lummug the size of an ox himself used his shield to absorb the blows before retaliating with his sword his cuts were not severe but they were quickly adding up blood soaked both their armor take his strength velixar said i will take his mind but use a light touch our puppet must believe he won qurrah thought over his spells then settled on one he had used on his brother he cast the curse invisible weights latched onto lummugs arms and legs making it seem his sword weighed thrice its normal weight and his shield was made of stone you grow tired trummug shouted seeing his opponents movements slow and his breathing quicken youre not able to face my strength velixars spell was more subtle but far more dangerous to lummug his curse spread a thin veil of shadow over the orcs eyes lummug could still see but what he saw was far from truth when he saw trummug swing his axe from below his waist he positioned his shield to block the blow never came not from that direction trummug had lifted his axe high and swung straight down no shield stopped it the axe cleaved through lummugs helmet split his skull and then buried itself in a mess of ribs lungs and heart with a scream of victory trummug tore free his axe and lifted the giant weapon above his head with one hand lummug dead he shouted to the fortress trummug hordemaster now their leader dead it was politics as normal for the rest of the orcs trummug they shouted trummug the hordemaster the entire fortress erupted in cheers of loyalty as trummug basked in his glory velixar walked beside him do not forget what karak has given you he said reward his faith in you by your faith in him for karak trummug suddenly shouted for karak for karak the orcs outside the fortress took up a similar chant for karak for karak the orcs within confused though they were joined in they found the words pleasant to their tongues and the shout comforting to their minds for karak for karak with the mug tribe united in his name it was only a matter of time before the other tribes fell in line the army numbering two thousand strong marched east a new standard for their banners it was the skull of a lion part two i t had been a long night for the halforc harruq tun try not to scream too much his tormenter said as he pressed a glowing piece of coal against his neck with a pair of tongs a very long night no screaming harruq said through grit teeth no screaming he felt the searing pain against his flesh he heard sizzling his blood hissing and drying he would have given anything to throttle the man but the heavy chains around his body denied him his desire as he hung naked against the wall im sure your friends are looking for you by now the tormenter said he pulled back the coal and admired his work an ugly black burn covered the entirety of harruqs neck looking but not finding the halforc flung his head to one side so his long brown hair didnt cover his face and doing his best to ignore the horrible pain it caused his neck his breathing was heavy from the pain but still he laughed you have no idea he said between labored breaths no idea how badly you just erred oh really the man said he wore black robes with a feline skull hanging from a chain around his neck his upper lip protruded a full inch farther than his lower jaw so when he smiled he looked like a strange combination of horse and man what mistake was that because im not the scary one harruq said they were deep in the bowels of an old mansion one with an owner rumored to be eccentric and lonely looking around at the various torture devices hanging from the stone walls of the cell harruq had to agree about the eccentric part he did not however think the man was alone too often not in that cell judging by the blood staining the floor youre not the scary one the tormenter asked humoring him im the big one harruq continued he was stalling and by ashhur the man didnt seem to have a clue haern hes the creepy one sneaky kill you before you know youre dead but no that isnt too scary dying without knowing it aurry however the halforc laughed then stopped to cough up and spit out a blob of blood you mean your weak little elf woman the man asked him he dug his fingers into the burn on harruqs neck harruq sucked in air denying the man the scream he wanted she sees what youve done to me and shell be hotter than a dragon napping in a wildfire haerns got some sort of honor aurry the man in the black robes slapped him then kissed the skull that hung from his neck karak protects me the man said his power protects me from scrying no one knows youre here no one will hear you no one will know youve died until i dump your body at the eschatons doorstep too late then too late for you again harruq laughed and coughed and laughed what was your name again he asked karak has given me the name of tormentus the man said glowing with pride his right hand in driving out blasphemy from this world harruq lost himself in laughter so loud and chaotic he appeared delusional tormentus drove a dagger through the palm of the halforcs hand and even that did little to stop his laughter tormentus harruq said when he regained control you give yourself that name his laughter resumed huge shuddering laughs that shook him against the chains that held him to the wall run children tormentus is coming crazy man for a crazy god the man slashed him across the face and neck with a knife furious and humiliated he had given himself the name thinking it would inspire fear in those he worked upon on most it had but this strange halforc who seemed impervious to any pain he caused only found it hysterical suddenly he was ashamed of the name felt almost childlike in its creation you may know me as gregor if you would prefer he said wiping the blood off his dagger the name i held before karak blessed me with his power sure thing harruq said so what is your last name cutall hurtme imakebooboos enough gregor marched over to his rack of torture devices full of prongs pliers wrenches strange shaped blades and rollers full of spikes and rusty edges the halforc had dared trespass onto his property his servants had subdued him with sleep scrolls they all carried it took three to drag harruqs body downstairs to his torture room and chain him to the wall the halforc had tested the chains strength when he first awoke then settled in and endured his punishment what were you looking for gregor asked as he grabbed a device with a wooden handle and a small curved blade eschaton do not steal or rob what was it you sought in my mansion just the usual harruq said the man turned and approached with a sick grin on his face thieves killers crazy people you seem like all three what you going to do with that anyway oh this gregor asked smiling at his tool you keep laughing and mocking me you ignore any pain i cause so im going to cause you pain you cant ignore and when you laugh at least it will be at a higher pitch the room fell silent as harruq realized what it was gregor was saying now thats just too far the halforc shouted straining against his chains you can hurt and kill me but really you cant be that sick shouts echoed through the closed wooden door and into the room gregor glanced up the stairs frowning at the intrusion what is going on up there he shouted i dont know harruq said you should go see definitely that is something you should he stopped when gregor backhanded him and then pressed the curved blade against his groin more shouts came from upstairs we can talk about this harruq said all trace of humor gone from his voice talk about this like men like men gregor asked a wild fear in his eyes more shouts filled the room people had entered the mansion it did not take much thought to guess who like men harruq repeated with an enthusiastic nod but youre not a man gregor said not anymore the door exploded inward and in stepped a furious aurelia tun fire danced on her fingertips gregor tensed the blade against harruq while his other hand grabbed the halforc by the throat stay back the man ordered stay back or i cut him and no priestess will undo the damage listen to what he says aurry harruq said a slight quiver in his voice you play some interesting games the elf said as she looked around the room she saw the torture devices the wooden racks and the chains on the wall she saw the blood pooled upon the floor a sick room she thought sick room for a sick man where are the others gregor asked the assassin where is he i see one flutter of gray and i cut cut him aurelia said the fire leaving her hands only to be replaced by ice and i will do the same to you except i will have far more time to make sure it hurts she dont mean it harruq said trying to smile you just let me go and well all be happy and leave gregor leaned closer and shoved harruqs head against the wall he knew he was in a tight spot and the idea of the elf removing his own manhood did not appeal to him only by threatening the halforc did he remain safe but if he actually carried out his threat gregor harruq said his voice soft as if he did not want aurelia to hear just be calm shell listen to me you understand im her husband she obeys what i say what do you propose gregor whispered back the halforc ignored the horrible glare aurelia gave him for while his tormenter was an idiot harruq knew full well the elf could hear him despite his whispering just this harruq whispered before slamming his forehead against gregors nose the blow knocked him back and that slight separation was all aurelia needed a javelin of ice flew from her hands and pierced his back lightning followed the ice reducing him to a dead smoking lump of flesh and black robes aurelia crossed her arms and stood at the top of the stairs so do i always obey what you say dearest husband she asked clever ploy nothing more harruq said grinning now please could you get me to delysia i think im going to pass out true to his word the halforc slumped against the chains unable to stand now that his adrenaline was fading the elf pulled up her skirt as she walked down the stairs not wanting to stain her dress on anything in the foul room she kicked the curved blade gregor had held then looked up at the ceiling a faded rune carved in blood covered it designed to prevent magical scrying the magic fades over time she told the dead tormenter and the runes need reapplied just thought you should know she looked over harruqs wounds wincing as she did the man had done a number on her husband but he had suffered through worse aurelia a voice called down the stairs the elf turned and shouted back come on down haern found the big ox a blond man cloaked in gray appeared at the top of the stairs twin sabers in his hands the servants have been taken care of he said when he saw gregors body he sheathed his swords and apparently so has the master hars passed out she said fiddling with the locks care to help me get him out of these so i can take us home haern pulled out a kit from a pouch hidden beneath his cloaks a minute later all the locks were undone and harruq slumped into haerns strong arms the elf whispered words of magic and then a blue portal ripped into existence its blue light scattering the shadows of the room haern found harruqs swords and armor piled in a corner and tossed them into the portal he then dragged the unconscious halforc in aurelia entered last but only after tossing a ball of fire at the rack of torture instruments setting them aflame h arruq awoke the next morning at the touch of feminine fingers against his skin aurry he muttered his eyes still closed its me said a voice that was not aurelias lie still i just started hey delysia pleased as always the priestess chuckled despite her concentration white light surrounded her hands filled with healing magic she focused on the brutal cuts gregor had made cuts that looked dangerously close to becoming infected the light poured into them killing the sickness and closing the wounds each cut took several minutes of concentration and by the time she had the halforc looking decent her entire body ached and her head pounded as if filled with a thousand ogres banging drums harruq lay still for most of it the healing magic soothed most of his pain but the ache in his muscles would not subdue for days and the strange stretching and pulling of his skin against the wounds was uncomfortable at best as delysia cast her spells he heard a door creak open followed by shuffling of robes so hows our halforc doing asked tarlak the leader of the eschaton mercenaries doing good harruq said eyes still closed remind me to never listen when you suggest splitting up patrols whine all you want tarlak said youre still alive harruq opened his eyes and glared at the mage he was dressed in a bizarre assortment of yellow robes yellow sash and long yellow pointy hat delysia stood beside him rubbing her pounding temples they were clearly brother and sister with matching red hair and green eyes tarlak stroked his goatee all the while trying to hold in a laugh the halforc glared harder determined to whallop the man if he dared mock his predicament i heard you almost lost something precious tarlak said another word and ill shove your hat down your throat and pull it out your rear very manly of you glad you can still do stuff like that i swear tar i will hush now delysia said frowning at her brother stop pestering him so hell sit still if you insist tarlak said sitting down on the bed next to him they were on the second floor of the eschaton tower normally it was delysias room but it often doubled as a ward for an injured mercenary at least we got the sick bastard harruq said closing his eyes and obeying a command by the priestess to shift onto his side yeah about that tarlak took off his hat and picked at it turns out that wasnt the guy what stay still delysia said smacking him on the head with the palm of her hand thought you decided some karak worshipper was doing all the mutilations harruq said doing his best not to move i did but that guy you killedgregor right well this gregor worshipped karak but he wasnt a priest he was just some spoiled son of a rich man that fancied himself a chosen of our dear dark god tarlak put the hat back on his head that and after you and aurry so neatly dispatched him we found another body near the castle i wont bore you with the details harruq raised an eyebrow at him alright fine tarlak said you know me too well extremities dismembered hands were sewn onto his face palms covering his eyes tongue gone bowels burned oh and the neatest carving on his chest they made some skull out of twisted skin and bruises enough delysia said standing and holding her fingers against her chest please enough sure thing sis tarlak said he tipped his hat to the halforc get better tonights going to be another long one and like i say no rest for the orcish thought it was no rest for the short harruq said immediately regretting it yeah the mage said a pall coming over his cheery attitude at reference to the former member brug well no shorties around to keep going so got to deprive someone of rest right harruq did not respond he doesnt blame you delysia said once tarlak had left the room he should the halforc muttered you are not your brother she insisted gently running a hand down his wounded back and you are not responsible for him or the company he keeps even if you were ashhur preaches forgiveness the priestess left not expecting a reply she was right t he rest of the eschaton gathered around the fireplace on the first floor of the tower drinking magically conjured drinks and discussing the previous night three bodies haern said shaking his head and staring at the fire theyre taunting us no other explanation escalation does not mean taunting tarlak said as he came down the stairs though it very well may be when antonil asked us to help patrol it was a single body found every three days haern argued that night and every night after we have found a body for each night they know were looking they aurelia asked she was seated in a luxurious red chair with a blanket over her she took another sip of a hot brown drink that was deliciously sweet that many bodies cant be one man the wizard said and i still swear the priests of karak are doing this delysia came down the stairs looking pallid and exhausted her brother tossed a blanket around her shoulders and led her to a cushion beside aurelia hell be fine she said whatever cut him was far from clean but i think hell she stopped a spell of dizziness taking away her words thank you aurelia said delysia smiled what if it is the priests haern said his tone softer more dangerous will we finally strike at their heart the women glanced to tarlak who sighed and began to explain the priests have a hidden temple inside veldaren very very powerful spells hide its appearance mask the evil energy within and deny any attempts to scry its location supposedly it will reveal itself only to those who seek karaks favor aurelia leaned forward suddenly very interested but you know where it is she said somehow you found it tarlak glanced to haern not found haern said i have been inside its walls the spider guild did not take kindly to my faith in ashhur delysia winced she and haern had spent many nights conversing underneath the stars haern had been a trained killer since birth and so the opportunity to speak and think without fear of judgment or punishment had proven addictive one night the members of the spider guild had assaulted them dragging haern toward the temple of karak while leaving delysia for dead they thought to purge me of my belief haern continued old wounds drained the life from his eyes i memorized the way and i will never forget that building both the illusion and its true form then we tell the guards aurelia said the priests of karak are forbidden from the city once king vaelor hears of an entire temple hell hell do nothing tarlak said because he already knows every king is informed on the first night they take the throne theyre also told in no uncertain terms that they will die should they try to remove the priests from the capital how do you know this aurelia asked tarlak feigned shock and insult why because im a wizard of course im supposed to know these things the temples existence is common knowledge to the upper members of veldaren haern explained the priests focus their attention on the wealthy and gain safety and power through them the priests of karak bring only the most faithful and rich to their temple and even then they bring them blindfolded why dont the priests of ashhur do something about it aurelia asked open warfare on the streets tarlak asked with a chuckle fun as that would be callan and his ilk accept the temple as a necessary evil but we however do not fall under their jurisdiction what was this about war on the streets harruq asked as he came limping down the stairs aurelia frowned and rose from her chair you shouldnt be up and around youll make yourself sick haerns beaten me far worse than this the halforc argued though his voice was weak and unconvincing he accepted aurelias arms and used her weight to reach her chair she wrapped her blanket around him before sitting down beside delysia we dont want war on the streets tarlak said so we must be certain the priests are committing these murders and mutilations but do we really have the strength to take them on in their home no less haern leaned back and ran his hands through his blond hair no i dont think we do he said but that hasnt stopped us before we have never taken such a great risk so if we do we must do it with all our abilities if the priests of karak survive we will be guaranteed retaliation he looked around at his friends and i would not wish that upon any of you we need to be more vigilant aurelia said we keep looking and keep searching if we find and stop the priests outside the temple they will view us as mercenaries performing a job those we kill will be faulted for being caught will that be enough to deter the killings haern asked it will be if we kill enough of them aurelia said the hardness in her eyes frightening fantastic harruq said why are they doing these killings in the first place karak seeks total devotion delysia said after a long period of silence this means inhibition compassion and humanity must be purged these mutilations these sacrifices are meant to show their faith and i think we are ignoring one other aspect fear there is a reason the bodies are being dumped for all to see if it is fear they want theyre getting it tarlak said remembering the talk he heard the previous day and itll get worse especially with how those three were found when harruq asked how the wizard shook his head some things are best to remain in the dark for now we rest pray and do what we do best for the rest of the day come night well scour the city and hope to ashhur we catch whoevers doing this before more bodies are found strung fromnever mind good day everyone he downed the rest of his glass made it vanish with a snap of his fingers and then hurried up the stairs to harruqs questioning look haern only shook his head and shuddered t hat night the eschaton gathered near the western entrance to the city the air was cold and they all wore extra layers underneath their armor and robes as well as thick cloaks wrapped about their bodies harruq aurelia you search the southern quarter tarlak ordered del and i will scan the west haern gets the east so far no ones been taken from the north so well leave it be until they do you going to be alright without me delysia asked harruq sure thing the halforc said with a wink aurry will keep me safe if you find any priests of karak use your best judgment tarlak said if they are too many seek us out even if it is just one treat him like a wild dragon yes daddy aurelia said before taking harruqs hand and pulling him away haern bowed tied his hair behind his head and then leapt to the rooftops come on tarlak said casting invisibility spells over he and his sister lets see if we can finally catch these murdering crows d espite the danger the priests wore their black robes openly in the dark streets their success had emboldened them no man or woman who noticed them would dare point an accusatory finger come the dawn leading the group of five was pelarak the revered priest of karak tonight will be special pelarak said fingering the pendant shaped like a lion skull that hung from his neck his voice was deep and firm a powerful presence in the streets of veldaren the fear we have caused is a pittance compared to our task tonight before the rise of the sun the armies of karak will conquer all what about the eschaton the priest on his left asked they have a part to play in this pelarak answered from his belt he drew a dagger come our time is short they followed him north heading straight for the fountain at the center of veldaren o ne good sleep harruq mumbled rubbing his eyes with his giant fists thats all i want why is it when bad things start happening we always have to scour the city at night such a baby aurelia said jabbing him in the ribs with an elbow youre a step away from dead every time you plop down in our bed what happened to this fabled orcish stamina we elves always heard about bunch of lies the halforc muttered we like sleep we like food and we dont like staying up all night staring at empty streets the two were perched atop a building aurelia had used a levitation spell to bring them up other than a few drunks and stray animals they hadnt seen a sign of life people are becoming afraid aurelia said frowning staying home and avoiding the streets at night but there is something else going on something harruq look up he sighed and glanced to the cloudcovered sky yup might rain perfect no look closer he did and was stunned he had not seen it before oh gods he said his jaw dropping what does it mean we need to find tarlak now aurelia grabbed his hand and leapt them off the roof using another levitation spell to slow their fall hand in hand they ran as far above them the red skull of a lion blanketed the entire western sky a ghostly image shimmering across the clouds a s haern leaned over the edge of a building nothing more than a pair of eyes shining in the night he heard a strange cry he could not place it but it sounded bestial and deep the stranger part was that he heard it from the sky he looked up and there it was a giant skull with its mouth opened in roar it was blood red and hovered above the city like an angry god not good he said before breaking into a sprint another roar thundered through the city louder angrier even without his exceptionally trained hearing haern could tell where it came from he leapt from rooftop to rooftop straight for the heart of the city w hen they heard the deep roar they knew something was horribly amiss harruq drew his swords and aurelia summoned her staff and prepared her spells they expected to see guards rushing toward the center but so far the streets remained barren where are the guards harruq asked as they ran afraid she answered we underestimated what is going on im scared harruq weve faced worse he said no she said stop she pulled on his arm and reluctantly he slowed he could feel his own horror growing at a rapid pace a strange cancer that he was unaccustomed too all he could think of was fleeing to the eschaton tower and cowering away from the lion in the sky its magic aurelia said brushing her hand across his face as she stared into his eyes look at me look and repeat after me the fear is weak when the threat is false say it the fear is weak when the threat is false soft light flickered on her fingertips again the fear is weak when the threat is false light flashed between them but it did not hurt his eyes nor make him blink the cancer in his stomach vanished that should do for now she said kissing his lips delysia can better ward us against fear should we find her come on she grabbed his wrist and pulled the lion roared as if mocking them sooner we get rid of that thing the better harruq said glaring at the lion as it glared back down at him they ran until they could see the large fountain in the center of the city they stopped again but not out of fear what the abyss is that harruq asked the lion in the sky roared triumphant the halforc felt his swords shake in his hands aurelia wrapped her free hand around his wrist needing its touch five priests of karak surrounded the fountain whose waters ran red with blood pelarak stood at the north side his hands raised and his eyes to the sky the other four were on the opposite end kneeling in prayer or chanting three bodies lay like the corners of a large triangle surrounding them their chests were wrenched open their ribcages broken and twisted wide as if something had burst from within standing above the bodies were the lions they were larger than horses their black flesh rippled with muscle they had no fur instead covered with a smoldering coat of embers in unison the three arched their backs and roared and from their bellies streams of fire soared into the air the lion in the sky roared back pleased what are they harruq asked his eyes wide with terror lions aurelia said gripping his hand tighter servants of karak hes twisted them made themwe need the guards we need tarlak where is everyone the panic in her voice only worsened harruqs fear he could imagine one bearing down upon him its claws made of molten rock its fur burning his very flesh as its obsidian teeth closed around his neck faithless children pelarak screamed drawing his attention outward away from his nightmarish vision all throughout the city his voice could be heard behold the lion that comes in the night seeking to reclaim his kingdom you have turned from karak willingly forgetting all that once made this city proud now you cower fearing his judgment will you surrender will you accept the truth you have blinded yourselves to or will you give in to death and in its embrace hide from your ignorance the priest lowered his gaze and stared straight at the couple your brother was always the wisest harruq tun he said he approaches with an army at his side your master marches with him will you join them will you repent and turn to the life you once lived or will you doom yourself and your loved ones by fighting against him harruq looked to his wife and in her eyes he saw the floating corpse of his daughter the halforc met the priests gaze and he felt his fear shatter underneath his anger i would rather die than become the soulless murderer my brother would have me be he said pelarak nodded accepting the decision so be it karak has given us his servants to prepare the way it is in their teeth you will die the lions roared all three leering at him with hungry eyes harruq snarled back and smashed his swords together aurelia clutched her staff and a flickering shield of red grew around her two of the lions belched fire the powerful streams ripping through the air only to part against the elfs shield aurelia twirled her hair and smirked that it pelarak chuckled it is a pleasure to meet you aurelia tun however briefly may you die with little pain at his command the lions charged they filled the entire street one leading the other two side by side behind the ground shook from their footfalls the night shimmered under the red embers of their fur the couple held their ground when the lions were about to reach them and the foremost had leapt into the air aurelia knelt and pressed her fingers against the ground a wall of ice grew straight upward several inches thick the entire wall groaned from the pressure as the first lion hit it hundreds of cracks filled the ice here she said pressing her hands against harruqs chest red light surrounded their skin that will protect us from their fire she kissed him as he stared at the ice wall which had begun to crumble and their claws and teeth he asked on your own there she said as the barrier shattered she flung boulders of ice from her hands as deadly concentration blanketed her face harruq stayed at her side determined to protect her no matter the cost the foremost lion snarled as the boulders crashed against its face and legs a second lion leapt past with frightening speed come try me harruq yelled running to one side and batting his swords together the lion veered toward him its mouth open in roar a stream of fire shot between the gaping jaws and enveloped the halforc he crossed his arms and braced his legs but aurelias spell held strong the fire flickered across his armor and skin without burning he felt the heat and sweat poured across his skin but he was not burned it seemed the lion was not surprised by his survival for it leapt with its paws leading obsidian claws hungry for blood harruq dodged to one side slashing out with his magical blades salvation and condemnation the sister swords cut through the molten armor and into black flesh dark fluid seeped out bursting into flame at contact with the crisp cold air the wounded lion cried out in pain and wrenched its body away from the swords when it landed further down the street it spun its eyes glaring with an intelligence that was terrifying as harruq prepared for another leap aurelia used a spell to raise her high into the air the other two lions belched fire and leapt skyward lance after lance of ice batted them back angling them so their claws passed inches from her dress and their teeth snapped air instead of flesh frustrated the two lions circled underneath snarling up at her poor kitties the elf said as more ice swirled around her fingers you want to come and play she fired thick lances of ice which thudded against the muscular feline bodies she wasnt harming them much but at least the two lions were focused on her instead of harruq she threw two more boulders of ice one missed while the other cracked in two as it collided against the spine of a lion as its cry of pain ended she heard a voice well done pelarak shouted dark circles sparkled on his fingertips but it is time your foolishness ended aurelia felt a tingling throughout her body and then the firm grip of gravity took hold she hooked her fingers and cast another levitation spell but the magic would not take the elf fell her green dress flapping in the air as the lions waited hungrily below they were denied their meal strong arms gripped her as she passed by the houses jarring her to one side together they rolled along the roof she came to a rest still inside those arms having fun without me haern asked as he helped her stand about time you she stopped are you alright the assassin was clutching his amulet of the golden mountain as his entire body shook the amulet helps he said i will not cower before the demons of karak you poor dear she put her hands on his own white light flared as she cast the same spell she had cast on her husband haerns shaking subsided delysia and tarlak will be here soon he said he grabbed her hand and held it firm thank you he said the lion in the sky roared once more and it seemed the entire city shook under its power the two lions leapt atop the building the wood and plaster cracking under their weight their eyes shimmered as they tensed for a pounce can you keep the lions at bay haern asked have so far havent i the one on the right dug its claws waiting for the slightest movement to react the priests are mine the assassin whispered from a standstill he leapt twenty feet to his right gently falling to the roof of another building both lions charged one gave chase for haern but stopped when aurelia pelted its side with a bolt of lightning the force spun it sideways ruining its jump the thing tumbled to the street belching fire all the way down aurelia fell as the other lion descended upon her she had nowhere to go its muscular body was all she could see she closed her eyes hooked her fingers for one last spell and prayed h aern jumped from roof to roof his twin sabers held tight in his hands he and tarlak had spent many nights pondering what would happen if the priests of karak revealed themselves to the city now with the event upon them it seemed all their preparations and strategy were as pointless as could be the lion dominated the sky if they did not end the fear that filled the city veldaren would be theirs he saw the five priests standing around the fountain that ran red with blood he saw pelarak recognizing the leader the others prayed and knelt while he watched and commanded from the corner of his eye he saw a flash of lightning knock back the lion that had given him chase he didnt know if it would resume after him or return for aurelia he prayed ashhur would watch over her but he could not go back swords ready he ran nothing but a blur of gray in the night the houses ended haern catapulted himself into the air with all the strength in his legs he dove for the fountain his sabers leading like the claws of a bird diving for its prey his cloaks trailed behind him somehow silent though they thrashed wildly he fell amid the farthest two his arms stretched wide one saber pierced through the back of a priests neck the one next to him gasped the curved blade cutting his throat they died still kneeling in prayer their faces slumped to the dirt the one on the right had shifted from his prayers as if he had heard the commotion the other continued shrieking out his devotion to karak haern rammed both his sabers through the lungs of the one on the right his back arched in pain he opened his mouth to scream but the assassin had already angled a saber around cutting deep into his neck he let out only a gurgle of blood loud as he was the other priest realized the sudden quieting of prayers he opened his eyes only to see a brief flicker of light before the tip of a saber pierced through his eye socket with a grunt haern kicked the dead priest off his sword before he could turn he felt a weight press against his shoulder pain spiked through his body the magical hand of pelarak was upon him gripping his body and sending wave after wave of torture the priest watched the assassin writhe all the while keeping his right palm stretched flat red light swirled around his hand as well as haerns body you murdered my followers pelarak said they died quick and with little pain i will not grant you that same courtesy the light turned crimson and haerns screams grew louder the whole time pelarak smiled enough delysia shouted white fireflies zipped around pelaraks body their light burning his eyes one by one they crashed against his body dissolving into luminescent sparks their holy energy burned delivered a throbbing stab against his soul his concentration broke the red light around his hands faded so the priestess finally shows her face pelarak said as delysia ran to haerns side he shrugged off the pain and let unholy energy gather at his fingertips same could be said for you she whispered as glanced over haerns body he didnt appear too wounded just in shock from the pain hed recover if given the time time though was something she would have to fight for you are a healer pelarak said as the darkness about him intensified do you think you can withstand the purity of my hatred ten small projectiles flew toward her their centers swirling an ugly brown while their outsides glowed black delysia put her hands out as if she were resisting a fall and then braced her mind the projectiles hit each one filled with an image and accompanying emotion she saw fields of desecrated bodies she saw innocents burning in fire she felt anger hatred disgust and contempt more images those of mutilated children starving women bleeding animals and ruined forests pushed into her mind to each one she countered with the image of aullienna smiling happy in her arms as she held her all around were her friends she remembered the joy and happiness and against it the anger and vile images broke clever pelarak said as the mental link the projectiles had established broke but karak has long wanted your meddlesome group removed i have seen what you dare not see two more orbs of dark memories formed at his fingers he threw the first then the second his smirk was gone the images he was sending hurt him as well but against a priestess of ashhur they would be devastating delysia prepared her defense the image came and it too was of aullienna running happily through the forest behind their tower a pang of dread hit her as she realized what she was being shown the girl climbed over a log ducked through brush and then found a stream she giggled and smiled before diving into the water the priestess tried to remember her happy her laughing in her arms as a child but all she could see was aullienna flailing water filling her tiny lungs and stealing away her life the emotion coupled with the image was also something she had not expected terrible wracking guilt you see the horrible things this world must endure because of the faith you preach she heard pelarak say you see the ruination that ashhur breeds by your rejection of the halforcs brother the second projectile hit she knew this one well and against her weakened heart she could not shrug it aside she saw brug lying numb and helpless on the ground as tessanna stood over him with her dagger in hand as the blade pierced through his eye she shrieked and begged the image to end again she felt horrible guilt this time coupled with regret she could not bear it pelarak smiled as the priestess collapsed to her knees sobbing haern lay beside her his eyes closed two of the most powerful defenders of veldaren both laid broken by his strength of will praise be to karak he prayed as he approached with death in his hands t he flames felt much hotter than before harruq grimaced and hoped aurelias spell would hold out the last thing he wanted to be was a charred meal for an overgrown cat but he would be the first to admit things never went as hoped best you got he shouted as he ran down the street the lion hot on his heels with fire shooting from its mouth harruq decided not to test his defensive spell anymore than he had to he rolled underneath the first blast and dodged the second by ducking into an alley the lion spun its body and dug its claws into the ground huge grooves cut into the dirt as it halted its momentum harruq clashed his swords together taking strength from their magic dont think you can fit in here he said to the lion but if you can i dont think your claws can match my swords want to try it evidently it did the lion snarled and lunged both shoulders slammed against the side of buildings their walls shook charring black from the heat harruq leapt back but only a little the lion tried again beams broke plaster crumbled even if the buildings had to fall it would reach him persistent bugger harruq muttered when the lion charged again he lashed out cutting a deep line across the bridge of its nose the pain only spurred it further fire flooded the alley and this time the halforc felt his skin blister the protection spell was nearly spent not good he said not good not good not good he cut at a searching paw then went on the offensive salvation and condemnation cut and spun the lion could only bat at the swords unable to use its greater size to its advantage in the cramped alley when the paw struck blade harruq pressed with all his strength the creature howled as it lost two claws nubs of flesh hanging from them the lion hobbled back limping on its wounded right paw black blood poured across the dirt harruq picked up one of the claws and hurled it at the lion the mockery angering it further it bared its teeth and prepared another blast of fire the halforc braced his arms seeing nowhere to go if he survived he could perhaps kill it before it recovered from the wound the rush of fire however never came three bolts of lightning slammed into its rear the force knocking the lion to the ground a whimper escaped its throat strange and unbecoming a lance of ice followed it crashing against its face the ice tore through its left eye rendering it blind the creature turned to run but now harruq was leaping out of the alley his twin swords hungry he slashed the tendons in its back legs tumbling the lion to the ground before it could stand a final bolt of lightning struck from the sky the giant body convulsed and a stream of molten black gunk oozed from its open mouth it moved no more how in the abyss are you not a pile of ash right now tarlak asked as he walked down the alley and slapped the warrior on the shoulder aurry harruq said the wizard chuckled of course where is our lovely elf anyway the ground shook beneath them and high in the sky the blood lion roared in exaltation the two exchanged a single look then without a word they ran toward the fountain weapons drawn and magic ready a s the huge teeth closed on her neck aurelia cast a desperate spell her body turned translucent as if it were made of smoke and light she fell through the roof her body like a ghost she landed beside a bed where two children cowered in the arms of their father their eyes were wide and all shook with deep constant fear whats going on the father asked sweat ran down his chin get under the bed she told them at first they did not move but then giant claws tore away the wood above their heads and red light flooded the room as fire poured in the elf hooked her thumbs and held her hands high palms outward a ward against fire materialized before the family a shimmering concave barrier that darkened from orange to deep red as the fire parted against it the father grabbed a son in each hand held them to his chest and then made a frantic rush for the door no wait aurelia shouted more of the roof tore away the giant feline mass crashed down claws raking and teeth biting directly beneath that mass was the family the elf cast a spell on pure instinct she clapped her hands then opened them a giant shockwave billowed out in a conic tornado of concentrated sound it struck the lion as it descended the creature bellowed in anger as it flew through a wall and out onto the street as the spell ended she heard one of the boys crying as if far away everything else was drowned out by the ringing of her ears stay inside she said though she did not hear the words she ran to the opening in the wall and looked out the lion was struggling to stand on a broken leg another marched in circles around it protectively from her vantage point she had a clear shot at both ice formed and cracked around her hands she pointed her fingers and then the ice fractured and flew the hundred shards grew larger until they were long as arrows and wickedly sharp the pacing lion saw the attack and leapt before the wounded one roaring as the ice shards pelted through its thick skin and into the muscle beneath as aurelia prepared another spell the two fled toward pelarak the wounded one trailed behind still limping but the distance was not far unable to see the elf jumped through the hole and landed on the street she saw pelarak before the fountain the bloodstained water swirling like a living snake around his legs and arms his eyes looked to the sky his mouth open in worship lying before him was the still body of delysia eschaton h aern sensed pelaraks approach as his wits slowly returned to him he heard the priests cold thanks to karak nearby delysia sobbed the assassin let a slit of light enter an eye he saw pelarak standing over them he was smiling only in absolute emptiness is there order he heard him say as he put his hand on delysias pale forehead the unholy energy surrounding his fingers crawled into her mouth and nose like vile worms the priestess neck snapped back and wideeyed she stared at the sky coughs retched from her throat haern felt a sickness stir within him he had watched brug die powerless to help him he would not suffer that fate again his arms weighed a thousand stone but still he lifted them numb fingers closed around the hilt of a saber the darkness was crawling deeper into delysia her heart was pure and the presence of unholy energy filled her with unbearable pain all doubt and fear within her was magnified tenfold her spine locked tight and she had no control over her body she knew she was gagging she knew she was dying haern took two deep breaths and flung the saber the blade spun through the air its aim true the curved end sliced across pelaraks wrist leaving a shallow cut the pain jerked his hand the darkness snapped out of delysias body she collapsed her eyes open unseeing the priest clutched his bleeding wrist and glared you will suffer dearly he snarled haern laughed weakly an exhausted grin on his face i know he said but at least you have something to remember me by pelarak was not amused he pointed his hooked fingers a bolt of shadow shooting from his palm just before the bolt hit haern enacted the magic in one of his rings he teleported ten feet into the air the bolt harmlessly hit the dirt where he had been haern shifted in air trying to angle his body just right the magic in the ring would only send him straight ahead and only once every few seconds he would have one chance when he hit the ground and only one the priest saw the assassin above and glared he would enjoy extracting what little life remained in the priestess as for haern he was a nuisance he had long tired of he fired another bolt of shadow just before he landed haern enacted the magic of his ring he reappeared forward mere inches away from the priest his elbow smashed against pelaraks forehead as the priest staggered haern reached for delysias hand if he could just touch her he could use the ring to take her with him and escape he brushed the cold skin of her fingers but then a brutal pain stabbed his chest darkness swirled around his vision and then he felt himself soaring through the air he grabbed one of his cloaks and pulled it from his body the cloak snapped firm the magic within activated haern floated to the ground blind wounded and half a mile from veldarens center pelarak towered over delysia his breathing deep and controlled in an attempt to reign in his anger he glanced about seeing his lions battling in the streets and upon the rooftops he had expected the eschaton to prove a difficult foe but this was beyond his original estimation underestimate your foe underestimate your losses he said as he knelt down and grabbed delysia by her long red hair he dragged her closer to the fountain which still pulsed red with blood from the curse he had cast upon it he placed her beside one of the mutilated bodies then let go of her hair all around lay his dead brothers killed by perfect strikes from the assassin they would suffice for reinforcements pelarak took out a dagger flipped the bodies onto their backs and then carved a rune onto their forehead he felt the lion watching him from high above the power of karak was heavy in the air a glorious night he thought one he had waited many years for he sheathed his dagger and let his faith fill him i call forth your servants pelarak said his hands to the sky the water in the fountain thrashed and bubbled the curse growing within he felt tendrils wrap around his body flowing with power he gasped in pleasure my faith denies this world he shouted and i demand you burst the chains that hold you and give unto me your servants so we may cleanse this land the runes on the dead priests foreheads flared red before exploding upward in smoke the ground shook the sky roared the bodies of the priests erupted in blood as from their chests lions emerged at first they were the size of their worldly counterparts but then grew larger and stronger once they were free of their passageway into dezrel the lions shook off the blood that stained their coats they uttered quick growls to each other greeting their fellow pack members the two wounded lions joined them dipping their heads in greeting pelarak lowered his arms as he felt the incredible power fade from his body his knees wobbled and he gripped the side of the fountain to steady himself he had not expected to need more of the lions but battle was chaotic after all when he saw the lions looking at him he bowed i am a humble servant he said the leader of the pack sniffed at him then nudged the unconscious delysia with a paw pelarak stood and redrew his knife do not doubt my strength he told the creature the dorual will walk this world again the pack leader roared and the rest of his pack took up the roar as far away a different kind of pack gathered to face the new threat s ee now tarlak said as he watched the four lions tear into their world through the bodies of the priests thats not fair they reached aurelia who stood shocked by the sight two are wounded she said as tarlak and her husband neared but even so there are six of them haerns gone and delysia she couldnt finish they watched as pelarak drew his dagger and hovered over her still body tarlaks hands shook he turned to the others unable to watch not in vain he said the hard look in his eyes scaring the couple not here not nowand not in vain lightning crackled around his hands painfully bright one of the lions spotted them and roared harruq turned his swords drawn and his hands shaking aurelias spell had done much to banish the unnatural fear from the aberration in the sky but his normal fear went untamed it grew when all six of the creatures turned and belched fire toward them the awesome display nearly broke his spirit aurelia latched onto his arm a spell on her lips there she said you will be protected from the fire again and dont run on me harruq tun dont you dare run he faced the lions which approached in a tight pack of power and muscle i wont he said as one the spellcasters unleashed blasts of ice and lightning the front lions dodged but those behind were knocked back more blasts followed and then came boulders of earth and ice cones of air and invisible walls of magic harruq watched the display awed and humbled by aurelias and tarlaks power his swords felt small and useless in his hands by comparison the lions shook their heads from side to side and endured the brutal hits using their giant mass and momentum to continue forward the three would be crushed not in vain harruq whispered hoping he could keep such a promise tarlak tried to lift one of the lions off the ground with a brute levitation spell but the creature resisted the wizard collapsed to his knees exhausted aurelia fired lances of ice but they were small compared to the previous barrage harruq stepped forward prepared to sacrifice his life to give them time to escape he was never given the chance a swirling beam of light twice the size of any man screamed between he and tarlak it struck the foremost lion enveloping its entire body in pure magical essence the power tore its skin and shattered its bones a second beam followed and this time the lions had no choice but to retreat it struck another lion but the creature rolled out from the blast melted rock poured from its nose and its right shoulder sagged stunned harruq glanced back to see the source of the attacks tessanna he said his mouth hanging open the crazed demoness had come stranger still she walked between lathaar and another man both wearing the gleaming armor of paladins tarlak looked back as well and his entire body tensed at the sight how dare she he said lightning crackled from his hands despite his exhaustion no lathaar shouted stepping in front of the girl with the solid black eyes the lightning had already been loosed mira brushed aside lathaar as if he were a child and then batted away the lightning with her bare hand tarlaks anger flared but then lathaar was running his swords drawn and light flooding the street mira he shouted her name is mira harruq looked to the lions but they were observing the new power they faced when he turned back to mira he realized the clothes she wore were different her dress was beautiful and green tailored similar to aurelias her skin was darker and her whole body thicker and healthier again he heard lathaar shout the name mira what the abyss is going on he asked the other man pulled his shield off his back and the brilliant light joined lathaars so that the street was bright as day all their fear and worry faded away behind us the man with the shield shouted positioning himself in front of aurelia and tarlak lathaar joined harruqs side glancing at him as he did we fought together once before lathaar said ready to do so again harruq nodded the lions were snarling and belching fire clearly unhappy about losing their numbers advantage so who might you be tarlak asked names jerico of the citadel the paladin said good to meet you jerico try not to die on me so i can greet you properly oh and dont let me die either the wizard held in a surge of rage as mira stood beside him he remembered lathaars words spoken in a time that felt ages away she could be her twin he had said he hadnt been lying the anger passed as he reminded himself again and again that the girl with black hair and eyes was not the murderer of his best friend the demons are scared mira said she lifted her hands and let the wild magic within her pool around her fingers they know what i am even karak fears me she brought down her hands as the lions charged down the street time to justify their fear aurelia and tarlak fired twin streams of ice shards but it was miras spell that sent the lions leaping to the rooftops a maelstrom of swirling air and magic erupted from her hands spanning the width of the street it sucked in the other two spells twisting into a vortex of ice and wind while the other lions could flee the one with the wounded leg only whimpered and braced for the hit its molten fur shredded away under the power the ice sliced every inch of its flesh dark blood clouded the maelstrom which dissipated when mira ended her concentration ice and blood rained upon the street as the lion fell dead the remaining lions dashed from roof to street to roof as spells darted after them magical arrows bolts and beams of all elements lit up the sky at last they reached the party and the four leapt as one from the rooftops about time jerico shouted as one leapt straight for him a glowing image of his shield flung outward and struck the lion the power hit its stomach like a battering ram killing all momentum the paladin gave it no reprieve striking at its sides with his mace as it hit the ground in a graceless tangle of limbs harruq and lathaar rushed their attacker their swords hacking the lion clawed and bit as its huge body slammed into the both of them it rolled head over feet as it roared the two fighters rolling with it the fire of its fur was hot to the touch but aurelias spell spared harruq lathaar had no such protection the paladin screamed in pain as he stabbed again and again into the belly of the lion the halforc slashed at its eyes scoring a wicked strike along the upper eyelid he held in a scream when two claws tore across his arm easily piercing his leather armor and shredding flesh the remaining two lions leapt at the casters both eager to devour the strange goddess among them aurelia and tarlak raised their hands and cast protection spells but mira would have none of it she flicked a wrist at each of them winds pushed them aside the first landed atop her but it passed through her body like mist the girl laughed something wrong she asked her hand reached out ghostly and ethereal when it touched the lions skin the spell enacted golden light exploded all around her painful to the eschatons eyes but absolute torture to the demons the lion flew back from her touch its right shoulder shattered the other twisted in midleap trying to hide from the glaring spell it sailed overhead and landed behind the group it leapt again avoiding a blast of lightning tarlak looped his right hand twice and then red webs fell from the sky the lion struggled but could not resist their strength it hit the street with a whimper and lay there writhing against the webs it was given no chance to recover mira pelted it with a blast of white magic so strong it peeled away fur and flesh so its bare ribs were exposed the mighty lion died whimpering not far away the lion with the wounded shoulder snarled in anger its pack was dying and karak was not pleased it glanced back to pelarak who beckoned for it to return the lion dodged a parting shot from aurelia before racing back to the priest be healed pelarak told it as he put his hands on the wounded shoulder light poured across the shoulder shaping bone and mending cartilage with a pleased roar the lion turned back to the eschaton pelarak drew his knife and urged it on the sacrifice will be made he said words of magic poured from his mouth shadow and mist swirled around the dagger as he clutched it with both hands tarlak saw the spell as well as his sister lying unconscious at his feet we have to help her he shouted he started to run but the pack leader blocked the way nearby he heard growling and shouts of pain lathaar and harruq had backed their lion against a wall and between their coordinated attacks kept it cornered jericos lion on the other hand was battered and beaten every time it attacked jerico blocked with his shield letting the holy energy seep in and destroy the demonic flesh of the beast i will keep its attention mira said as she stepped beside him hurry to her side a thousand tiny arrows flew from her hands adjusting their aim when the lion dodged at their touch the creature howled the arrows did no permanent damage instead causing sharp stinging pains multiplied by the hundreds the pain infuriated the beast aurelia increased its torment by zapping it on the nose with a bolt of lightning mad beyond reason it roared and charged tarlak ran unnoticed past the lion his eyes locked on pelarak b e darkness made flesh pelarak said as the spell neared its end the verbal components were finished he could feel the power swelling within him as he looked to the still form at his feet he saw a woman beautiful and devoted in her faith flesh so soft and a heart so kind he said sacrifice everything must involve sacrifice he knew her brother watched he let that last bit of guilt plunge the dagger into delysias breast no tarlak screamed a single spear made of fire sailing from his hands pelarak did not try to protect himself he accepted the spear with closed eyes letting the fire burn the flesh of his chest the impact knocked him against the fountain the edge cracked against his hip and he fell to one knee as pain filled his drained body the magic was gone his soul felt empty the dagger in his hands contained no magic only a dark stain of blood the wizard slowed tears running down his cheeks as he watched the shadow and darkness swirl into the wound on his sisters chest he heard a roar from the sky karak was mocking him damn you karak he said his lower lip quivering damn you and your priests too he lifted his arms into the air every bit of his power screaming into the spell when he thrust his arms down a bolt of lightning twice the width of an oak tree blasted the fountain shattering the statue of a long dead king and spilling bloodwater everywhere pelarak accepted the blast knowing death was an inevitability for his faith and the path he walked but death did not come karaks will was strong in the air and his hands protected his most faithful priest when pelarak stood tarlak knew damn well what he was seeing karak was not done mocking him then delysia rose from the ground the darkness settling upon her flesh slits opened across her face shining red eyes underneath claws stretched out from her fingers circular and long as swords the creature looked to him and snarled revealing rows of teeth sharper than daggers and just as large he sobbed the sounds of battle fading away his sisterhis beautiful sister had become he couldnt think it couldnt bear it his sister had become a dorual one of the trusted bodyguards of karak and now it charged claws out and teeth ready it would kill him and he lacked the heart to resist defeated before a single drop of blood was drawn he slumped to his knees and waited j erico dropped his mace and flung his other hand against the inside of his shield the lion had abandoned all form of tactic every time it swiped or bit his shield was there instead it flung its entire weight in hopes of crushing him against the side of a house he could feel the wood cracking against his back and his arms shook against the tremendous weight he clenched his jaw and focus his elbows would not bend his arms would not move even if bones broke he would not relinquish the holy power of his shield poured into the demon like a river at last it fell back its very being quivering too much had entered its body it collapsed white light wafting off its body like smoke from a dying fire jerico gasped in relief his shield arm falling limp at his side he retrieved his mace and took a look around their battlefield lathaar and harruq still fought against their lion but they appeared in control he didnt see mira or aurelia but he trusted their magic tarlak though he heard the wizards cry and at the sound he felt his heart sink it was the cry of a broken man he turned and saw the dorual stand the body a blot of pure darkness hovering above the street dont give in he whispered but tarlak already had jerico ran his shield leading meanwhile the dorual vanished only to reappear directly in front of the kneeling wizard claws closed around his neck as it lifted him with one hand the creature snarled at him its red eyes evil and heartless make it quick pelarak ordered as he staggered toward the pair he was an honorable man the dorual growled in response the priest shrugged his shoulders and watched with its free hand it dragged a claw across his neck and sliced open a thin red line of blood the pain sparked a bit of life into tarlak he clutched at the darkness and attempted to cast a spell but claws closed tighter choking away his breath the creature nipped at his throat with the tips of its teeth mocking him warm foul breath blew across the blood further igniting the pain torturing mocking back jerico screamed as his shield slammed into the doruals side the hit freed tarlak from its grip jerico continued to pummel it with his shield as he shouted in the name of ashhur the light and all that is good i cast you back the creature howled the darkness within its being hurt beyond measure by the holy light against his constant attacks the dorual had little chance to escape or survive pelarak ended them with a curse darkness covered jericos eyes blinding his sight the paladin swung with his mace hoping to kill the creature before it realized his weakness but the hit struck the dirt he felt something slice into his arm and then a horrid pain pierce his side he staggered back while pulling his shield close to his body you may be light in this world he heard the priest say but can you live in the darkness can you haern whispered into pelaraks ear before burying both sabers through his back and into his heart the darkness left jericos eyes the dorual was gone marching down the street were priests of ashhur their high priest calan led the way lathaar joined his side horrible burns covering his face and hands calan approached and put his hands on the wounds be healed he told the paladin and forgive us for our failure to arrive in time better late than never harruq said tramping down the street he held his right arm against his chest and winced with every step but not much at this he looked to tarlak blood ran down the wizards neck as he knelt with his hands pressed against the stone he stared at the remnants of the fountain his mind cruelly remembering every detail of the dagger plunging into his sisters chest haern approached and offered his hand tarlak didnt take it get up the assassin ordered tarlak glared but haerns look remained firm at last the mage took his hand haern pulled him to his feet and then hugged him all is not yet lost he said she still lives but as thatthat he didnt finish mira and aurelia emerged from around a corner their lion slain mira brushed away a priest who came seeking to help for she had not a single bruise on her lathaar went to her side but when he tried to speak she shushed him by putting a finger against his lips her eyes looked to the stars where the red lion still shimmered you lost this night she said she raised a hand her hair lifted as if amid an upward gale of wind the white of her eyes vanished to black the lion shook and its color ran as if it were turning liquid it gave one last furious roar before all its power broke the red funneled down swirling like a tornado a tornado that ended at miras fingertips as the last of the color swirled inside her hand she clenched it to a fist her face grew hard as stone and her eyes filled with anger and determination hope battles fear she said all eyes upon her and hope springs from faith she flung the power back to the sky but this time a golden mountain shimmered before the stars its light was soft its image subtle but it was there lathaar squeezed her hand at the sight and kissed her cheek she blushed come with us to the temple calan said as he wrapped an arm around tarlaks shoulder we need to talk not yet tarlak said pulling free from his grasp he walked to where pelaraks corpse lay amid the shattered remnants of the fountain karak has a way of bringing back the dead he said but not this time he burned the corpse to ash and then scattered it into the air a high breeze caught it and sent it south so not a speck fell amid the city that done he accepted calans arm and walked to the temple h arruq remembered the first time he and his brother had come to the temple tessanna had taken into her own body a deadly poison flowing through aurelias veins saving her the high priest calan had cured tessanna while simultaneously warning qurrah of the path they walked as harruq approached its marble walls he thought of those words and understood so many had died because his brother chose the darkness he had felt an outsider the first time he came but now he felt somewhat at home the peace and calm in the air was just what he needed calan led them inside to the giant chamber for worship row after row of benches faced an altar covered with purple silk young priests rushed in from a side door carrying blankets and food the party sat together among the benches with calan standing in the aisle beside them all along the walls torches flickered and shone sleep here this night calan said you need safety after all this not more travel were most grateful aurelia said offering thanks when it became clear tarlak would not calan handed them a few more pillows then turned to jerico a smile emerged on his face his tiredness and worry unable to hold it back praise be to ashhur he said another paladin lives jerico stood and bowed to the high priest my name is jerico of the citadel i offer you my mace and my shield should you ever need them i pray not calan said how did you survive as jerico began his story lathaar slid beside harruq and aurelia the elf was curled into his arms her head resting on his chest she looked asleep but he knew she wasnt the halforc nodded in acknowledgment he opened his mouth to say something then stopped i spoke with keziel the head cleric of the sanctuary lathaar began dont worry about it harruq interrupted im sorry harruq but hewhat happened is aullienna alright aurelia stirred she put her fingers against harruqs lips to keep him from speaking she drowned the elf said her voice soft and sad brug is dead as well tessanna killed him the paladins jaw clenched tight as he held back his anger he could see the pain in harruqs eyes and he knew any condemnation against qurrah would only worsen it im sorry he said meanwhile jerico had finished his story and calan had more pressing matters to attend tarlak remained silent and dejected his face looked ashen his eyes fixated on the floor the priest knelt beside him she is not dead calan whispered and i dont say this to offer some meager comfort amid your grief the spell cast upon her is brutal yes but it does not kill the host the dorual will use her life to cling to this world if we act fast enough tarlak looked up his eyes were red and tears welled up ready to fall i know she can be saved he said you think i dont know that you think i dont cling to that hope but right now she is helpless while the most vile and horrific thoughts are rammed into her mind by the demon that possesses her even if we save her she might never be the same youre wrong mira said she had remained quiet ever since entering the temple but now she stood her shyness shedding away the suffering we go through does not change who we are only reveal our true self if you love her then you will have your sister back once more tarlak stood taking his blanket with him he looked around at the priests and the eschaton an angry defiance raging within i may not grieve for her death he said but i can grieve for her suffering now leave me be he moved to the other side of the chamber wrapped himself in the white blankets and did his best to sleep calan chewed on his lower lip as he watched the mage go then stood and addressed the rest get some sleep you all need it and as do i with that he left for his own bedchamber exhausted and troubled the rest of the eschaton did their best to sleep m iles away a shape blacker than the night fled west through the forest guided by the whispers of the dark god deep within the shade delysia wordlessly screamed o ne day from veldaren one day and qurrah couldnt find tessanna he searched the camps where the wolfmen slept but she was not there he searched the legions of orc tents but she was not there he searched the tight packs the hyenamen slept and ate in she was not there at last he asked velixar she needs time velixar said will you give it to her he sighed and said he would good the man in black said wait until nightfall then head south follow the stream trust me qurrah it is for the best qurrah had seen velixar and tessanna talking over the past weeks as they marched through the vile wedge collecting their armies some joined willingly some did not but the numbers of their soldiers and the power of their magic destroyed any who resisted the army began its march but qurrah stayed at velixars request for a moment he felt panic seeing his army leave without him he knew velixar needed him though just as he needed velixar in the sudden calm that filled the armys departure his fears and his doubts were free to torment him he knew he would meet his brother in conflict the eschaton would not let the city fall without a fight did he wish his brother dead what about tarlak and delysia who had taken him in an image flashed before his eyes it was of harruq his skin pale and his eyes lifeless he was just one of hundreds marching mindlessly to his command or was it velixars command he didnt know he didnt know if it mattered either way the image churned his stomach and filled him with dread night came he followed the stream south the moon was bright and even without his orcish blood he would have had little trouble seeing he had spent so much time with the army he had forgotten how much he enjoyed the quiet solitude of the stars he kept his thoughts calm and controlled as he walked he wanted to think of nothing once karak was freed he could be gone from the worries the fear and the guilt dezrel inflicted upon him he would go where his brother never existed and none would ever know the atrocities they had done or the murder they shared an owl hooted twice and when he looked up to search for it he saw the pond it was almost too large to call a pond the banks stretching for hundreds of feet the water was crystalline and beautiful the surface was calm so that the moon and stars shone elegant upon the water standing before the pond her arms at her side and her back to him was tessanna sometimes i remember life before you tessanna said all those nights qurrah nodded but said nothing he did not understand what was going on but he could feel the significance many nights were cold or lonely sometimes i had bodies for warmth but always the night stayed cold but there were good nights qurrah i want you to know that she turned to face him her arms were crossed and she looked so young since ive been with you ive known hurt she said i thought i couldnt hurt anymore but i have i never thought i would ever need someone so much itd scare me but i do she uncrossed her arms with slow small movements she let her dress fall to the ground exposing her naked flesh i love you qurrah said everything i do its because i know she said this body is yours qurrah many have had it but tonight gently she traced her fingers down her neck past the curve of her breasts and to her belly tonight is special take off your clothes he did his heart pounded in his ears she was so beautiful but what was going on he felt he was swimming in power and drowning in magic i want you to know i can live without you she said as she dipped a foot into the pond i would hate every second but i would live not after tonight velixar has given me something i never thought i could have she stopped walking when the water was up to her waist she reached out a hand and beckoned him in the dead of winter he knew he should be cold he knew his frail body would shiver and break in the water but the water was warm to his touch the sense of magic swarming around him thickened at tessannas beckon he embraced her tonight she whispered into his ear tonight under these stars in this water i can conceive will you give this to me will you give this of yourself he had never believed such a thing possible but as she wrapped her legs around him and guided him into her he knew the answer aulliennas face flashed before his mind he had taken her from tessanna and tonight he might somehow make amends after what i have done he said as his breaths quickened of course i will standing within the water they made love their movements were slow careful at last she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him below the surface baptizing them in the name of velixar and karak when he tore his head above the water and screamed out in ecstasy he felt the eyes of gods upon him his lover emerged with him gasping in pleasure a twinkle was in her eye the act was done tessanna was with child t hey elected to walk back to velixar and the army qurrah felt he was exiting a dream the cold of the wind came biting back and he shivered underneath his layers of clothing no matter how close to a fire he sat or how much clothing he wore he always felt cold in winter tessanna did not complain or show discomfort but her lips were blue and her teeth chattered with each step despite all this they wanted to walk they needed to talk velixar offered this to me she said answering the question she knew her lover kept unspoken he said karak knew my prayers though i never sent them to him he told me to travel to the pond and wait for you there if i offered myself to you and to the dark god i would have a child a daughter she looked to him tears streaming down her face though her voice remained firm ive always wanted a daughter she said im not ready to be a father he said our life our actionswhat will become of any child following our footsteps she took his hand into hers and kissed his fingers by the time i give birth we will be gone from here our daughter can live a life free of this place i can give her the childhood i was denied she looked to the stars and giggled mommy isnt happy with me right now and she isnt happy with karak either will you still be able to aid me and velixar in opening the doorway he asked her to this she turned and glared i am not weak now she said a sudden venom filling her words never think that of me i didnt qurrah said i justwait a moment something approaches he stopped her then narrowed in his eyes in the darkness he saw a shape running toward them it was humanoid though its body was hunkered down so he could not see much else tessanna lifted her hand so that fire swirled from her fingers unbelievable she said licking her lips karak has sent us a gift the shape slowed once it reached the edge of light created by tessannas fire it was a being of pure shadow its ethereal presence swirling like black smoke in the darkness glowing red slits for eyes leered at them when the creature snarled rows of sharp teeth glistened what is this thing qurrah asked tessannas hand closed and the fire vanished in only the starlight the creature was free to approach it stood directly before them and growled softly qurrah felt his skin crawl at the sound i know this scent tessanna said her hand creeping toward the things neck i know this body the shadow being retreated before her hand shriveling back like a snake shedding its skin qurrah startled at the revealed face and neck of delysia eschaton she looked catatonic tessanna rubbed her neck with her fingers then pressed them against her lips i love the taste she said licking her fingers with her other hand she drew her dagger the purity of her blood what are you doing qurrah asked the girl turned to him and beamed the wildness in her eyes horrified him isnt it clear karak gives me a child so i take a child from ashhur she is a gift a sacrifice an omen choose whatever sounds best to you tessanna stunned him by leaning forward and kissing delysias lips her dagger trailed upward drawing a thin red line from the bottom of delysias neck to the cleft of her chin she licked the blood from her dagger and giggled i could get used to this enough qurrah said send her back why she asked do you care for her she worships a false god and even worse lets such a perfect body go to waste the halforc grabbed her wrist and held it firm he glared at her every part of his being refusing to back down you have killed enough of those close to my brother he said no more he was not prepared for the rage that seethed inside his lover when she spoke her voice was calm but her entire body shook and quivered i have killed she said is that how you see it i killed brug it was my desire my idea that killed aullienna is it is that how you sleep at night is that how you banish your guilt by casting it to me she yanked her arm free from his grasp the love they shared just an hour ago seemed ancient and lost to qurrah even worse her words tore at his guiltwracked mind again he thought of an undead harruq marching at his command and felt his heart split you dont understand he began but tessanna cut him off by thrusting the hilt of her dagger into his open palm take it she said take it and listen we are condemned by our actions or we are free of them we are murderers or we are victims you will kill again will you feel its guilt only for those you know a life taken is a life taken qurrah will you succumb to guilt or not he closed his hand around the dagger and looked to the imprisoned delysia i dont know he said i dont feel guilt i justi dont want to hurt my brother not any more than i already have even if he hurts me she slipped behind him her hands trailing around his neck and shoulders but the choice is the same for him she whispered if he had never chosen his lover over you then the hurt would never be he chose his path he chose his hurt will you be slave to it he looked at delysias beautiful frozen horrified face she was alive inside he knew he could smell her fear his fist clenched tight be gone he said waving his hand the essence of the dorual shrieked in anger but could not refuse the power of his words or the magic that spiked from his fingers the girl collapsed as the rest of the darkness dissipated delysia gasped in air her eyes locked open the halforc stood over her dagger in hand the hand shook how many times he said how many times must i question myself how many times must i doubt the path i walk how many how many the priestess coughed once then blinked her fingers clutched the grass a reflex as the woman gulped in air i will not he said his heart was in his throat he felt his soul quivering i will not do this anymore he knelt down pulled delysias head up by her hair and then sliced open her throat blood poured over his hands and onto the grass she made no sound as she stared at him with eyes that were full of despair he stared right back as deep inside him he felt something die he dropped her head to the dirt and then looked to the dagger in his hand there tessanna said as she wrapped her arms around his neck now the blood is on both our hands as it always should have been a life for a life he said mesmerized by the crimson droplets dripping from the edge will it be enough the darkness swirled around them then collected into a doorway that velixar stepped through qurrah knelt at his entrance while tessanna curtseyed the man in black eyed the body then clapped his hands together all as i hoped he said he knelt and touched the body shadows lifted it from the ground they took shape becoming a longlegged spindlyarmed creature without eyes or a mouth the thing held delysias body in its arms and sprinted east with blinding speed velixar bade his disciple to rise a man dear to me passed away this night he said and now they will suffer in turn you are strong qurrah and you grow stronger still come your army awaits my army he muttered he clutched the dagger tight with both hands and looked at his master please take us to my army another portal of shadow opened velixar stepped through followed by tessanna out of sight qurrah finally let the tears free he wanted to kneel and beg for his brother to forgive him but instead he placed the dagger underneath his right eye and slashed downward he screamed his tears mixed with blood before he lost his nerve he placed the dagger underneath his left eye and did the same i will not cry for you anymore brother he told the darkness let my tears mix with blood so i may remember this vow he slid the bloody weapon into the sash of his robe and stepped through neither tessanna nor velixar asked about the wounds upon his face it was if somehow they understood h arruq awoke with a screaming headache and a throbbing pain in his side he guessed the headache to be from hunger and exhaustion and the pain from the hilt of his sword digging into his side he rubbed his eyes and looked about the rest of the eschaton were asleep on the pews a few torches flickered and died bathing him in darkness tun the halforc spun for the voice had come from behind nothing just a closed door he thought perhaps it was haern testing him but he was curled up in a bundle of gray robes beside aurelia it wasnt tarlak either for the mage slept in the far corner twitching and shifting as if trapped in unpleasant dreams betrayer he drew his swords their red light seemed demonic in the holy place harruq debated waking the others so few would call him betrayer only qurrah he felt a shiver crawl up his spine there was another who would label him as such do you suffer yet he knew that voice that cold feeling the man in black had returned show yourself harruq whispered he stood in the aisle between the pews constantly spinning and searching listen to me harruq tun you can avoid more pain you can avoid more suffering take your lover and go what is it you want harruq asked the silence what is it that brought you back from the abyss where you belonged you lost a daughter do not lose more you can still come to my fold you can join your brother and fight at his side do not let pain cloud your judgment the halforc approached the giant doors to the temple his armor creaked and he kept waiting for someone to wake from his noise none did i am not what you wanted he whispered i am not what you tried to make me be you failed velixar and damn me for letting qurrah fail with you my life for you that was your promise if you deny me what was promised then i must take it from another and another until your life is either mine or ended there is no other way you and your friends killed one dear to me i have done so in kind suffer harruq tun suffer in your betrayal the halforc kicked open the door swords raised to strike velixar was not there only the cold body of delysia his blood froze his swords fell from his hands and their loud ringing upon hitting the stone awoke the others he staggered back slamming the door shut to block the sight he fell to his knees his hands digging into his face her throat was cut her clothes tornbut most damning was the single word carved across her forehead tun whats going on haern asked the first to reach his side when harruq did not answer he pushed open the door all time halted for the assassin he did not move he did not breath when time resumed he sheathed his blades and knelt beside her body he lifted her into his arms and carried her inside the others were waking each stirring from a deep sleep harruq kept his eyes shut hating his brother more than he had ever hated someone in his life and then he heard tarlaks cry what happened he heard him shout no shes alright sheshe he opened his eyes at the sound of tarlaks weeping somehow the torches had been relit delysia lay on the floor before tarlaks curled form aurelia was at his side her arms around him he accepted the embrace and buried his face into her bosom haern stood by them tears on his face even mira cried overwhelmed by the sorrow her keen mind drank in from the room only the paladins remained firm hear me tarlak lathaar said kneeling beside delysias body there is no emptiness in my words only truth and compassion she has gone to a place beyond our suffering she dwells in a land foreign to our tears everything we feel we feel for ourselves my sister tarlak sobbed my only sister lathaar took her body into his arms and stood ashhur gave her life and now he has taken that life back to his arms he carried her outside tarlak followed at aurelias insistence harruq stayed where he was when the wizard cast his eyes to him he dared not meet them when the door slammed shut the halforc thought himself alone he was not get up harruq looked up to see jerico standing over him his arms crossed i said get up leave me be harruq grumbled jerico struck his fist against the halforcs face the pain flared his anger and he glared death at the paladin what the abyss is the matter it is one thing to mourn jerico said but you arent mourning youre drowning yourself in guilt and grief that was your name carved upon her forehead wasnt it harruqs look was answer enough why then what is the meaning behind it answer me a long time ago me and qurrah swore our lives to karak he said he didnt want to but he couldnt stop staring at jericos eyes they imprisoned him i turned my back on karak when i fell in love with aurelia qurrah fell in love with a girl named tessanna aurry pulled me away from the darkness but tess just pulled qurrah further and further in tessanna is the other daughter of balance jerico asked harruq shrugged dont know what youre talking about no matter the paladin said another time so now karak tortures you for your choice he does not take kindly to those who escape his grasp you may be just one life but just as ashhur celebrates with every soul that welcomes him into their heart so too does karak fume with each loss brug delysia aullienna harruq shook his head how many will he take how many will suffer for my sins none will and none have jerico said your sins havent earned you the pain you feel it is the good in your life karak could not hurt those you love without you loving them in the first place would you sacrifice everything good just to avoid your pain ive slain children harruq said confessing though he knew not why and when my daughter was killed i thought it punishment for my crimes and so you felt the burden yours jerico said finishing the thought will you let every good deed you perform be overshadowed by your past if so there is no point go join your brother join karak but if you wish your sins forgotten join us with ashhur and accept the grace he freely offers the darkness in your life is caused by others not the past you seek atonement from harruq fiddled with his swords uncomfortable and confused you make it sound so easy he said a bit of the hardness left jericos face trust me its a heavy burden but i do not carry it alone ill be outside you should help bury her it is only right the paladin left harruq alone in the chamber of worship in the silence he thought over jericos words they did seem too easy too simple but how many days had he spent with the eschaton without guilt fear or condemnation of his past it seemed only his brother obsessed over who they had been qurrah never believed people could change perhaps that was why he seemed so alien to him now if youre listening harruq whispered help me figure this out it was the closest thing to a prayer he had made since the death of his daughter f or a moment haern and tarlak wearily argued for an eschaton burial but lathaar would hear none of it youve buried enough he had said to the wizard let me bear the burden lathaar carried her in his arms while the others followed him to the western wall two nervous guards stood before it open the gate tarlak said in a cracking voice he produced his sigil showing his allegiance with the king now the guards obeyed theyre just on edge after the spell cast over the city lathaar said as they exited the city id wager that they cowered and hid every time the lion in the sky roared they didnt go far west off the road was a large common grave in its center was a stone slab for those who preferred the burning of bodies to burial lathaar picked a spot on the edge of the grounds and nodded there they had no tools to dig instead aurelia raised her hands and whispered a spell the dirt shook and cracked a perfect slab rose into the air hovered a moment and then broke into tiny pieces lathaar set her body within the grave and shook his head at aurelia no magic for this part he said our hands will suffice silence overcame them as each looked down at the still body the word tun glared out at them from her forehead disgusted mira took a handful of dirt and blew white sparkles filled her breath the dirt flew to the letters smoothing and compressing until a thin layer covered them harruq was grateful but when he opened his mouth to thank her he found it dry and uncooperative its always my job to say something tarlak said every bit of his being fought to collect itself to toughen against his pain it was a monumental effort and all there could see the will within him was strong even so aurelia gently placed her hand on his lips and kissed his cheek not this time she whispered jerico and lathaar exchanged looks jerico was the older and by tradition was to speak at a burial but lathaar had known delysia in person familiarity won out over tradition all of us here lathaar began every one of us knows how to kill every one of us has but delysia was a healer what we accomplished through strength and magic she did through love and kindness as we made a better place through our sword and fire she made a better place by her forgiveness and compassion she touched each one of us and saved so many while we may harden our hearts against the world for her passing may each one of us remember that the strength of her love and conviction is no less weakened nor voided by her death he took a handful of dirt and let it fall into the grave she is with ashhur now finish the burial when the last of the dirt filled the grave lathaar stabbed two thick branches into the earth forming a simple triangle somber and exhausted the eschaton lingered unsure of what to do it was haern who broke the silence and it was a sentiment harruq recognized harm had befallen them and he wanted vengeance i can lead us to the priests he said his sabers were already drawn we have tolerated their presence long enough delysia would not approve tarlak said i do not share that sentiment the assassin said their leader glanced around gauging everyones feelings he had denied retribution against qurrah and for that aullienna and brug had died he had denied retribution against the dark priests and now his sister lay buried before him could he do it again my heart is not ready for battle he said at last not this night but we will he stared straight at the assassin and promised we will mira wandered amid the graveyard her eyes closed and her arms outstretched her aimlessness reminded harruq so much of tessanna as he watched her her back was to him so he could not see the horrible pain across her face only when lathaar called her name did they see her torment too soon she said theyre too soon what do you mean dear aurelia asked she pointed west they followed her gaze and there they saw the faint line of torches lining the horizon aurelia gasped for her eyes were far keener than the others an army she said as if she herself could not believe it thousands strong what devilry is this lathaar and jerico exchanged a glance they had not revealed their failure yet but it seemed they had no choice qurrah has darakkens spellbook lathaar said he winced at the ashen look that covered tarlaks face please im sorry he attacked the sanctuary and stole it from the hearth its not qurrah harruq said stealing attention away from the paladin condemning his brother its velixar thats his army hes done this before several years ago doesnt matter who tarlak interrupted the priests were there to soften the city for the attack and they did a damn good job too do what you can that army will be here by the dawn haern grabbed tarlaks arm and stopped his casting of a portal where are you going he asked to warn antonil tarlak said glaring at the hand on his arm and then grab a moment of rest ill be worthless without it he yanked his arm free and finished his spell he entered the swirling blue portal without another word the rest watched him go ill start rallying troops jerico said glancing back to the city we might have a chance if we hold the two gates karaks image in the sky will have shaken most of the guards faith we need to restore it ashhur be with us all lathaar said bowing to the others the two paladins ran back to the city mira followed you both will be needed haern said running a hand through his hair weve all seen what your brother and his lover can do if velixar is with them even the citys walls will not be enough to protect us harruq said nothing aurelia wrapped her arms around his waist and held him close as the assassin left the two stared at the line of torches in the dark aurelia filled with worry and harruq with guilt my brother he said because of my brother and therein lies the blame aurelia said not you easy words how many will die tonight aurelia pulled on his shoulder and forced his eyes to meet hers she was a living blessing in the moonlight a beautiful creature hundreds of years old and filled with grace and wonder and she kissed the simple plain man she loved not us she said and remember which side of the walls you are on you will fight to save not to kill now come she took his hand and led him back to the city t arlak closed the portal immediately after exiting not wanting anyone to follow while he had said he was going to speak with antonil he had instead sent himself to the eschaton tower with a wave of his hand he opened the front door and rushed inside the others had been too focused on aurelias description of what she saw to notice he had cast a divination spell he had seen wolfmen hyenamen birdmen orcs and goblins all marching in unison not since the original days of the brothers war had such an army existed he came to the eschaton tower because he expected never to return his room was first tarlak scooped up scrolls from his shelves and tossing them into his hat which seemed to never fill he went to delysias room next wincing at all the signs of the life he took a few pieces of jewelry brug had made for her and then closed the door he skipped haerns room knowing the assassin always kept everything he needed close on person outside harruq and aurelias room he paused thinking of what they might want from within might as well check he said and placed his hand on the door only to realize it was ajar his hair stood on end and somehow he knew it was no accident or happenstance slowly he pushed it open thankful it was welloiled as to not creak sitting with her legs curled underneath her was tessanna gently running her hand through the illusory grass aurelia had created with her magic with the door open he could hear her softly singing his hands trembled brug had died by her dagger and all the while she had laughed laughed her back was to him helpless he thought power swelled into his hands begging for release he held it in something was too sad about the scene and then he heard crying im sorry aully he heard her say big dogs coming and hes coming for you her grief was so great he felt like an intruder in his own tower where was the simplicity he had felt only minutes ago his hands lowered and the magic around them faded away a piece of bone pressed against the back of his neck he tensed and his heart leapt as he heard raspy breathing from behind a life for a life qurrah whispered you spared her so i spare you the bone piece left when tarlak turned around qurrah stared at him with arms crossed and his whip in hand the bone hovered in orbit around his head like a morbid halo two scars ran down the side of his face angry and red his tears have become acid tarlak thought the contempt and vileness he saw in qurrahs eyes made it seem almost possible weve seen your army the wizard whispered do you come to conquer or destroy youll fight me either way qurrah responded so that is an answer you dont need your city is doomed tell my idiot brother to flee while he still can tessanna heard their talking and stood she smiled back to tarlak even though tears ran down her cheeks you know he wont she said answering for him which makes it all the sadder tell them im sorry too but i will kill all of you if i must as will qurrah leave tarlak please leave he walked down the stairs slow and dignified he would run from no one when he reached the outside he opened a portal to veldaren thoughts raced through his head under no circumstances would he give their message to harruq he glanced back one last time at his home as a part of him realized why qurrah and tessanna had come back youll never have what they had he said to the highest floor before stepping inside unaware of the life already growing inside tessannas womb a ntonil had slept poorly ever since the lion appeared in the sky when its roar shook the city he had cowered like the rest of his soldiers and the shame of it scarred his honor several hours had passed with him falling in and out of fitful sleep haunted by dreams of facing legions of dark shapes while he wielded only a broken sword when the blue portal ripped open in his room he lurched forward and grabbed his sword which lay next to him on the bed easy tarlak said as he stepped out to find the tip near his throat its just me your local friendly wizard forgive me antonil said putting the sword down ive just been edgy since wellim sure you saw it more than saw it the mage said his whole persona darkening priests of karak unleashed that blasphemy upon the sky delysia is dead the priests killed her antonil opened and closed his mouth the grogginess in his head refused to clear but piercing that grogginess was the gentle face and red hair of the priestess his heart panged with guilt we should have been there he said my guards my soldiers we only cowered while you fought it doesnt matter tarlak interrupted what matters is that an army marches toward the city almost ten thousand strong orcs the guard captain asked yes tarlak said but also hyenamen and wolfmen even birdmen march alongside thisll make the orc attack several years ago look like childs play antonil rubbed his thumb and forefinger against his eyelids are you sure he asked as he blinked away the rest of his sleepiness no i just enjoy waking people in the middle of the night and scaring them yes im sure get your guards stationed wake up every man who owns a sword and then put them before the gates antonil leapt from his bed still wearing the underpadding of his armor he put the rest of his goldtinted armor on in mere moments buckling and strapping it on as he talked if they arent equipped with siege weaponry then theyre going to throw their numbers against the gates and see if itll break if we position enough weight on the other side and place archers you dont understand tarlak said he stepped back as antonil swung an arm around nearly clobbering him in the head in his attempt to fasten a buckle near the back of his waist his room was well furnished but still small only the king had a gigantic room for his own inside the castle the man in black the necromancer who commanded the orcs that last attackhe leads this one as well antonil paused his sword belt in mid buckle are you sure he asked tarlak rolled his eyes didnt i answer that already last time that man shook our walls with his sorcery antonil said he destroyed the western gate as if it were made of sticks and mud are you telling me that same man marches against our town with five times the numbers now it was tarlaks turn to rub his eyes with his fingers did our great guard captain develop a hearing problem over the last five minutes antonil buckled his belt and sheathed his sword he took his shield off a rack and slung his arm through the two straps at last he donned his helmet he looked regal and deadly in the golden hue i must alert the king he said send someone else tarlak said we need you at the walls if anyone else tells him but me antonil said a strange hardness in his eyes he will not believe them so be it the eschaton will help you but we will not follow the orders of the king he grabbed the mans arm as he turned to leave antonil he said there is a very real possibility the city will fall they do not march to occupy they will kill every one of us some even eating our remains if that will happenabandon the city please the guard captain pulled his arm free of his grasp i will obey my king he said he left to visit the kings private bed chambers tarlak swore as he paced the small room everyone has to make things so bloody complicated he said as crossed his arms and glared at the floor if antonil followed the kings orders not a soul would be allowed to flee hed bury everyone in his paranoia and selfishness ever since the elven assassin had taken his left ear to the abyss with it all tarlak said i just want to burn stuff he opened a portal to the city walls and stepped through a t first the soldiers barred them from the walls but then haern showed them his sigil my apologies watcher of the king one of the soldiers said offering a clumsy bow he moved away from the stone steps letting them pass haern led the way followed by the paladins all along the wall soldiers prepared arrows and readied armor jerico guessed at the numbers and was none too pleased with his estimate there cant be more than three hundred he said haern nodded as he scanned the horizon they were above the western gate which was sure to take the brunt of the attack he watched the sea of torches marching closer his stomach hardening the king lost too many to the orcs siege and then the elves at woodhaven haern said three hundred archers and two thousand footmen are all he commands rumors say its more than just orcs coming a soldier beside them said he looked old and grizzled neither paladin was familiar with veldarens military ranks but the man was clearly not of a lower station do they lathaar asked the whole wedge is coming the wolf and bird and hyena the man nodded towards the torches both his hands gripping his bow tight he was missing two of his fingers on his left hand and where did you hear this jerico asked that man the soldier said pointing farther south along the wall it was still dark but in the torchlight tarlaks pointy yellow hat stood out above the metal and armor excuse me haern said slipping past and chasing after he found tarlak cheering and slapping archers on the backs and arms encouraging as only he could kill twenty of those orcs and ill polymorph your motherbymarriage into a goat he said fifty and ill make her a toad hate your hair hate your face ill change it too only fifteen kills each oh you sir ill even give you a discount since youre nose is so tarlak haern said grabbing the wizard and turning him about we need to talk howdy haern tarlak said grinning at him ready for some mindless slaughter i hear there are more than orcs coming the assassin whispered what did you see his grin faded but when he saw others looking at him and perked right up when they hit the walls theyre all yours tarlak shouted so dont have too much fun as they pretend they can climb with their bare hands he leaned in next to haern and whispered all races of the wedge haern every blasted mongrel were outnumbered ten to one the assassin grabbed him by the collar and yanked him closer they will bury us he whispered back the whole city will burn then well burn with it tarlak whispered scared of a little fun haern besides youre worth a couple hundred kills im good for a few hundred as well aurry lathaar jericohow many can mira handle were their hope their only chance and i will not let us descend into cowardice and retreat now go back to the west gate and cause chaos like i know you can thats an order yes lord eschaton haern said his voice and subsequent bow filled with sarcasm he returned to the paladins and drew them close so others would not hear twenty thousand against our two according to tarlak both nodded neither appearing surprised to the ground jerico said i will defend the west gate if it breaks the troops there will need me lathaar drew his swords their glow shining bright in the night ill be there with you i was not there at the sanctuary i will make amends mira grabbed lathaars hand and squeezed it tight ill stay here she said and ill do what i can they wont be ready for me no one ever is lathaar said he kissed her cheek and joined jerico and haern down the stairs mira a tiny diminutive figure amid the bustling soldiers waved she looked so out of place the man with missing fingers put his hand on her shoulder and asked her to seek shelter no she said a bit of fire sparking in her eyes im here to protect you the soldier let her be and if any raised eyebrows or gestured toward her he only shook his head and sent them on their way h arruq and aurelia stationed themselves at the southern gate using a portal to get up top at first the soldiers there startled and drew their swords but a glare from the halforc sent them back get to work he growled were here to help and you best like it such a silver tongue for a brute aurelia said she smiled and poked his side save the gruff its going to be a long night you mean day the halforc pointed east where the first glimmer of sunrise pierced the sky its already been a long night the distant army grew closer the glow of the torches stronger aurelia watched her brow wrinkled orcs see perfectly in the dark she wondered why do they carry torches velixars making them do it harruq replied gripping his sword hilts for comfort has to be its the fear the numbers same for that damn lion in the sky if he had his way wed throw open the gates the second he got here and beg him to command us his priests failed aurelia said as will he and if not the elf crossed her arms and frowned at her husband alright mister enough of that she gestured to the soldiers about her scared and exhausted for their sake she said her voice quieter he nodded and kept the rest of his fears silent his mood brightened a bit when tarlak appeared walking along the walls slapping and joking with every archer along the way when he reached the two he smiled and tipped his hat ready for an orc roast of epic proportions he asked more ready than i thought harruq said smiling in spite of it all good to have you here tar same for you the wizard said the joy and foolishness in his eyes bleeding away his whole body was trembling it seemed the specter of delysia hovered behind his eyes just waiting for him to break the smile returned with greater strength than harruq could imagine tarlak pushed the ghosts away it does mean a lot you know the wizard said we know aurelia said youre a good friend aye harruq said his hands latched tight around the hilts of his swords together the three waited for karaks axe to fall upon their city t he king slept in a bedchamber beside his throne room two guards stood beside the door anxious and alert the roars of the lion had scared them and now they heard alarms of an orc army approaching when antonil pushed open the huge double doors to enter the throne room the guards knew by his armor that the alarms were true he strode over to them and saluted wake the king he ordered the right guard tapped against the door antonil pushed him aside and slammed his fist against the thick wood king vaelor he shouted your majesty you are needed he heard shuffling then a clank of wood and metal as the lock was thrown open the door crept open a crack for what reason do you interrupt my sleep the king asked through the crack my apologies antonil said after bowing an army comes and i seek your council remain here until i am ready his king commanded the door slammed shut antonil opened his mouth to argue then closed it his blood boiled and he slammed his shield against a wall not caring that he dented it damn fool he muttered his glare to the guards made it clear that repeating that outburst meant death the two saluted understanding perfectly antonil paced before the door seething as the time passed he needed to be commanding his guards positioning and rallying them into a fighting state instead he was stuck inside the castle bereft of all news twenty minutes later the king exited his bed chambers he wore armor made of gold it was soft impractical but it looked beautiful in the torchlight and antonil knew that was what mattered to his liege a garishly jeweled sword swung from a belt trimmed with silver a red cape hung from his neck upon his head was the crown of veldaren it had once been a simple ring of gold with a ruby upon the front but vaelor had declared it unfitting of a true king adding several large gems and rubies attached to the bottom of the crown was a veil of red silk recently added to hide the loss of the kings left ear sir your attire antonil said is this not how a king should be dressed for battle vaelor asked my men have needed me he argued could you not have spoken with me before you dressed forfor battle do you dare question your king vaelor asked he crossed his arms and frowned he was not much older than antonil and when they were children training together they had been mistaken for brothers due to their similar looks but now antonils face and hands were worn and calloused the king lacked a single scar on his pampered skin his beard was trimmed and hair neatly curled around his shoulders not a strand too long or too short only his ear marred the image no sir antonil said bowing forgive me i am just worried they are far more than i have ever faced all the races of the vile wedge have allied against us they will destroy every life in our fair city if we let them king vaelor walked to his throne and sat down do as you must he said i trust you to keep our city safe no sir you dont understand antonil stepped forward his worry overcoming his discipline we have no troops mustered from the reaches of neldar the green castle as well as all of the hillocks are most likely destroyed if this were a siege we could hold out for months lord gandrem would ride the host of felwood through the northern plains and crush our foes against our walls so too would lord meren ride up from angelport a whole legion of his archers ready to feather our enemies antonil knew he treaded on dangerous ground but he had no choice but to continue but they will not he said this is no siege the beasts of the wedge will storm our walls our troops are weak in number and wholly unprepared we should order the populous to ready a retreat if one of the gates falls we can what is this king vaelor asked his voice thundering in the empty throne room retreat you would surrender our walls to orcs and dogs i will not be written into the history of our world as such a coward already woodhaven has been lost to the elves because of your weakness you will fight to the death to protect what we all hold dear you have defeated the orcs once you will do so again it is not cowardice to think of protecting the commonfolk should we fail but it is cowardice by failing those helpless before that battle was even begun the guard captain turned away his fury rising with the stinging mention of woodhaven he was arguing with his king had times truly sunk so low very well he said falling to one knee and bowing his head i will not fail you king vaelor put his hand on antonils shoulder we will be praised in songs for ages to come after our victory this night he said antonil thought a funeral dirge was more likely with his kings permission he left to join his men when antonil arrived at the western gate he was immediately aware something was amiss his generals had done well to position and defend during his absence but they were all terrified even the grizzled old men who had fought many a battle appeared ready to cast aside their weapons the guard captain bound up the steps and joined his archers determined to find out the reason when he saw the ocean of bodies approaching he understood their fear leading the army were the birdmen clutching their torches in their clawed and misshapen hands long feathers stretched out from their forearms a mockery of their lost ability to fly their heads were small dominated by their giant beaks of all colors behind them were the wolfmen they were bigger than the hyenamen their skin gray and their bodies lean and muscular their backs were heavily curved causing their long arms to drag near the ground their awkward walk vanished when they ran their bodies balanced for running on all fours the hyenamen were the last of animal men and their yipping was already reaching the city they looked like smaller cousins of the wolfmen except their skin was yellow and black and their legs better suited for walking and running upright then came the orcs howling and waving their torches antonil frowned as he saw their banners it was the lion standard of karak youre right to be afraid a quiet voice told him he glanced left to see mira smiling at him with twinkling eyes but you neednt be they havent seen what i can do go down the stairs the paladins are waiting for you paladins he looked behind him and sure enough he saw the telltale glow of white and blue he gave one last strange look to the girl with black eyes and climbed back down from the wall paladins of ashhur he shouted buried in the center of the hundreds of footmen lined before the gate shone two swords and a shield come forth jerico and lathaar knelt before the guard captain as the man approached we come to offer our aid and the aid of ashhur lathaar said if there was ever a time we needed ashhurs aid it is now antonil said but i thought only one remained i hid but no longer jerico answered i ask you let us fight alongside your men in defense of this city antonil pointed to the locked and barred gate i have heard stories of paladins fighting off hundreds before falling in death lets put those stories to the test to the front if the heathen creatures burst through ashhurs light will wait for them lathaar said as he stood the two took their positions antonil watched them shouting and ordering around his men the sun was rising but darkness remained heavy in the hearts of his men fear was the weapon of karak and antonil knew nothing turned aside that weapon better than a paladin we will hold the gate someone whispered into antonils ear he didnt need to look to know who it was if you are here as well haern then im sure we will antonil said archers and ground troops ready the guard captain and his personal guards marched to the southern gate they had half the ground troops but the gate was thinner and the street narrower antonil expected the strongest blows to fall against the west when he arrived he saw his best general sergan shouting with a voice rapidly approaching hoarseness greetings sergan antonil said saluting the old veteran think we have a chance compared to woodhaven this will be a picnic the man replied long as we dont got elves shooting at ushey who the abyss taught you how to buckle a sword sergan stormed over to a young footman who appeared lost on how to strap his sword to his waist the general grabbed it from him flipped it around buckled it tight and returned to antonil in the span of five seconds its always the simplest stuff antonil said a grin on his face wasnt my trainee sergan grumbled the two quieted as each looked to the men on the ground and walls and pondered the strength of their forces sergan antonil began we can hold the general said even if they send more than youre thinking well hold and if the gates fall antonil asked you mean like last time the guard captain nodded sergan sighed and gestured wide with his hands they wont find the going easy lead your men and ill lead mine well hold believe it and well do it see you at the battles end antonil said he drew his sword and held it high rallying the soldiers around him a pint of ale for every man who beheads an orc he shouted the men shouted back but their cheers were hollow after saluting sergan he sheathed his sword and marched back to the western gate w hen the last of the sun rose above the horizon the priests of karak made their presence known they slipped out of the kings forest garbed in their finest black robes they formed a loose semicircle around the city with forty of their members they spread their hands and faced veldaren they opened their mouths a single solid roar of a lion shook the city and filled all who heard with fear every third minute they released karaks power into that roar so that all within knew that a god himself had come to destroy g reat master the goblin said groveling on his hands and knees as if qurrah were a deity men come to speak with you and they kill orcs who say no where are they qurrah asked leave us velixar told the goblin our guests are here marching through the horde of orcs were twentyfive knights arranged in rows of five their armor was black their eyes were blacker and waving from banners attached to their saddles was the skull of a lion the halforc glared recognizing his new arrival the priests herald our arrival the centermost of the leading five said as he removed his helmet and now the last of the obedient are joined as one army high enforcer carden velixar said embracing the man after the dark paladin had dismounted it has been far too long aye it has prophet and i am high enforcer no longer krieger has assumed my mantle krieger dismounted from the horse beside them and knelt it is an honor to be at your side at the final purge he said velixar bade him rise the dark paladins have done far more than i in swaying hearts to the true god it is i who is honored by your allegiance the sun has risen the walls are in view and the great lion roars the battle is ready to begin he turned to qurrah who along with tessanna had remained quiet beside velixar wanting little to do with their new guests prepare the torches he said to them afterward stay at my side and us krieger asked join the priests in their circle not a single soul is to escape let the lesser races shed their blood for karak first the dark paladins rode out their banners held high they filled in gaps of the circle and when the priests released the lions roar they held their swords high and shouted the name of their god when we start the fun boomed an intoxicated voice gumgog pushed his way through the orcs using his club arm to beat senseless any who didnt move his face was painted white and on his chest was the skull of a lion the orc lumbered up to velixar and slammed his club to the ground when he roared calm yourself warmaster qurrah said not giving velixar a chance to speak order the beastmen to raise high their torches when the fire hits the city order the birdmen to attack the western gate you do know which is west right bwah hah hah gumgog lifted his club arm and shifted his shoulder so he could point at the gate directly across from them that one gumgog drunk and gumgog want to kill but me still know what is what what about the south gate the hyenamen will assault that one velixar replied grinning at qurrah keep the wolfmen back their use is later when the gates fall have trummug unleash the horde what karak wants karak gets the orc bellowed before turning around and beating his way back through the orc ranks raise your torches he shouted throughout the army all of you get them torches high amusing orc velixar said laughing the fear wafting from the city was intoxicating and by the smile on qurrahs face he knew his disciple sensed it too will you begin the assault on your own or do you wish my help let the first strike be mine the halforc said it is only just tessanna kissed his cheek and stepped back giving him room to cast his spell the horde army completely surrounded the city with the birdmen and hyenamen near their designated gates they held their torches high as ordered qurrah closed his eyes and let the magic pour out dark words flowed across his tongue he felt the torches in his mind lighting his inner vision like stars across a sky he grasped them as he would with a fist except he used his power his will to command the fires of the torches flared hot blinding even in the morning light with a triumphant cry he tore the fires into the sky they soared upward yellow tails streaking after them as if they were comets hundreds upon hundreds dotted the blue crackles of black within the heart of the flames signifying the dark magic that controlled them with another cry qurrah sent them rushing toward veldaren like a river of fire they rained down upon the walls the buildings and the castle flesh cloth and wood blackened the soldiers crossed their arms and ducked their heads screams lifted to the sky first few but then many as the fires spread veldaren was burning qurrah opened his eyes to witness the destruction of his spell at his side tessanna slipped her hand back into his beautiful she whispered into his ear the priests lifted their arms and opened their mouths karaks roar shook the city this time angrier and ominous amidst the fire gumgog slammed the ground and roared for his army to attack the birdmen squawked and charged the west gate while hundreds of hyenamen yipped in earnest fervor the archers along the walls released their first volley and as the tips pierced the flesh of bird and hyena velixar lifted his eyes to the sky in thanks veldarens purge had begun b irdmen to the west mira shouted using magic to escalate the volume of her voice so that all the soldiers near her heard hyenamen to the south fill them with arrows antonil shouted as he ran up the stairs and joined miras side the first volley fired the twangs of bowstrings in perfect unison hundreds of arrows fell upon the birdmen piercing their tough skin and shoddy armor they ran with their heads low and wings spread wide so those that fell were trampled without slowing the charge they squawked with fanatical anger and determination a second volley lessened their numbers even further so that by the time they neared the gate they numbered only eight hundred the outermost gate was made of wood with the inner side reinforced with iron lacking any sort of siege weaponry antonil wondered what lunacy made them think they could break through then from his perch he saw their sharp claws shred inches into the wood showering the ground with splinters fire at will he ordered his archers focus on the door yes sir mira said a grin spreading across her face fire swirled around her hands begging for release she slammed them together unleashing a giant funnel of flame the fire struck just before the gate incinerating tens of the grotesque creatures then the spell detonated dozens more flew back leaving ugly featherless corpses in the spells wake the archers along the wall assaulted the scattered remnants who tried to mass at the gate well done antonil whispered better than hot oil perhaps not mira said she pointed to the greater army waiting i think i made a friend t here velixar said his eyes locked on the fiery bomb igniting his forces on the western side foolish to give away her position so early in the fight darkness clouded his fingers but tessanna halted his spell no she said glaring at the wall even as she laughed shes mine she is me and mommy wants me dead the other daughter of balance the man in black wondered he had figured the spell to be cast by harruqs wife so be it he said here kittykitty tessanna said twin red orbs of magic growing inside her palms big dogs coming and hes coming for you she threw them the force of the spell knocking her to her knees mouth agape and eyes sparkling she watched her spell get back mira shouted seeing the two orbs rotating around each other as they approached she spread her hands wide mentally pushing antonil and the other archers to safety she had but a second to cast a shielding spell before the orbs struck mira lathaar shouted as half the western gate swarmed with yellow fire the fire burned hot and died drifting to the sky in a putrid smelling smoke the paladin cheered as it dissipated for hovering a foot above the wall was mira her hair swirling and her eyes black as night get off the wall she ordered the rest of the archers who obeyed without hesitation antonil grabbed lathaars shoulder and twisted him around to face him how can she survive that he asked better question lathaar said pointing at the girl how can they survive that a solid beam of magic over ten feet wide screamed straight for tessanna who waited with her right arm out and her palm open when the blast hit she opened her eyes dark lust inside them the white beam parted at her fingers and swirled around her body like water parting around a stone her arm shook her body wavered help her qurrah shouted but velixar shook his head she doesnt need help the man in black said are you so blind to your lovers strength the beam intensified in strength and tessannas fragile body seemed ready to break weak and insignificant versus the sheer power unleashed against her but then she pulled back her hand and spun her arms high above her like a dancer qurrah cried out thinking the magic would shred her to pieces but instead it swirled around her body like a funnelstorm the white faded to red then to black from within qurrah heard laughter the tornado froze with a vicious tearing sound all its magic pulled in on itself folding and bending into a single black orb the size of a pebble it hovered above tessannas palm which shook as she fought to control it shrieking she hurled the volatile orb back at mira mira summoned her defenses but when the pebble hit her translucent shield she knew her mistake pain sheared through her mind a white flash marked the explosion followed by a giant eruption of lightning and smoke and darkness her shield broke her tiny body flew off the wall haern was there in an instant leaping through the air to grab her in his arms with a thought he teleported them to the ground and put her safely down the gate mira cried struggling against the assassins arms which pinned her the gate its vulnerable the gate is the gate will break haern whispered to her whether you protect it or not will you break with it or regain your strength to fight again before she could answer the great roar of the lion filled the city it felt as if it rose from the dirt beneath them lifting the dust and blowing the hairs on their skin in the sudden silence following mira accepted his wisdom get them away from the gate she said pointing to the soldiers wedged in front of it hurry haern helped her to her feet and then turned seeking antonil get them back he shouted waving both his sabers above his head to gain the guard captains attention antonil copernus i said get them back t arlak and aurelia watched as the hyenamen charged with frightening speed the first volley by the archers fell far behind the coming force the archers compensated for the speed for their second volley killing twenty twenty out of nearly nine hundred get them arrows out there sergan shouted as he paced before the locked and barred gate you want us to throw open the city so i can show you how to kill that can be arranged tarlak mumbled as the hyenamen spread apart to lessen the damage of the third volley the makings of a fire spell was on his lips when aurelia grabbed his wrist and stopped him velixar is out there she said if he knows where we are hell counter wait for them to enter the city where our magic will go unseen spoilsport tarlak said incompetent wizard she shot back orc lover dont make me polymorph you the hyenamen slammed against the gate their claws sharper and thicker than those of the birdmen the soldiers inside the city shook from the combination of yipping growling and clawing on the other side theyre just overgrown mutts you pansies sergan shouted to his ground troops and archers i want empty quivers by the end of this battle now get to it the arrows rained down on the hyenamen clawing at the gate but when one fell those behind it pulled it back and tossed it to the side using the bodies of their own dead they built walls on either side of the gate then to tarlaks shock a squad of ten hyenamen came running forward with crudely cut planks of wood in their arms they threw the planks atop the two walls of dead bodies the hyenamen had to crawl underneath but it worked the archers could not reach the hyenamen that clawed against the gate shredding the wood and twisting the iron behind it thats got to go tarlak said he glanced at aurelia who nodded in agreement make it fast she said and whatever you do dont make it flashy below them a hairy arm burst through the wood in between the straps of iron it flailed around wildly as if hoping a victim was near this is going to be fun harruq said from the front line he ran up both his swords drawn with a single blow he chopped the arm off at the elbow and kicked it to the side two clawed hands replaced it prying at the wood to make the hole bigger harruq thrust both swords into the hole they came back soaked in blood that all you got he screamed to the other side of the door get back here soldier sergan shouted at him you want trampled the second that door knocks open but weve got to harruq stopped as a loud explosion rocked the outside of the gate smoke poured through the tiny hole along with the scent of burnt fur gates clear again he heard tarlak shout the archers resumed their firing you want to fight at the front you do as i say sergan commanded to which harruq shrugged and obeyed wizards get all the fun he grumbled as tarlak and aurelia pondered their next choice of attack a s the hyenamen clawed and tore at the door of the southern gate the last remnants of the birdmen fled the battlefield most had been killed by arrows or miras fire spell plenty crawled wounded along the ground but none would come to aid them velixar frowned in disgust such cowardly creatures he said but expected ashhur did create them when the retreating birdmen reached the line of dark paladins and clerics they cried out for mercy instead the dark paladins butchered them with their weapons as did the clerics with their spells not a single kill to their name qurrah said what a waste they will serve their purpose soon velixar said but for now the man in black closed his eyes and began casting qurrah had taken the fire of torches the hyenamen and birdmen carried and the display had been incredible velixar took the fire from his thousands of orcs under his command the fire swirled into the air forming a giant streaking comet velixar forked his hands as he concentrated breaking the ball of flame in two each one curled around smoke and fire trailing after as they careened for the barred gates of the city antonil was still ordering his men back when the ball slammed into his gate blasting apart the wood and melting the iron a cloud of heat blew down the street killing fifty of his soldiers that could not escape in time antonil slammed his sword against his shield even as his men scattered and broke ranks to me he shouted form up to me with pure will antonil gathered his army and reformed their ranks before the shattered remnants of the gate they saw the ring of servants of karak and behind the horde of orcs with their banners waving in the morning sun as long we hold breath our city will not fall antonil shouted ignoring the quaking fear in his heart as long as we hold firm our enemy will break stand men stand lathaar held his sword high as did jerico with his shield their light shone across the soldiers and as the two paladins prayed the soldiers fear melted like snow within a fire if your heart is with ashhur then death holds no sway against you jerico shouted accept the light and fight the darkness their fear was great but the light was greater their ranks tightened their swords stopped their shaking ready to fight ready to die the men at the western gate waited a urelia prevented the attack from being the disaster it should have been as the comet of fire burned through the hyenamen and slammed against the gate she leapt from the wall she had no time to levitate no time to think she collapsed from the impact and her teeth bit down hard on her tongue head bent blood in her mouth she raised her hands and summoned a shield of magic she prayed it would be enough the fire burst through shards of wood and iron exploding inward aurelia screamed unable to hold the shield but then tarlak summoned an enormous blast of air from the ground before her pushing the fire and shrapnel to the sky harruq ran to her side ignoring sergans cries for order as he sheathed his swords and took her into his arms he saw hundreds of hyenamen yipping at him with hungry eyes the gate was down and their way was clear harruq ran to the side while the soldiers of neldar collided with the claws and teeth of their attackers ill protect her until shes ready tarlak said as he hovered down beside them with a levitation spell get yourself into the fight harruq turned to the chaos of steel fur and muscle with pleasure he growled he let out a roar his adrenaline taking over he charged the gate soldiers had surrounded the entrance so that any hyenamen who entered found a circle of steel waiting the hyenamen were dying far more than the humans but sheer numbers pushed them back then harruq joined he slammed his way past the veldaren soldiers having no fear for the claws of his enemy salvation and condemnation drank freely as he sliced and chopped he did not retreat as the other soldiers did instead he waded forward slaughtering any who met his charge hot damn sergan shouted witnessing harruq in action now thats fighting not willing to let the halforc have all the fun sergan took his axe and rushed to his side together they hacked and chopped until they were at the rubble of the gate the entrance was narrow and only three could come at once the room to maneuver diminished it favored the two even more the claws of the hyenamen were no match for the weapons that tore through them their thick hide was no match for the enchanted steel and wellsharpened edges that cut them get ready to fall back harruq said through grit teeth as he disemboweled one hyenaman while stabbing the throat of another lead on sergan told him the initial rush of hyenamen had been scattered and uneven due to the destruction of the fiery comet that had broken the gate the archers had done their best to thin their attack but now the hyenamen pressed forward as a single unit back harruq yelled turning and running into the city shields now sergan ordered hot on harruqs heels the two split once they were past the gateway rows of soldiers took their place their shields locked together into a single wall the hyenamen hurled themselves with wild abandon the men screamed their shoulders throbbing and their wrists aching but they did not move men behind them pushed forward aiding those who were weak or wounded the hyenamen howled and tried but their momentum was broken atop the wall the archers emptied their quivers for with their enemy packed and unable to move they couldnt miss the soldiers on the front started stabbing in between the shields filling the street with blood harruq rejoined the two casters knowing there was no place for him without a shield you alright he asked his wife head hurts she said she leaned against the wall tarlak was beside her staring at the intense combat any spell we cast will hit our own he said either that or make our position known theyll hold harruq said good tarlak said because its going to get harder as if on cue the city shook from the roar of the lion except this time the shaking did not stop harruq looked about confused and worried what the abyss he asked no point staying hidden now aurelia said gingerly rising to her feet the orcs are coming harruq looked back at the row of soldiers guarding the door about thirty had fallen leaving less than two hundred to hold the gate several hundred hyenamen remained still fighting and clawing with every ounce of their strength to enter of the thousands of orcs if even half marched to their gate the halforc charged the front line shield or no shield he was going to fight and he was going to kill because the numbers they faced were about to get a whole lot bigger s tand firm antonil shouted as the lions roar filled their ears its effect was pitiful compared to the light of the paladins swords and shield as it died they felt the ground beneath their feet shake the orc forces were charging the guard captain positioned himself in the center of the first line to his right was jerico his left lathaar antonil jerico said listen to me when the orcs are a hairs width from sword reach we need to charge if we brace our shields then guard captain jerico said pulling on antonils shoulder to force him to meet his gaze order your men to charge just before the strike trust me trust ashhur the coming horde roared and bellowed half broke south a giant river of gray flesh and armor antonil whispered a prayer for sergan and his men ill trust you he said aloud when finished were all dead men anyway not yet lathaar said overhearing the comment not by a long shot he held both his swords high and shouted out the word elholad his swords flared brighter than any torch sun or star those who saw it knew no fear they felt the sun on their skin for the first time knew comfort in the weight of their armor and the strength in the grip they held on their swords the orcs passed through the ring of priests and dark paladins not daring to touch any even in their frenzy archers released their arrows but it was like spitting on a bonfire at my command antonil shouted over the commotion i want you to charge as one do you understand the soldiers shouted in unison the army closed the distance jerico stepped out from the front row and knelt to one knee his shield leaned before him its light shimmered and swirled as if a rainbow were trapped within the metal the paladin closed his eyes and prayed the orcs were almost upon him they funneled through the shattered ashes of the doors and into the giant gateway their axes and swords were drawn their mouths were open in mindless cries of bloodthirst jerico heard none of it he felt his shield become weightless on his arm he felt his heart stop the whole world was silent he opened his eyes he felt his faith like a knife in his chest unbreakable immovable in one smooth motion he stood and pushed his shield against the air a white image rammed forth similar to his shield but larger and made of purest light sound returned the world resumed jerico watched as the glowing shield slammed the nearest orcs they howled with pain and every one toppled as if a hammer had struck their chest those behind tripped over them and died trampled by the next wave of their comrades charge antonil screamed the men rushed forward lathaar and antonil leading the way lathaars swords sliced through gray flesh antonils shield bashed and pushed his sword cutting into any weakness the orcs had no footing no momentum those who funneled into the gateway died their bodies becoming a barrier the rest had to climb over and then jerico joined them his mace bonebreaker more than living up to its name he shattered the jaw of one orc kicked his body back and then crushed the skull of his replacement over a thousand orcs pressed and fought to enter the city but were held back by the front seven of neldar fall back antonil shouted the horde were pulling away preparing for another rush many were dragging bodies and dumping them to the sides so they could have a clear battlefront a few tried to give chase and deny the soldiers a chance to flee but then haern appeared in the gap between the two armies a wicked gleam in his eye he spun through the orcs his curved sabers slashing out tendons and throats as he passed the orcs tried to converge on him but he leapt further away from the city he descended upon the orc army like a storm cloud once outside the gateway he had even more room to maneuver he double stabbed ones throat then leapt into the air and jumped off his chest he sailed over the orcs his entire body rotating sabers slashed and cut eyes and faces those near his landing tried to flee they died when several rushed hoping to bury him with numbers he turned toward the gate and activated the magic of his ring vanishing and reappearing past their blockade he ran through the gateway which was a bloodied mess the rest of the soldiers were inside and in formation while jerico knelt once more his eyes closed and his shield ready what in the abyss was that thatshield lathaar asked jerico while the others around them were gasping for air both paladins appeared to be only winded from the fight like that jerico asked his eyes still closed a slight smile broke the corners of his lips ive done it only once when i was alone can you do it again he looked to the orcs who were snarled and lining up for another charge i dont know jerico said ill try antonil ran through his ranks pulling fresh men to the front when done he ran back with his sword high and gleaming charge at my command he screamed yes sir the soldiers shouts were louder heartier they had withstood the first assault without nary a life lost no longer did they feel they fought a hopeless battle get ready lathaar said as he stepped back to the line they wont be surprised this time around we dont need surprise haern said blood covering his golden hair we have strength they cant dream of the orcs entered the gateway with their arms crossed and their weapons held in defensive positions but it did no good jerico waited even later hurling the magical shield into the gateway even as the orcs swung at his body they flew back screaming in pain the ground became a tangled mess of limbs as they fell atop one another instead of charging the orcs behind them retreated wanting no part of that chaos lathaar and haern attacked giving them no quarter antonil raised his hand and held his army back in case the orcs tried to assault they didnt glowing swords and sharpened sabers slashed through those who tried to stand and fight even those who lay in pain found steel piercing through their throats and eyes lathaar reached the end of the gateway and stared out at the giant mass sent to kill them the orcs glared and howled but dared not move the paladin raised his swords high and he laughed despite the blood that soaked his armor is this the great army of karak he shouted is this the legion that will wipe life from this world his words carried and one man amid the host of orcs heard and was made furious that damn pally just wont die krieger spat on the ground and drew his scimitars beside him carden drew his giant sword and watched the black flame surround it leadership through action the old man said let us show our brethren the strength of karak side by side the two dark paladins pushed their way through the orcs the flame of their weapons filling all who saw it with fear t his is it harruq shouted as he slammed the body of a hyenaman against the wall condemnation hacked off his head meanwhile salvation buried deep into the gut of another the creature yipped and clawed the air a twist of the sword finished it all around him men with shields charged forward slashing at their enemies before falling back only harruq remained where he stood a bloodied behemoth towering over them claw marks marred his face and covered his arms but their pain was insignificant side to side his swords swept his long arms covering every inch of the gateways width his swords glowed brighter from the blood that stained them the orcs were the only thing keeping the hyenamen fighting many tried to turn and flee but a wall of flesh and swords pushed them on many never even fought back as harruq slaughtered them he didnt care he felt no guilt his home was under attack and he would defend it two claws slashed across his cheek he tasted blood in return he slashed out the creatures throat and spilled its intestines along the goreslick ground another leapt onto his swords just so he could bite his neck the others charged thinking him vulnerable harruq screamed louder and crazier than the dying hyenaman he flung him away his vision red and his pain distant those that thought him vulnerable found their claws cut from their hands their teeth smacked from their jaws and their lives rent from their bodies pull back brute sergan yelled to him from behind the wall of shields pull back before you get your sorry ass killed the halforc kicked a body off his sword knocking down two more behind it he roared out in mindless primal fury soldiers stormed past him locking together their shields so sergan could grab and pull him further into the city harruq pushed the general back and walked inside wiping some gore away from his eyes with his thumb when he neared tarlak and aurelia he sheathed his swords how many tarlak asked lost count harruq said the ground suddenly shifted on him as if it was rumbling and bumping but he was the only one to drop to his knees while the others looked on he heard the other two talking but their voices were strangely distant hes lost a lot of blood he heard his wife say im fine he said wheres calan tarlak asked i said im fine the halforc staggered to his feet and drew his swords he knew it was morning but the sky was darker the city dark as well we need more time aurelia said she ran to the gate lightning crackling on her fingertips tarlak pulled on the back of harruqs armor he tried to resist but the ground betrayed him again salvation and condemnation fell from his hands the wizard sat down on his knees in front of him and took off his hat drink this up like a good little boy and well let you kill more baddies alright tarlak pulled a vial out of his hat like a petty magic trick he popped the cork off the top pried open harruqs lips and shoved the silvery liquid down the taste reminded him of somewhere but he couldnt place itcouldnt he slipped into unconsciousness still trying to remember a urelia watched as the last of the hyenamen fell to the swords of the neldar troops orcs tried to drag away the dead but the archers above fired volley after volley the piles of bodies grew larger in the momentary reprieve aurelia stepped just inside the shield wall kneel down she said sergan recognizing her for who she was ordered the front to their knees keep them off me she said as she began her spellcasting she had a small window in between the shoulders of the men to either side of her shed have to be careful the orcs funneled into the gateway ready to bury them in their numbers a bolt of lightning tore through their center killing seven a second took five more her hands stretched over the mens heads and from her fingers flew a hundred arrows of fire those that avoided her spells hurled their bodies at her but the soldiers had seen her power three shields pelted one orcs body as he tried to hack off the sorceresss fingers another had two swords pierce his belly and hold him back as aurelia flung a ball of fire through the gateway and into the mass of orcs it exploded over fifty feet in diameter orcs shrieked and died roast em one shouted beside her the elf smiled amid her concentration sure thing she said ten black orbs dripping from her fingers she flicked her hands and the orbs flew into the charging orcs each orb exploded when it struck flesh or armor engulfing the hapless victim in fire faster and faster her spells came she hurled a ball of ice over the wall crushing two poor orcs underneath magical arrows buried into gray throats lightning blasted huge lines of them to the ground but still they came the soldiers pushed them back one even flinging his arms in front of an axe strike so the elf could complete her spell theres too many sergan shouted to her trust me aurelia said her head pounded her back ached and her fingers felt made of lead i know she made a ripping motion with her hands a wall of fire stretched from the ground to the top of the citys outer entrance she cast the spell again forming a second barrier of fire on the inner side a few orcs howled as they were pushed into the fire to test its strength blackened and dead they rolled out the other side aurelia grabbed the shoulders of the nearest man and pressed her head against his chest with eyes closed she tried to gather her strength she had used so much magic it felt as if her eyes would melt out of their sockets and blood would seep from her ears well hello the man said always knew id sweep you off your feet one of these days she opened her eyes to see the soldier she had collapsed against was actually tarlak comfy he asked with a grin you sure know how to ruin a good thing she said pushing away from him did you find calan aye i did he said and i must say they know how to have fun aurelia raised an eyebrow but the wizard just shook his head either youll see it or ill tell you about it later for now how are things here nice fire walls by the way were holding she said rubbing her eyes with her fingers but once you and i are exhausted and harruqs bled out every bit of strength hes got what then theyre so many at least we have the archers tarlak said yeah she said at least v elixar said not a word as he watched the assault progress qurrah found it difficult to read his face for every second the chin shifted higher or the cheeks sunk lower or the eyebrows changed color his anger though was loud and clear ashhur has done well velixar said guided the strongest of this world to his side and then brought them to fight against us but i have done the same have i not we are ready to obey qurrah said i know velixar said kill the archers qurrah raised his hands and went over the words of a spell he had learned from velixars journal he had become a master of manipulating the bones of the dead but the spell he was about to try was far beyond anything he had attempted before just before beginning the spell he tried something new prayer aid me in this karak he prayed prove to me your allegiance and i will prove to you mine words of magic poured from his lips hundreds of dead lay piled beside the two blasted gates of the city every single one was an entity he felt in his mind their death lingering in anger he harnessed the power of that death and then turned it on their broken bodies his hands hooked and curled the words came faster and faster in the dark recesses of his mind he heard the growl of the lion in one giant explosion the bones of the dead tore into the air numbering in the thousands there they hovered while beneath them blood poured down like rain let death ride along the walls the halforc whispered the bones swirled together a storm of white and red it started at the west like a floating meat grinder it descended on the archers atop the walls the bones pelted their bodies tore across their skin and shredded their flesh from there it traveled south many archers leapt from the wall accepting the broken bones in their legs or arms to the carnage they witnessed upon their brethren by the time it reached the second gate half of the archers had fled down ladders and steps the other half died qurrah was not done he pulled the bone tornado higher letting the blood and gore within it fall across the city the tornado sucked in on itself collecting into a giant grotesque ball of bone death is rain velixar said seeing what was about to happen let them learn it qurrah slammed his fists together the ball of bone exploded the pieces pelted the city the effect was dramatic the stench of fear rose high from the city and the necromancers drank it in with pleasure tessanna kissed qurrahs lips giggling madly as she did do it again she said break their buildings knock down the walls bones qurrah the bones the halforc kissed her twice perhaps later he said one of the gates will fall soon velixar said when that happens the entire city will collapse what if too many die before then qurrah asked you have the strength to sunder the walls so why dont you the man in black laughed those who die will serve me in death just as well as they would serve me in life does it truly matter no qurrah said staring at the western gate and wondering if his brother was inside i guess it doesnt as for the wallsthe soldiers are here for a reason they are to fight and they are to die i would not deny them their right besides we must save our strength breaking celestias will to open the portal to thuloss world will require everything qurrah and then even more velixar gestured to the combat his anger gone enjoy the battle enjoy the death we have sown these seeds for centuries let us enjoy the reaping t he smell of blood was overpowering as they neared the west gateway of the great wall surrounding veldaren this should have excited him but the blood was not the intermixed carnage of battle no it was the stench of a massacre and even worse it was his army suffering the great loss of life worst of all to krieger the pathetic paladin lathaar helmed the defense this is no time for private duels carden said to krieger as they approached with the archers dead or hiding after the bone tornado they approached the sundered gate without worry the paladins death proves our strength regardless the circumstances then my failure to kill him showed ashhurs strength krieger said or does it not work both ways carden turned his eyes burning with anger you are the high enforcer now he said act it our enemies are strong and clever we will overcome them by sheer faith and will not by assumptions and ego draw your swords paladin of karak krieger did beside him carden raised his enormous sword the dark fire visible throughout the battlefield all around orcs gathered their bloodlust was high and the sight of the fire heightened it further if only they could get inside if only the gateway defenders could be broken paladin of ashhur carden shouted your kind is dead your god is fallen do you weep for your souls knowing no arms wait to embrace you in death lathaar emerged from the line of shields inside the city the glow on his swords strong krieger felt his blood boil at the sight of him he should have killed him when he had the chance he realized he could have slaughtered him as a faithless broken man in a backwater village that was the fitting end for him not some heroic last stand in the greatest battle of his life ashhur be damned carden said stirring him from his thoughts you were right there is another jerico stepped beside lathaar and together they raised their holy armaments their glow combining into an awesome display carden held his sword near his face letting its dark fire absorb the painful glow his name is jerico krieger said they are the last we can eliminate their kind right here right now we cannot draw them out carden said he turned to the orcs around them so we must meet them within orcs your cowardice ends now you will charge you will fight and you will slaughter let the name of karak sound from your lips the force of his voice whipped them into a greater fervor krieger felt the authority in cardens voice and realized just how much he still had to learn and grow in his faith fight hard krieger shouted determined to fill the role he was given break through the guards and you will have an entire city waiting pillage rape every sin every vice you can have it all the orcs were screaming now ready to tear apart their own kin to engage in battle krieger slammed his sabers together the sparks showering around his enormous frame as one the dark paladins charged the orc army hot on their heels lets see how tough you are jerico said hurling another giant shield of light carden raised his sword and bellowed out the word felhelad his sword became a blade of pure fire its color darker than the night when the shield of light approached he slashed the air cutting it in two a force struck the two dark paladins but they were not harmed and they were not held back ashhur be with you jerico said to lathaar as he stood to fight you as well lathaar replied elholad his swords became pure light the counterpoint to the black fire that bore down upon them jerico raised his shield as cardens sword slammed against it he had never felt a blow he could not withstand he had never tried blocking a felhelad he screamed in pain needing every bit of strength to hold back the sword anger fueled his determination and then it was cardens turn to experience something he had never felt in all his long life the holy retribution of jericos shield his felhelad jerked back pain stabbing his hands shoulders and stomach the struggle had been mere seconds but each one stared at his opponent with newfound respect krieger bore down on lathaar his weapons also felhelads did you miss me he shouted as his sabers connected with lathaars swords crackling power swirled between them lathaar winced and pushed back hows your back he asked he parried a thrust stepped aside and then blocked a vicious chop behind him soldiers of neldar readied their shields and stepped forward the orcs had arrived howling bloody murder they filled the gateway pouring around the paladins the formation of shields wavered antonil shouted and urged them on wading deep into the river of gray but his valiant efforts were nothing compared to the hundreds pressing in jerico parried a sideswipe with his mace whirled his weapon around and struck carden across the chest he was strong but the power from his faith was in his shield not his weapon the mace recoiled the enchantments on the armor too tough for his weapon to break the dark paladin saw this and laughed those who cannot kill will be killed he said slamming his felhelad against the glowing shield again they both recoiled wounded by the exchange two orcs ran past carden and leapt at jerico their axes swinging jerico blocked one clubbed the second in the jaw and then slammed his shield against the first three more moved to attack jerico but carden cut them down with one giant swing despite his lecture with krieger he was determined to finish off the stubborn paladin without interference black fire leapt around his fist and shouting the name of karak he punched jericos shield jerico knew what carden was doing several of the stronger paladins of karak could harness their faith into a single blow that could shatter stone and fell trees the stronger their faith the stronger the blow he knew cardens faith was immense when the fist connected with his shield he knew immense didnt come close the center of his shield bowed inward the metal cracking and melting his arm shook in spasms while his fingers locked open his mouth opened in a scream that felt unending the pain stretched beyond intolerable when cardens fist pulled back jerico collapsed to his knees still alive carden said as he hefted his felhelad in both hands and raised it for a killing blow accept my respect as i remedy this down came the sword l athaar pressed the attack as the soldiers of neldar made one last push to seal the gateway against the orcs krieger tensed his legs and braced against the powerful blows he grit his teeth as his biceps throbbed under the strain the dark paladin refused to budge when he reached the inner edge of the gateway instead crossing both scimitars and locking lathaars weapons together in their center your city is falling krieger said as the veins in his neck bulged your faith is a false hope to be extinguished karak is the true god as you die you will see the proof lathaar met kriegers stare without blinking human soldiers fought at his side their coordination having beaten back the orcs to the broken gate screams of the wounded and dying filled his ears as he poured his strength into his arms and swords he saw the insanity lurking within kriegers eyes all around people were dying those he could aid those he could heal those he could protect with his swords we dont matter lathaar said the knowledge striking him like a hammer he pulled back slashed kriegers scimitars wide and then rammed him with his shoulder leading the dark paladin fell back entangled in the horde of orcs behind him fighting to prove ashhurs faith is folly he said as krieger slaughtered the hapless orcs that hindered his return to combat then why fight krieger screamed as he slammed the hilts of his weapons together the two interlocked when he twisted them so that he held a long bladed staff instead of two separate scimitars he twirled it in his hands as overwhelming rage burned in his heart several orcs tried to assault lathaar but krieger beat them back severing the head of one who did not react quickly enough the paladin was his to kill thousands will die within these walls if i dont lathaar said quiet enough to ensure the dark paladin did not hear that is all that matters he slammed his elholads together the bright light blinding the orcs that stampeded into the city the human soldiers had spread out their tight line bulging into a semicircle that threatened to break with every passing moment only lathaar stood in its center no orc foolish enough to attack lathaar however did not care about his duel he didnt care about krieger all around were bringers of death and he would end them he spun his swords cutting and slicing tens of orcs died as they tried to rush around him for the easier targets behind krieger lunged twirling his staff as if it weighed nothing lathaar batted aside his opening thrust stepped closer and slammed an open palm against kriegers chest ashhurs voice was all he could hear he didnt know what it was he did but when his palm touched the black metal of kriegers breastplate his vision turned white just as carden had struck jerico lathaar struck krieger the power hurled the dark paladin backward through his troops of orcs and out of the city smoke drifted from the hole in his chestpiece but lathaar was not done he sheathed his short sword and held the longer elholad with both hands its blade stretched out another foot it should have been unwieldy but it was pure light weighing nothing killing everything a swipe to the right and five orcs fell dead a swipe left and six more died he whipped the blade around cutting off the legs of a charging orc and then slammed his elholad to the ground a shockwave of holy power lanced into the gateway slicing through flesh and armor like butter the orcs engaged with the humans having lost their reinforcements collapsed and fled shields pressed into the entrance the veldaren soldiers creating tight formations lathaar spun and saw the other dark paladin towering over jerico as if he were a conquered prize jerico he shouted as he charged after carden the dark paladin was surrounded by soldiers of neldar the long black sword swirled around slicing through shields and armor but antonil and his men did not let him rest nor to score a killing blow upon jerico time and time again he would swing his sword in a full circle knocking away all who neared and then try to stab the blade into jericos chest each time jerico lifted his shield and blocked the blow the shields glow had faded and he looked beyond exhausted but he was stubbornly alive cowards carden shouted to the men who encircled him will none of you stand to fight or will you flee like diseased dogs antonil thrust at cardens back but he had been baited carden was ready the enormous length of his blade should have severed his head and sent it rolling through the street but the felhelad stopped lathaar protected him sparks exploding between them as their blades collided your faith isnt enough to challenge me boy carden said ashhur thinks otherwise they pulled back and swung again at the collision of their godblessed blades orcs and men alike shielded their eyes against the light lathaar and carden pushed against each other with all their strength locked in a stare of death whoever blinked whoever faltered would die the city falls carden said through clenched teeth no heroism will save it shut up already jerico said as he swung his mace from his prone position bonebreaker struck cardens ankle bent in the metal and then touched flesh the magic within activated and carden screamed as the bones in his foot shattered antonil leapt in thrusting his sword through the exposed gap in the armor underneath cardens arm blood soaked his sword but before he could twist it the dark paladin spun his giant blade batting them all away like insects but as the blade spun around haern appeared directly before carden a wicked grin on his face he sliced his sabers across the sides of cardens neck severing an artery before somersaulting away lathaar saw the blood saw the pain and knew his opponent beaten in one single move he spun a full circle and swung the momentum and power pushed aside cardens last attempt to block the elholad melted his armor cut through his arm and cleaved his body in two the black fire around the felhelad vanished outside the gate krieger shrieked in mindless fury w hat is the matter qurrah asked velixars face had grown ashen in a rare expression of sorrow ashhur has always been bitter in defeat velixar said two of my dearest friends are dead still we have not entered the city are you sure we cant play yet tessanna asked smiling and batting her eyes like a child meanwhile a dark paladin rode up on horseback and saluted velixar a spellcaster has formed twin walls of fire at the southern gate he said their forces are ready to break but we have no means to combat the magic so damn stubborn velixar said a bit of frustration leaking into his voice qurrah kissed tessannas lips and then bade the dark paladin to give him a ride you cannot go velixar said you are too valuable the portal must be opened and if you are killed if i am killed qurrah said then i never had the strength to aid you in the first place our armies are dying there is no honor in this not for either side let death come swift the dark paladin waited for a sign from karaks greatest prophet after a moment velixar nodded so be it he said the south gate is yours return the moment our minions enter the city qurrah bowed the horse turned and rode for the south entrance so few tessanna said laughing at the man in black all our numbers all our power and we are held back by so very few valiant efforts disgust me velixar said the west gate is yours to destroy let in our troops however you see fit tessanna beamed and blew him a kiss i knew youd let me have my fun she said she eyed the city as her breathing quickened and her pulse raced fire consumed many buildings the smoke floated in a gentle breeze somewhere within was her reflection mother had told her to shatter her reflection and she would obey the pleasure in the imagining was overwhelming but the men at the gate with their shields and swords were keeping her from her pleasure blood is a strange thing she said her fingers crossed magic leapt out of her like a river a hundred orcs lined before the gate lurched and howled as their blood exploded out their bodies the blood flowed through the air in rivers pooling above the ground as tessanna held it firm in her mind it is our life and at its loss we diebut no other substance in our world holds so much magic and desire for death well other than you velixar the blood sank to the ground it grew thicker stronger congealing and reshaping as necessary from the great pool three forms stood each with feminine features they had no eyes but they did not need them they could sense the blood of their foes tessanna shook her fingers and strange words poured faster and faster from her mouth the beings grew larger drawing in the blood from which they formed soon they were five times the size of a normal man around their heads blood congealed into long ropes of hair that flowed down to their ankles although they had no eyes they did have mouths and each one opened and let out a shriek that pierced the sounds of battle you must teach me that spell velixar said as he watched in awe blood elementals tessanna said as she smiled arent they beautiful the elementals marched toward the gateway where antonils men stood horrified the two paladins rushed the front and stood side by side haern however had other plans he weaved through the ranks of the soldiers to mira who sat resting against a wall youre needed haern said to her haern she said will you protect me he took her hand until death my lady now come the first of the blood elementals neared the entrance it was taller than the walls but rather than duck inside the gateway it struck with its fists the stone cracked and crumbled a second stepped beside it and rammed its shoulder against the wall soldiers dove back as the gateway collapsed in on itself at first it appeared the rubble would still hold them at bay but then the three grabbed chunks of stone and hurled them away antonil stood at the front of his soldiers as the first elemental stepped through the wall and into the city can these things be killed he asked haern everything can be killed the assassin replied be brave your men need it mira raised her hand to the air a tiny pebble of light swirling inside her palm demon elemental she shouted be gone from my sight it raised its foot to crush her the light shot from her palm leaving a trail of red in its wake when it hit the skin of the elemental it pierced through traveling up its leg to its waist before exploding the thing shrieked as it was severed in two its upper body collapsing in a shower of blood the legs toppled in the gateway the magic holding the elemental together was broken streams of red poured across the feet of the soldiers the second elemental stepped inside bellowing in rage mira raised her hand and another white pebble formed across her palm the elemental however grabbed an enormous chunk of stone and hurled it at her mira released the light shattering the stone into a giant rain of pebbles clanks and pings filled the air as the stone fell upon armor and shields before mira could prepare a piece of the wall hurled through the air toward her get back haern shouted he took mira in his arms and leapt aside the rock smashed where she had been then continued crushing several soldiers in its path the elemental passed through the wall and into the city at antonils command his soldiers charged hacking at the elementals legs and feet the swords cut through the thick dried layer that made up its skin and released the blood swirling inside it poured over them all in sheets coating their armor and weapons the thing let out a shriek a strange sound akin to a wounded bird of prey furious it slammed its fists to the ground crushing men in their armor then kicked a soldier so hard he flew through the air and landed atop a house two more it hurled back to the orc army still the cuts grew in number biting into its skin and keeping it at bay haern put mira down far to the side of the entrance the blood elemental was still visible fighting against soldiers that came up only to its knees its just blood the girl said as she watched the fight just blood fire enveloped her hands she unleashed her power in a stream of flame its width greater than the length of her own body the stream arced as if shot from a cannon striking the elemental in the chest at the height of its ascent the elemental shrieked its skin hardening into long black strips that fell from its body jerico slammed his shield against its leg and then it went down antonil led the rest hacking and cutting its body as it lay vulnerable the last elemental picked up giant rocks in each hand and hurled them at the soldiers slaughtering its sister both pieces shattered in the air broken by unseen magic lathaar glanced down the street and his heart lifted at the sight marching in rows of five were the priests of ashhur their hands to the air and holy power crackling around them swords made of light sliced across the elementals chest face and arms it took a step forward but mira blasted it with a ball of fire antonil called back his men knowing their part was over more holy power washed over the creature sundering tessannas hold upon it with one last shriek it crumbled blood showered down upon the gorecovered dirt no celebrating yet antonil shouted running through his troops and forcing them to line up form ranks form ranks the city is vulnerable what had once been a chokehold was now a giant opening in the wall rows of orcs were raised their banners to karak and cheered antonil copernus one of the priests shouted from the formation calan stepped out and beckoned the guard captain to him my gratitude for your aid antonil told the old priest but the orcs are about to charge and i know calan said interrupting him listen to me our wall has been breached the city is lost take the king and flee there are ways out to the kings forest from the castle the soldiers peasants the childrentake them with you who will hold the wall calan gestured to his priests we can hold them for a time take your men and do what must be done to preserve the lives of our people antonil glanced to the orc horde he was terribly outnumbered with a paltry force left to hold the opening and once they fell the city was doomed everything inside him hated the thought of fleeing but he knew more was at stake than his pride i will take my soldiers to the king he told the priest hold as long as you can calan nodded and he put his hand on the mans shoulder you are a good man a good leader he said the people will need you in the coming months be strong for them he turned back to the priests and raised his hands high above his head let our voices be heard by ashhur and let our faith be a shield against the coming darkness he prayed calan turned back to the broken wall braced his legs and held out his left hand behind him the rest of the priests did the same they closed their eyes bowed their heads and gave themselves to ashhur a white beam flew from each of their palms collecting together into a massive stream it bubbled outward through the gap in the wall and out into the field there it turned back in on itself sealing the shattered gateway away from velixar and his horde soldiers of neldar antonil shouted to the castle the eschaton there gathered together watching the remaining troops march east he doesnt believe we can hold now the gateway is destroyed lathaar said he is right haern said the priests will hold them at bay until their strength fades they are buying us time what do we do jerico asked follow him lathaar said until we know more we follow they did even as the orcs hacked at the white shield with their weapons ignoring the pain it gave them for they too knew the shield could not last forever once it fell the city was theirs q urrah eyed the fire with mild amusement it was a simple barrier of flame that would burn for hours in a thick line but inside the cramped gateway it was lethal the orcs parted for him recognizing his power and station only one did not move and it was gumgog waiting for him with his real arm and his giant club arm crossed across his chest i tried smothering the fire with orcs gumgog said but they just burned waste of orcs you gonna put it out qurrah chuckled at the warmaster yes i will put it out keep back your horde until i say it is safe understood alright gumgog said you got some orc blood so you be trustworthy eh qurrah said nothing as he approached the fire to his right he saw an orc crawling toward his army his legs had been crushed by an ice boulder from aurelia he was in pain but he was alive kerlem frau spevorr qurrah shouted stretching out five fingers the orc shrieked as horrendous pain spiked up his back qurrahs hand shook magic pouring out his fingers blood spurted out the orcs lower back his tailbone tore through the flesh the orcs shrieks grew louder as his ribs cracked and his muscles tore with a cry of victory qurrah lifted his hand high the spinal cord ripped out the orcs body dripping blood and gore the shrieks ended with a word of magic qurrah lit the spine and skull aflame burning it clean to me qurrah said beckoning with his fingers the spine floated to his hand he held it like a staff those who had watched the spectacle cheered and howled not caring for the loss of one of their own only thrilled by the awesome display of power both hands clutching the staff qurrah approached the fire it burned strong and it was so thick he could not see through it he had an idea what awaited him on the other side aurelia or tarlak protected the gate perhaps even both if he banished the fire they would just recast the spell he would have to defeat them despite what velixar might say fifty feet from the fire he slammed the bottom of the staff against the ground a wave of countermagic streaked toward the gate invisible to the naked eye the two walls of fire sputtered and died the orcs cheered but qurrah did not move nor did he give signal to attack aurelia stepped into the gateway her staff in her left hand she glared at qurrah but said nothing qurrah felt a chill at the sight of her but he also felt excitement lifting the hairs on his neck he could kill her he would kill her no guilt would claw at his throat he let no worry eat his insides aurelia would die the elf hurled a lance of ice from her right hand qurrah struck it with the skull of his staff the lance shattered into harmless frost and snow he threw a bolt of shadow into the entrance aurelia summoned a magical shield and his attack splashed and dissipated against it lightning sparkled on her fingers with both hands she clutched her staff and lunged the bottom half at him from the wood a giant beam of yellow streaked straight for qurrah he clutched his bone staff and slammed the ground another wave of countermagic flowed defeating the beam his pale fingers caressed the skull of his staff coercing the magic out the jaw clattered and a haunting laughter came from within twenty orange and red balls shot from the eyes dancing and twirling in the air before shooting straight for aurelia the elf leaned against her staff and summoned her shield the orange balls exploded into fire and ash each one sapping a bit more of her strength when the last exploded they stared at one another neither saying a word tarlak stepped beside her from within the city fire swirled around his hands a ball of flame seared through the air but qurrah hooked his hands and stole control of it the fire turned away from him and headed straight back at tarlak the mage crossed his hands and spread his fingers a magical ward against fire surrounded his body so that when the flame struck he felt little of its heat smoke filled the gateway and for a brief moment qurrah could not see the spellcasters then two blasts of magic one fire one ice shot through the smoke both in thick beams the size of his body the fire qurrah merely sidestepped letting it kill several behind him the ice he detonated early with a piece of bone from his pocket qurrah whispered words of magic letting the dark power flow from his tongue ten orcs collapsed and died the bones from their bodies tearing through their flesh and into the air they flew in a river toward the gateway dripping blood aurelia created a wall of ice to protect them but qurrah blasted a hole in its center with a wave of his hand the bone pieces shot through striking her skin tarlak leapt in front and slammed his hands to the ground a shockwave rolled outward destroying the rest of the ice wall and turning the bone pieces to chalk before either could muster an attack qurrah hurled a wave of countermagic with his staff both were knocked back an alien feeling overcoming them as all magic was temporarily denied from their bodies as the wave passed qurrah approached for he could see how little strength they had left to fight him why tarlak asked as he neared what honor is in this what justice what reason no honor qurrah said washing another wave of countermagic over them no justice punishment for a city that banished me vengeance against those who sought to kill me retribution against those who turned my brother against me that is what i bring harruq stepped in front of the gateway he leaned against the side as if his legs could barely support him he looked groggy and dazed as if he had just awaken from a sleep no one turned me against you he said to his brother you did that yourself youre a slave of karak now nothing more qurrah laughed he spread his arms wide clutching his bone staff with one hand it seemed the entire wall shook with his laughter i am no slave he said and i am no servant do you know what i am brother do you know harruq watched as qurrahs eyes flared red first once then twice it was like watching the first gentle flames of a fire kindling harruq knew those eyes he knew that glow i am karaks left hand qurrah said his hissing voice washed over by a deep rumbling sound of foreign power i am his fire and i will burn everything i touch his eyes shone a fierce red glowing even in the morning light running down scars underneath his eyes were constant streams of blood that burned aflame like the tears of a demon aurelia unleashed a barrage of lightning but qurrah caught its power with one hand collected it in a ball inside his fist and then hurled it back she screamed in pain as the last of her magical wards broke she flew back badly burned her thin form crumpled in the street sergans soldiers swarmed over her their shields raised to protect her from any more harm furious at the sight tarlak tried to cast a spell of fire but a flash of red from the skulls eyes blinded him and scrambled his thoughts before he could resume bone pieces slammed against his forehead and neck beating him back only harruq stood against him qurrah looked at his brother with eyes that were not his own you did not kill me when you had the chance he said somewhere within you is the desire to stand at my side join me velixar dreamt of you leading his armies it is not too late salvation and condemnation shook in harruqs hands sadness and rage whirled inside him greater than qurrah would ever know you believe no one can change harruq said but youre wrong you know nothing of me be gone from my home he slammed his swords into the sides of the gate stone shattered and broke he struck the left wall with both his blades the foundation shook die in darkness brother qurrah said a beam of black magic shooting from his right hand harruq screamed his rage inside burning he crossed his arms and let the blow hit he felt the magic strike his skin but he did not care he would not succumb to it he would not fall even if all the world came crashing down on his shoulders white lightning crackled from his weapons qurrah saw him resisting he poured all his strength into his spell harruqs entire body shook and qurrah thought him ready to fall ready to die but he was wrong i am not the weaker harruq screamed he pushed back the magic his arms flung wide and inside the gateway a sound like thunder shook the tun brothers salvation and condemnation struck the stone walls at either side and through the stone a shockwave rumbled blasting away its foundations the evil spell flew back from harruq and assaulted qurrah he felt the pain sweep across his body the force of it knocked him back and he flew through the air as the gateway crumbled in on itself when he hit the ground his body writhed in pain from both the spell and the fall but qurrahs thoughts were far away all he could focus on was how in those last few moments harruqs eyes had shimmered gold h arruq tarlak screamed as the gateway collapsed dust billowed everywhere and he closed his eyes against the sting as it settled he saw harruq standing before the rubble his swords held at his sides his entire body was lifting and falling with his breathing every muscle was taut he looked like a paragon of strength and tarlak was awed by the sight of it when harruq sheathed his swords and turned the image vanished wheres aurelia harruq asked he noticed the look tarlak was giving him but misunderstood its meaning where is she he demanded shes here lad sergan said pushing aside the soldiers that still guarded her with their shields a little burned but shes breathing harruq rushed over and took her into his arms her dress was blackened across the front and ugly burns marred her chest her eyes were closed but her breathing was soft and constant as he brushed the side of her face with his fingers tarlak cast a spell across the rubble covering it with a thin sheet of ice lets see you climb up that he said he took off his hat and reached inside frowning as he did he had stashed a wide assortment of potions in his mad dash through his tower but wasnt sure of how many four five more from within his hat he pulled out a single healing potion and sighed good enough he said he knelt beside harruq and offered it to him thanks the halforc said he twisted off the cork and gently tilted it against aurelias lower lip at first she coughed but harruq was persistent he covered her mouth with his hand and when her coughing died she swallowed the rest on instinct the burns on her chest lost their angry red her eyes fluttered open whereis he still here she asked qurrahs outside harruq said i sent him away good aurelia said closing her eyes and leaning against his chest ill sleep here for awhile then sergan placed his soldiers in front of the crumbled gateway in case any orcs tried to climb over this done he hefted his axe onto his shoulder and stood beside the eschaton so what now the old veteran asked rest tarlak said you wont get many chances hop atop the wall and see how the other gate fares sergan motioned for one of his men to climb atop and see when the man returned he looked baffled it looks like a web is covering the entrance sir the soldier said its white and it glows damned if i know what it is some sort of magic protecting the entrance tarlak said consider it good keep your men sharp and be ready for anything who knows what qurrah and his minions might do to enter sergan moved away leaving the eschaton by themselves as aurelia rested the mage scratched his head and looked at the halforc do you know what you just did back there he asked aye harruq said i did something i dont understand clear enough for you not even close you toppled the wall with your swords alone we both know enchanted or not your swords dont possess that strength what are you saying tar tarlak plopped down beside them im saying i have no clue what i just saw harruq but it scared me to death yeah harruq said looking down at aurelia so he didnt have to face tarlaks inquisitive gaze to tell you the truth it scared me too but i knew what i was doing i just knew and for one moment there just one moment everything felt right tarlak paused a strange worry churning in his gut we have to get to the center he said what why harruq asked trust me on this alright we need to go the halforc lifted aurelia into his arms and nodded lead on they left sergan to guard the remains of the gateway as they hurried north q urrah returned to velixar with his head hung low another dark paladin had offered him a ride back which he took ungratefully when he dismounted he knelt before velixar and offered his apologies i failed you my master he said the southern gate is sealed off with rubble my brother defeated me stand qurrah it is no matter velixar gestured to the white shield summoned by the priests of ashhur do you know what you see a last desperate measure by a dying city the wall is broken the way into the city clear it is now just a matter of time when their strength fails we will push through and fail it will velixar waved his hand over his throat casting the spell with but a thought when he spoke he spoke not to those around him but to the entire city people of neldar he said your walls have fallen your last measures are failing your army has abandoned you to death i am the word of karak i am his witness his prophet and his sword fall to your knees and worship the true god and you will live ashhur has not abandoned you for you were never in his care cast aside your delusions worship karak cry his name seek his forgiveness if you do not then you will die by the sword and you will not rest your corpse will rise and even in death you will serve choose people of neldar service in life or service in death you have no other choice velixar smiled and ended the spell i have long waited to give that speech he said and it was as glorious as i had always hoped order gumgog to bring his troops to the western gate our victory is near a ntonil rushed up the steps of the castle the guards stationed there threw open the door so he could enter he marched down the carpeted hall feeling a strange anger at the luxury around him he was covered in blood and his boots left red footprints across the carpet he took off his helmet and held it in his hand in his other hand he held the hilt of his sword as it swayed in its sheath sitting on his throne still wearing the ungainly gold armor waited king edwin vaelor of neldar your highness antonil said as he bowed on one knee we must get you to safety the walls will soon be breached there are tunnels to the forest and from there we can flee to felwood castle at first vaelor only stared at antonil as if he were staring at a halffinished puzzle you wish us to flee the king said at last you would let them plunder our city while we cowered in the woods i will not be a beggar king lord gandrem would sooner hold me prisoner and retake neldar in his name after the orcs are slaughtered antonil felt his cheeks flush red he could feel the heat of his anger baking off of him it is either that or death my lord he said is that a threat the king stood towering over antonil because of the raised platform his throne rest upon we will die fighting and in glory not hiding is your spine so soft you coward at one time antonil might have felt intimidated but now he felt only fury you bathe in scented oils and perfumes he said rising to his feet i have bathed in the blood of my friends and foes yet you call me a coward how dare you speak to me in such a manner antonil put his helmet back on his head and glared at the pathetic man before him i will save as many lives as i can and then flee this city of tombs i swore to protect neldar and so i shall then you are a traitor to the crown king vaelor shouted how dare you commit such treason antonil turned and pulled the crown from vaelors head in one smooth motion he placed it on the ground and then smashed it with his sword gems broke from the gold and rolled across the floor he grabbed the king by the top of his armor and pulled him close so that he could smell the stink of blood on him there is no crown antonil said and the blame is yours he stormed out of the castle as he marched down the steps the king rushed out screaming at his guards seize him he shouted he is a traitor a coward i demand you execute him antonil stopped and glared at the two guards they looked between one another their swords wavering unsteady in their hands i will not spare your lives antonil said lower your weapons to the kings horror they did as they were told and then joined antonil in their march away from the castle vaelor returned inside closing the giant doors on his own it was the last time antonil would ever see him t he priests shield was weakening it no longer harmed those that struck it so trummug had every orc in his army hurling his weapon at the shimmering white magic velixar laughed enjoying every second let the dead rise he whispered karaks power flooded his being he shouted out the words of his spell over a thousand dead bodies of orcs hyenamen and birdmen rose from the ground held sway by his command a chill swept through qurrah at the sight beautiful tessanna whispered in his joy velixar could wait no longer a solid black beam shot from his hands and into the white shield which flickered and bowed inward against the barrage the ground shook as the priests last protection for the city broke the orcs needed no command into the city they poured where the priests waited their strength was spent their role was played they raised their arms to the sky and let the axes fall knowing the golden eternity waited for them velixar gave his last warning to the city your walls are breached your city is lost come out of your homes and kneel cast aside your weapons your faith and your lives serve karak as you were always meant to serve the thousand undead shouted the name karak in perfect unison the sound horrifying to every soul within the walls velixar cast one last spell on his orc army they heard his voice in their ears and the power of his command was great those that kneeled lived those that did not died the orcs obeyed the slaughter began those hiding behind locked doors and barred windows lived as long as the barricades held which under the biting axes and raging muscle of the horde was not long in minutes the entire west side of the city was filled with blood and the cries of the dying s hit harruq said as he heard velixars message all around were the people of neldar they were terrified and every one was filled with an instinct to flee they had nowhere to go no safe haven and then they started kneeling more than half cast down what meager weapons they had and kneeled a few prayed others just waited for death cowards harruq screamed to them karak brings you nothing hes no savior he doesnt know mercy theyre just scared aurelia said put me down har he did as he was told the sight of so many on their knees filled his blood with anger how many had died to protect their lives would they blaspheme against the sacrifice made for them by their worship of a death god aurry harruq asked can you make my voice loud like his he gestured west toward the general direction velixars voice had come i can tarlak said what you have in mind we go east he said and we go fast he ran down the street not caring if they caught up his heart was racing he could hear it throbbing in his ears all about men women and children were opening their doors and kneeling he wanted to shout and curse their names but he did not there were those loyal to ashhur he knew he would call them to him those with the will to live those with the courage to fight since the eastern side had no gate and therefore no traffic the more wealthy had built their homes within harruq watched as the homes grew nicer and the streets better cared for at the end of the road he saw the wall looming high above the homes a glance behind him showed tarlak and aurelia both running after when he reached the wall he stopped not the least bit winded cast the spell he said tarlak glared still trying to catch his breath he put his hand on harruqs neck and then muttered the spell the halforc felt a tingle in his throat and assumed it ready he sheathed his swords cupped his hands to his mouth and began shouting people of neldar come to the east gate if you want to live if you want to fight then here is your salvation come east come east he turned back to tarlak and nodded the mage snapped his fingers ending the spell so harruq said you two ready to make us a gate he backed away as the two casters put their hands upon the stone they muttered amongst each other picking a spell to cast in unison when decided they began words of magic flowed from their lips the wall shook as invisible waves assaulted the stone harruq watched as aurelia grimaced pain etched on her every feature his heart ached at the sight their spell finished the stone exploded outward leaving a giant gap in the wall six men could walk side by side through if their shoulders touched the last of the rubble had not yet hit the ground when aurelia collapsed to her knees harruq drew his swords and let her be he faced the west the road was broad many people could travel through how many would come though how many ill be fine aurelia said as tarlak helped her to her feet my head i just cant think straight i cantgive me a moment she leaned against the wall and closed her eyes tarlak rubbed his temples knowing how she felt near the end he had almost fainted he doubted he could throw a fireball larger than his thumb so we guard our new gate tarlak asked as the first few survivors came running toward them i guard our new gate harruq corrected you two aid the refugees theyll need protected to emphasize this he pointed to the ring of dark paladins and clerics that encircled the city theyll kill any that try to cross more people arrived they held little a few random provisions or possessions dear to them the death and carnage on the opposite side of the city seemed worlds away you be careful aurelia said kissing harruq before taking tarlaks hand dont do anything dumb tarlak said tipping his hat the two followed the fleeing civilians out harruq did not watch them go he didnt want the distraction nor the worry blades in hand he watched for the first of the orcs to arrive all the while screaming above the crowd come east come east c ome east velixar asked as he heard harruqs rallying cry there is no east gate qurrah said has he lost his mind once the entire orc army had funneled inside the city velixar ordered his undead to enter they poured in through the broken west gate like a river of rotten flesh qurrah did not watch instead focused on a dark paladin rider arriving the paladin pulled heavily on his reigns to halt his horse the people of veldaren are fleeing the rider said there is a gap in the east wall one of their mages must have created it velixar looked at his undead entering the city and wondered it is too far around to seal the other side he said push our forces harder we will overcome them from behind the man in black turned to tessanna yes lovely she asked him fetch bloodheel he ordered her she placed two fingers in her mouth and whistled neither qurrah nor velixar heard a sound but the fivehundred wolfmen waiting behind them howled from the giant pack a towering behemoth of fur muscle and fang emerged his entire body decorated with the bones of dead foes he had eaten we come to fight bloodheel said his rumbling voice deeper than velixars but we truly came to feast the city is bleeding when will we taste blood in response velixar pointed past the southern tip of the citys walls the people of neldar are fleeing the city to the east unprotected unprepared slaughter them all bloodheel arched and howled to the morning sky his yellow eyes shimmering with hungry lust we will not fail you he said he dropped to all fours and began running on either side the rest of the pack passed howling and drooling the carnage will be complete velixar said a smile growing on his everchanging face praise be to karak praise indeed qurrah said as the wolfmen vanished around the walls of the city w ell here we are lathaar said as they arrived at the fountain in the center of the city ready for some fun always am haern said he leapt to a nearby home and kicked off an open window to propel himself to the roof from there he scanned the major roads in all directions thousands of people filled the streets herding to the center and then turning east toward the supposed safety and freedom there you see anything jerico shouted over the commotion of the frightened people beside him mira clutched at her robes her arms crossed and her hands shaking the fear around her was leaking in but the bloodlust from afar was worse when jerico saw her tired crying face he only wiped the tears away with his thumb and smiled haern turned his eyes west all he saw was a sea of gray flesh and burning buildings its progress was steady every home was broken into and its occupants slaughtered the orcs who couldnt find a warm body to butcher moved further into the city the bulk of the army was on the main roads but like a disease it had spread throughout the entirety of the western half almost time haern shouted back he took three steps and then leapt to the top of the statue from there he wrapped himself in his cloaks and waited swarms of men and women passed the panic on their faces obvious the orcs arrival was sudden thirty came barreling near their axes and swords cleaving innocent flesh behind them the few remaining humans knelt and cried out to karak for salvation the sound of their pleading was far worse to haern than any scream of pain from the dying he jumped activating the power of his ring as he did his momentum forward continued even after his body vanished in a puff of shadow and reappeared ten feet west he descended on the orcs as a swirling gray death two had their throats cut as he landed a twist a step and two more dropped tendons cut and necks bleeding the orcs surrounded him but the assassin had begun his cloak dance the first to try a wild chop in the center of gray cloaks had three of his fingers severed the axe dropped to the ground soaked in blood the orc tried to retrieve it with his good hand he died for ashhur lathaar shouted slashing the nearest orc across the shoulder they had encountered no resistance since entering the city they were not prepared for the eschaton that had gathered in the center most had their backs turned to them fighting against haern as he slaughtered their kind from within when lathaar tore through their ranks the orcs knew their error any who turned to face the paladin felt steel biting into their backs from haern they screamed and fled wanting no part of either the west is dead mira said watching them go those who remain alive have given themselves to karak she spread her arms gathering her power her eyes closed as she focused on the magic that dwelled within her from the sky a giant meteor of fire materialized traveling at blistering speeds it slammed into the street crushing the orcs with the force of its impact houses beside it crumbled dust filled the air blocking all vision of the road south jerico shouted pushing his way through the crowd with his shield more orcs had come flooding the streets from the back ways of the western quarter the paladin watched in horror as the orcs butchered over a hundred unarmed men and women only nine lived all falling to their knees and shouting karaks name at the top of their lungs jerico felt his mace shaking in his hand at the sight the last of the human survivors ran past and only he stood before the gray mass deaths waiting jerico said slamming his shield with his mace come and you shall receive the orcs charged he blocked the first strike against his shield smiling at the sound of the weapon shattering he stepped back and swung his mace cracking the orcs skull open two more rushed but he parried both their attacks stepped closer to the first and then slammed his shield across its face holy power flared killing it instantly jerico backed off rotating from side to side letting the orcs endure the pain they felt every time their swords or axes struck his shield several tried to run past to flank but every time hed spin and slam bonebreaker into their gut or face he was nearing the fountain when he saw a gray blur fly overhead jerico charged knowing all too well what that meant howls of pain came from the pack as haern did what he did best jerico struck down the two nearest slammed aside a third with his shield and then met haern amid the bodies well met jerico said to haern before running toward the larger group of orcs further down the street at least thirty by his count probably more he shouted the name of his god and met the charge his legs braced his shield raised he felt the tremendous weight slam against him axes cut across his platemail fingers pried at his eyes and the open areas of his armor the orcs tried to bury him beneath their feet but he was a pillar of stone that would not be broken as the last of their momentum died he screamed in mindless agony he could feel the blood running down his body much of it his and then he pushed them back a glowing image of his shield filled the entire street its light blinding even in the morning sun when he stepped forward the shield struck the orcs shrieked as it crushed their bodies broke their bones and knocked them hundreds of feet back as a pile of twisted corpses that rained upon the street jerico staggered his strength fading when he turned to the fountain he saw lathaar making his stand against streams of orcs mira fought behind him killing tens at a time with fireballs and lances of ice haern weaved around the sorceress taking down any who avoided lathaar and tried to attack the unarmored girl too many jerico shouted as he ran to them we go to harruq over a hundred filled the southern roads some approached them at the center while others continued east slaughtering those who refused to kneel he looked to the north expecting the same scene but instead he saw soldiers marching in rows their swords were drawn and their armor was caked with blood antonil led them pull back antonil shouted to the eschaton we will cover your retreat lathaar swung side to side forcing his opponents to step back and that room was all he needed he turned and ran east grabbing miras hand as he did haern spun his cloaks to hide his form and then cut down the first two who tried to run past before he was buried by the orcs he activated the magic in his ring and reappeared on the other side of the fountain antonils men were down to twohundred having lost twenty during their march south from the castle he positioned five at the start of the eastern road saluting them with his sword hold was all he told them the men saluted and then turned to the mass of orcs they locked together their shields braced themselves and prepared for death theyll be slaughtered mira said as they ran they sacrifice so we may live antonil said and may ashhur forgive me for demanding such a thing from them the girl pulled her hand free from lathaars grip and turned back to the five the orcs pushed and slammed against them but they held firm stabbing over their shields and pushing back the greater numbers when over a hundred more orcs neared the men only raised their swords high and cheered mira did not understand what she was witnessing did not understand the valor and courage driving them but she knew she would honor it they would not be defiled and made to suffer she hurled a giant fireball as they were buried beneath the wave of orcs it turned them to ash and slaughtered more than forty of the orcs they had fought come on lathaar said taking her hand once more an army on their heels they ran s tay hidden among the people tarlak told aurelia as they hurried away from veldaren if we can catch them off guard the better the sea of refugees neared the circle of priests and dark paladins a hundred were ahead of them their legs fueled by fear and adrenaline their hearts in their throats tarlak and aurelia watched as the first reached the black circle the men and women tried running past the dark paladins drew their swords offered a prayer of thanks to karak and then slaughtered any who neared bodies piled at their feet killed by their burning black blades the priests poured prayers to karak and touched those near them with their hands horrible pain flooded those inflicted and wounds like knife cuts covered their bodies of the first hundred only twenty made it past alive butchers tarlak said take out the priests first ill try aurelia said the two picked a target and attacked tarlaks priest was caught unaware and without any wards for protection a bolt of lightning struck him square in the chest obliterating his heart trailing behind it was a lance of ice by aurelia her priest managed to bring up his hands and a spell was halffinished on his lips when the lance punched through his throat and pinned him to the ground they both turned on the final priest he summoned a protective shield but aurelias fireball broke its power and tarlak finished him with a barrage of twenty magical arrows the dark paladins attacked cutting down those unlucky enough to be in their way they split one after aurelia one after tarlak aurelia knew any spell she cast to protect herself would not be strong enough against their blades so instead she did her best to keep them back she tore up chunks of earth and hurled them at him as he punched and pushed his way through she knelt and touched the ground a patch of ice stretched from her fingers to his feet in his bulky armor he had little hope of keeping his balance she tried to cast a spell but then those behind her jostled her forward the people were running scared and there were too many for them to recognize the battle transpiring she fell onto the ice cracking her forehead purple lines marred her vision she tasted blood as if underwater she heard the rest of the refugees their shouts and crying a garbled murmur but worse was the knowledge that the dark paladin surely approached i got you a voice whispered still muffled it felt like swabs of cotton clogged her ears someone picked her up and balanced her on her feet she looked up and saw the dark paladin dead smoke rising from his armor she glanced to her side to see it was tarlak holding her the two were levitating an inch above the ice the swarm of people fleeing were avoiding the ice and therefore avoiding them theyre dead tarlak told her are you alright i cant think i cant she closed her eyes and put her head on his chest im sorry im not weak not like this shouldnt be i shouldnt be shush tarlak said we both are my head is going to explode if i cast another spell but we have no choice more are coming aurelia she looked back to the city and there she saw the wolfmen almost fivehundred running on all fours they were less than a mile away yet already they could smell the fear in the sweat of their prey i cant aurelia said turning away her eyes downcast she shook her head again and again you can tarlak said taking her head in his hands and forcing her gaze back up to him no she said tears running down her cheeks please i cant you will tarlak said and so will i if we fail we fail but i will not let any more die even if it means dying myself the ice below them faded its duration ended tarlak lowered them to the grass took off his hat and reached inside he pulled out a single vial he had hoped for more but he had been too quick to scavenge items from his tower drink this he told her itll clear your head and make you feel like you just had a solid hour of sleep the two stepped out from the stream of refugees running a blind east with no goal other than to leave the city far behind a few spotted the wolfmen and their screams of fear alerted the rest they fled faster pushed harder those who tripped or were too weak to continue were trampled pay no attention to behind us tarlak said stand still and cast until you cant cast anymore and even then continue if we take enough then maybe theyll have a shot the wolfmen howled in unison ready to kill ready to feast aurelia drank the contents of the vial all her will keeping her from gagging on the foul taste her mind did clear and the terrible ache in her temples faded she dropped the vial to the grass thank you she said dont mention it tarlak said he took out a wand from within his robe and held it with both hands lets just hope i get the chance to make you another a worn and battered pair they waited for the wolfmen to close the distance and the slaughter to begin h arruq stood before the gap in the wall his head was down and his hair covered his face salvation and condemnation were at his sides their tips jammed into the dirt his eyes stared at the people that fled to him and the safety he had offered even in their panic they made sure not to touch him something about him made them stay clear he did not see but those that passed stared in admiration or reverence he was like a deity made of stone several thousand men and woman had fled by the time harruq saw the first orcs they were scattered and few the teeth lining the edge of a gaping maw swallowing his entire city it was swallowing people he loved it would not swallow him the last of the refugees screamed for help but he did not move he would not reach them in time and if he left the gap orcs might escape the city and give chase so he watched his heart too calloused too exhausted to feel anything more than anger as the innocents were butchered and mutilated before him you will die before you pass harruq said to the first to approach the orc ignored his words and hefted his twohanded axe above his head salvation lashed out and cut his throat in a single blinding motion the sword returned to its original position as the body crumpled before him a second neared condemnation cut the axe from his hand looped around and disemboweled him the orc crumpled gasping out his pain harruq saw none of it heard none of it a strange anger had settled over him it was not raging or burning it did not consume him like so often anger had instead he felt it filling his veins like ice as three orcs charged him he knew without question they would die by his hand there would be no pleasure in the killing no thrill in the act just a deepening of the strangeness enveloping his mind harruq smashed away the axe aimed for his head stepped forward and buried one sword to the hilt in the orcs gut his other parried away a thrust so that the orc holding the sword fell forward harruqs elbow turned his nose to a splattered mess of cartilage and blood he then pulled free his sword and slashed the remaining orcs neck blood poured across the black steel four orcs lay dead at his feet he stared down the street where more than forty approached they carried pieces of humans like trophies his anger strengthened come and die like the animals you are he shouted to them he held his swords crossed above his head a glowing x that dripped blood the mass of orcs charged they had killed many but not enough they knew the innocents fled outside the walls only harruq remained in the way only harruq he swung with all his strength the magic in the swords cutting bone like it was dry wheat he took out the legs of the orc before him stepped back and then swung again three more fell their armor broken their chests and bellies pouring blood across the ground as the bodies fell they formed a barrier to the others behind one they had to stumble and climb across harruq gave no reprieve and offered no inch of ground the orcs swung cut and bit but he did not feel the tears in his flesh did not know of the blood that poured across him all he knew was the death in the eyes of those he killed and they were many as the last of the forty died or lay dying harruq screamed to the morning sky a single cry of anguish sorrow and anger it echoed throughout the town intermixing with the sobs of the trapped the bellows of hatred and the pitiful weeping of those whose lives now belonged to karak qurrah did not hear the war cry but he felt it in his heart c ome velixar said as the last of the undead marched through the walls it is time we entered as the conquerors we are the man in black raised his arms to the heavens his red eyes rolling into his skull he opened his mouth and whispered and his legions of undead obeyed karak they shouted karak karak it rose high from rotted throats and mindless flesh the walls shook with the cry all who heard felt the lions condemning eyes upon their backs the dark priests joined the shout and the lions roar traveled for miles the orcs took up the chant those who knelt forfeiting their souls for their lives whispered it the entire city became a writhing cauldron of death blood and worship karak karak but there were still those fighting against him and whose lips worshipped him not whose hearts followed ashhur even as they struggled to survive inside the maelstrom k arak be damned harruq shouted as he cut down his orcish attacker you hear me karak be damned he buried his sword deep into the gut of another so that blood poured hot across his hand and wrist he yanked out the blade and kicked the body back another obstacle for the incoming mass his anger had evolved he felt it flooding his being with strength wild and desperate to be used his focus was no longer the narrow knife edge but instead wide he saw everything felt everything as the battle grew desperate fifty more had come and they charged and howled with wild abandon harruq braced himself and prepared for the onslaught but then he saw they were running out of fear harruq had but a few to massacre the rest were buried by sergan and his soldiers well met gatekeeper sergan said his enormous axe hefted onto his shoulder so whats the toll i cant pay in gold but i got plenty of orc heads for you harruq wiped the blood from his weapons and sheathed them for a brief moment a grin lit up his face two heads a man can you pay the toll he asked two two bah my men here got nine to a head easy aint that right the soldiers exhausted and ragged raised their swords high and cheered go harruq said to emphasize this he turned and pointed to the wolfmen charging the fleeing peoples of veldaren they will need you more than i hear that sergan shouted we got some mutts to kill stick tight and well make it fine he turned back to harruq his voice dropping to a whisper are you sure you can hold until im dead ill hold the halforc replied thats what im afraid of sergan said but he smiled and saluted the kindness vanished quick as it came shouting with a voice hoarse and dry he hurried his men on as the last passed harruq drew his swords and placed his back to them his momentary reprieve was gone swarming onto the eastern road were over a hundred orcs harruq twirled salvation and condemnation taking comfort in their strength for karak the orcs shouted as they charged and karak can have you harruq shouted back his bravado was not false he saw the hundred and he saw them dead it was his task to make it come to pass from underneath his armor he pulled out the scorpion pendant brug had made him and let it dangle from his neck the pendant flared its magic increasing the strength of harruqs swords the first to near him lost his head the second fell with his body in two the halforc rushed the army cutting and chopping with a viciousness beyond anything he had ever known as the orcs climbed over piles of their dead he took off their arms and legs letting them add to the obstacle they tried to pass three orcs ran around the side where the pile of dead was less and leapt over seven bodies they were behind harruq and beyond his line of sight but there was one who could see them one who ran along the rooftops with long gray cloaks trailing behind him haern leapt into the air kicked off the wall and descended upon the three each saber stabbed downward at a neck as he landed a sweep of his legs took out the third he cut his neck as he fell bleeding out the orc before he ever hit the dirt harruq heard the commotion and spun salvation lashing out haern blocked it with both his sabers his blue eyes unflinching even as his arms quivered against the halforcs amazing strength harruq realized who it was nodded and then turned back to the horde haern joined his side and together they fought as the piles of dead grew larger the orcs pulled back their numbers were not enough their strength did not match up against the tremendous skill of their opponents more were coming however their numbers building higher and higher the two watched as the orcs cleared away the dead that blocked their paths how the others doing harruq asked as he gasped for air they live haern said estimating the forces arrayed against them as he neared two hundred he stopped bothering we will die here you know that right the halforc chuckled no i dont well hold haern we have no choice the assassin dropped into a stance one weapon high one low as the orcs prepared to charge its been an honor to fight beside you harruq tun haern said aye harruq said die well the orcs arrived spearheaded by a brave few and followed up by a cowardly many haern jumped forward slicing out the throats of two and tearing at the legs of the third they fell trampled by the others the assassin leapt back and this time harruq unleashed a whirlwind of steel the magical weapons tore through armor shattered the shafts of axes and broke the poorly wrought swords orc after orc fell dead often in multiple pieces with each spin harruq took a step back and with each step he left a trail of dead fall back haern shouted harruq did as ordered their opponents were too close and as he retreated several axes cut where he had been haern lunged parrying a few defensive swings before thrusting his sabers through eyes and mouths five died but they were a pittance the assassin retreated unable to strike any more harruq protected his retreat hurling a body against those nearest and then charging in blood poured across the dirt as he swung with both weapons left then right and then left again fearful of getting too close several orcs hurled their axes at him as well as the axes of the dead fight on haern shouted using his sabers to knock down or parry the axes he leapt over harruqs head and landed on the other side batting away two more throws his foot shot out tripping an orc and then he cartwheeled his other foot breaking a chin axes hurled through the air where he had been when he touched down he leapt again avoiding a second barrage more orcs charged thinking him on the run instead he activated the magic of his ring and appeared mere inches before them two impaled themselves on his sabers the others trampled over them haern screamed as the weight pressed against his body the dead orcs protected him from their axes and swords but that mattered little as feet stomped across his face he tried to activate the magic in his ring to teleport himself out but the magic for the day was spent haern gasped for air all the while cursing such a death get off harruq screamed slamming his shoulder into the group three flew backwards the unlucky fourth gurgling as the halforc tore out his throat with salvation harruq spun daring them to approach haern shoved off the bodies and staggered to his feet his face was badly bruised and every breath filled his chest with pain all around the orcs encircled them howling and taunting harruq haern said yeah get down the halforc obeyed the two dropped to the ground haern screamed as his chest pressed against the dirt but he would endure bright light flashed above them and then lightning tore through the ranks of orcs followed by a barrage of lances made of ice in the span of seconds they were all dead harruq stood stunned by the sight down the street came mira bits of ice still dripping from her fingers behind her were antonil and his men as well as the two paladins well met haern said bowing to the girl with blackest eyes form up a line antonil shouted his men spread across the street seven deep their shields interlocked lathaar and jerico stepped beyond them and surveyed harruq and haern do either of you need healing lathaar asked just my ribs haern said ill be fine healings for after the battle harruq said their bruises and cuts denied their words but the paladins let them be harruq stepped past them and saw the line antonil was forming no he said no get them out of the city get them out antonil turned to him and frowned and who are you to order me he asked harruq stormed over grabbed antonil by the top of his chestplate and yanked him close so that their eyes were inches apart i know you harruq said his voice quiet but shaking with intensity the people of neldar will need a leader go to them let us die as we must but take your men and go that clear antonil pushed aside harruqs hand then nodded to the fields beyond the wall the wolfmen were swarming through the refugees though it appeared many fought against them brief flashes of magic be it fire or lightning dotted the battle protect us as long as you can the guard captain said and ill do my best to ensure you have something to protect mira slipped past them all and stared out at the battle beyond the city her hands shook as she watched she could feel them dying her keen eyes saw many wolfmen avoiding the fight instead feasting on the slain others were circling about killing those that scattered or dropped off as if it were sport deep inside she felt her power stirring we must hurry she said before a sudden blast of wind propelled her across the grass faster than a horse in full gallop at antonils order his troops abandoned their wall of shields and marched outside the city only lathaar and jerico stayed behind for neldar antonil said saluting them for ashhur jerico replied the four defenders faced the west scores of orcs were dead and the rest who lived ignored the gap in the wall and instead tore into homes in search of easier victims the attacking army had been devastated of that there was no doubt still the remaining orcs were more than enough to slaughter the fleeing peoples of veldaren but it wasnt the orcs that attacked karak karak marching down the street far as they could see came the undead they jostled and bumped each other as they walked their eyes were lifeless but their voices were not karak karak there must be over a thousand haern said feeling his gut sink but they are dead jerico said readying his shield to my side lathaar you two stay back until you are needed the paladins weapons glowed a fierce white and the glow grew all the brighter as lathaar turned his swords into elholads youve seen many things in your life haern said to harruq as the undead army approached but you have never seen paladins fight karaks undead harruq guarded jericos right flank while haern guarded lathaars left the two paladins held their weapons high their eyes closed and their mouths whispering prayers to their god karak karak lathaar opened his eyes stay with me was all he said he launched himself at the tide of dead flesh and bone as the blades of light tore through the bodies the undead did not just fall they shattered as the magic controlling them was scattered and broken fast as he could cut them down they came packed together so tight that a single swing massacred three at a time as the hands tore at his flesh and teeth bit for his arms he leapt back jerico slammed his shield into the mass screaming ashhurs name the rotten flesh melted against his shield like butter he swung bonebreaker in wild arcs each blow blasting apart arms and chests deep into the army he ran and when the undead tried to close around him lathaar was there cutting them down back lathaar shouted and jerico obeyed he bashed his shield side to side beating away the clawing fingers lathaar cut a swathe of chaos through the ranks circling in front of jericos shield with no fear of its holy power as he circled back around to where jerico stood firm over a hundred undead lay in pieces across the ground blood ran from scratches across his exposed face and neck lathaar gasped for air he and jerico had rode night and day to reach neldar and their rest within the temple of ashhur had been too brief they were both running on adrenaline and faith each was tested as they stared out at the mass of dead chanting karaks name they had killed but a tenth of their numbers even rivers must run dry lathaar said as he sheathed his short sword amen jerico said as one lathaar lifted his sword and jerico lifted his shield the light upon them flared powerful and dominating harruq felt a comfort in his chest his heart longing for the peace he felt emanating within the light the undead however shrieked and howled those nearest disintegrated and those behind them tried to flee only to be pushed back and torn to pieces by the rest the light faded back to its gentle glow another hundred destroyed an awesome sight haern said in the brief lull before the paladins attacked once more harruq nodded but could not find words to describe what he had seen and felt lathaar cut through the undead holding his elholad with both hands jerico waited and when lathaar needed to retreat he was there his shield leading as they fought harruq twirled his swords unable to stand by any longer tired of watching yet he asked haern you know i am to either side they attacked haerns strikes were impossibly precise cutting away tendons and muscle so that one undead after another collapsed unable to stand or attack harruq was far less efficient salvation and condemnation pounded through skulls and bone with brute force between them lathaar twirled his elholad and sliced through the bodies that swarmed about when haern found himself overwhelmed he somersaulted back jerico was ready slamming his shield into the undead while the assassin was still upsidedown in the air time crawled harruq felt he fought an endless wave of fingers and teeth his armor was scratched and soaked in gore his face and neck were covered with bruises and every exposed bit of flesh was cut and bleeding any normal foe would have been exhausted and daunted by the enormity of death around them but they fought no normal foe bit by bit they retreated toward the wall unable to halt the wave despite their bravery the bodies were piling up their adrenaline was fading and the armor on their backs was becoming harder and harder to bear another hundred fell the dead were crawling over the barriers made by their own fallen yet still they came jerico could hardly swing his shield instead holding it against his body as the blows rained down harruq swung his arms without feeling the swords in his hands haerns strikes turned slower less accurate another hundred fell lathaar took the front his swords weighing nothing he used wide arcs striking any many as he could he called out to ashhur but his voice did not have the strength it once did the dead did not recoil at his faith they came onward dying their bones shattered their blood spilt and their skin torn and broken despite the losses the undead continued their chant karak karak they would not flee they would not stop another hundred fell come back harruq shouted as he kicked away the remains of a young man well fill the gap with their own corpses jerico whirled in a circle bonebreaker blasting away seven undead swarming about him he turned in the momentary reprieve and fled back to the wall following the others when they were out he turned and placed himself in the very center of the crumbled wall he collapsed to one knee his shield jammed into the dirt to support his weight i dont know how much longer he gasped he could barely see through the blood that ran down his face from the multitude of cuts and swelling bruises i dont know lathaar stood beside him his elholads glowing as fierce and bright as they had at the start of their fight the remaining hundreds of velixars forces jostled and approached but for the moment they did not attack harruq collapsed against the wall and glanced back to the refugees he saw no sign of tarlak and aurelia the wolfmen were gone the last remnants of veldarens people fled east it would not be long before they were out of sight theyll have a chance now harruq said letting his gaze linger longer than he should the undead were moaning and chanting but holding still they were a fraction of their former number but still dangerous still fearsome haern crouched using every second to catch his breath why command them to wait jerico asked i think i know lathaar said but he had no time to explain rise the command rolled through the homes and echoed against the walls hundreds of dead men women and orcs rose a single chant on their lips for qurrah for qurrah at their sound harruq closed his eyes and lowered his head look what your actions have done haern said the bodies of young and old men and women stretched far as they could see the number was far beyond their abilities already stretched to their limit they would all die and as they were torn limb to limb their murderers would shout and worship the name of harruqs brother not my actions harruq said opening his eyes and facing the horde he stood before jerico and held his twin blades before his face letting their red glow seep into him not my murders not my guilt i will not be damned for him the undead lumbered forward driven on by a single command kill the others readied their weapons and their hearts they would all fight and they would all die but harruq was not convinced gold shimmered in his eyes as he glared at beings robbed of their peace in death a thousand beaten he said through grit teeth time for a thousand more t he wolfmen split into two groups as they neared the fleeing people of veldaren tarlak swore as they went to either side of the people trying to surround and trap them dont worry about those who make it past tarlak said kill those near us and well draw enough to give them a chance of course aurelia said she turned and kissed him on his cheek thank you that better not have been a goodbye kiss the wizard said winking keep your end up and ill keep mine tarlak pointed his wand at the river of black and gray fur time to punish some very bad dogs a ball of fire leapt from the wand shrieking through the air with smoke trailing after it slammed into the center of their numbers and detonated waves of flame rolled out in all directions burning dozens of wolfmen to death instantly many more collapsed to the ground from the force of the explosion that was pretty aurelia said lightning sparking off her fingertips five more charges tarlak said got to make them count aurelia launched a giant strike of lightning into the right wave it bounced from one wolfman to another knocking at least thirty to the ground smoke rising from their fur she turned to the other side the lightning replaced with frost from her hands a blanket of ice stretched out for hundreds of yards as the wolfmen ran across they slipped and slid forming a barrier against those behind them over fifty tumbled or smacked into their own members until those behind started leaping over the ice or running atop the few crushed dead tarlak sensing opportunity sent another explosive ball of fire at the pileup atop the ice wolfmen howled as their fur burned and their eyes bulged in the heat unable to ignore the casters twenty broke for them the rest continuing straight for the unarmed people aurelia killed the first ten with bolts of lightning tarlak finished the rest with a ball of fire three charges left tarlak said as they spun about the wolfmen were raking their claws along the sides of the columns of men and women children of all ages were the first to die having fallen behind without someone to carry them tarlak felt the wand shake in his hand as he saw wolfmen stop to fight over the first scraps he spent his third charge obliterating five wolfmen that had gathered around a single woman holding two crying babes come on aurelia said taking tarlaks hand and pulling him along as they ran she cast weak bolts of lightning striking dead one or two wolfmen as they neared the wolfmen cut and bit through the slower stragglers quickly approaching the larger sections of people a whirl of her hands and fire sprang from the ground burning hot and high as it separated the wolfmen from the refugees hundreds closed their eyes and leapt through enduring the pain and burns to reach the helpless many others turned and howled at the two spellcasters tarlak sent another fireball into their midst roasting thirty more only one fireball remained in his wand the wolfmen charged their tongues hanging out the side of their mouths grab hold of me tarlak said as he clutched his wand with both hands can you protect us against fire i can try she said but why do you the wolfmen neared outnumbering them forty to one aurelia wrapped her arms around his waist as she understood keep your eyes closed she told him the words of magic for the spell were still on her lips as the wolfmen leapt at them their claws stretched and hungry tarlak tipped his wand to the ground and shot the ball of flame at their feet the shock struck them first blasting the air out from their lungs the heat followed agonizingly painful aurelia chanted even though she made no sound she felt her spell weakening her head was light her eyes saw only black the fire rolled on and on and she felt the last of her power drain away the protection spell faded but it had lasted long enough tarlak opened a single eye and looked about aurelia was in his arms and he was hunched over her as if he had been terrified which was true when he saw only charred remains of the wolfmen he straightened and reached for his hat he felt only smooth skin my hat he shouted my hair he spun around looking for his yellow hat and saw hundreds of soldiers marching toward him sergan leading the way to the fight sergan shouted pick it up before the crazy firekissing mage blows everyone to pieces they marched on by a few offering praise but most too somber to bother the rest of the wolfmen had reached the refugees and were tearing through them in a merciless bloodbath we need to draw them back aurelia said as the soldiers ran on but how the wolfmen arent here to just kill tarlak said oh there it is he found his hat ten feet away most of its yellow fabric now black he propped it on his head mumbling about the stupidity of fire spells finished he gestured to the carnage at hand look at them he said were too late most of the wolfmen had stopped their chase instead content to feed huge groups circled around masses of bloody bodies howling and yipping in glee oblivious to the charging soldiers they gorged themselves it was only when sergans axe tore through the skull of a fullbellied wolfman that they roared and charged only half bothered to stop their feasting the other half still eager for blood resumed their chase of the fleeing peoples stay tight sergan shouted and his sheer will alone kept his men going their armor was thick but the claws of the wolfmen were thicker giant waves of solid muscle and fur slammed against their ranks raking biting and tearing out throats over and over the wolfmen howled knowing fear was their ally sergan swore as he saw many of his soldiers shying away from the yellow teeth and the bloodstained claws theyre eating your loved ones he shouted grabbing a man who had turned to flee and spinning him around you gonna let them eat you too sergan did not wait for a response instead he turned around and buried his axe into a charging foe the wolfmen pulled back and started circling snarling their mouths oozing blood and drool those that had fled were cut down immediately sergan shouted orders determined to face the new challenge the soldiers formed a circle of their own and back to back they raised their weapons and hurled insults every now and then a wolfman would near clawing at an exposed leg or an unshielded arm every time an axe or sword awaited it severing claws or slicing away tendons in the leg those that stumbled due to their wounds were killed before they had a chance to call for help hold on sergan shouted we got them now it appeared they did and that was why the wolfmen suddenly turned and abandoned the fight faster than any of the men could hope to run they chased after their brethren and the fleeing veldaren people sergan swore and gasped for air as one of his soldiers beside him slapped his back we got them running the soldier said lets finish this aye sergan said hoisting his axe onto his back smart words ill agree to that tarlak said also slapping the general on the back where the abyss did you come from sergan asked startled tarlak pointed back toward the city you ran by us remember before they could say anymore mira flew past them only the sound of rushing wind marked her passing who the blazes was that sergan asked give chase and see tarlak said wait aurelia said she walked through the tired men and despite her exhaustion and wounds the regal sight of an ageless elf fighting alongside the mortal men filled them with hope when she reached their center she closed her eyes and raised her hands i have one last spell she said all around the men felt their skin tingle as the spell ended she collapsed into tarlaks waiting hands whatd that do sergan asked march and see tarlak told him sergan gave the order and to his shock his men raced away like horses their arms and legs pumping faster than he thought possible you going to follow tarlak asked sergan glanced back at the mage who was cradling aurelias head while she lay on the grass and then the general realized his own troops were leaving him far behind wait up he shouted he sprinted his old bones running faster than they ever had in his youth tarlak watched him go they would reach the wolfmen soon but not before many innocents were slaughtered again they would be outnumbered and he also knew the effects of aurelias spell once it ran out the soldiers would be exhausted if they did not kill quickly you better enjoy this nap tarlak said he shifted his hat and scratched the bald spot on his head because i might need you to wake up and save my ass if those wolves come back t he man pushed his way through the waves of fleeing people in the distance he could see veldaren now a smoking shell of its former glory the sound of screams and crying were all around him but they rolled in greater strength from the trailing end of the masses where the wolfmen fed three others followed this man all attired in red robes and armor they followed their leader trusting him with their lives kill quickly before they know any challenge them the man said the closest to him a redhaired girl who would be beautiful but for the brutal scar that had taken her right eye drew her daggers and smiled too fast and we wont get to have any fun the girl said too slow and one of us wont ever have fun again the leader said he pulled his hood off his head revealing long black hair that fell past his shoulders none could see his face for he wore a pale cloth pulled tight about his features only his eyes peered through two holes the left a dark hazel the right a vivid red the girl couldnt see but she knew he was smiling well do it perfect she said hate for us to die just when things were getting interesting the four neared the end of the refugees with only a panicked few men and women in between them and the hounds that chased the leader dipped his hand into a bag tied to his waist and pulled out a handful of ash tilting his head back he scattered the ash across his covered face instead of scattering in the wind the ash hovered about his body held in place by powerful magic when he lowered his head a haze surrounded it obscuring his already hidden features no hesitation and no mercy he said as he prepared his magic his name was deathmask leader of the ash guild with his home destroyed and all his negotiations contracts bribes and wealth of his thief empire ruined he was eager to show the wolfmen just how he had earned his title the last of the refugees fled past and the four stood ready deathmask raised his palms to the sky chanting dark words a leading pack of ten saw them gathered in a protective circle around their leader their daggers drawn and their red cloaks flapping in the wind the foremost howled and into the air they leapt determined to crush the sudden resistance burn for me deathmask whispered his spell completed his fingers clenched into fists and then jerked downward the grass before him cracked and broke as columns of fire tore into the air three wolfmen plunged through whimpering as the flame ignited their fur and blackened their skin the three guarding deathmask launched into action as the remaining wolves descended the lady with the missing eye jumped and collided in the air with her chosen prey the wolfmen bit and clawed but she kicked and spun avoiding every scratch just before they struck ground she buried a dagger into each eye scoring the first kill of the group behind you veliana deathmask shouted the lady did not check to see instead trusting her commander she dropped to her knees and curled down her head a swirling black ball of molten rock flew above her courtesy of deathmask it struck dead an attacking wolfman knocking his jaw clean off veliana stood and spun daggers lashing more had joined the initial ten furious at being denied easy kills and feasting blood splattered across her from cuts across a surprised wolfmans lip and nose a sharp elbow to his gut doubled him over and then her daggers finished him smoke swirled around veliana in a large circle as if escaping from some underground fire recognizing the spell the lady faced her attackers and beckoned them to assault seven charged howling for blood deathmask activated his spell as the first crossed the ring of smoke lava sliced through grass and formed a wall thin as a leaf the melted rock splashed across the wolfmen melting their eyelids to their eyes and coating their fur as they crashed to the ground howling in pain the lava hardened locking their bodies in strange painful contortions the lava wall vanished as quickly as it appeared but by now the wolfmen had no desire to engage they leapt straight for deathmask who laughed behind the gray haze mier nien care to keep me alive he asked the remaining two of the four clicked their daggers together and stood side by side in front of their leader gray bandanas obscured their mouths and chin but their brown eyes and black hair were mirror images of the other twins by birth they were also twins in combat mier dropped to one knee and swept his leg underneath the first attacker nien plunged a dagger through heart before the wolfman hit the ground while he pulled his dagger free nien spun and slashed the tendon above the heel of a second this time it was mier who buried his dagger into the heart of the fallen simultaneously they leapt into the air as three swiped their claws and bit at them as they spun and their cloaks swirled eight pairs of throwing daggers flew down piercing arms and legs both landed behind deathmask who stood with his palms open gray darts shot from his fingers over a hundred in number six wolfmen collapsed as the darts pierced their skin before vanishing into smoke they bled out and died little help here veliana shouted twisting and parrying the claws of two wolfmen that attacked her in a animal frenzy numerous cuts lined their bodies all superficial as deathmask whispered a spell veliana at last failed a dodge claws ripped through the leather armor and across her chest blood poured as she screamed and fell back nien and mier hurled daggers as they chased the wolfmen tensed and guarded against the painful but shallow stings buying veliana time deathmask slammed his hands together anger fueling his magic you cut her he whispered his spell needed no semantic components just rage you cut her and now youll bleed a vortex of gray smoke billowed from his mouth arching through the air like a snake through water it struck the two wolfmen and instead of blowing across them it shredded their flesh as if the smoke were made of steel razors veliana sheathed one of her daggers and clutched her wounded chest deathmask felt his heart skip the wound must have been deeper than he thought nien and mier ran on for they saw what veliana did not the remaining fifty wolfmen barreling toward her get back deathmask shouted the twins heard and obeyed veliana had fled too far out she would need to save herself deathmask hurled several orbs of black fire killing the nearest but it was too little too late we could save her nien shouted to his leader they are not that many mier agreed at my side she knows that deathmask said his mismatched eyes flaring with anger do not question me veliana glanced at the wolfmen saw their closeness and then turned to deathmask she blew him a kiss then started running for her life she was the slower and she should have been caught but she was not mira arrived lightning fire and ice exploded through the wolfmens ranks in a simultaneous barrage that left them devastated only a scattered few escaped fleeing with all their speed toward the safety of the city deathmask sighed and pulled the cloth from his face the people of veldaren were safe at least for now the four sheathed their weapons and bowed as sergan and his men approached they gasped for air yet still offered a mild cheer theyre safe mira said staring at the refugees that continued their eastward trek she smiled at deathmask thank you alright lets form up and get an idea what we got sergan said he smiled when he saw antonil and his troops in the distance ashhur be praised he said ashhur may not be to blame for this veliana said as she looked upon the smoking rubble of veldaren but he certainly deserves no praise not this day maybe sergan said but ive got breath in my lungs and a weapon in my hand so at the least ill praise him for that deathmask chuckled amen i guess w alking through the streets of veldaren they seemed demigods the orcs cheered and raised their weapons at sight of them those that knelt in prayer to karak groveled all the lower when they passed qurrah felt chills at the reverence tessanna giggled thinking it amusing velixar thought it was about damn time at long last velixar said as they arrived in the heart of veldaren standing before the giant fountain dedicated to valius kren the first king appointed by karak while he still walked dezrel the city is returned to the hand of its creator there are still those who resist qurrah said staring at the statue and remembering how it was there he had first met tessanna my brother included what will you do about them velixar did not answer instead he watched tessanna as she approached the fountain as if in a trance her eyes were locked on the waters a smile dominated her face she drew out her dagger and stepped in high above her head she raised her left arm and pressed the edge of her dagger against her pale scarred flesh its been so long she said and the smile grew she slashed her skin the blood poured down and as it did she twirled another cut she gasped in pleasure with every cut tessanna remembered the city as it had been she remembered the soldiers she remembered the thugs the men who desired her she remembered meeting qurrah the halforc felt the hairs on his neck raise as she laughed wild and free without punishment without anger without dismissal or disapproval she bled into the water im home she said to the two as they looked upon her qurrah reached out and she took his hand she stepped out of the fountain and pressed her body against his the blood from her arm unable to stain his robes he kissed her forehead twice then turned to velixar something in his glowing eyes disturbed him so he pressed the matter of his brother the gap in the east wall qurrah insisted many of your undead have been defeated i can sense as much they are no threat to us velixar said but that is no reason to let them live he is your brother the dead fill this city by the thousands raise them qurrah send them to the wall qurrah glanced away remembering the multitude of undead velixar had summoned on many occasions how many had he summoned at the sanctuary twentyseven at last he turned back to velixar shame bitter in this throat i cannot he said what i would summon will be a pittance compared to the army you can muster velixar crossed his arms and glared at his disciple you have grown in my absence qurrah tun but not near enough i said raise them tessanna rubbed her fingers across the halforcs face and brushed her lips against his ear listen to him she whispered he sees the same that i see qurrah stepped away from her and closed his eyes so be it he told them i will raise the dead that i can by now he knew every syllable by heart the power did not come from the pronunciation a mangled word only diminished the spells strength for the true power came from the well of his soul that seethed in black turmoil his hands shook as he felt nervousness crawl around the back of his mind his master was watching his lover was watching would he disappoint them how strong was he really he felt the essence of death floating around the city thick and strong in his mind he demanded it to follow his will the final words escaped his lips rise he shouted rise the strength fled his body the magic left him spent to his knees he fell and when he opened his eyes he sighed he did not have to say the number for he knew that all three of them could sense it pitiful velixar said a thousand bodies lay massacred within this city the death still fresh within them and you bring a mere seventy to their feet forgive me qurrah said between deep breaths it is the best i could do no velixar grabbed him by the front of his robes and lifted him to his feet with surprising strength eye to eye they stared velixars features swirled faster cheekbones growing out and then sinking back as his eyebrows stretched longer and thinner you have not done your best i had thought you would be tested with my absence but i was wrong look around you qurrah those that fight against us fight with every last drop of their strength and many beyond even that when was the last time you were pushed when was the last time you had to fight even when your mind was in agony and it felt your very next spell would send you to death when qurrah when never qurrah said as he glared his eyes flashing red let go of me the halforc turned his back to them and pulled his hood low over his face his pride was wounded and his anger seethed he had fought he had bled he had killed many and his strength had grown by leaps and bounds yet now he stood accused tessannas words repeated in his head he sees the same that i see what did that mean he stretched out his hands the words to the spell returned to his lips he would show his master that he was not the failure he assumed deep in his chest he felt his power stirring perhaps he had not poured all he had into the spell perhaps just perhaps he could do more his focus narrowed to a razor edge higher and higher his hands raised the power built and this time it was swirling out of control he tried to harness it to command it he opened his mouth and shouted the words within his being he felt fire his chaotic will stretched about the city demanding the dead to rise the dead obeyed another ninety stood i knew you could do better velixar said as the combined dead of the first two spells sauntered toward the center of town silence qurrah said the venom in his voice startling the halforc fell to one knee and propped himself up with a fist he gasped for breath within his head he could feel the hundred and sixty every one moving by his strength alone it was a weight he had never felt so strong before it was as if creatures lurked inside his eyes clawing and biting at any moment he thought he would pass out but it was not enough you wanted me pushed qurrah said as he stood you wanted me tested so be it master he raised his arms to the sky and began casting the spell one final time velixars eyes narrowed as he stared but tessanna only giggled at last she said as the power of the spell built flecks of white dust gathered around the halforcs frozen pose swirling as if it were a childsized tornado qurrahs eyes rolled into his head everything ached everything hurt the well of his magic something he felt himself attuned to felt empty drained but he remembered years ago when he had challenged velixars magic the well is limitless he thought the power grew steady its chaos was gone with each passing second he felt his soul rise the hairs on his body stood his mouth locked open the last of the spell finished the well refused to run dry rise he screamed and for once his throat did not tear magic poured out of him he demanded obedience of the dead and the dead obeyed his heart raced as his body wavered delirium overtook his mind the well would not run dry all around veldaren the dead were rising and still the well did not run dry he tore his gaze from the sky and looked at velixar a wild smile on his face for one heavy moment qurrahs eyes shone a fierce red a thousand he said and then he fell as he lay in the dirt the glow about his eyes faded away he coughed twice and then he began laughing go to him velixar said to tessanna the girl nodded still smiling she knelt beside qurrah and stroked his hair i can feel them qurrah said inside me theyll obey they are so manyso many velixar bowed his head as he heard the words of karak inside his mind he has felt my touch it will not be long before thulos enters this world and breaks the chains of the goddess praise be to you my greatest servant his eyes he whispered there is but one way for me to escape my prison you know this as well as i i was to be your avatar velixar insisted hold faith i show you no dishonor but if there is another i would keep you by my side as you wish the man in black said he raised his head and saw tessanna staring at him qurrah is mine first she said as she held her laughing insane lover and when your god is freed he is mine alone he has tasted what i have always lived velixar said i will never take him from you tessanna helped her lover to his feet he gripped her tight his fingers digging into her skin with wild eyes he grinned at velixar a thousand he said are you still disappointed master the features on velixars face slowed in their shifting and from within the frozen visage the red eyes glared follow me to the castle he said and send your pets to the east wall let them finish off your brother we have more important matters to attend to as you desire the halforc said he closed his eyes and all throughout the city his undead heard his commands and obeyed velixar led them north toward the castle qurrahs undead took up a chant and when velixar heard it a frown burned across his lips they did not shout to karak like they should have instead they shouted their loyalty to another for qurrah they shouted for qurrah for qurrah t he guards had abandoned their posts the giant doors were unlocked and unguarded the three of them were alone small figures in a giant city filled with fire blood and death velixar stared at the castle a smile replacing the frown he had been wearing he raised his arms as he saw the four crenellated towers the faded gray stone and the roaring lion carved deep into the walls at the base of each tower praise be to karak velixar said im home the inside was empty and quiet they walked across the carpet into the throne room king vaelor sat on his throne and in the morning light that shone through the windows he was an obnoxious yellow figure at the sight of them he stood and drew his sword no king has surrendered this city king vaelor said and i will die before i become the first you are not surrendering velixar said marching ahead of qurrah and tessanna you are relinquishing the throne to its rightful heir karak built this city and karak demands that long forgotten loyalty blasphemy the king shouted velixar laughed only an idiot would believe stating the truth to be blasphemy the man in black said as he curled his fingers i have no time for you worm his fingers uncurled blood collected around the kings eyes and in one single crack the bones in his face crunched inward the sword dropped from his hand he fell forward and bled out on the carpet not the honorable death he most likely hoped for qurrah said velixar dismissed the dead king with a wave of his hand none will remember his name he said fools and cowards are soon forgotten velixar passed by the throne gently touching its sides with his fingers the ceiling was high and behind the elevated dais was a wall covered with a giant crimson curtain hung from a long golden rod velixar grabbed part of the thick fabric in a fist and whispered a word of magic purple fire surrounded his hand the curtain burned in a sudden flash becoming ash without smoke or heat qurrah gasped at the sight behind the curtain and even tessanna grabbed her lovers arm and held it tight a single painting covered the wall done with skill and detail beyond anything qurrah had ever seen much of it was of a green landscape cluttered with small hills and a few sparse trees a giant portal swirled in the center fire burned out of control within it standing before the portal were two men strong and beautiful qurrah recognized one for he was eerily similar to the statue he had seen inside veldarens temple to karak the two could have been twins except for their hair the one on the left was blond the other brown perched on the clouds above them watched a woman her hair black as coal and her eyes empty orbs of shadow the resemblance was unmistakable she looked like an older mature tessanna right here velixar said interrupting the long silence that had followed the paintings revealing where this wall stands is where the gods entered they created the painting to commemorate their arrival the kings of neldar hid it not long after the great war as if they were ashamed of those that had shaped the stone and created their city velixar took out his journal and opened it to the center page his hand quivered as he glanced over the words so long he whispered so very long this is where we will cast the spell asked qurrah this is where we reopen the portal to their former world velixar brushed the stone with his fingers the stone rippled like water against his touch come qurrah let it be done tessanna kissed his cheek make me proud she whispered the halforc joined velixars side he glanced at the words on the page they appeared simple but he knew better the strength required to open the portal would be enormous otherwise velixar would never have needed aid he felt sweat trickle down his back as he repeated the words over and over in his mind wait he said we should rest we are both weary from the battle we should sunder the wall between the worlds while the chance is still before us velixar said interrupting him are you afraid qurrah tun of course i am qurrah said i am no fool the power needed could tear me to pieces and what of tessanna at this the man in black turned and offered his hand to the girl smiling she took it your magic is instinctual velixar told her given to you by the goddess herself you will know when the time is right qurrah i ask you are you ready qurrah closed his eyes he could still feel the weight of the dead he raised pressing on his mind but it grew lighter with each moment within himself he had found a well of power that frightened and exhilarated him could he tap it again he put his fingers against the wall and stared at the painted portal within the fire on the other side he saw raised swords and legions of armies silhouetted in black did he have the strength to condemn all dezrel to such a fate he felt tessanna take his hand he glanced behind and saw the love in her eyes the trust and the fragile faith yes qurrah said i am ready velixar began first chanting in a deep monotonous tone over fifty lines filled the page varied in their pitch and pronunciation qurrah took a deep breath and joined in at first he felt no difference from the other cantrips and spells he knew but then the power hit it was as if he had latched onto a carriage as it sped by with its horses at full gallop deep in his chest he felt a pull and as he poured all his will into continuing the words he felt his whole body trembling qurrah he heard tessanna shout the strain was horrendous every bit of magic shrieked out of his soul his vision faded into a mix of red purple and yellow within the psychosight the words on the tome burned like fire his voice rose higher his throat tore and as the blood ran down he knew he was going to die at his side velixar continued casting even as the book shook in his hand and the red glow of his eyes dimmed to nothing the wall before them raged like the surface of a lake within in a storm all he could hear was a constant thunder but whether it was real or in his mind he did not know the words continued the magic continued his death grew closer take my hand he heard a voice say and in the madness he sensed a stability he had never thought possible he reached out blindly a hand took his and its grip was iron he collapsed unable to see the words of the book but not needing to every thought every image every breath was dominated by the power of the spell he screamed and even as he screamed he continued a tiny sliver of blue swirled in the center of the wall the spell was nearing completion qurrah tried to speak the final lines the lines that would wrench open the wall and end dezrel but he could not his screaming was too loud the pain too incredible through tearfilled eyes he looked to velixar and saw his true visage he was a skull with eyes bones with a robe death in a body his features no longer changed for he had no features just his eyes which were dull and colorless he too was screaming and his wail was the final blow against his shattering psyche forgive me mother a voice said its sound a perfect calm amid the thunder forgive me but i wish to be free of your desires your eyes your power please mother forgive me tessanna placed a hand upon the wall wind swirled in every direction the ground heaved in protest images and sounds from the far corners of the world assaulted them random and wild amid it all the girl with blackest eyes felt at home so softly she whispered the final words that neither had the strength to say take away it all she whispered as the portal ripped open in a sudden violent explosion of noise and air qurrah and velixar flew back their limp bodies rolling across the ground tessanna arched her back and lifted her arms as the chaos swarmed over her followed by a blinding white light that quickly turned red her vision returned as the light lost its strength the portal gently swirled its being filled with what looked like millions of tiny stars compared to the original portal it was tiny only the size of an ordinary man tessanna brushed its edges im sorry she said backing away she laughed as she cried but i couldnt be happier mommy velixar was the first to his feet we did it he gasped his voice was raspy and weak but with each passing moment it sunk deeper and firmer celestia has lost ashhur has lost qurrahs haunting laughter echoed in the cavernous room do you sense it he asked as he lay on his back can you feel the hatred the goddess is furious velixar oh so furious the portal shimmered and shrunk as if in response qurrah and velixar screamed in turn as they felt sharp pains spike into their minds celestia was trying to close the portal leave them be tessanna shouted as velixar fell to the floor and qurrah rolled around on his back his laughter and screaming an intertwined sound of lunacy the castle rumbled as if the earth itself were angry desperation velixar said as his own screaming faded there is nothing she can do but strike at us in futile frustration he knelt on knee and stared at the portal as a red liquid ran from both his eyes a wave of his hand and the shimmering stopped the portal swirled faster stronger the stars pulled back leaving a deep blackness fixed in the center the blackness grew something is coming through tessanna said as she backed away qurrah stood turned to one side and spat blood he grinned as he wiped the back of his hand over his mouth who approaches he asked velixar a lowly demon a commander of an army or is it thulos himself will he bow to you or cut off all our heads before we can speak a word velixar pulled his hood low over his face and smirked if you thought the latter was the case you wouldnt be smiling stay on your best behavior while karak has sought an alliance with his brother the same cannot be said for thulos for centuries they have hunted for this world tessanna wrapped her arms around qurrahs shoulders and braced her chin on his shoulder unless its thulos we can kill it she said so we might as well be polite air hissed out of the portal as if it were exhaling and then the creature stepped through he looked human albeit a magnificent version of one giant muscles flexed inside his crimson painted armor only his arms were exposed the rest covered in wellcrafted mail made of plate and chain a golden helmet rest atop his head its nose guard hanging long past his chin in the back was a small hole so that the mans brown ponytail could be pulled through emblazoned across the chest piece colored a vibrant yellow amid the crimson was the symbol of a fist hanging from his hip was a giant sword sheathed in black leather gems and rubies the man stared at them with wide amber eyes his skin was bronze and every inch covered with scars when he spoke his language was that of the gods we have opened doors to many worlds but this is the first brazen enough to open a door to ours the man said who is the idiotic dabbler in magic that created this rift name yourself so that i may punish your stupidity the man from the other world drew his sword its length nearly equal to velixars height in response velixar bowed low and beamed a smile frightening in its authenticity i am the one who opened the portal he said and long have i desired suchidiocy do you know where you are minion of the war god the man glanced about and the confusion in his eyes was like a crack in his armor of confidence all he saw was a castle one like thousands he had destroyed before but the man with the everchanging face spoke his language and knew of his master i do not know the man said but when you speak i have understanding my name is ulamn general of the first legion and servant to the war god with whom do i speak velixar again bowed as he introduced himself i am velixar voice of the lion and i welcome you to dezrel a world you have long sought after the lion ulamn said his sword lowered as his mouth hung open do you mean in answer velixar drew from underneath his robe a pendant he had held ever since the end of his mortal life it was shaped like a triangle in one corner was mountain another a lion and in the third a clenched fist proof of my claim velixar said as ulamn shook with rage i speak for karak and he welcomes you the cowards fled here then ulamn said gesturing about the castle with disgust failing in their duty and unwilling to accept the consequences for what purpose does karak call upon the warseekers conquest velixar said he yearns to fight alongside his brother but he has been trapped by the goddess of this world if thulos can defeat her karak will be free to join your side ulamn sheathed his sword and crossed his arms thulos is not one of mercy or compassion karaks cowardice is forgivable velixar insisted thulos may not be one for compassion or mercy but he is one of honor let karak atone his disgrace by serving do you dare tell me your master would refuse such a powerful ally as his own brother qurrah felt tessanna tighten her grasp around his shoulders her hair tickled the side of his face as she kissed his ear when the soldiers come she whispered who is subordinate to who i will speak with the war god ulamn said his amber eyes widened with excitement we are always eager for new worlds to conquer he bowed and velixar bowed back without another word ulamn turned and vanished back into the portal to his homeworld velixar laughed long and loud the sound chilled qurrah but not as much as it once did the war demons are coming the man in black said let dezrel fear and the heavens shake with the coming rupture karak will be freed amen qurrah said a crooked smile on his face tessanna kissed his cheek amen she said she tossed her hair and giggled so many are going to die were bad qurrah badbadbad qurrah only laughed t hey came in waves thirty or so of shambling undead biting with bleeding teeth and clawing with broken fingers each wave threatened to break their line but harruq held firm as the wall of the dead grew ever larger lathaars elholad had faded and he swung normal steel with exhausted arms even haerns slender sabers felt like giant clubs to him the potent magic in bonebreaker kept jerico dangerous with even his mildest of swings smashing bone harruq however seemed no longer mortal salvation and condemnation blasted away flesh and sliced off limbs without pause he no longer felt his arms but he didnt need to he just kept on swinging the shower of gore proof enough that his numb hands still followed orders blood soaked him from head to toe much of it his but he didnt care any time his resolve threatened to break or his exhaustion steal him away into unconsciousness he heard the words that spurred him on for qurrah for qurrah they chanted it and in return he shattered their jaws and took the blasphemous life that enabled them to speak to harruq it was a fair trade the gap in the wall narrowed further and further filled with corpses of all shapes and sizes harruq kept ordering the others back until only he stood before a four foot expanse that the undead pressed through they kept coming kept trying to drown him in numbers but his arms never ceased haern wanted to say something to hear his student speak but dared not disturb his concentration lathaar leaned beside him and whispered amid the slaughter what is he he asked haern shook his head just a halforc he replied ashhur is with him jerico said hoisting his shield onto his back even more so than with lathaar and i his will his strengthbut his body will break tears filled harruqs golden eyes he didnt even see his attackers anymore he just saw his friends his family and the face of his brother he would kill them he would kill all of them for aurelia for tarlak for brug and then the undead changed their chant for aullienna they shouted for aullienna for aullienna the sound was a horrendous blasphemy the beautiful name of his daughter flooding the streets through dead throats and lifeless vocal chords as harruq cried his heart filled with pain equal to the pain in his chest his legs his head he couldnt think he couldnt breathe too tired too damn tired delysia brug aullienna was aurelia still alive tarlak he fell to his knees his weapons falling limp beside him the confidence in which he fought dissolved into emptiness deep in his head he heard qurrah laughing harruq haern shouted seeing his students sudden collapse lathaar reacted first slamming his shoulder into harruqs side the two fell to the side of the gap in the wall jerico smashed his shield forward pushing back the undead harruq snap out of it haern said pulling the halforcs face up by the hair but harruqs eyes were rolling into his head and he kept shaking side to side his lips were moving but nothing came out wisps of dark smoke rose from his tongue damn you qurrah the assassin whispered what game is it you play now h e stood on stars hidden beneath glass blue fire rose and fell in a ring around them and high above floated a small red sun where am i harruq asked qurrah pulled back his hood his eyes were a deep red his skin was ashen with each word he spoke the blue fire flared higher where does not matter dear brother only why forgive me for such a ploy to use aulliennas death as a weapon against you is a cheap dishonor but i needed you to fall your mind has grown stronger entering was no easy task such a shame harruq said seeing the stars below his feet filled him with vertigo so he stared straight at qurrah his eyes reminded him of velixar and the chilling thought kept his mind sharp celestias wall has fallen qurrah said as we speak an army of war demons enters the city there is no limit to their size harruq hundreds of thousands loyal to velixar and to me we will lay waste to all life why harruq asked what have you suffered to slaughter so many what loss have you endured that is greater than my own weve been fools for a long time qurrah said the blue fire soared to the crimson sun a wall reaching millions of miles high the red in his eyes deepened your daughter died because of velixar he led aullienna into the forest and planted the seed that eventually drowned her your hatred of me your vengeancenone of it is just harruq felt as if a knife had shredded his insides and then stuck firmly into his heart his head swirled much as the stars did below i loved your daughter qurrah continued as did tessanna our recklessness caused her death what do you want with me harruq asked unable to meet qurrahs gaze join me everyone will die it is inevitable does it matter if life ceases its pointless cycle on this miserable stretch of rock you your wife the rest of the eschaton just bow and swear allegiance and you will live what life could i hope to live in a dead desolate world we will leave it qurrah said when all is conquered velixar will open us a door to a new world without our troubles without our death we can escape go back to how it had always been dezrel will be but a sad memory harruq looked back up to qurrah his lower lip quivering back to how it was he asked qurrah nodded back as if we never met velixar back harruq said back to killing children for your games back to trusting you and obeying your commands you would sacrifice this world and then ask me to sacrifice my very life to serve at your side deadly anger swarmed over qurrahs face you will die otherwise what you ask for is worse than death so melodramatic qurrah said his voice a vile hiss is what i offer truly so terrible what do you gain by fighting against me accept my apologies accept my mercy live at my side dont die beneath me a chuckle shook harruqs belly vibrating up his chest and out to his arms until his whole body was quaking with laughter one day i will die he said but it will never be beneath you youre as low as it gets brother theres no way to sink any lower get out of my head the fire sunk the stars faded and as the sun shrunk into a thin dot qurrah sighed the red of his eyes was all that harruq could see and in perfect silence he heard the words of his brother so be it my mercy is spent you will break before me and unlike you i will not show weakness when i strike the killing blow harruq did not allow him the final word even back how it was he said you never would have stayed your hand the darkness broke and he opened his eyes d amn him qurrah said jarring out of a trance tessannas hands wrapped around his body holding him as he reoriented himself the two cuddled against a wall of the throne room near them was the portal which had been still ever since ulamns departure velixar was on the opposite side of the room deep in prayer to karak he didnt accept tessanna said i told you he wouldnt you give my brother too much credit qurrah said and you give him too little will he die to your undead the halforc rubbed his eyes and then shook his head no he wont hes still strong as are his friends hes almost out of the city tessanna nestled her face into the side of his neck have your pets keep chase she said giggling as if it were a humorous joke day and night theyll follow deny your brother sleep deny him rest he will crumble she grabbed qurrahs hand and held it against her abdomen is it true he asked her are you with child of course tessanna said her eyes sparkling aullienna will no longer haunt me i will have a daughter of my own cease your pets chanting of her name already done she wrapped her arms tighter about his waist and kissed his chin ready to be a father she asked him i do not run from my responsibilities he said that isnt an answer he frowned down at her it is the only answer i will give now please i need sleep he shifted more of his weight against the wall and closed his eyes so he wouldnt see the frown he knew was across his lovers face she wanted to know he could feel her presence peering at the edges of his mind her considerable mental strength curious to his inner feelings such feelings were well guarded for in truth he did not know if he was ready to be a father he wasnt even sure he knew what it meant to be one how many children had he killed how often had he preached against bringing life into a world of suffering in doing so was he a hypocrite and a blasphemer against his own beliefs he didnt know the stone was cold the portal was open and karak was victorious all other things were chaos so he stroked her hair and enjoyed her touch while all around the city burned g et him up lathaar shouted as he hacked at the limbs that pressed past jericos shield even if you have to carry him get him up ill get right on that haern whispered slapping harruq across the face the halforcs eyes were vacant more of the strange shadow floated from his open mouth what is it you are saying haern asked leaning closer get out of my head harruq growled his focus returned where the abyss am i he asked later haern said standing and offering him a hand harruq tried to accept but his arms swung like wood his fingers foreign and unresponsive so instead haern grabbed the crook of his arm and pulled him to his feet is our sleeping princess awake jerico shouted his entire body was braced against the river of undead which moaned in futile anger can you feel your legs haern asked ignoring the paladin harruq shook his head well can you still run he better lathaar said as he lopped an arm off at the elbow because thats what were doing jerico braced with his front foot and then used it to push off hooking his shield onto his back as he ran east lathaar swung his sword in a single arc cutting down the first bunch of undead that toppled through before he too sprinted east haern pulled the halforc along harruq struggled to focus foot after foot that was all that mattered swing a dead log that was his leg plant down and then swing the other the undead poured through the wall but they were slow and lumbering second after agonizing second the city grew smaller behind them the chorus of moans becoming distant their pace slowed to a steady jog which soon slowed to a quick walk they all kept their silence they were too exhausted for anything else t hey had no tent so instead they found a few withered trees hacked off their limbs and arranged them in a circle representing the commanders tent the air was cold and with the setting of the sun it had grown even colder fires dotted the hills each source of heat heavily crowded in the center of their circle a large fire roared courtesy of tarlak antonil and sergan sat beside each other huddled and dejected the eschaton sat with them as did deathmask and his group grief had come with the stars and the night was filled with the cries of lost homes friends and loved ones lets keep this simple no formalities here antonil said breaking the silence that had fallen over them tarlak your eschaton saved countless lives this day so that is why i bring you all here ashhur forgive me but i must ask for even more and deathmask the reputation of your ash guild and your defense of my people has also earned you a seat amongst us sergan and i will speak for whatever remains of our kingdom of neldar do any object you might as well speak for neldar tarlak said no one else will i need to know what chance we have antonil said he glanced around meeting each and every pair of eyes surrounding the fire start with the basics food water shelter can we manage i can conjure spring water from the ground aurelia said she sat in harruqs lap her husbands arms wrapped around her to keep her warm and once we have a decent sleep creating fire for warmth should not be a burden a decent sleep may be a long time coming jerico said pointedly glancing west twenty guards patrolled the area ready to sound the alarm if a party of undead entered their camp any sleep will feel divine right now tarlak said he brushed his goatee with his thumb and forefinger though fire does us no good while traveling how many with us are too old or too young to survive a journey in the cold we have no blankets no tents lets not worry about what we cant change antonil said what about food aurry cant you summon some harruq asked same with you right tar deathmask chuckled at the halforc did no one bother to tell him of the components for mage banquets he asked components harruq asked in answer tarlak reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of small yellow gems he handed one to the halforc topaz the wizard said the more the food the more topaz we use what did you think those extravagant meals we fed you were free i have some as well aurelia said enough to feed five for a month but how many thousands are here it will never last keep it simple deathmask said plain bread if we spread it out we might have enough to last an extra week tarlak aurelia do you mind being responsible for the food and water until another solution is found antonil asked tarlak laughed sure why not i dont mind being a walking bakery another moment of silence antonil knew the first part was easier at least compared to what he planned to propose so we have no shelter the guard captain began and limited food where else can we go to seek aid omn is a brutal month away through the deep of winter no less we must go to the elves and request their aid youre a fool deathmask said after you nearly start a war to remove them from woodhaven you think either race of elves will give food and shelter to so many refugees the one responsible for that edict is dead antonil said his ragged face hardened and do you see any other option if i must i will have scoutmaster dieredon plead my case they will turn us away deathmask insisted mordan waged war to push them across the rivers and then neldar banished them from their lands we are not welcome and we are not wanted you might as well turn us back around and march us right into veldaren and if i thought it was the best path for my people id be the first to kneel before the armies of the dead antonil shouted but ill be damned if i watch the rest of this nation slaughtered by karaks madness quiet down now tarlak said stroking his goatee as he glanced between the two deathmask i understand your worry personally i think the elves will be thrilled at the chance to thumb their noses at us but does anyone here know of any possible alternative silence i didnt think so tarlak said i dont know the prejudices of most here but the elves arent evil and they arent heartless monsters there are too many weak and helpless here for them to fully turn us away the bigger question is do we seek help from the quellan or the dezren elves the quellan aurelia said she shifted in harruqs lap they will help us the dezren will just turn us away how do you know this tarlak asked wait a second harruq interrupted whats the difference between what is it quellan dezren does no one tell this beast anything deathmask muttered watch it harruq grumbled the dezren elves once lived in mordan lathaar said he had drawn his sword and laid it across his lap his eyes staring at the soft bluewhite glow king baedan waged war quick and brutal to force them from their forests by systematic fires those fires spanned for miles and filled the sky with smoke and ash the elves fled across the rivers and settled in what you know as the derze forest many came to the citadel for aid but we you turned us away aurelia said left us cold and hungry and scared as we entered a country not our own in search of a home as she spoke both jerico and lathaar stared at the ground in shame a kind word a hand raised in aid and we might have believed that not all humankind shared such hatred and disgust you were the champions of the god of men you turned us away the dezren elves will not give us aid i was but a child at the time lathaar said in the following quiet i dont know the reason politics perhaps or maybe sorolloss influence had grown too strong but i remember your faces so beautiful so tired i tried to offer some food to a small elven boy my headmaster slapped the bowl out of my hand and ordered me inside the quellan elves share their hatred antonil said his own voice turning ragged why would they help us it is they who helped the dezren build homes in their forest while vaelor turned a blind eye to their plight harruq aurelia said tell them what your brother said to you just before you fled the city the halforc shifted suddenly uncomfortable with the amount of eyes watching him how many didnt know of qurrah how would he explain who he was and what his brother had done qurrah he said trying to find a place to start hejust before we left he entered my mind he said celestias wall had fallen and that thousands of demons were pouring into the city i dont know what he meant or if he spoke the truth celestias wall mira asked startling those around her she had remained silent for the meeting but now seemed focused who is this qurrah deathmask asked and what wall did he speak of qurrah harruq began was once a member of my eschaton tarlak interrupted he has caused us much grief and sides with the servants of karak he commands many of the army that overran veldaren qurrah antonil said the necromancer you accused of mutilating the bodies half a year ago he leads this army yes tarlak said we did not kill him when we had the chance now we all pay dearly for our failure the wall mira said tell me what is it aurelia started to speak but antonil held up a hand it is my failure he said and i will tell it only kings and guard captains are shown what is behind the throne curtains it is a mural depicting ashhur and karak entering this world through a swirling door made of stars whenever a new king takes the throne the quellan elves send a single diplomat always with the same request will you guard that which all other kings have guarded most assume it means peace or life but that isnt it our scholars believe it is through that wall that gate of stars that the gods entered our world the quellan elves confirm this whatever celestia guarded our world from cannot be ignored mira said antonil stood and turned his back to the fire his hands shook at his side i swore to guard the throne of the king with my life yet here i am what has your vile brother done harruq what has he released into our world aurelia brushed aside harruqs arms and stood placing her hand atop antonils shoulder he flinched but did not push her away the quellan elves will fight them she said no good would have come from your death nor the sacrifice of the thousand that look to you for strength say the destination and we all will follow give the word and your people will gladly die in the cold damp earth it is better than the fate you spared them from is it antonil asked as the guards at the perimeter called out warning undead approached can you be so certain w ake my disciple velixar said qurrah muttered and crept open an eye can it wait until dawn he asked velixar frowned displeased at the lack of immediate obedience ulamn returns stand our new army comes tessanna stirred at the sound of their voices our army she asked her voice was drowsy and her eyes still closed do they march with our banner do they obey our commands in time velixar said the portal swirled the stars violent qurrah stand their passing will tax your strength gently qurrah slid tessanna off his chest and to the floor he staggered to his feet brushed his eyes and then screamed in horrid pain velixar grit his teeth and his eyes faded ulamn stepped through flanked by twenty guards they held flags of the yellow fist weapons hung from their belts the first of many ulamn shouted and the others raised their fists and cheered they marched forward ignoring the three in the corner twenty more arrived wielding polearms made of a strange red iron that matched their crimson armor again qurrah screamed the pain will lessen with each passing velixar said his voice raspy and weak celestia has not yet given up hope of breaking our spirit i can see that qurrah gasped as he crumbled to his knees thirty more soldiers entered they held supplies for constructing tents and fortifications the halforc winced his teeth locked tight so that his scream came out as a hissing moan try to rest tessanna said as she stroked her lovers face it is only pain you have endured worse that qurrah said as he gasped for air that is a lie a group of forty marched into the throne room carrying long planks of wood atop their shoulders qurrah arched his back against the wall and smacked a fist against the cold stone sweat covered his face through blurred eyes he saw velixar did little better his skin had turned pale and rotten his eyes were tiny spots of red amid a dried up skull velixar pulled his hood low across his face and turned away from his disciple do you understand the power we control velixar asked without us they cannot enter to defeat the armies of celestia and ashhur they will need thousands of thuloss war demons if we break under the strain they will be trapped here thousands qurrah gasped as another group of forty entered marching in perfect formation with gigantic swords strapped to their backs it will get easier velixar said i promise ulamn finished ordering his men to set up camps along the outside of the castle and approached the necromancers we normally have a hundred gatekeepers to share the burden of passing through our armies he said to have only two will slow us greatly we have time velixar said how many centuries have you searched for this world a few extra months will be nothing thulos will not be able to enter the demon general said you both are far too weak to support the entrance of a god when celestia is defeated and her elves ash and bone we will have the strength velixar said how many come with you two hundred for now ulamn said glancing at qurrah will he survive he will tessanna said answering for him i know he will so be it we will camp within the city a battle has been fought here and it will do us good to be surrounded by the bodies of the conquered qurrahs scream interrupted them which then turned to laughter is it true pain makes you stronger he asked in between laughs because you wont need a god after this ill be one his madness is ulamn began none of your concern velixar said go tend your army the demon general frowned but obeyed two more groups exited the portal before it shrank the stars fixated in position qurrah gasped in relief as the light returned to velixars eyes i will be in prayer the man in black said before marching off he could not bear to be in the same room as his disciple he slammed the doors shut behind him leaving the two lovers in silence tessanna knelt down and held qurrah as he gasped in pain i wish they would have let me sleep first he said the right side of his face cracking a smile sleep now tessanna told him kissing each of his eyes closed recover your strength you will need it by the morn he did as he was told far too weak to argue otherwise m ira slipped through the many fires her heart panged by the sight of so many suffering she wondered how many would never wake from their sleep ten fifty a hundred the cold would claim so many she reached the edge of their encampment a lone guard walked by a faded cape wrapped around his body and his helmet pulled down to cover his numb ears he nodded at her as he passed a throne of a king mira said her eyes staring off in the night visions danced before her not of her own creation and a mural with the gods entrance is this what you want of me celestia is this my purpose she waved her hands tearing open a blue portal her whole body quivered with fear and excitement she knew who waited on the other side could she face her knowing what her dreams demanded she didnt know but she entered anyway t essanna stood as the small blue portal ripped open beside the throne she smiled as a healthier livelier version of herself stepped through they stared at each other with gigantic black eyes the eyes of goddesses i dreamt you would come to me tessanna said is that all you dreamt mira asked no tessanna said smiling at her sleeping husband i dreamt of my child and i dreamt of you dying my dagger plunged deep in your breast she drew her dagger and licked the edge not minding the blood that trickled from the cut she made on her tongue i dont trust my dreams mira said ive defeated ancient demons tessanna armies have quivered and fled by my hand alone and qurrah quivers from mine tessanna said and he is greater than any army soft white mist fell from miras hands as she summoned her magic dreams change she said never tessanna said only we change our dreams stay the same mira hurled a lance of ice which quickly shattered from a wave of tessannas hand seven more lances followed each one breaking as she laughed is this all tessanna asked i thought you were supposed to be my mirror mira spread her arms above her head and glared a ball of fire grew shaking with intensity with all her strength she hurled it across the room but not at tessanna instead it flew straight for qurrahs sleeping body tessanna shrieked twirling her hands on instinct a wall of shadow cocooned him the fire exploded burning curtains and filling the room with smoke qurrah was unharmed tessanna glared at mira she was no longer having fun mira saw this and smirked i lived alone for so long mira said as did you what would it be like to lose him and return to that loneliness never tessanna hissed bolts of shadow shot from her hands splashing across a magical shield mira uncrossed her arms and from the center of her chest a bolt of lightning streaked across the room tessanna caught it in her hand laughing as she felt its power char her flesh her laughter ended when a second bolt struck qurrah dissolving her barrier around him qurrah exhausted beyond measure from opening the portal and enduring the arrival of so many troops remained unconscious how afraid of loneliness are you mira asked before she could hurl a second attack at qurrah the lightning bolt left tessannas hand strengthened by a surrounding aura of fire mira brought up her shield and cried out in pain as she halted the spell tessanna gave her no reprieve she locked her hands together braced and then fired a gigantic beam of shadow mira did the same except pure white magic streamed from her hands the two beams struck the sound of their meeting a concussion of violent thunder you will break tessanna said you have no idea the pain i can endure suddenly mira halted her beam and hurled herself into the air with a levitation spell tessannas spell continued onward blasting apart the doors to the castle destroying several homes and eventually knocking a hole in the wall surrounding the city she swore as several soldiers in crimson armor entered in a frantic search for the cause of the tremendous magical power stay out of this she shouted to them the men glanced about saw qurrah lying vulnerable and ordered a protective barricade mira frowned at the sight her one advantage now blocked by a wall of shields you have no escape tessanna said you arent strong enough to beat me and even if i fall others will kill you this accomplishes nothing liar mira rained fire from the ceiling burning the stone to black the fire did not pass through their shields and tessanna herself let several waves burn her skin and singe her hair she laughed at the pain a goddess fighting a goddess tessanna said who wins who breaks the tie the angrier mira said lightning swirled about the ceiling striking tessanna over and over some she blocked with a shield others she let hit her smoke rose from her eyes and when she opened her mouth and laughed putrid darkness floated from within like ash you would strike my lover to defeat me tessanna said and you are wrong it is not the angrier it is the one most insane she raised her arms and black ethereal wings stretched from her shoulders they grew larger and larger reaching from the ceiling to the floor a single beat and she rose to equal height as mira and then shrieked a wild magical cry the sound knocked mira back and scattered her thoughts the sight of the black angel awakened something inside her she slammed the other side of the room with her body then gasped at the pain her eyes flared a rainbow of colors wispy white wings grew from her back attached to her shoulder blades by ethereal strands white and black light shimmered in the room and even the experienced war demons who had conquered many worlds stood with mouths agape insane mira asked is this what you call insanity tessanna snarled and cast a bleeding spell the magic faded losing all strength in the blinding white she hurled fire and lightning but this time it was mira who let the spells hit laughing as they splashed across her skin they damaged her dress and burned her skin but caused no serious harm is this what we are mira asked as she beat her wings stretching the luminous white extremities throughout the room is this the visage we will know beyond our death tessanna pulled her arms tight across her chest her black eyes shimmering beneath a gray haze red seeped into her wings the bloody crimson similar to the wings of the soldiers guarding qurrah with their shields swirling darkness collected around her hands she stared at mira with a sudden calm and at that look mira knew what was happening she could feel it in her own head her children were fighting and mother was coming to set things right youre to die tessanna said i dont know why but youre to die its the only reason i was allowed my child dreams nothing more mira said lie to yourself if you must tessanna locked her fingers together pointed her hands at mira and let the full extent of her power unleash in a focused beam of red lightning mira thought to batter it aside with a shield as all other attacks but she underestimated the power sent against her her shield shattered like glass and then she screamed as pain immeasurable swarmed her being her wings dissolved fading away as if they were but a dream magic abandoned her as the electricity swirled around her body she plummeted to the ground smacking against the unforgiving stone tessanna giggled as she heard the delicious sound of bones breaking stay away from her she ordered when she saw the war demons leaving their defensive formation she is my kill and mine alone triumphant she lowered herself to the floor her black wings pulling back into her body she smiled at the blood everywhere mira lay on her stomach facing away from tessanna directly before her was the portal spinning steadily she looked like a sacrifice to the mural an offering in payment for the demon soldiers that had marched forthwith but that wasnt what caused tessannas smile nor was it the blood on the floor it was the fact that miras shoulders and chest still heaved from her breathing i expected more tessanna said as she drew her dagger so easily beaten mountains should have crumbled from our conflict and entire cities leveled mira opened her eyes and stared at the portal as she heard the voice of the goddess speaking ive wanted this for a long time tessanna said she could hear her mothers voice the one that had told her to shatter her mirror finish it the voice cried end her destroy her life the dagger a single strike with the dagger you still dont know what we are mira whispered and you think you will raise a child deep inside her breast she felt her power rising it was the magic of the goddess granted to her when she was just a babe leaving her mothers womb that power had struck her mother dead stripped her of all life so that it might pour into the newborn child a spell repeated over and over in her mind and gently celestia whispered to the small lonely girl you were not meant for this world only to save it from itself forgive me my daughter accept the dagger forgive your other she knows not what she does only that she does it for me mira began whispering the words of the spell the power in her breast strengthened and concentrated tessanna sensed the growing danger all around them wind swirled chaotic and directionless their hair whipped about and the dust of the ground rose to the ceiling the nearby soldiers covered their faces and cowered tessanna knelt smiling her insane smile her heart raced her head throbbed excitement tingled up and down her spine all would happen as it was meant she would plunge the dagger shatter her mirror and then rouse qurrah from unconsciousness so he could hold her maybe even make love to her mira stammered more and more she felt desperate and vicious she was becoming a trap one that would detonate with the force of an angered goddess tears ran down her face continuing even when tessanna pushed her onto her back the dagger hovered in the air if it plunged through her skin miras magic would release in a devastating explosion destroying veldaren and closing the portal balance so precariously trembling over permanent darkness would be preserved tessanna grabbed miras face in her hand and tilted it so they could stare eye to eye her other hand quivered with excitement as it held the dagger now her entire purpose was now for one agonizing moment all her pieces were made whole her mind was one and in singular desire she plunged down the dagger mira closed her eyes knowing what her death would mean what her sacrifice would gain knowing so many lives would be saved but she remembered how lathaars arms had held her as she wept atop karaks bridge and that knowledge meant nothing she would never see him again she screamed one of horrible sorrow and shame the spell dissipated the danger vanishing and she went against her mothers will the dagger plunged into her breast tessanna gasped in pleasure but the kill was not complete she had missed the heart and for a strange moment she realized she had never aimed for it in the first place then why did i she asked before her mind fractured the agony crumpled her to the floor as she held her temples and screamed lathaar mira whispered as she felt warm blood spill across her chest please help me lathaar help me with shaking limbs she slid onto her knees the dagger lodged in her flesh she glared at the war demons who watched in admiration and horror they knew her strength and were both in awe and terror of it she looked away unsure what such armored men with red wings meant all she wanted was one thing with the last of her power she staggered to her feet opened a portal and fell through tessanna crawled along the floor weeping all the while where she crawled she left a long red smear of blood the soldiers parted for her she clutched qurrahs robes and used them to pull herself onto him she beat against his breast as she wept wake up she said please wake up qurrah the drain of the portal was too great her lover remained unconscious as the war demons took up their shields and weapons she laid her head upon his neck and bathed him with her tears i was whole she said i was whole qurrah please wake up i was whole but now mommys mad at me mad at us both she wants our child please qurrah please damn it please wake up she cried herself to sleep still alone still in pieces l athaar lay with his back to the small fire one of many that warmed the sprawling camp his body was exhausted his mind begged for sleep but still he stared into nowhere ever since his childhood in the citadel he had believed he was to be a beacon an example of a decent life in an indecent world he knew he was far from perfect but his failure to meet a standard did not remove the standard he heard the weeping and terror of so many shivering beside fires as they too failed to succumb to sleep he the beacon felt emptied and darkened what hope could he offer them that would not stink of falseness a sudden rush of air stirred him and he turned to see mira collapse through a blue portal she fell still gasping his name mira he asked pushing up to a sitting position where have you he saw the dagger in her chest he swallowed his question she lay on her back staring up at him as she gasped in air he put one hand on the side of her face and the other on the daggers hilt this will hurt more than it already does he told her she said nothing whispering a prayer lathaar pulled out the dagger blood poured across her dress as her scream of pain awoke many nearby without pause the paladin dropped the dagger and pushed both his hands against the wound he closed his eyes a twinge of fear in his heart he was exhausted mentally and physically ashhur had not gifted him with healing talent would he still heed his prayer please he whispered ive nothing left in me by your hand let her be healed for this i beg he felt no warm presence no divine light not even a sense of comfort when he opened his eyes he saw the white light fading from his hands he pulled back and through the hole in her dress he saw the skin knit together into an angry scar mira closed her eyes sleep calling as the pain faded from her breast she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him to her im sorry she said tears swelled in her eyes i love you lathaar and because of that ive done something terrible nothing terrible can come from love he said youre wrong she said remembering the vicious hatred in tessannas eyes and now ive sacrificed us all he stroked her forehead with the tips of his fingers and held her in his arms until sleep stole her away from the world she was no longer meant for and in the quiet he heard a voice but it was not the deep calm of ashhur this one was feminine peaceful and in great pain balance is broken young paladin there must be a victor will you fight for all things good will you protect my daughter with my life he whispered then mind your faith s he could see her breath in the air but she refused the comfort of a fire harruq still slept which didnt surprise her she had seen how exhausted he was as a soft wind blew against her she shivered and pressed her arms against her chest i must say aurelia i was not aware elves were immune to cold silly me the elf rolled her eyes deathmask wrapped in a thick blanket smirked as he approached then again he said most elves would do anything to escape a human death caravan such as ours so obviously you are not a normal elf what do you want she asked her voice as cold as the weather antonil is forming people into groups with the goal of each group sharing a set portion of food youll be needed soon thats fine she said still staring past the hills where the ruins of veldaren lay hidden deathmask turned to go but then stopped you realize we wont have enough food he said we have no choice if we ration we ration we make it farther but not to the quellan forest and we have no tents no blankets just freezing water and conjured bread that will do little but dull their hunger aurelia turned on him anger in her eyes what do you want she asked you want to flee yourself abandon those you could help to save your own skin no but id rather not die in a hopeless cause without he glanced behind her and his bravado faded he pulled up his mask from around his neck and covered his face aurelia spun looking for what it was he saw twenty shapes flew from the west their wings red and their armor crimson what manner of men are those aurelia asked no men of dezrel deathmask said as he poured ash across his face ready he tilted his head and raised his arms dark fire consumed his hands kill them quickly before they know our power he said if one escapes they will track our location with ease ice lined aurelias fingers side by side they waited as the winged war demons flew closer as they neared they drew spears and swords and held them high their red hue shining in the morning light surely they see the campfires ahead deathmask muttered they know our location why do they press the attack they want blood aurelia said so lets give it to them lances of ice flew from her hands at tremendous speeds the demons dropped and spun expertly avoiding most one had his wing shattered at the shoulder while another dropped dead a spear of ice pierced through his throat and out the back of his neck deathmask laughed at the display of power the dark fire of his hands swelled he focused on a single demon watching with pleasure as fire surrounded him and consumed his wings in a single burst of flame the demon plummeted doomed to die by the long fall the remaining demons saw their attackers and spiraled to the ground skimming above the grass in a collision course for the two spellcasters deathmask burned the wings of two more clenching his fist and grinning with each body that rolled and bounced on snapping bones lightning arced from aurelias fingers striking dead one demon before leaping to the next only ten remained by the time they neared them drop down aurelia shouted she fell to her knees and slammed her open palms to the grass a wall of fire tore to the sky and through it the demons flew it only burned and maimed them but it also hid their presence as the last passed through the fire aurelia banished the wall and stood the demons were spread out in two groups each group looping around and coming in for another pass know any more tricks deathmask asked i dont fight flying men too often aurelia said neither do i but i do fight overaggressive ones deathmask clapped his hands together dark magic sparked between them and a loud roar erupted at their contact again he clapped and the roar was louder the black sparks stronger aurelia spun her arms and a swirling column or air enveloped them here they come she said but deathmask needed no warning grinning beneath his mask he clapped his hands the third time as the first of the demons pushed through the wall of wind a shockwave of sound and magic rolled in all directions aurelia felt it strike her body her lungs froze her heartbeat halted for one agonizing second her body was a statue the feeling passed and her lungs and heart resumed their dutiful workings aurelia smiled as she realized the brilliant trap even deathmask had been stunned by the spell but they were on firm ground and could recover immediately the war demons however aurelia gave them no chance to recover as they spun and turned in a vain attempt to avoid the ground she blasted them with lightning and fire deathmask cursed them with pain and weakness sapping their strength and clotting their minds several died from striking the ground only a few remained healthy enough to flee deathmask pointed them out and swore three he said theyre out of reach not yet aurelia said the demons had flown straight into the air hoping to gain enough distance to fly safely back to veldaren aurelia stared into the sky visualizing she had to be perfect she whispered the words to the spell then stepped through the blue portal that tore open before her she fought off the initial wave of disorientation for she did not step onto land but into freezing open air directly above the demons all three had been facing back watching for spells to dodge she killed the first with a lance of ice through the head the remaining two turned to see her fall between them lightning exploding from her hands limp and smoking they fell very much dead aurelias fingers danced the semantic components of a spell her fall slowed as a levitation spell took hold shivering in the wind she floated to the ground smirking at deathmask the whole time show off he said as she gently landed if i wasnt insane i would have joined you in opening the portal and he stopped as if slapped what aurelia asked a portal deathmask said why dont we open a portal to the quellan forest youre insane aurelia said i dont have the strength to move so many and neither do you not a free form one deathmask insisted think older when portal magic was first discovered if we carve the correct runes into the rock and then have enough of us join together we can open a much larger portal it would be healthy and strong and ready to move say thousands of people hundreds of miles away from chasing winged demons how many do we have aurelia asked you tarlak and i would be hardpressed even with the help of the runes veliana can cast spells as can the twins deathmask insisted we can do this tarlak will agree trust me if you say so aurelia said trudging back to the camp where hundreds of hungry people waited for her to create them food a re you insane tarlak asked as he handed off a piece of bread what mushrooms have you been eating itll take more time and patience but we can do it deathmask insisted the three stood before long lines of people each a representative of the groups antonil had separated them into each person was given a loaf of bread and bit of cheese to divide up among his group in the center of the camp veliana had summoned a gentle spring for those needing a drink were talking an entire day maybe two tarlak said two days to carve the runes ensure all of us know the words cast the correct incantations and then move everyone through while hoping no one has a slip of concentration that leaves hundreds of people stranded miles away from safety that sounds about right deathmask said tarlak sighed he twirled his finger a piece of bread appeared in his hand like some cheap parlor trick another twirl and he had some cheese he handed both off to a haggard women with frostbitten fingers alright then the wizard said lets have a talk with antonil a bsolutely not antonil said even i know the risks of portal magic what happens to those who might be left behind even worse what happens if we are attacked in the middle of the ritual i have absolute faith in this idea tarlak said he removed his hat and scratched at the bald spot on his head its not like the portal is made of fire or anything you need to trust us aurelia said you know our resources are limited this is our best hope antonil frowned and crossed his arms he glanced about his camp pondering the options guard captain deathmask said stealing his attention how many did not wake up this morning how many perished of exhaustion of cold of hunger or thirst or sheer hopelessness i know the number as do you over a hundred was the answer under his orders the soldiers had left them where they lay we will not survive this journey deathmask said even in perfect conditions we would be hard pressed but we are in the dead of winter one snowstorm one torrent of icing rain and all will die give us the order antonil sighed aurelia felt a sinking feeling in her gut at the sight of the guard captain when he spoke do it then he said and may ashhur have mercy on us all t he refugees collected around fires huddled and quiet antonil had told them little of their plan only that they needed to rest and stay warm after his simple speech the guard captain retreated south to where a small cluster of trees surrounded a spring that emerged from one hill and vanished into the small cave mouth of another the trees were barren their leaves long since fallen he had left his soldiers under strict orders not to follow when he heard the soft hiss of a portal opening he shook his head and sighed im not one of your soldiers aurelia said guessing his thoughts and even if i were i would still come here he turned and faced her his shoulders sagged and his frown seemed permanently etched above his jaw i dont know you well aurelia but i know enough to believe there is a reason for this intrusion and a goodhearted one at that i dont want to hear it my shame is shut your mouth already aurelia said and at her harsh words he obeyed for a moment she said nothing only glared at last she spoke your men are dying your people are dying they are cold they are hungry and they are terrified i am well aware of that antonil said his right hand shook clutching the hilt of his sword who are you antonil copernus aurelia asked do you know anymore i am a failure to my people to my king and to my kingdom and what do i do now i let them sit here gambling on the whims of wizards and sorcerers to save their lives from demons and the dead what would you tell me that i did the right thing that they need me what would you tell me that i do not already know you are their king she shouted tears swelled in his eyes even as he adamantly shook his head no he said i have no bloodline and no claim to a throne i abandoned open your eyes aurelia said you are no longer a guard captain you are no longer a servant to the king for you cannot be a servant to yourself every life in that camp needs to trust in something or someone to protect them and promise them a better life the day after tomorrow already they speak of you as king in their whispers take up the mantle i am not ready antonil said but the words came out weak no one is ever ready she said she reached out and took his quivering hand with her other she drew his sword flipped the hilt toward him and grinned what is it you humans say she asked the king is dead long live the king it is so will the portal work he asked as he took the sword i havent the slightest idea she said despite his terror king antonil laughed if you are ready she said as he wiped his eyes then i have this for you she removed his golden helm held it to her lips and kissed it the helmet shivered and the gold drained away the precious metal reshaped and from the top seven spikes jutted into a warlords crown it is awesome antonil said as he stared at the gift she offered back to him just an illusion the elf said but in times like these illusions will suffice your strength will give strength to others now wait here for my return aurelia did not want the newly crowned king to come strolling into the camp no he would ride in atop a horse and demand the courage and respect he deserved they had no horses but that wasnt a bother to her a few well placed teleports and she was much farther south staring out across a chill field several wild horses trotted about nibbling from grass that still held a bit of green come to me she said casting a simple charm spell across the largest and most elegant the beautiful beast strode up and snorted while shaking his head his body was deep black with only a thin line of white underneath his neck it will be cold where i take you she told the horse but you will be the mount of a king a fair trade yes another shake of the head another snort aurelia giggled she knew the creature was intelligent but not enough to understand her words only pegasi were smart enough for that but the horse understood her tone and could feel her desires the charm spell made sure of that she put her arm atop his neck and lead the horse through portal after portal holy piss bucket antonil said when aurelia appeared before him with the horse such language for a king she said climb up he will obey your commands just make sure i have a bit of time alone with him every night or hell suddenly decide youre not near as friendly ive been thrown before antonil said ill do what i must to prevent that again k ing antonil rode into the camp he nodded at the soldiers that he passed every one even those that stood slackjawed stood erect and saluted the peasants that saw him cheered his name the weather suddenly not so cold the future not so bleak at last our king wears a crown one shouted all hail antonil shouted another slowly word spread from campfire to campfire at aurelias instructions he circled the perimeter of the camp letting soldier and commoner see his armor his crown and his steed when he finally returned to his tent and dismounted the entire place was stirring with shouts and songs sergan waited for him his axe hefted across his shoulders about the finest damn thing ive seen in years he said his grin spreading from ear to ear and since when could you create crowns from dirt and horses from logs since today antonil said he went to hug the old sergeant but sergan stunned him by falling to one knee and laying his axe across the ground i swear my axe to you king copernus he said will you accept this gift humbly offered i accept it antonil said and i am humbled by its offering sergan stood and the two embraced all around soldiers raised their weapons and cheered the newly honored king winked at aurelia who had remained in the background admiring her work she feigned a curtsey then laughed impressive illusions tarlak said sliding up beside her so what is he really riding a donkey a large dog the horse is real aurelia said if it had been an illusion id have made sure its face resembled yours touching tarlak said now follow me weve got a problem i told you this was crazy veliana said a large rock in her hands and i know i wasnt the only one they were gathered atop a solitary hill strewn about the dead grass were slabs of stone with runes carved atop them some were intricate in detail while others were only halffinished deathmask stood where the portal was to go a chisel in his left hand genius will always have its doubters he said waving the chisel about so will madness tarlak said as he and aurelia arrived at the top of the hill funny how much those two have in common mier and nien laughed the two were busy juggling stones a chisel and a hammer oddly enough with each pass the runes on the stones grew a tiny bit sharper and longer deathmask doesnt trust us nien said deathmask doesnt trust anyone but this time he doubts us mier said what are they talking about aurelia asked the portal tarlak began will still work deathmask interrupted we just need to shorten the distance what do you mean were not enough nien said not strong enough mier said please just one person at a time aurelia said even with all of us helping tarlak said glaring at deathmask as if daring him to interrupt again were looking at hundreds of miles to the edge of the quellan forest multiply that by the thousand or so we must transport and well all crumble under the strain aurelia crossed her arms and stared at the stones the others stilled their movements they had all reached the same conclusion but they wanted to know if the last major spellcaster agreed you want us to make two portals she said glancing back up at them one halfway to the forest and once were all safe one the rest of the way cut the strain in half well still make far better time deathmask said i know youre right but the strain on all of us will she stopped for she sensed something both alien and familiar it was an aura of brooding silence constrained power behind a cracking dam gently limping mira walked up the hill youre building a portal the girl said aye we are my beautiful lady tarlak said he frowned at the sight of her torn dress and multiple bruises lathaar had told him a little about miras trip back to veldaren still he was surprised by just how fast she had healed even the deep stab to her chest was only a vicious red line of scabbed blood should you be up and about hurt as you are he asked to this she said nothing only trudged to the circle of stones where will you take them she asked two hundred miles south deathmask said after that another hundred the quellan forest mira said yes deathmask said that is our goal the girl smiled but it was a dead smile you mustnt make two portals one will suffice i will hold it and i alone the twins halted their juggling tarlak and aurelia glanced about nervously deathmask only laughed what sorceress do you think you are he asked her no what goddess no goddess mira said her black eyes flaring with sudden life but if you must judge me by my blood then know me as celestia she raised her arms and at once the many runes snapped rigid fire burned across them changing and reshaping the runes she arranged them in a circle about the hill out of her mouth words of magic poured quick and sharp clouds circled above pulled in by the power that swept through them lightning struck the hill in the deafening thunder a massive blue portal ripped open miras dress flapped in the wind that swirled into it the other casters stared in awe i will hold the portal she said showing no strain from its size or distance i killed us all it is the least i can do prepare your magic the demons approach demons deathmask asked what is she talking about to this she pointed west tarlak cast a spell to augment his eyes his jaw dropping open when it completed were in trouble he said someone find antonil we need people moving through this portal now aurelia cast a similar spell her heart sinking at what she saw soaring through the air in perfect ranks were hundreds of the winged men she and deathmask had fought earlier many of them carried red banners marked with the yellow fist an entire army she said her voice just above a whisper are they what qurrah has brought into this world fight them mira said unless mother denies me my strength i will hold deathmask tarlak said tipping his hat care to fight side by side to protect our goddess i enjoy my life deathmask said his hand dipping into the bag of ash hanging from his belt and ill enjoy this battle as well antonil ordered his people into a giant line stretching up the hill five wide they rushed the survivors through while the remaining troops of veldaren flanked them on both sides mira stood beside the portal her arms raised to the sky and her eyes closed her hair tossed about while her dress flapped against her legs high above the clouds darkened and grumbled angrily the two paladins stood at her side their orders simple mira was not to be touched the blue portal hissed and shook as five by five the people fled through do not panic and do not stop antonil shouted as he rode his horse down the long line of frantic refugees as long as you hold breath make for the portal he circled the greater mass of people at the bottom of the hill eager to join the line again shouting his command the soldiers flanking drew their swords and saluted and the sign of formality and duty soothed those climbing toward the swirling blue magic beyond the last few families and peasants the eschaton stood in a long line they stared east with baited breaths deathmasks crew intermixed with them magic sparking on their fingertips they were eight in all the first and strongest line of defense against the coming demons use everything youve got to get their attention tarlak said as the sky swarmed with dull red armor and beating wings keep them on us as long as you can with each volley take a few steps back as you wish master wizard deathmask said ash hovering so thick before his face his features were all but gone and no one be a fool when the battle is lost make for the portal dying here means nothing such elegant words harruq muttered i dont exactly feel like dying here either aurelia said but her voice was distracted she was trying to estimate the number of soldiers that approached by her guess each banner that flew represented a unit of fifty and she counted nine banners she winced daggerwork may not be enough mier said we need more than daggers nien said veliana drew her own kissed the blades and stared at the sky with her lone eye their armor is thick but daggers will do just fine she said the twins chuckled at her but said nothing theyre almost here harruq said he could see the giant red wings the crimson armor and the wicked weapons hanging from their belts silhouetted by a blackened sky they seemed a demonic army indeed lets give them a good welcome shall we tarlak said before beginning his spellcasting deathmask and aurelia joined him choosing their largest and flashiest spells a ball of fire shot from tarlaks hands smoke trailing behind it when it struck the first soldier it detonated consuming more than twenty in fire aurelias spell was a great barrage of ice lances forced to evade the demons broke their perfect ranks as ten of their own plummeted to the ground deathmasks was the worst in the center of their ranks a small ball of shadow appeared unseen at his command it exploded filling the sky with thousands of blacktipped arrows most bounced off the armor the demons wore but their wings carried no such protection deathmask laughed as he saw more than fifty drop to their deaths you need to teach me that spell tarlak said with a whistle you would not want to learn deathmask said not while the golden mountain hangs from your neck damn tarlak said thats a shame so instead he prepared a second fireball as a great swarm of metal descended u lamn hovered high in the sky a banner carrier holding flight beside him the general swore as he saw the spells decimate his army he had expected a ragtag band of survivors for him to slaughter but powerful spellcasters even worse he saw the swirling blue portal atop the hill the mass climbed but ulamn had conquered many worlds and fought with spellcasters greater than those arrayed against him send a single unit after the casters he ordered have the rest assault those atop the hill i want that portal closed two demons beside him tucked their wings and dove screaming out their generals orders the army split in two each curling around the initial defense line and hooking back to the hill antonils men raised their shields and shouted their time to fight had come d amn it theyre not taking the bait tarlak shouted as he blasted several demons with lightning as they passed make for the top haern said he turned to harruq and motioned for him to follow but aurelia needs me the halforc protested now haern shouted he leapt more than twenty feet into the air his sabers drawn the few demons foolish enough to fly near screamed as their throats were cut and their wings severed harruq snarled and gave chase running outside the line of antonils men to avoid the throng of refugees eyes ahead veliana said twirling her daggers a unit of fifty dove for the line their ranks spread wide to lessen the damage of magical attacks lightning and ice struck down several but then they closed the gap mier and nien let loose their daggers hurling four at a time into the air the blades shimmered purple with magic those that tried streaking straight at tarlak veered off unable to withstand the barrage veliana crouched before deathmask ready to defend deathmask curled his hand sapping the strength from the first to near the demon struck the dirt ten feet before him his wings unable to keep him afloat get down veliana said as two more arced close and swung their long glaives veliana jumped into the air her legs tucked against her chest as she fell backward her daggers lashed out perfectly timed the long blades cut beneath her her twisted body slipping in between the wooden shafts her left dagger cut straight through ones neck spewing blood her right severed tendons and unable to bear the pain the demon dropped his glaive and ascended mere distractions deathmask said as he stood hurling small bolts of fire to keep away a few circling demons they will kill mira while we play aurelia had no protector so she relied on her own magical strength as the demons came whirling in she tore the dirt from the ground and hurled it high the demons bounced and slammed through the boulders many fell unconscious while others veered away from the dangerous trap make for the portal the elf shouted she hurled the boulders crushing a few remaining demons that circled above them turning about she saw the true battle raging the shouts of dying and panicked rolled down the hill the elf closed her eyes her mind focused on mira at the top she felt her body shiver and when she opened her eyes she stood beside the girl the tempest wind blowing her hair and dress by ashhurs girdle get down elf jerico shouted behind her she obeyed without thought the paladin rushed past her his shield high steel collided as a war demon struck where she had been the demon hollered as holy light leapt up his weapon and into the scarred flesh of his hands jerico pushed aside the sword with his shield raised bonebreaker and struck the demon dropped his skull shattered nice of you to join us lathaar said as he slammed his swords together all about demons winced and averted their eyes in the brief reprieve aurelia looked down the hill studying the fight demons had slammed into the shield walls on either side of the refugees using brute strength and size to push their way through antonils men had held firm however and men of valor fought against the crimson armored demons lining the ground on either side were scattered corpses of demons she saw more than fifty a true tribute to antonils training the king rode along the west side his sword held high hold firm he shouted hold fast hold firm and make for the portal the people of neldar did as commanded and five by five they stepped into the blue and were gone behind us lathaar said jerico turned chuckling at the sight four demons flew close together their swords stretched before them they were planning on ramming the paladins with their speed and weight to knock them aside youd think theyd have learned by now jerico said he stood before mira his shield high singing a song to ashhur jerico braced his legs a glowing image of his shield leapt into the air ten times the original size the demons collided with the image as if they hit stone bones broken they collapsed lathaar circled mira his swords whirling in a blinding blur of a white both were elholads and in the paladins hands they weighed nothing and cut everything broken weapons littered the ground along with severed limbs and pieces of armor still the swarm increased a wave of twenty banked from the sky straight for mira lathaar stood before them his weapons crossed jerico knelt behind mira catching his breath he knew the demons lathaar did not kill would try to circle back around aurelia tossed lances of ice softening the wave for lathaar hold me fast ashhur he prayed and your will be done he stood firm a tribute to heroic paladins of old his twin elholads slashed and cut the demons armor meant nothing to him their weapons were nothing as well spears and swords clacked off his armor but they would not pierce flesh one after another he cut them down severing them into pieces the bodies of his foes crashed off his body even their momentum nothing to him ashhurs will was done aurelia stared with mouth agape for not a single demon had survived jerico stretched as high above a demon hurled his spear easy enough he said his eyes opened wide as the spear punched through his platemail into his back and out through his underarm aurelia shouted his name as he fell to his knees only his shield propping his body to a sitting easy he gasped the pain incredible easy his head slumped and his eyes closed jerico lathaar shouted turning toward his friend hold your post aurelia shouted furious he turned to her but she did not back down instead she pointed to the line of fleeing peoples still over three hundred in number hold your post or all of them will die she said the fury in his eyes shifted to understanding he nodded ashhur be with us all he said turning back to the demons that circled the sky the only other of his kind lay dying and he could only turn his back and guard his charge the light on his blades lessened and he felt their weight once more h aern led the way down the line a blur of gray in the dim light many of the war demons had landed preferring solid ground over tumultuous wind despite their valor antonils men were falling exhausted and outmatched in skill the demons that punched through slaughtered men and women soaking themselves in the blood of innocents haern leapt into the air landing on the back of one demon with an elderly woman hanging limp from his spear his sabers sliced the arteries in the demons neck as the demon fell he leapt again ten feet up the hill atop a second he landed with all his weight on the demons neck snapping bone harruq followed in a less precise manner he barreled through combat not fearing the swords of either man or demon condemnation and salvation tore through crimson armor spilling an even darker shade across the red mail when he saw two demons assaulting a soldier cowering behind his shield he roared and slammed his shoulder into the nearest as the demon flew he planted his foot and swung severing the second at the waist harruq gave the soldier no time to thank him before he was off chasing haern up the hill wait up damn it he shouted im not a leaping frog like you are he caught movement from the corner of his eye instinctively he braced his shoulders turning to one side as a spear skewered where he had been the attacking demon slammed straight into him and in a mass of muscle and armor they rolled crushing a hapless man in their way harruq growled as the demon scowled behind his helmet thulos will burn your world to ash for this cowardice the demon said he tried to strike with his spear but harruq pinned his arm with his knee youre the one attacking unarmed men and women harruq said the demons body pinned condemnation underneath him but salvation was free the problem was the demon gripped harruqs wrist and held back the killing thrust slowly the tip quivered in the air youre strong and you speak the gods tongue the demon said veins pulsed underneath the scars across his face pull back your blade and join us we have positions of honor for your kind harruq laughed but amid his struggling it sounded more like a cough ill tell you what i told qurrah notgonnahappen down went the tip through flesh past bone and into dirt the demons arms went limp harruq pulled himself free yanking out his swords in the process getting so tired of people trying to recruit me he said and in the middle of battle for gods sake he turned to the portal and ran k ing antonil ducked his head as a spear thudded into a shield held by one of his men his heart was heavy for he could see just how many of his soldiers lay dead even worse the men women and children he had sworn to protect blood soaked the hill the bodies of the slain a barrier needing climbed his horse charged across the grass as he swung his sword at any nearby enemy in spite of his exhaustion his guilt and his sorrow he shouted for all to hear keep climbing keep running to the portal to safety do not stop do not stop a war demon slammed to the ground before him and swung his glaive antonil jerked the reigns and without hesitation his horse jumped a sharp neigh filled the air as the glaive tore flesh but nothing stopped the enormous weight from crashing atop the demon as his body crumpled beneath the hooves he heard the labored breathing of his horse turn into a dying whinny im sorry he said as he dismounted the horses front legs collapsed a giant pool of blood covering the ground below the king looked about the darkened hill the clouds had turned even thicker so that it seemed night had fallen there were no torches no starlight just the brilliant blue glow of the portal he trudged toward it but three demons landed before him with their swords and axes drawn they saw his crown and knew they found a chance for glory antonil saluted determined to kill at least one before he died he was never given the chance a bolt of lightning shot past the king hitting the first demon in the eye before leaping into the chest of the second and the throat of the third all three fell wisps of smoke rising from their bodies hope i wasnt intruding tarlak said as he grabbed antonils wrist and pulled him on now lets leave before their friends show up king antonil followed the yellow robes as if they were light in a giant fog all around he saw chaos men missing limbs and women bleeding from giant gashes across their arms and chests some were armed most werent climbing adjacent the trail of bodies he saw the four members of the ash guild a deadly combination of daggers and death magic striking down any demon who dared near they offered no aid to the wounded or those in combat only pressing onward toward the portal toward escape how many have made it through antonil asked as they neared the top of the hill cant say for sure tarlak said his eyes constantly darting about in search of threats at least half more than half actually maybe a lot more hundreds at least watch your head he hurled another bolt of lightning a joyless smile on his face as he pegged a demon out of the air with the vast bulk of the veldaren people escaped the rest of the demons had taken to circling above preparing one last assault on mira and the portal how does she still stand antonil asked shaking his head near a hundred corpses surrounded her the vast bulk wearing the crimson armor of thulos lathaar stood at her side his weapons tipped to the dirt his eyes scanning the sky when the ash guild arrived he saluted them they did not salute back instead they dived through the portal their part of the battle finished the king shook his head disappointed but understanding it was not cowardice that caused them to leave just selfpreservation antonil heard a primal roar from the halforc he glanced back in awe of the sight harruq was soaked in blood cuts covered his arms and hands yet he grinned with a maniacal glee the demons seemed to have labeled him as a special prey for while all around him men women and even soldiers hurried to the portal unabated wave after wave dove for harruq the halforc took them in stride slamming them away with his powerful swords as antonil watched harruq sidestepped a thrust beheaded the attacking demon took two steps back and then buried both his swords into another demons chest even as he flung the body away another took its place striking downward with a gigantic axe swords together he blocked the blow grinning even as the muscles in his arms twitched he muttered something but antonil couldnt hear it then the axe shook its haft shattered and harruq struck down the demon we have little time tarlak said pointing upward the demons were forming ranks it would not be long before more waves descended they looked to the king go through tarlak said the people will need you i will not abandon those still here antonil said i will defend to the death if i must i thought youd say that tarlak said he snapped his fingers a sudden gust of wind roared to life an invisible force pushed up on his feet stealing any chance he had to resist cursing the wizards name antonil flew through the portal and vanished dont get me wrong tarlak said as lathaar shook his head at him honor and pride has its place but im pretty sure intelligence and reason deserve a bit of respect as well jerico lathaar said gesturing to his wounded brethren hes wounded please get him through the portal forget me jerico said his voice hoarse im not going anywhere like the abyss you arent tarlak said high above thunder rumbled and at its sound mira shivered the goddess is strained she said please hurry just a hundred more lathaar said as people rushed into the portal we can hold another crack of thunder and as its force rumbled through the land the demons dove for mira and her protectors they were tightly packed as if they would bury them in metal regardless if they died or not for war they shouted a communal roar that shook the hearts of all remaining for ashhur lathaar cried rising his swords to the sky and may karak have them tarlak said fire leaping from his fingers aurelia joined him their barrages of ice and fire swirling together demons crumpled and shattered under the power harruq and lathaar stood at either side of mira and as the bodies came racing in they cut and blocked slamming away any who would dare strike her lathaars swords blinded and repulsed the demons harruqs cut their flesh and broke their wings haern circled about eyeing the battle for any opening if harruq faltered haern was there killing the attacker if aurelias lance of rock or ice missed its target he was there his sabers a blur of death lightning filled the sky some magical some not fire joined it and smoke blurred the clouds on and on the veldaren people entered the portal the demons could find no opening no weakness but still they came antonils soldiers joined the ranks of the fleeing unable to fight any longer the demons attacks focused more desperate and brutal at last an elderly couple passed through the portal and only the eschaton remained guarding mira the ground shook and the ethereal wind surrounding mira vanished its time to go tarlak said everyone get your ass in the portal someone take jerico lathaar shouted as he parried away the attacks of three demons the light on his swords flared and as the blinded demons pulled back he cut them down the runes atop the hill cracked and exploded showering them with chalk the portal shrunk to half its size now or never tarlak said he tipped his hat to the others hurled one last fireball and jumped through harruq help him aurelia shouted she lifted wall after wall of ice from the ground trying to buy themselves time harruq ran to jerico ducking blow after blow from demons that swooped above the walls of ice he was almost there when he heard a horrible cry he turned to see aurelia on her knees her hands pressed against her neck her delicate fingers were soaked in blood a redtipped spear lay beside her harruq looked back and when his eyes met with jericos he saw understanding without anger or pity go jerico said harruq ran to his wife took her in his arms and disappeared through the portal more spears fell down exploding whenever they neared contact with miras skin lathaar fought with a frantic new urgency the demons flocked to the holy light of his blades like moths to a torch mira walked to the portal and stood there shaking her head as the waves of death and suffering assaulted her mind does the tragedy destroy the valiant sacrifice she asked the battlefield get up lathaar shouted to jerico he stood beside mira fending off demons one after another we cannot save him haern said joining his side his sabers danced demon after demon died but at last he would wait no more he yanked his blades free from a shredded throat twirled his cloak and leapt through the portal leave jerico shouted his face locked in pain lathaar stabbed his longsword through the eye of a demon twisted it and then kicked away the corpse i will not abandon you jerico knew this true and that was why he hurled bonebreaker through the air the mace struck lathaar in the chest and even through the platemail he could feel his bones trembling he staggered back his balance lost mira saw jericos intent and aided him she pushed lathaar through the ground shaking the sky furious and with demons all about jerico laid back to the dirt thank you he said to mira who stared at him with an expression he did not understand die well she told him and im sorry she stepped through the portal and at her passing the blue vanished lightning struck where it had been and at that final release of power the clouds lost their anger the wind died light pierced through as jerico lay on his back he stared at the newly freed sun and prayed that ashhur would grant his soul passage to the golden eternity epilogue qurrah stirred as the sun crept above the dull horizon he felt a weight on his chest and an ache in his temples tessanna huddled in his arms in her hands she held a knife she smiled at him as blood ran down her face from five vertical cuts pieces she said as she slashed off her ear without a single grimace of pain mommy left me in pieces
