jeffrey archer the sins of the father the second book in the clifton chronicles series sir tommy macpherson cbe mc td dl chevalier de la légion dhonneur croix de guerre with palms and a star medaglia dargento and resistance medal italy kt of st mary of bethlehem for i the lord thy god am a jealous god and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation book of common prayer harry clifton my name is harry clifton sure and im babe ruth said detective kolowski as he lit a cigarette no said harry you dont understand theres been a terrible mistake im harry clifton an englishman from bristol i served on the same ship as tom bradshaw save it for your lawyer said the detective exhaling deeply and filling the small cell with a cloud of smoke i dont have a lawyer protested harry if i was in the trouble youre in kid id consider having sefton jelks on my side to be about my only hope whos sefton jelks you may not have heard of the sharpest lawyer in new york said the detective as he blew out another plume of smoke but he has an appointment to see you at nine oclock tomorrow morning and jelks dont leave his office unless his bill has been paid in advance but began harry as kolowski banged the palm of his hand on the cell door so when jelks turns up tomorrow morning kolowski continued ignoring harrys interruption youd better come up with a more convincing story than weve arrested the wrong man you told the immigration officer that you were tom bradshaw and if it was good enough for him its going to be good enough for the judge the cell door swung open but not before the detective had exhaled another plume of smoke that made harry cough kolowski stepped out into the corridor without another word and slammed the door behind him harry collapsed on to a bunk that was attached to the wall and rested his head on a brickhard pillow he looked up at the ceiling and began to think about how hed ended up in a police cell on the other side of the world on a murder charge the door opened long before the morning light could creep through the bars of the window and into the cell despite the early hour harry was wide awake a warder strolled in carrying a tray of food that the salvation army wouldnt have considered offering a penniless hobo once hed placed the tray on the little wooden table he left without a word harry took one look at the food before beginning to pace up and down with each step he grew more confident that once he explained to mr jelks the reason hed exchanged his name with tom bradshaw the matter would quickly be sorted out surely the worst punishment they could exact would be to deport him and as hed always intended to return to england and join the navy it all fitted in with his original plan at am harry was sitting on the end of the bunk impatient for mr jelks to appear the massive iron door didnt swing open until twelve minutes past nine harry leapt up as a prison guard stood to one side and allowed a tall elegant man with silver grey hair to enter harry thought he must have been about the same age as grandpa mr jelks wore a dark blue pinstripe doublebreasted suit a white shirt and a striped tie the weary look on his face suggested that little would surprise him good morning he said giving harry a faint smile my name is sefton jelks i am the senior partner of jelks myers and abernathy and my clients mr and mrs bradshaw have asked me to represent you in your upcoming trial harry offered jelks the only chair in his cell as if he was an old friend who had dropped in to his study at oxford for a cup of tea he perched on the bunk and watched the lawyer as he opened his briefcase extracted a yellow pad and placed it on the table jelks took a pen from an inside pocket and said perhaps you might begin by telling me who you are as we both know youre not lieutenant bradshaw if the lawyer was surprised by harrys story he showed no sign of it head bowed he wrote copious notes on his yellow pad while harry explained how hed ended up spending the night in jail once hed finished harry assumed his problems must surely be over as he had such a senior lawyer on his side that was until he heard jelkss first question you say that you wrote a letter to your mother while you were on board the kansas star explaining why you had assumed tom bradshaws identity thats correct sir i didnt want my mother to suffer unnecessarily but at the same time i needed her to understand why id made such a drastic decision yes i can understand why you might have considered that changing your identity would solve all your immediate problems while not appreciating that it could involve you in a series of even more complicated ones said jelks his next question surprised harry even more do you recall the contents of that letter of course i wrote and rewrote it so many times i could reproduce it almost verbatim then allow me to test your memory jelks said and without another word tore off a sheet from his yellow pad and handed it and his fountain pen to harry harry spent some time recalling the exact words before he set about rewriting the letter my dearest mother i have done everything in my power to make sure you receive this letter before anyone can tell you that i died at sea as the date on this letter shows i did not perish when the devonian was sunk on september th in fact i was plucked out of the sea by a sailor from an american ship and thanks to him im still very much alive however an unexpected opportunity arose for me to assume another mans identity and i did so willingly in the hope it would release emma from the many problems i seem to have unwittingly caused her and her family over the years it is important that you realize my love for emma has in no way diminished far from it i cannot believe i shall ever experience such love again but i do not feel i have the right to expect her to spend the rest of her life clinging on to the vain hope that at some time in the future i might be able to prove that hugo barrington is not my father and that i am in fact the son of arthur clifton at least this way she can consider a future with someone else i envy that man i plan to return to england on the first available ship so should you receive any communication from a tom bradshaw you can assume its me ill be in touch with you the moment i set foot in bristol but in the meantime i must beg you to keep my secret as steadfastly as you kept your own for so many years your loving son harry when jelks had finished reading the letter he once again took harry by surprise did you post the letter yourself mr clifton he asked or did you give that responsibility to someone else for the first time harry felt suspicious and decided not to mention that hed asked dr wallace to deliver the letter to his mother when he returned to bristol in a fortnights time he feared that jelks might persuade dr wallace to hand over the letter and then his mother would have no way of knowing he was still alive i posted the letter when i came ashore he said the elderly lawyer took his time before he responded do you have any proof that you are harry clifton and not thomas bradshaw no sir i do not said harry without hesitation painfully aware that no one on board the kansas star had any reason to believe he wasnt tom bradshaw and the only people who could verify his story were on the other side of the ocean more than three thousand miles away and it would not be long before they were all informed that harry clifton had been buried at sea then i may be able to assist you mr clifton thats assuming you still wish miss emma barrington to believe you are dead if you do said jelks an insincere smile on his face i may be able to offer a solution to your problem a solution said harry looking hopeful for the first time but only if you felt able to retain the persona of thomas bradshaw harry remained silent the district attorneys office has accepted that the charge against bradshaw is at best circumstantial and the only real evidence they are clinging on to is that he left the country the day after the murder had been committed aware of the weakness of their case they have agreed to drop the charge of murder if you felt able to plead guilty to the lesser charge of desertion while serving in the armed forces but why would i agree to that asked harry i can think of three good reasons replied jelks firstly if you dont youre likely to end up spending six years in prison for entering the united states on false pretences secondly you would retain your anonymity so the barrington family would have no reason to believe you are still alive and thirdly the bradshaws are willing to pay you ten thousand dollars if you take their sons place harry realized immediately that this would be an opportunity to repay his mother for all the sacrifices shed made for him over the years such a large sum of money would transform her life making it possible for her to escape the twouptwodown in still house lane along with the weekly knock on the door from the rent collector she might even consider giving up her job as a waitress at the grand hotel and start living an easier life although harry thought that was unlikely but before he agreed to fall in with jelkss plans he had some questions of his own why would the bradshaws be willing to go through with such a deception when they must now know that their son was killed at sea mrs bradshaw is desperate to have thomass name cleared she will never accept that one of her sons might have killed the other so is that what tom is accused of murdering his brother yes but as i said the evidence is flimsy and circumstantial and certainly wouldnt stand up in court which is why the das office is willing to drop the charge but only if we agree to plead guilty to the lesser charge of desertion and how long might my sentence be if i agreed to that the da has agreed to recommend to the judge that youre sentenced to one year so with good behaviour you could be free in six months quite an improvement on the six years you can expect if you go on insisting that youre harry clifton but the moment i walk into the courtroom someones bound to realize that im not bradshaw unlikely said jelks the bradshaws hail from seattle on the west coast and although theyre well off they rarely visit new york thomas joined the navy when he was seventeen and as you know to your cost he hasnt set foot in america for the past four years and if you plead guilty youll only be in the courtroom for twenty minutes but when i open my mouth wont everyone know im not an american thats why you wont be opening your mouth mr clifton the urbane lawyer seemed to have an answer for everything harry tried another ploy in england murder trials are always packed with journalists and the public queue up outside the courtroom from the early hours in the hope of getting a glimpse of the defendant mr clifton there are fourteen murder trials currently taking place in new york including the notorious scissors stabber i doubt if even a cub reporter will be assigned to this case i need some time to think about it jelks glanced at his watch were due in front of judge atkins at noon so you have just over an hour to make up your mind mr clifton he called for a guard to open the cell door should you decide not to avail yourself of my services i wish you luck because we will not be meeting again he added before he left the cell harry sat on the end of the bunk considering sefton jelkss offer although he didnt doubt that the silverhaired counsel had his own agenda six months sounded a lot more palatable than six years and who else could he turn to other than this seasoned lawyer harry wished he could drop into sir walter barringtons office for a few moments and seek his advice an hour later harry dressed in a dark blue suit cream shirt starched collar and a striped tie was handcuffed marched from his cell to a prison vehicle and driven to the courthouse under armed guard no one must believe youre capable of murder jelks had pronounced after a tailor had visited harrys cell with half a dozen suits shirts and a selection of ties for him to consider im not harry reminded him harry was reunited with jelks in the corridor the lawyer gave him that same smile before pushing his way through the swing doors and walking down the centre aisle not stopping until he reached the two vacant seats at counsels table once harry had settled into his place and his handcuffs had been removed he looked around the almost empty courtroom jelks had been right about that few members of the public and certainly no press seemed interested in the case for them it must have been just another domestic murder where the defendant was likely to be acquitted no cain and abel headlines while there was no possibility of the electric chair in court number four as the first chime rang out to announce midday a door opened on the far side of the room and judge atkins appeared he walked slowly across the court climbed the steps and took his place behind a desk on the raised dais he then nodded in the direction of the da as if he knew exactly what he was about to say a young lawyer rose from behind the prosecutors desk and explained that the state would be dropping the murder charge but would be pursuing thomas bradshaw on a charge of desertion from the us navy the judge nodded and turned his attention to mr jelks who rose on cue and on the second charge of desertion how does your client plead guilty said jelks i hope your honour will be lenient with my client on this occasion as i dont need to remind you sir that this is his first offence and before this uncharacteristic lapse he had an unblemished record judge atkins scowled mr jelks he said some may consider that for an officer to desert his post while serving his country is a crime every bit as heinous as murder im sure i dont have to remind you that until recently such an offence would have resulted in your client facing a firing squad harry felt sick as he looked up at jelks who didnt take his eyes off the judge with that in mind continued atkins i sentence lieutenant thomas bradshaw to six years in jail he banged his gavel and said next case before harry had a chance to protest you told me began harry but jelks had already turned his back on his former client and was walking away harry was about to chase after him when the two guards grabbed him by the arms thrust them behind his back and quickly handcuffed the convicted criminal before marching him across the courtroom towards a door harry hadnt noticed before he looked back to see sefton jelks shaking hands with a middleaged man who was clearly congratulating him on a job well done where had harry seen that face before and then he realized it had to be tom bradshaws father harry was marched unceremoniously down a long dimly lit corridor and out of an unmarked door into a barren courtyard in the middle of the yard stood a yellow bus that displayed neither number nor any hint of its destination a musclebound conductor clutching a rifle stood by the door and nodded to indicate that harry should climb on board his guards gave him a helping hand just in case he was having second thoughts harry took a seat and stared sullenly out of the window as a trickle of convicted prisoners were led up to the bus some with their heads bowed while others who had clearly trodden this path before adopted a jaunty swagger he assumed it wouldnt be long before the bus set off for its destination wherever that might be but he was about to learn his first painful lesson as a prisoner once youve been convicted no one is in any hurry harry thought about asking one of the guards where they were going but neither of them looked like helpful tour guides he turned anxiously when a body slumped into the seat next to him he didnt want to stare at his new companion but as the man introduced himself immediately harry took a closer look at him my names pat quinn he announced with a slight irish accent tom bradshaw said harry who would have shaken hands with his new companion if they hadnt both been handcuffed quinn didnt look like a criminal his feet barely touched the ground so he couldnt have been an inch over five feet and whereas most of the other prisoners on the bus were either musclebound or simply overweight quinn looked as if a gust of wind would blow him away his thinning red hair was beginning to grey although he couldnt have been a day over forty youre a firsttimer said quinn confidently is it that obvious asked harry its written all over your face whats written all over my face you havent got a clue whats going to happen next so youre obviously not a firsttimer this is the eleventh time ive been on this bus or it could be the twelfth harry laughed for the first time in days what are you in for quinn asked him desertion harry replied without elaboration never heard of that one before said quinn ive deserted three wives but they never put me in the slammer for it i didnt desert a wife said harry thinking about emma i deserted the royal navy i mean the navy how long did you get for that six years quinn whistled through his two remaining teeth sounds a bit rough who was the judge atkins said harry with feeling arnie atkins you got the wrong judge if youre ever on trial again make sure you pick the right judge i didnt know you could pick your judge you cant said quinn but there are ways of avoiding the worst ones harry looked more closely at his companion but didnt interrupt there are seven judges who work the circuit and you need to avoid two of them at all costs one is arnie atkins hes short on humour and long on sentencing but how could i have avoided him asked harry atkins has presided over court four for the past eleven years so if im heading in that direction i have an epileptic fit and the guards take me off to see the court doctor youre an epileptic no said quinn youre not paying attention he sounded exasperated and harry fell silent by the time ive staged a recovery they will have allocated my case to another court harry laughed for the second time and you get away with it no not always but if i end up with a couple of rookie guards im in with a chance though its getting more difficult to pull the same stunt again and again i didnt need to bother this time because i was taken straight to court two which is judge regans territory hes irish like me just in case you hadnt noticed so hes more likely to give a fellow countryman a minimum sentence what was your offence asked harry im a pickpocket quinn announced as if he were an architect or a doctor i specialize in race meetings in the summer and boxing halls in the winter its always easier if the marks are standing up he explained but my lucks been running short recently because too many stewards recognize me so ive had to work the subway and the bus depots where the pickings are slim and youre more likely to be caught harry had so much he wanted to ask his new tutor and like an enthusiastic student he concentrated on the questions that would help him pass the entrance exam rather pleased that quinn hadnt questioned his accent do you know where were going he asked lavenham or pierpoint said quinn all depends on whether we come off the highway at exit twelve or fourteen have you been to either of them before both several times said quinn matteroffactly and before you ask if there was a tourist guide to prisons lavenham would get one star and pierpoint would be closed down why dont we just ask the guard which one were going to said harry who wanted to be put out of his misery because hed tell us the wrong one just to piss us off if its lavenham the only thing you need to worry about is which block they put you on as youre a firsttimer youll probably end up on a block where life is a lot easier the oldtimers like me are usually sent to d block where theres no one under thirty and no one with a record for violence so its the ideal setup if you just want to keep your head down and do your time try to avoid b and c block theyre both full of hopheads and psychos what do i have to do to make sure i end up on a block tell the reception officer youre a devout christian dont smoke and dont drink i didnt know you were allowed to drink in prison said harry you arent you stupid fucker said quinn but if you can supply the greenbacks he added rubbing a thumb against the tip of his index finger the guards suddenly become barmen even prohibition didnt slow them down whats the most important thing for me to watch out for on my first day make sure you get the right job whats the choice cleaning kitchen hospital laundry library gardening and the chapel what do i have to do to get in the library tell em you can read what do you tell them asked harry that i trained as a chef that must have been interesting you still havent caught on have you said quinn i never trained as a chef but it means im always put in the kitchen which is the best job in any prison whys that youre let out of your cell before breakfast and you dont go back to it until after dinner its warm and you have the best choice of food ah were going to lavenham said quinn as the bus turned off the highway at exit thats good cause now i wont have to answer any dumb questions about pierpoint anything else i ought to know about lavenham asked harry unperturbed by quinns sarcasm as he suspected that the oldtimer was enjoying delivering a master class to such a willing pupil too much to tell you he sighed just remember to stick close by me once weve been registered but wont they automatically send you to d block not if mr masons on duty quinn said without explanation harry managed several more questions before the bus finally drew up outside the prison in fact he felt hed learnt more from quinn in a couple of hours than hed managed in a dozen tutorials at oxford stick with me repeated quinn as the massive gates swung open the bus moved slowly forward and on to a desolate piece of scrubland that had never seen a gardener it stopped in front of a vast brick building that displayed rows of small filthy windows some with eyes staring out of them harry watched as a dozen guards formed a corridor that led all the way to the entrance of the prison two armed with rifles had planted themselves on either side of the bus door leave the bus in twos one of them announced gruffly with a fiveminute interval between each pair no one moves an inch unless i say so harry and quinn remained on the bus for another hour when they were finally ushered off harry looked up at the high walls topped with barbed wire that surrounded the entire prison and thought even the world record holder for the pole vault wouldnt have been able to escape from lavenham harry followed quinn into the building where they came to a halt in front of an officer who was seated behind a table and wearing a wellworn shiny blue uniform with buttons that didnt shine he looked as if hed already served a life sentence as he studied the list of names on his clipboard he smiled when he saw the next prisoner welcome back quinn he said you wont find much has changed since you were last here quinn grinned its good to see you too mr mason perhaps youd be kind enough to ask one of the bell hops to take my luggage up to my usual room dont push your luck quinn said mason otherwise i might be tempted to tell the new doc youre not an epileptic but mr mason ive got a medical certificate to prove it from the same source as your chefs certificate no doubt said mason turning his attention to harry and who are you this is my buddy tom bradshaw he doesnt smoke drink swear or spit said quinn before harry had a chance to speak welcome to lavenham bradshaw said mason captain bradshaw actually said quinn it used to be lieutenant said harry i was never a captain quinn looked disappointed with his protégé a firsttimer asked mason taking a closer look at harry yes sir ill put you on a block after youve showered and collected your prison clothes from the store mr hessler will take you to cell number threetwoseven mason checked his clipboard before turning to a young officer who was standing behind him a truncheon swinging from his right hand any hope of joining my friend asked quinn once harry had signed the register after all lieutenant bradshaw might need a batman youre the last person he needs said mason harry was about to speak as the pickpocket bent down removed a folded dollar bill from inside his sock and slipped it into masons top pocket in the blink of an eye quinn will also be in cell threetwoseven said mason to the junior officer if hessler had witnessed the exchange he didnt comment you two follow me was all he said quinn chased after harry before mason could change his mind the two new prisoners were marched down a long green brick corridor until hessler stopped outside a small shower room that had two narrow wooden benches fixed to the wall littered with discarded towels strip said hessler and take a shower harry slowly removed the tailored suit smart cream shirt stiff collar and striped tie that mr jelks had been so keen for him to wear in court to impress the judge the trouble was hed picked the wrong judge quinn was already under the shower before harry had unlaced his shoes he turned on the tap and a trickle of water reluctantly dripped down on to his balding head he then picked up a sliver of soap from the floor and began to wash harry stepped under the cold water of the only other shower and a moment later quinn passed him what was left of the soap remind me to speak to the management about the facilities said quinn as he picked up a damp towel not much bigger than a dishcloth and attempted to dry himself hesslers lips remained pursed get dressed and follow me he said before harry had finished soaping himself once again hessler marched off down the corridor at a brisk pace with a halfdressed still wet harry chasing after him they didnt stop until they came to a double door marked stores hessler rapped firmly and a moment later it was pulled open to reveal a worldweary officer elbows on the counter smoking a rolled cigarette the officer smiled when he saw quinn im not sure weve got your last lot back from the laundry yet quinn he said then ill need a new set of everything mr newbold said quinn who bent down and removed something from inside his other sock and once again it disappeared without trace my requirements are simple he added one blanket two cotton sheets one pillow one pillowcase the officer selected each item from the shelves behind him before placing them in a neat pile on the counter two shirts three pairs of socks six pairs of pants two towels one bowl one plate one knife fork and spoon one razor one toothbrush and one tube of toothpaste i prefer colgate newbold made no comment as quinns pile grew larger and larger will there be anything else he eventually asked as if quinn were a valued customer who was likely to return yes my friend lieutenant bradshaw will require the same order and as he is an officer and a gentleman be sure that he gets only the best to harrys surprise newbold began to build another pile seeming to take his time selecting each item and all because of the prisoner whod sat next to him on the bus follow me said hessler when newbold had completed his task harry and pat grabbed their piles of clothes and charged off down the corridor there were several stops on the way as a duty officer had to unlock and lock barred gates as they came nearer to the cells when they eventually stepped on to the wing they were greeted by the noise of a thousand prisoners quinn said i see were on the top floor mr hessler but i wont be taking the elevator as i need the exercise the officer ignored him and continued past the shouting prisoners i thought you said this was the quiet wing said harry its clear mr hessler is not one of the more popular officers whispered quinn just before the three of them reached cell hessler unlocked the heavy iron door and pulled it open to allow the new con and the old con to enter the home harry had a lease on for the next six years harry heard the door slam behind him he looked around the cell and noticed there was no handle on the inside of the door two bunks one on top of the other a steel wash basin attached to the wall a wooden table also attached to the wall and a wooden chair his eyes finally settled on a steel bowl under the lower bunk he thought he was going to be sick you get the top bunk said quinn interrupting his thoughts on account of you being a firsttimer if i get out before you youll move down to the bottom one and your new cellmate will get the top prison etiquette he explained harry stood on the bottom bunk and slowly made up his bed then climbed up lay down and placed his head on the thin hard pillow painfully aware that it might be some time before he managed a nights sleep can i ask you one more question he said to quinn yes but dont speak again until lights on tomorrow morning harry recalled fisher saying almost the same words on his first night at st bedes its obvious youve been able to smuggle in a considerable amount of cash so why didnt the guards confiscate it as soon as you got off the bus because if they did said quinn no con would ever bring in any money again and the whole system would break down harry lay on the top bunk and stared at the onecoated white ceiling that he could touch by reaching up with his fingers the mattress was lumpy and the pillow so hard that he could only manage to sleep for a few minutes at a time his thoughts turned to sefton jelks and how easily he had been duped by the old advocate get my son off the murder charge thats all i care about he could hear tom bradshaws father telling jelks harry tried not to think about the next six years which mr bradshaw didnt care about had it been worth he dismissed his lawyer and thought about emma he missed her so much and wanted to write and tell her he was still alive but he knew he couldnt he wondered what she would be doing on an autumn day in oxford how was her work progressing as she began her freshman year was she being courted by another man and what of her brother giles his closest friend now that britain was at war had giles left oxford and signed up to fight the germans if he had harry prayed that he was still alive he thumped the side of the bunk with a clenched fist angry that he was not being allowed to play his part quinn didnt speak assuming that harry was suffering firstnightitis and what of hugo barrington had anyone seen him since he disappeared on the day harry should have married his daughter would he find a way of creeping back into favour when everyone believed harry was dead he dismissed barrington from his mind still unwilling to accept the possibility that the man might be his father when his thoughts turned to his mother harry smiled hoping that she would make good use of the jelks had promised to send her once hed agreed to take the place of tom bradshaw with over in the bank harry hoped she would give up her job as a waitress at the grand hotel and buy that little house in the country shed always talked about that was the only good thing that would come out of this whole charade and what of sir walter barrington who had always treated him like a grandchild if hugo was harrys father then sir walter was his grandfather if that turned out to be the case harry would be in line to inherit the barrington estate and the family title and would in time become sir harry barrington but not only did harry want his friend giles hugo barringtons legitimate son to inherit the title even more important he was desperate to prove that his real father was arthur clifton that would still give him an outside chance of being able to marry his beloved emma harry tried to forget where hed be spending the next six years at seven oclock a siren sounded to wake those prisoners who had served long enough to enjoy a nights sleep youre not in prison when youre asleep were the last words quinn had muttered before falling into a deep slumber then snoring it didnt bother harry as a snorer his uncle stan was in a different class harry had made up his mind about several things during his long sleepless night to help pass the numbing cruelty of wasted time tom would be a model prisoner in the hope that his sentence would be reduced for good behaviour he would get a job in the library and write a diary about what had happened before he was sentenced and everything that took place while he was behind bars he would keep himself fit so that if war was still raging in europe he would be ready to sign up the moment he was released quinn was already dressed by the time harry climbed down from the top bunk what now asked harry sounding like a new boy on his first day of term breakfast said quinn get dressed grab your plate and mug and make sure youre ready when the screw unlocks the door if youre a few seconds late some officers get a kick out of slamming the door in your face harry began to pull on his trousers and dont talk on your way down to the canteen added quinn it draws attention to yourself which annoys the oldtimers in fact dont talk to anyone you dont know until your second year harry would have laughed but he wasnt sure if quinn was joking he heard a key turning in the lock and the cell door swung open quinn shot through like a greyhound out of the slips with his cellmate only a stride behind they joined a long line of silent prisoners who were making their way across the landing past the open doors of empty cells before walking down a spiral staircase to the ground floor where they would join their fellow inmates for breakfast the line came to a halt long before they reached the canteen harry watched the servers in their short white coats standing behind the hotplate a guard carrying a truncheon and wearing a long white coat was keeping an eye on them making sure no one got an extra portion how nice to see you again mr siddell pat said quietly to the guard once they reached the front of the queue the two men shook hands as if they were old friends this time harry couldnt see any money changing hands but a curt nod from mr siddell indicated that a deal had been struck quinn moved along the line as his tin plate was filled with a fried egg with a solid yolk a pile of potatoes more black than white and the regulation two slices of stale bread harry caught up with him as he was having his mug half filled with coffee the servers looked puzzled when harry thanked them one by one as if he were a guest at a vicarage tea party damn he said when the last server offered him coffee i left my mug in the cell the server filled quinns mug to the brim dont forget next time said harrys cellmate no talking in line yelled hessler slamming his truncheon into a gloved hand quinn led harry to the end of a long table and sat on the bench opposite him harry was so hungry he devoured every morsel on his plate including the greasiest egg hed ever tasted he even considered licking his plate and then he recalled his friend giles on another first day when harry and pat had finished their fiveminute breakfast they were marched back up the spiral staircase to the top floor once their cell door had been slammed shut quinn washed his plate and mug and placed them neatly under his bunk when you live in an eight by four for years on end you make use of every inch of space he explained harry followed his lead and could only wonder how long it would be before he was able to teach quinn something what next asked harry work allocation said quinn ill be joining siddell in the kitchen but weve still got to make sure they put you in the library and thatll depend on which officer is on duty trouble is im running out of cash quinn had hardly got the words out of his mouth before the door was pulled open again and hessler was silhouetted in the doorway the truncheon thumping into his gloved hand quinn he said report to the kitchen immediately bradshaw go to station nine and join the other wing cleaners i was hoping to work in the library mr i dont give a fuck what you were hoping bradshaw said hessler as wing officer i make the rules around here you can go to the library on tuesdays thursdays and sundays between six and seven like any other inmate is that clear enough for you harry nodded youre not an officer any longer bradshaw just a con like everyone else in this place and dont waste your time thinking you can bribe me he added before marching off to the next cell hesslers one of the few officers you cant bribe whispered quinn your only hope now is mr swanson the prison warden just remember that he considers himself a bit of an intellectual which probably means he can manage joinedup writing hes also a fundamental baptist hallelujah when will i get the chance to see him asked harry could be any time just be sure to let him know you want to work in the library because each new prisoner only gets five minutes of his time harry slumped down on the wooden chair and placed his head in his hands if it wasnt for the jelks had promised to send to his mother hed use his five minutes to tell the warden the truth about how hed ended up in lavenham meantime ill do what i can to get you into the kitchen added quinn it may not be what you hoped for but its sure better than being a wing cleaner thanks said harry quinn scurried off to the kitchens not needing directions harry took the stairs back down to the ground floor and went in search of station nine twelve men all firsttimers stood in a huddle and waited for instructions initiative was frowned on in lavenham it smacked of rebellion or the suggestion that a prisoner just might be cleverer than an officer pick up a bucket fill it with water and get yourself a mop said hessler he smiled at harry as he ticked off his name on yet another clipboard as you were last down bradshaw youll be working in the shit house for the next month but i wasnt the last down protested harry i think you were said hessler the smile not leaving his face harry filled his bucket with cold water and grabbed a mop he didnt need to be told in which direction to go he could smell the latrines from a dozen paces he began retching before hed even entered the large square room with thirty holes in the ground he held his nose but he had to continually leave the room to gasp for air hessler stood some way off laughing youll get used to it bradshaw he said in time harry regretted having eaten such a large breakfast which he brought up within minutes it must have been about an hour later that he heard another officer bellowing his name bradshaw harry staggered out of the latrines white as a sheet thats me he said the warden wants to see you so lets get movin harry was able to breathe more deeply with each step he took and by the time hed reached the wardens office he felt almost human wait there until youre called for said the officer harry took a spare seat between two other prisoners who quickly turned away he couldnt blame them he tried to gather his thoughts as each new prisoner went in and out of the wardens office quinn was right the interviews lasted for about five minutes some even less harry couldnt afford to waste one second of his allotted time bradshaw said the officer and opened the door he stood aside as harry entered the wardens office harry decided not to get too close to mr swanson and remained several paces from his large leathertopped desk although the warden was seated harry could see that he was unable to do up the middle button of his sports jacket his hair had been dyed black in an attempt to make him look younger but it only made him look slightly ridiculous what did brutus say of caesars vanity offer him garlands and praise him as if he were a god and that will be his downfall swanson opened bradshaws file and studied it for a few moments before looking up at harry i see you were sentenced to six years for desertion havent come across that one before he admitted yes sir said harry not wanting to waste any of his precious time dont bother telling me youre innocent swanson continued because only one in a thousand is so the odds are stacked against you harry had to smile but if you keep your nose clean harry thought about the latrines and dont cause any trouble i cant see why you would have to serve the full six years thank you sir do you have any special interests swanson asked looking as if he wasnt at all interested if harry did reading art appreciation and choral singing sir the warden gave harry a disbelieving look not sure if he was trying to get a rise out of him he pointed to a sign hanging on the wall behind his desk and asked can you tell me the next line bradshaw harry studied the embroidered sampler i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills he gave silent thanks to miss eleanor e monday and the hours hed spent at her choir practices from whence cometh my help sayeth the lord psalm one hundred and twentyone the warden smiled tell me bradshaw who are your favourite authors shakespeare dickens austen trollope and thomas hardy none of our own countrymen good enough harry wanted to curse out loud having made such an obvious blunder he glanced across at the wardens halffilled bookshelf of course he said i consider f scott fitzgerald hemingway and o henry to be anyones equal and i believe steinbeck is americas finest modern writer he hoped hed pronounced the name correctly hed make sure he had read of mice and men before he came across the warden again the smile returned to swansons lips what job has mr hessler allocated to you he asked wing cleaner although id like to work in the library sir would you indeed said the warden then ill have to see if theres a vacancy he made a note on the pad in front of him thank you sir if there is youll be informed later today said the warden as he closed the file thank you sir repeated harry he left quickly aware that hed taken longer than his allotted five minutes once he was out in the corridor the duty officer escorted him back to the wing harry was thankful that hessler was nowhere to be seen and that the cleaners had moved on to the second floor by the time he rejoined them long before the siren sounded for lunch harry was exhausted he joined the line for the hotplate and found quinn already ensconced behind the counter serving his fellow inmates large portions of potato and overcooked meat were dropped on to harrys plate he sat alone at the long table and picked at his food he feared that if hessler were to reappear that afternoon he would be dispatched back to the latrines and so would his lunch hessler was not on duty when harry reported back to work and a different officer put another firsttimer on the latrines harry spent the afternoon sweeping corridors and emptying trash cans his only thought was whether the warden had given an order to reallocate him to the library if he hadnt harry would have to hope for a job in the kitchen when quinn returned to their cell after dinner the expression on his face left harry in no doubt that he wouldnt be joining his friend there was one place available for a washerup ill take it said harry but when mr siddell put your name forward hessler vetoed it said youd have to do at least three months as a wing cleaner before hed consider a transfer to kitchen duty what is it with that man asked harry desperately rumour has it he signed up to be a naval officer but failed the board exam and had to settle for the prison service so lieutenant bradshaw has to suffer the consequences harry spent the next twentynine days cleaning the latrines on a block and it wasnt until another firsttimer appeared on the wing that hessler finally released him from his duties and began to make someone elses life hell damn mans a psycho said quinn siddells still willing to offer you a job in the kitchen but hesslers vetoed it harry didnt comment but the news isnt all bad quinn suggested because ive just heard that andy savatori the deputy librarian has been granted parole hes due to be released next month and even better no one else seems to want his job deakins would said harry under his breath so what do i have to do to make sure i get it nothing in fact try to give the impression youre not that interested and keep out of hesslers way because we know the wardens on your side the next month dragged on each day seeming longer than the one before harry visited the library every tuesday thursday and sunday between six and seven but max lloyd the senior librarian gave him no reason to believe he was being considered for the post savatori his deputy remained tightlipped although he clearly knew something i dont think lloyd wants me to be his deputy said harry after lights out one evening lloyd wont have a say about it said quinn thats the wardens decision but harry wasnt convinced i suspect hessler and lloyd are working together to make sure i dont get the job youre becoming para whats the word said quinn paranoid yeah thats what youre becoming not that im sure what it means suffering from unfounded suspicions said harry couldnt have put it better myself harry wasnt convinced that his suspicions were unfounded and a week later savatori took him to one side and confirmed his worst fears hesslers put up three cons for the wardens consideration and your name isnt on the list then thats that said harry thumping the side of his leg im going to be a wing cleaner for the rest of my days not necessarily said savatori come and see me the day before im due to be discharged but by then it will be too late i dont think so said savatori without explanation meanwhile study every page of this very carefully he handed harry a heavy leatherbound tome that rarely left the library harry sat on the top bunk and opened the cover of the page prison handbook before hed reached page he began to make notes long before hed started reading the book a second time a plan had begun to form in his mind he knew his timing would be critical and both acts would have to be rehearsed particularly as he would be on stage when the curtain went up he accepted that he couldnt go ahead with his plan until after savatori had been released even though a new deputy librarian had already been appointed when harry carried out a dress rehearsal in the privacy of their cell quinn told him that he was not only paranoid but crazy because he assured him his second performance would be in solitary the warden made his monthly rounds of each block on a monday morning so harry knew that hed have to wait for three weeks after savatori had been discharged before he would reappear on a block swanson always took the same route and prisoners knew that if they valued their skin they disappeared out of sight the moment he came into view when swanson stepped on to the top floor of a block that monday morning harry was waiting to greet him mop in hand hessler slipped in behind the warden and waved his truncheon to indicate that if bradshaw valued his life he should step aside harry didnt budge leaving the warden with no choice but to stop in his tracks good morning warden said harry as if they bumped into each other regularly swanson was surprised to come facetoface with a prisoner on his rounds and even more surprised when one spoke to him he looked more closely at harry bradshaw isnt it you have a good memory sir i also remember your interest in literature i was surprised when you turned down the job as deputy librarian i was never offered the job said harry if i had been i would have accepted it with alacrity he added which clearly took the warden by surprise turning to hessler swanson said you told me bradshaw didnt want the job harry jumped in before hessler could reply probably my fault sir i didnt realize i had to apply for the position i see said the warden well that would explain it and i can tell you bradshaw that the new man doesnt know the difference between plato and pluto harry burst out laughing hessler remained tightlipped a good analogy sir said harry as the warden attempted to move on but harry hadnt finished he thought hessler would explode when he removed an envelope from his jacket and handed it to the warden whats this swanson asked suspiciously an official request to address the board when they make their quarterly visit to the prison next tuesday which is my prerogative under statute thirtytwo of the penal code ive sent a copy of the request to my lawyer mr sefton jelks for the first time the warden looked anxious hessler could barely contain himself will you be making a complaint asked the warden cautiously harry stared directly at hessler before replying under statute oneonesix it is my right not to disclose to any member of the prison staff why i wish to address the board as im sure youre aware warden yes of course bradshaw said the warden sounding flustered but it is my intention among other things to inform the board of the importance you place on including literature and religion as part of our daily lives harry stood aside to allow the warden to continue on his way thank you bradshaw he said thats good of you ill be seeing you later bradshaw hissed hessler under his breath ill look forward to that said harry loud enough for mr swanson to hear harrys confrontation with the warden was the main topic of conversation among the prisoners in the dinner queue and when quinn returned from the kitchen later that evening he warned harry that the rumour on the block was that once lights were out hessler was likely to kill him i dont think so said harry calmly you see the problem with being a bully is that on the flipside of that particular coin youll find the imprint of a coward quinn didnt look convinced harry didnt have long to wait to prove his point because within moments of lights out the cell door swung open and hessler strolled in swinging his truncheon quinn out he said not taking his eyes off harry once the irishman had scurried on to the landing hessler closed the cell door and said ive been looking forward to this all day bradshaw youre about to discover how many bones youve got in your body i dont think so mr hessler said harry not flinching and what do you think will save you asked hessler advancing the warden isnt around to rescue you this time i dont need the warden said harry not while youre being considered for promotion he added meeting hesslers stare im reliably informed that youll be appearing before the board next tuesday afternoon at two oclock so what said hessler now less than a foot away youve clearly forgotten that ill be addressing the board at ten oclock that morning one or two of them may be curious to find out how so many of my bones came to be broken after i dared to speak to the warden hessler slammed his truncheon down on the side of the bunk only inches from harrys face but harry didnt flinch of course harry continued its possible that you want to remain a wing officer for the rest of your life but somehow i doubt it because even you cant be so stupid as to ruin your one chance of promotion hessler raised his truncheon once again but hesitated when harry took a thick exercise book from under his pillow ive made a comprehensive list of the regulations youve broken over the past month mr hessler some of them several times im confident that the board will find it interesting reading this evening ill be adding two more indiscretions being alone in a cell with a prisoner while the cell door is closed statute fouronenine and making physical threats when that prisoner has no way of defending himself statute fiveonetwo hessler took a pace back but im confident that what will most influence the board when they come to consider your promotion will be the question of why you had to leave the navy at such short notice the blood drained from hesslers face it certainly wasnt because you failed the exam when you applied to be an officer who squealed said hessler his words barely a whisper one of your former shipmates who unfortunately ended up in here you made sure he kept his mouth shut by giving him the job as deputy librarian i expect nothing less harry handed his past months work to hessler pausing to allow this latest piece of information to sink in before adding ill keep my mouth shut until the day im released unless of course you give me some reason not to and if you ever lay as much as a finger on me ill have you thrown out of the prison service even quicker than you were drummed out of the navy do i make myself clear hessler nodded but didnt speak also should you decide to pick on any other unfortunate firsttimers all bets are off now get out of my cell when lloyd stood to greet him at nine oclock on his first morning as deputy librarian harry realized that hed only ever seen the man sitting down lloyd was taller than hed expected well over six feet despite the unhealthy prison food he had a spare frame and was one of the few prisoners who shaved every morning with his sweptback jetblack hair he resembled an ageing matinee idol rather than a man who was serving five years for fraud quinn didnt know the details of his crime which meant that nobody other than the warden knew the full story and the rule in jail was simple if a prisoner didnt volunteer what he was in for you didnt ask lloyd took harry through the daily routine which the new deputy librarian had mastered by the time they went down for supper that evening during the next few days he continued to quiz lloyd with questions about matters like collecting overdue books fines and inviting prisoners to donate their own books to the library when they were released which lloyd hadnt even considered most of lloyds answers were monosyllabic so harry finally allowed him to return to a resting position at his desk well hidden behind a copy of the new york times although there were nearly a thousand prisoners locked up in lavenham fewer than one in ten of them could read and write and not all of those who could bothered to visit the library on a tuesday thursday or sunday harry soon discovered that max lloyd was both lazy and devious he didnt seem to mind how many initiatives his new deputy came up with as long as it didnt involve him in any extra work lloyds main task seemed to be to keep a pot of coffee on the go just in case an officer dropped by once the wardens copy of the previous days new york times had been delivered to the library lloyd settled down at his desk for the rest of the morning he first turned to the book review section and when he finished perusing it he turned his attention to the classified ads followed by the news and finally sports after lunch he would make a start on the crossword puzzle which harry would complete the following morning by the time harry got the newspaper it was already two days out of date he always began with the international news pages as he wanted to find out how the war in europe was progressing that was how he learned about the fall of france and a few months later that neville chamberlain had resigned as prime minister and winston churchill had succeeded him not everyones first choice although harry would never forget the speech churchill had made when he presented the prizes at bristol grammar school he wasnt in any doubt that britain was being led by the right man time and again harry cursed the fact that he was a deputy librarian in an american prison and not an officer in the royal navy during the last hour of the day when even harry couldnt find anything new to do he brought his diary up to date it took harry just over a month to reorganize all the books into their correct categories first fiction then nonfiction during the second month he broke them down into even smaller classifications so that prisoners didnt have to waste time searching for the only three books on woodwork that were on the shelves he explained to lloyd that when it came to nonfiction the category was more important than the authors name lloyd shrugged on sunday mornings harry would push the library cart around the four blocks retrieving overdue books from prisoners some of which hadnt been returned for more than a year he had expected a few of the oldtimers on d block to be resentful even to take offence at the intrusion but they all wanted to meet the man whod got hessler transferred to pierpoint after his interview with the board hessler had been offered a senior post at pierpoint and he accepted the promotion as it was nearer his home town while harry never suggested hed had anything to do with hesslers transfer that wasnt the story quinn peddled from ear to ear until it became legend during his trips around the blocks in search of missing books harry often picked up anecdotes that he would record in his diary that evening the warden occasionally dropped into the library not least because when harry had appeared before the board hed described mr swansons attitude to the education of inmates as bold imaginative and farseeing harry couldnt believe how much undeserved flattery the warden was quite happy to soak up after his first three months loans were up by per cent when harry asked the warden if he could instigate a reading class in the evenings swanson hesitated for a moment but gave in when harry repeated the words bold imaginative and farseeing only three prisoners attended harrys first class and one of them was pat quinn who could already read and write but by the end of the following month the class had grown to sixteen even if several of them would have done almost anything to get out of their cells for an hour in the evening but harry managed to notch up one or two notable successes among the younger prisoners and was continually reminded that just because you hadnt gone to the right school or hadnt gone to school at all it didnt mean you were stupid or the other way round quinn reminded him despite all the extra activity harry had initiated he found he was still left with time on his hands so he set himself the task of reading two new books a week once hed conquered the few american classics in the library he turned his attention to crime by far the most popular category with his fellow inmates taking up seven of the librarys nineteen shelves harry had always enjoyed conan doyle and he was looking forward to turning his attention to his american rivals he began with the bigger they come by erle stanley gardner before moving on to raymond chandlers the big sleep he felt a little guilty about enjoying them so much what would mr holcombe think during the last hour before the library closed harry would continue to bring his diary up to date he was taken by surprise one evening when lloyd having finished the paper asked if he could read it harry knew that lloyd had been a literary agent in new york on the outside which was how hed landed the job in the library he sometimes dropped the names of authors hed represented most of whom harry had never heard of lloyd only spoke about how hed ended up in lavenham on one occasion watching the door to make sure no one overheard a bit of bad luck lloyd explained in good faith i invested some of my clients money on the stock exchange and when things didnt go quite according to plan i was left carrying the bag when harry repeated the story to quinn that night he raised his eyes to the heavens more likely he spent the money on slow nags and fast dames then why go into such detail asked harry when hes never mentioned the reason hes in here to anyone else youre so naïve sometimes said quinn with you as the messenger lloyd knows theres a far better chance of the rest of us believing his story just be sure you never make a deal with that man because hes got six fingers on each hand a pickpockets expression that harry recorded in his diary that night but he didnt take much notice of quinns advice partly because he couldnt imagine any circumstances in which he would make a deal with max lloyd other than about whose turn it was to pour the coffee when the warden dropped in by the end of his first year at lavenham harry had filled three exercise books with his observations on prison life and could only wonder how many more pages of this daily chronicle hed manage before he completed his sentence he was surprised by how enthusiastic lloyd was always wanting to read the next instalment he even suggested he might be allowed to show harrys work to a publisher harry laughed i cant imagine anyone would be interested in my ramblings youd be surprised said lloyd emma barrington sebastian arthur clifton said emma handing the sleeping child to his grandmother maisie beamed as she took her grandson in her arms for the first time they wouldnt let me come and see you before i was packed off to scotland said emma making no attempt to hide her scorn thats why i called you the moment i got back to bristol that was kind of you said maisie as she stared intently at the little boy trying to convince herself that sebastian had inherited her husbands fair hair and clear blue eyes emma sat at the kitchen table smiled and sipped her tea earl grey how typical of maisie to remember and cucumber and salmon sandwiches harrys favourite which must have emptied her ration book as she looked around the room her eyes settled on the mantelpiece where she spotted a sepia photograph of a private soldier from the first war how emma wished she could see the shade of his hair hidden under the helmet or even the colour of his eyes were they blue like harrys or brown like hers arthur clifton cut a dashing figure in his army uniform the square jaw and the determined looked showed emma that hed been proud to serve his country her gaze moved on to a more recent photo of harry singing in the st bedes school choir just before his voice broke and next to that propped against the wall was an envelope displaying harrys unmistakable hand she assumed it was the last letter he had written to his mother before he died she wondered if maisie would allow her to read it she stood up and walked across to the mantelpiece and was surprised to find that the envelope hadnt been opened i was so sorry to hear you had to leave oxford maisie ventured when she saw emma staring at the envelope given the choice of continuing with my degree or having harrys child there was no contest said emma her eyes still fixed on the letter and sir walter tells me that your brother giles joined the wessex regiment but has sadly been i see you had a letter from harry interrupted emma unable to contain herself no its not from harry said maisie its from a lieutenant thomas bradshaw who served with him on the ss devonian what does lieutenant bradshaw have to say asked emma aware that the envelope hadnt been opened ive no idea said maisie a dr wallace delivered it to me and said it was a letter of condolence i didnt feel i needed any more reminders of harrys death so i never opened it but isnt it possible that it might throw some light on what happened on the devonian i doubt it maisie replied after all theyd only known each other for a few days would you like me to read the letter to you mrs clifton emma asked aware that maisie might be embarrassed by having to admit she couldnt read no thank you my dear maisie replied after all its not going to bring harry back is it i agree said emma but perhaps you would allow me to read it for my own peace of mind she said with the germans targeting the docks at night said maisie i hope barringtons hasnt been too badly affected weve escaped a direct hit said emma reluctantly accepting that she wasnt going to be allowed to read the letter mind you i doubt even the germans would dare to drop a bomb on gramps maisie laughed and for a moment emma considered snatching the envelope from the mantelpiece and ripping it open before maisie could stop her but harry would never have approved of that if maisie were to leave the room even for a moment emma would use the steaming kettle to unseal the envelope check the signature and make sure it was back in its place before she returned but it was almost as if maisie could read her thoughts because she remained by the mantelpiece and didnt budge gramps tells me congratulations are in order said emma still refusing to give up maisie blushed and began to chat about her new appointment at the grand hotel emmas eyes remained on the envelope she carefully checked the m the c the s the h and the l in the address knowing that she would have to keep the image of those letters in her minds eye like a photograph until she returned to the manor house when maisie handed little sebastian back to her explaining that sadly she had to get back to work emma reluctantly stood up but not before she had given the envelope one last look on the way back to the manor house emma tried to keep the image of the handwriting in her mind thankful that sebastian had fallen into a deep sleep as soon as the car came to a halt on the gravel outside the front steps hudson opened the back door to allow emma to get out and carry her son into the house she took him straight up to the nursery where nanny barrington was waiting for them to nannys surprise emma kissed him on the forehead and left without a word once she was in her own room emma unlocked the centre drawer of her writing desk and pulled out a stack of letters that harry had written to her over the years the first thing she checked was the capital h of harrys signature so plain and bold just like the h in still house lane on maisies unopened envelope this gave her confidence to carry on with the quest she next searched for a capital c and eventually found one on a christmas card with the bonus of the capital m of merry the same m and the same c as mrs clifton on the envelope harry must surely be alive she kept repeating out loud finding a bristol was easy but england was more difficult until she came across a letter hed written to her from italy when they were both still at school it took her over an hour to neatly cut out the thirtynine letters and two numbers before she was able to reproduce the address on the envelope mrs m clifton still house lane bristol england emma collapsed exhausted on to her bed she had no idea who thomas bradshaw was but one thing was certain the unopened letter propped on maisies mantelpiece had been written by harry and for some reason best known to himself he didnt want her to know he was still alive she wondered if he would have thought differently had he known she was pregnant with his child before he set off on that fateful voyage emma was desperate to share the news that harry might not be dead with her mother gramps grace and of course maisie but she realized she would have to remain silent until she had more conclusive proof than an unopened letter a plan began to form in her mind emma didnt go down for dinner that evening but remained in her room and continued to try to fathom out why harry would want everyone except his mother to believe hed died that night when she climbed into bed just before midnight she could only assume that it must have been for what he considered a matter of honour perhaps he imagined poor foolish disillusioned man that it would release her from any obligation she might feel towards him didnt he realize that from the first moment shed set eyes on him at her brothers birthday party when she was only ten years old there was never going to be another man in her life emmas family had been delighted when she and harry became engaged eight years later with the exception of her father who had for so long been living a lie a lie that wasnt exposed until the day of their wedding the two of them were standing at the altar about to take their vows when old jack had brought the ceremony to an unrehearsed and unexpected close the revelation that emmas father might also be harrys father didnt stop her loving harry and it never would no one was surprised that harry behaved like a gentleman while emmas father had remained true to his character and behaved like a cad one stood and faced the music while the other slunk out of the back door of the vestry and hadnt been seen since harry had made it clear long before he asked emma to be his wife that if war was declared he wouldnt hesitate to leave oxford and join the royal navy he was a stubborn man at the best of times and these were the worst of times emma realized there was no point in trying to dissuade him as nothing she could say or do would have changed his mind he had also warned her that he would not consider returning to oxford until the germans had surrendered emma had also left oxford early but unlike harry she hadnt been given a choice for her there would be no chance of returning pregnancy was frowned upon at somerville and even more so when you werent married to the father the decision must have broken her mothers heart elizabeth barrington had so wanted her daughter to achieve the academic accolades that she had been denied for no other reason than her sex a rare glimmer of light appeared on the horizon a year later when emmas younger sister grace won an open scholarship to girton college cambridge and from the day shed arrived in that seat of learning she had outshone the brightest men once it became obvious that emma was pregnant she was whisked off to her grandfathers estate in scotland to give birth to harrys child barringtons dont produce illegitimate offspring at least not in bristol sebastian was crawling around the castle before the prodigal daughter was allowed to return to the manor house elizabeth had wanted them to remain at mulgelrie until the war was over but emma had had more than enough of being hidden away in a remote scottish castle one of the first people she visited after returning to the west country was her grandfather sir walter barrington it had been he who had told her that harry had joined the crew of the ss devonian and planned to return to bristol within the month as he intended to sign up as an ordinary seaman on hms resolution harry never returned and six weeks went by before she learned that her lover had been buried at sea sir walter had taken it upon himself to visit each member of the family one by one to inform them of the tragic news hed begun with mrs clifton although he knew she had already heard what had happened from dr wallace who had passed on thomas bradshaws letter he next travelled up to scotland to break the news to emma sir walter was surprised that his granddaughter didnt shed a tear but then emma simply refused to accept that harry was dead once hed returned to bristol sir walter visited giles and told him the news harrys closest friend had sunk into a desolate silence and there was nothing any of the family could say or do to console him when lord and lady harvey heard the news of harrys death they were stoical a week later when the family attended captain jack tarrants memorial service at bristol grammar school lord harvey remarked that he was glad old jack had never found out what had happened to his protégé the only person in the family sir walter refused to visit was his son hugo he made an excuse about not knowing how to get in touch with him but when emma returned to bristol he admitted to her that even if he had known he wouldnt have bothered and added that her father was probably the one person who would be pleased that harry was dead emma said nothing but didnt doubt that he was right for several days after her visit to maisie in still house lane emma had spent hours alone in her room endlessly considering what she might do with her newfound knowledge she concluded that there was no way she could hope to discover the contents of the letter that had rested on the mantelpiece for more than a year without harming her relationship with maisie however emma resolved not only to prove to the whole world that harry was still alive but to find him wherever he might be with that in mind she made another appointment to see her grandfather after all sir walter barrington was the only person other than maisie whod met dr wallace so he must surely be her best chance of unravelling the mystery of exactly who thomas bradshaw was one thing emmas grandfather had instilled in her from an early age was never to be late for an appointment it gives the wrong impression he told her that is if you want to be taken seriously with that in mind emma left the manor house at that morning and was driven through the gates of barringtons shipyard at exactly eight minutes to ten the car parked outside barrington house at six minutes to ten by the time she stepped out of the lift on the fifth floor and walked down the corridor to the chairmans office it was two minutes to ten sir walters secretary miss beale opened the door of his office as the clock on his mantelpiece began to chime ten the chairman smiled rose from behind his desk and walked across the room to greet emma with a kiss on both cheeks and how is my favourite granddaughter he asked as he guided her to a comfortable chair by the fire grace is just fine gramps said emma doing brilliantly at cambridge im told and sends her love dont get cheeky with me young lady he said returning her smile and sebastian my favourite greatgrandson hows he coming along your only greatgrandson emma reminded him as she settled back into a deep leather chair as you havent brought him with you i assume you have something serious to discuss the small talk had already been dispensed with emma knew that sir walter would have allocated a certain amount of time for the meeting miss beale had once told her that visitors were granted fifteen minutes thirty minutes or an hour depending on how important he considered they were family were not exempt from this rule except on sunday emma had a number of questions she needed answered so hoped hed allotted her at least half an hour she sat back and tried to relax because she didnt want gramps to work out the real reason she wanted to see him do you remember when you kindly travelled up to scotland she began to let me know that harry had been killed at sea im afraid i was in such a state of shock that i didnt take it all in so i hoped you might tell me a little more about the last few days of his life of course my dear said sir walter sympathetically lets hope my memory is up to it is there anything in particular you want to know you told me that harry signed up as the fourth officer on the devonian after hed come down from oxford thats right it was my old friend captain havens who made it possible and he was among the few survivors of the tragedy when i visited him recently he could not have spoken more warmly of harry he described him as a courageous young man who not only saved his life after the ship had been hit by a torpedo but sacrificed his own when he attempted to rescue the chief engineer was captain havens also picked up by the kansas star no by another ship that was in the vicinity so sadly he never saw harry again so he didnt witness harry being buried at sea no the only officer from the devonian who was with harry when he died was an american called lieutenant thomas bradshaw you told me that a dr wallace delivered a letter from lieutenant bradshaw to mrs clifton thats correct dr wallace was the chief medical officer on the kansas star he assured me that he and his team did everything in their power to save harrys life did bradshaw write to you as well no only to the next of kin if i recall dr wallaces words then dont you find it strange that he didnt write to me sir walter fell silent for some time you know ive never really given it any thought perhaps harry never mentioned you to bradshaw you know how secretive he could be emma had often thought about it but moved quickly on did you read the letter he sent to mrs clifton no i didnt but i saw it on the mantelpiece when i visited her the following day do you think dr wallace had any idea what bradshaw had written in that letter yes he told me it was a letter of condolence from a fellow officer who had served with harry on the devonian if only i could meet lieutenant bradshaw said emma fishing i dont know how youll manage that my dear said sir walter unless wallace kept in touch with him do you have an address for dr wallace only care of the kansas star but surely they must have stopped sailing to bristol when war was declared not as long as there are americans stranded in england who are willing to pay through the nose to get home isnt that taking an unnecessary risk with so many german uboats patrolling the atlantic not while america remains neutral said sir walter the last thing hitler wants is to start a war with the yanks simply because one of his uboats sank an american passenger ship do you know if the kansas star is expected to return to bristol in the near future no but i can easily find out the old man heaved himself out of his chair and walked slowly across to his desk he began to flick through page after page of the monthly timetable of dockings ah here it is he eventually said shes due out of new york in four weeks time and is expected in bristol on the fifteenth of november if youre hoping to get in touch with anyone on board be warned she wont be hanging around for long as its the one place shell be vulnerable to attack will i be allowed on board not unless youre a crew member or looking for a job and frankly i cant see you as either a deckhand or a cocktail waitress so how can i get to see dr wallace youll just have to wait on the dockside in the hope that hell come ashore almost everyone does after a weeklong voyage so if hes on the ship im sure youll catch him but dont forget emma its more than a year since harry died so wallace may no longer be the ships medical officer emma bit her lip but if youd like me to arrange a private meeting with the captain id be happy no no said emma quickly its not that important if you change your mind began sir walter suddenly realizing just how important emma considered it to be no thank you gramps she said as she rose from her place thank you for giving me so much of your time not nearly enough said the old man i only wish youd drop in more often and make sure you bring sebastian with you next time he added as he accompanied her to the door sir walter was no longer in any doubt why his granddaughter had come to see him in the car on the way back to the manor house one sentence remained etched in emmas mind she played the words over and over like a gramophone needle stuck in a groove once she had returned home she joined sebastian in the nursery he had to be coaxed off his rocking horse but not before a few tears had been shed after lunch he curled up like a satisfied cat and fell into a deep sleep nanny put him to bed while emma rang for the chauffeur id like to be driven back into bristol hudson anywhere in particular miss the grand hotel you want me to do what said maisie take me on as a waitress but why id prefer not to tell you do you have any idea how hard the work is no admitted emma but i wont let you down and when do you want to start tomorrow tomorrow yes for how long one month now let me try and get this straight said maisie you want me to train you as a waitress starting tomorrow and youll be leaving in a months time but you wont tell me why thats about it are you expecting to be paid no said emma well thats a relief so when do i start six oclock tomorrow morning six oclock repeated emma in disbelief this may come as a surprise emma but i have customers who need to be fed by seven and at work by eight so youll have to make sure youre at your station by six every morning my station ill explain if you turn up before six emma wasnt late for work once in the next twentyeight days possibly because jenkins tapped on her door at every morning and hudson dropped her off a hundred yards from the staff entrance of the grand hotel by miss dickens as she was known by the rest of the staff took advantage of her acting skills to make sure that no one worked out that she was a barrington mrs clifton showed emma no favours when she spilt some soup over a regular customer and even less when she dropped a stack of plates that shattered in the middle of the dining room the cost would normally have been deducted from her pay packet if shed had one and it was some time before emma got the knack of using her shoulder to barge through the swing doors that led in and out of the kitchen without colliding with another waitress coming from the opposite direction despite this maisie quickly discovered that she only had to tell emma something once and she never forgot it she was also impressed how quickly emma could turn a table round although shed never laid one before in her life and while most trainees took several weeks to master the skill of silver service some never managing it emma didnt need any further supervision by the end of her second week by the end of her third maisie wished she wasnt leaving and by the end of the fourth so did several regulars who were insisting that only miss dickens must serve them maisie was becoming anxious about how she was going to explain to the hotel manager that miss dickens had given in her notice after only a month you can tell mr hurst that ive been offered a better job with more pay said emma as she began folding up her uniform hes not going to be pleased said maisie it might have been easier if youd turned out to be useless or at least been late a few times emma laughed and placed her little white cap neatly on top of her clothes for the last time is there anything else i can do for you miss dickens asked maisie yes please said emma i need a reference applying for another unpaid job are you something like that replied emma feeling a little guilty that she wasnt able to take harrys mother into her confidence then ill dictate a reference you write it and ill sign it she said passing emma a sheet of the hotels headed notepaper to whom it may concern maisie began during the short time could i possibly leave out short asked emma maisie smiled during the time miss dickens has been with us at the grand emma wrote miss barrington but didnt tell her she has proved hardworking efficient and popular with both the customers and staff her skills as a waitress are impressive and her ability to learn on the job convinces me that any establishment would be fortunate to have her as a member of their staff we will be sorry to lose her and should she ever want to return to this hotel we would welcome her back emma smiled as she handed the sheet of paper back maisie scribbled her signature above the words restaurant manageress thank you said emma wrapping her arms around her i have no idea what youre up to my dear said maisie once emma had released her but whatever it is i wish you luck emma wanted to tell her im going in search of your son and i wont return until ive found him emma had been standing on the dockside for over an hour when she spotted the kansas star nosing its way into port but it was another hour before the ship finally docked during that time emma thought about the decision shed made and was already beginning to wonder if she had the courage to go through with it she tried to dismiss from her thoughts the sinking of the athenia a few months before and the possibility of never even making it to new york she had written a long letter to her mother trying to explain why shed be away for a couple of weeks three at the most and only hoped she would understand but she couldnt write a letter to sebastian to let him know that she was going in search of his father and was already missing him she kept trying to convince herself that she was doing it as much for her son as for herself sir walter had once again offered to introduce her to the captain of the kansas star but emma had politely declined as it didnt fit in with her plan to remain anonymous hed also given her a vague description of dr wallace and certainly no one who looked remotely like that had disembarked from the ship that morning however sir walter was able to pass on two other valuable pieces of information the kansas star would be departing on the last tide that evening and the purser could usually be found in his office between the hours of two and five every afternoon completing embarkation forms more important he was responsible for the employment of noncrew members of staff emma had written to her grandfather the day before to thank him for his help but she still didnt let him know what she was up to although she had a feeling hed worked it out after the clock on barrington house had struck twice and there was still no sign of dr wallace emma picked up her small suitcase and decided the time had come to walk the gangplank when she stepped nervously on to the deck she asked the first person she saw in uniform the way to the pursers office and was told lower deck aft she spotted a passenger disappearing down a wide staircase and followed her to what she assumed must be the lower deck but as she had no idea where aft was she joined a queue at the information desk behind the counter stood two girls dressed in dark blue uniforms and white blouses they were attempting to answer every passengers query while keeping smiles etched on their faces how can i help you miss one of them asked when emma eventually reached the front of the queue the girl clearly assumed she was a passenger and in fact emma had considered paying for her passage to new york but had decided she was more likely to find out what she needed to know if she signed on as a member of the crew where will i find the pursers office she asked second door on the right down that companionway replied the girl you cant miss it emma followed her pointing finger and when she reached a door marked purser she took a deep breath and knocked come in emma opened the door and stepped inside to find a smartly dressed officer seated behind a desk that was strewn with forms he wore a crisp opennecked white shirt which had two gold epaulettes on each shoulder how can i help you he asked in an accent shed never heard before and could hardly decipher im looking for a job as a waitress sir said emma hoping she sounded like one of the maids at the manor house sorry he said looking back down dont need any more waitresses the only available position is on the information desk id be happy to work there said emma reverting to her normal voice the purser gave her a closer look the pays not good he warned her and the hours are worse im used to that said emma and i cant offer you a permanent position continued the purser because one of my girls is on shore leave in new york and will be rejoining the ship after this crossing thats not a problem said emma without explanation the purser still didnt look convinced can you read and write emma would like to have told him that shed won a scholarship to oxford but simply said yes sir without another word he pulled open a drawer and extracted a long form passed her a fountain pen and said fill this in as emma began to answer the questions he added and ill also need to see a reference once emma had completed the form she opened her bag and handed over maisies letter of recommendation very impressive he said but are you sure youre suited to being a receptionist it was going to be my next job at the grand emma said all part of my training to be a manageress then why give up that opportunity to join us i have a greataunt who lives in new york and my mother wants me to stay with her until the war is over this time the purser did look convinced as it wasnt the first time someone had wanted to work their passage in order to get away from england then lets get you started he said jumping up he marched out of the office and led her on the short journey back to the information desk peggy ive found someone to replace dana on this voyage so you better get her started straight away thank god for that said peggy lifting a flap so emma could join her behind the counter whats your name she asked in the same almost impenetrable accent for the first time emma understood what bernard shaw had meant when he suggested that the english and the americans were divided by a common language emma barrington well emma this is my assistant trudy as were so busy perhaps you could just observe for now and well try to fill you in as we go along emma took a pace back and watched as the two girls handled everything that was thrown at them while somehow managing to keep smiling within an hour emma knew at what time and where passengers should report for lifeboat drill which deck the grill room was on how far out to sea they had to be before passengers could order a drink where they might find a partner for a round of bridge after dinner and how to get to the upper deck if you wanted to watch the sunset for the next hour emma listened to most of the same questions being asked again and again and during the third she took a step forward and began to respond to the passengers queries herself only occasionally needing to refer to the other two girls peggy was impressed and when the queue had dwindled to a few latecomers she said to emma time to show you your quarters and grab some supper while the passengers are having a predinner drink she turned to trudy and added ill be back around seven to relieve you then lifted the flap and stepped out from behind the desk trudy nodded as another passenger came forward can you tell me if we have to dress for dinner tonight not on the first night sir came back the firm reply but every other night peggy never stopped chatting as she led emma down a long corridor arriving at the top of some ropedoff steps with a sign declaring in bold red letters crew only this leads to our quarters she explained as she unhooked the rope youre going to have to share a cabin with me peggy added as they walked down because danas bunk is the only one available at the moment thats fine said emma down down and down they went the stairwells becoming more cramped with each deck peggy only stopped talking when a crew member stood aside to let them pass occasionally she would reward them with a warm smile emma had never come across anyone like peggy in her life so fiercely independent yet somehow she managed to remain feminine with her bobbed fair hair skirt that only just fell below the knees and tight jacket that left you in no doubt how good her figure was this is our cabin she said finally its where youll be sleeping for the next week i hope you werent expecting anything palatial emma entered a cabin that was smaller than any room at the manor house including the broom cupboard ghastly isnt it said peggy in fact this old tub has only one thing going for it emma didnt need to ask what that might be because peggy was only too happy to answer her own questions as well as emmas the male to female ratio is better than almost anywhere else on earth said peggy laughing before she added thats danas bunk and this is mine as you can see there isnt enough room for two people in here at the same time unless one of them is in bed ill leave you to get unpacked and come back in half an hour to take you down to the staff canteen for supper emma wondered how they could go any further down but peggy had disappeared before she could ask she sat on her bunk in a daze how could she get peggy to answer all of her questions if she never stopped talking or might that turn out to be an advantage would she given time reveal everything emma needed to know she had a whole week to find out so felt she could afford to be patient she began to stuff her few possessions into a drawer that dana had made no attempt to empty two long blasts on the ships horn and a moment later she felt a little shudder although there was no porthole to look through she could feel that they were on the move she sat back down on her bunk and tried to convince herself shed made the right decision although she planned to return to bristol within a month she was already missing sebastian she began to look more carefully at what would be her residence for the next week on each side of the cabin a narrow bunk was attached to the wall whose dimensions assumed that any occupant would be below average height she lay down and tested a mattress that didnt give because it hadnt any springs and rested her head on a pillow that was filled with foam rubber not feathers there was a small washbasin with two taps both of which delivered the same trickle of tepid water she put on danas uniform and tried not to laugh when peggy returned she did laugh dana must have been at least three inches shorter and certainly three sizes larger than emma be thankful its only for a week said peggy as she led emma off for supper they descended even further into the bowels of the ship to join the other members of the crew several young men and one or two older ones invited peggy to join them at their table she favoured a tall young man who she told emma was an engineer emma wondered if that explained why it wasnt only his hair that was covered in oil the three of them joined the queue at the hotplate the engineer filled his plate with almost everything on offer peggy managed about half while emma feeling a little queasy satisfied herself with a biscuit and an apple after supper peggy and emma returned to the information desk to relieve trudy as the passengers dinner was served at eight few of them appeared at the desk other than those who needed to ask for directions to the dining room during the next hour emma learnt a great deal more about peggy than she did about the ss kansas star when they came to the end of their shift at ten oclock they pulled down the grille and peggy led her new companion back towards the lower deck staircase do you want to join us for a drink in the staff canteen she asked no thank you said emma im exhausted do you think you can find your way back to the cabin lower deck seven room oneonethree if im not in bed by the time you get back send out a search party as soon as emma had entered her cabin she quickly undressed washed and slipped under the single sheet and blanket provided she lay on the bunk trying to settle her knees almost tucked under her chin while the irregular bobbing of the vessel meant that she couldnt remain in the same position for more than a few moments her last thoughts before she drifted into a fitful sleep were of sebastian emma woke with a start it was so dark she had no way of checking the time on her watch at first she assumed the swaying was caused by the movement of the ship until her eyes focused and she was able to make out two bodies in the bunk on the other side of the cabin moving rhythmically up and down one of the bodies had legs that stretched far beyond the end of the bunk and were braced against the wall it had to be the engineer emma wanted to laugh but she just lay very still until peggy let out a long sigh and the movement stopped a few moments later the feet attached to the long legs touched the floor and began to wriggle into some old overalls not long afterwards the cabin door opened and closed quietly emma fell into a deep sleep when emma woke the following morning peggy was already up and dressed im off for breakfast she announced ill see you at the desk later by the way were expected on duty at eight the moment the door closed emma jumped out of bed and after shed washed slowly and dressed quickly she realized there wouldnt be any time for breakfast if she hoped to be behind the information desk on time once shed reported for work emma quickly discovered that peggy took her job very seriously and put herself out to assist any passenger who needed her help during their morning coffee break emma said one of the passengers asked me about doctors surgery hours seven to eleven in the morning replied peggy four to six in the afternoon in case of an emergency dial oneoneone on the nearest telephone and the doctors name parkinson dr parkinson hes the one man every girl on board has a crush on oh one of the passengers thought it was a dr wallace no wally retired about six months ago sweet old thing emma asked no more questions during the break just drank coffee why dont you spend the rest of the morning finding your way around so you know where youre sending everyone peggy suggested once theyd reported back to the desk she handed emma a guide to the ship see you for lunch with the guidebook open emma began her quest on the upper deck the dining rooms the bars the card room a library and even a ballroom with a resident jazz band she only stopped to take a closer look when she came across the infirmary on lower deck two tentatively opening the double doors and poking her head inside two neatly made unoccupied beds stood against the wall on the far side of the room had harry slept in one and lieutenant bradshaw in the other can i help you said a voice emma swung round to see a tall man in a long white coat she immediately understood why peggy had a crush on him ive just started on the information desk she blurted out and im meant to be finding out where everything is im simon parkinson he said giving her a friendly smile now youve found out where i am youre most welcome to drop in at any time thank you said emma she quickly stepped back into the corridor closed the door behind her and hurried away she couldnt remember the last time someone had flirted with her but she wished it had been dr wallace she spent the rest of the morning exploring each deck until she felt shed mastered the ships layout and would be able to tell any passenger where everything was with more confidence she was looking forward to spending the afternoon testing out her new skills but peggy asked her to go over the passenger files in the same way shed studied the ship emma sat alone in the back office learning about people she would never see again in her life in the evening she made an attempt to eat supper beans on toast and a glass of lemonade but she was back in her cabin soon afterwards hoping to catch some sleep in case the engineer returned when the door opened the light in the corridor woke her emma couldnt make out who it was that entered the cabin but it certainly wasnt the engineer because his feet didnt reach the wall she lay awake for forty minutes and didnt get back to sleep until the door had opened and closed again emma quickly became accustomed to the routine of the daily work followed by the nocturnal visits these visits didnt vary greatly only the men although on one occasion the amorous visitor headed for emmas bunk and not peggys wrong girl said emma firmly sorry came back the reply before he changed direction peggy must have assumed she had fallen asleep because after the couple had made love emma could hear every word of their whispered conversation do you think your friends available why have you taken a shine to her giggled peggy no not me but i know someone whod like to be the first man to unbutton danas uniform not a hope shes got a boyfriend back home in bristol and im told even dr parkinson didnt make an impression on her pity said the voice peggy and trudy often talked about the morning that nine sailors from the devonian had been buried at sea before breakfast with some subtle prompts emma was able to gain information that neither her grandfather nor maisie could possibly have known but with only three days left before they reached new york she was no nearer to discovering if it was harry or lieutenant bradshaw whod survived on the fifth day emma took charge of the desk for the first time and there were no surprises the surprise came on the fifth night when the cabin door opened at whatever hour it was a man once again headed for emmas bunk but this time when she said wrong girl firmly he left immediately she lay awake wondering who it could possibly have been on the sixth day emma learnt nothing new about harry or tom bradshaw and was beginning to fear that she might arrive in new york without any leads to follow up it was during dinner that night that she decided to ask peggy about the one that survived i only met tom bradshaw once said peggy when he was roaming around the deck with his nurse well come to think of it he wasnt exactly roaming because the poor man was on crutches did you speak to him asked emma no he seemed very shy in any case kristin didnt let him out of her sight kristin she was the hospital nurse at the time worked alongside dr wallace between them they undoubtedly saved tom bradshaws life so you never saw him again only when we docked in new york and i spotted him going ashore with kristin he left the ship with kristin said emma anxiously was dr wallace with them no just kristin and her boyfriend richard richard said emma sounding relieved yes richard something i cant remember his surname he was the third officer not long afterwards he married kristin and we never saw either of them again was he a goodlooking man asked emma tom or richard asked peggy can i get you a drink peg asked a young man emma had never seen before but had a feeling she would be seeing in profile later that night emma was right and she didnt sleep before during or after the visit as she had something else on her mind the following morning for the first time on the voyage emma was standing behind the information desk waiting for peggy to appear shall i prepare the passenger list for disembarkation she asked when peggy finally arrived and lifted the counter flap youre the first person ive ever known to volunteer for that job said peggy but be my guest someone has to make sure its up to date in case immigration decides to doublecheck any of the passengers details once weve docked in new york emma went straight through to the back office putting aside the current passenger list she turned her attention to the files of past crew members which she found in a separate cabinet that looked as if it hadnt been opened for some time she began a slow meticulous search for the names kristin and richard kristin proved easy because there was only one person with that name and shed worked as a senior staff nurse on the kansas star from to however there were several richards dicks and dickies but the address of one of them lieutenant richard tibbet was in the same manhattan apartment building as miss kristin craven emma made a note of the address welcome to the united states miss barrington thank you said emma how long do you plan to be in the united states asked the immigration officer as he checked her passport a week two at the most said emma im visiting my greataunt and then ill be returning to england it was true that emma had a greataunt who lived in new york lord harveys sister but she had no intention of visiting her not least because she didnt want the rest of the family to find out what she was up to your greataunts address sixtyfourth and park the immigration officer made a note stamped emmas passport and handed it back to her enjoy your stay in the big apple miss barrington once emma had passed through immigration she joined a long queue of passengers from the kansas star it was another twenty minutes before she climbed into the back of a yellow cab i require a small sensibly priced hotel located near merton street in manhattan she told the driver you wanna run that past me again lady said the cabbie the stub of an unlit cigar protruding from the corner of his mouth as emma had found it difficult to understand a word he said she assumed he was having the same problem im looking for a small inexpensive hotel near merton street on manhattan island she said slowly enunciating each word merton street repeated the driver as if it was the only thing hed understood thats right said emma why didnt you say so the first time the driver took off and didnt speak again until hed dropped his fare outside a redbrick building that flew a flag proclaiming the mayflower hotel thatll be forty cents said the cabbie the cigar bobbing up and down with each word emma paid the fare from the wage packet shed earned while on the ship once shed checked into the hotel she took the lift to the fourth floor and went straight to her room the first thing she did was to get undressed and run herself a hot bath when she reluctantly climbed out she dried herself with a large fluffy towel dressed in what she considered a demure frock and made her way back down to the ground floor she felt almost human emma found a quiet table in the corner of the hotel coffee shop and ordered a cup of tea they hadnt heard of earl grey and a club sandwich something shed never heard of while she waited to be served she began to write out a long list of questions on a paper napkin hoping there would be someone living at merton street who was willing to answer them once shed signed the check another new word emma asked the receptionist for directions to merton street three blocks north two blocks west she was told she hadnt realized that every new yorker possessed a builtin compass emma enjoyed the walk stopping several times to admire windows filled with merchandise she had never seen in bristol she arrived outside a highrise apartment block just after midday unsure what she would do if mrs tibbet wasnt at home a smartly dressed doorman saluted and opened the door for her can i help you ive come to see mrs tibbet emma said trying to sound as if she was expected apartment thirtyone on the third floor he said touching the rim of his cap it was true an english accent did appear to open doors as the elevator made its way slowly up to the third floor emma rehearsed some lines she hoped would open another door when the elevator stopped she pulled back the grille stepped out into the corridor and went in search of number there was a tiny circle of glass set in the middle of the tibbets door which reminded emma of a cyclops eye she couldnt see in but she assumed the occupants could see out a more familiar buzzer was on the wall beside the door she pressed it and waited it was some time before the door eventually opened but only a few inches revealing a brass chain two eyes peered out at her what do you want asked a voice that she could at least understand im sorry to bother you mrs tibbet said emma but you may be my last chance the eyes looked suspicious you see im desperately trying to find tom tom repeated the voice tom bradshaw hes the father of my child said emma playing her last dooropening card the door closed the chain was removed and the door opened once again to reveal a young woman carrying a baby in her arms im sorry about that she said but richard doesnt like me opening the door to strangers please come in she led emma through to the living room have a seat while i put jake back in his cot emma sat down and glanced around the room there were several photographs of kristin with a young naval officer who she assumed must be her husband richard kristin returned a few minutes later carrying a tray of coffee black or white white please said emma whod never drunk coffee in england but was quickly learning that americans dont drink tea even in the morning sugar enquired kristin after shed poured two coffees no thank you so is tom your husband asked kristin as she sat down opposite emma no im his fiancée to be fair he had no idea i was pregnant how did you find me asked kristin still sounding a little apprehensive the purser on the kansas star said you and richard were among the last people to see tom thats true we were with him until he was arrested a few moments after he stepped on shore arrested said emma in disbelief what could he possibly have done to get himself arrested he was accused of murdering his brother said kristin but surely you knew that emma burst into tears her hopes shattered by the realization that it must have been bradshaw whod survived and not harry if harry had been accused of murdering bradshaws brother it would have been so easy for him to prove theyd arrested the wrong man if only shed ripped open the letter on maisies mantelpiece she would have discovered the truth and not put herself through this ordeal she wept accepting for the first time that harry was dead giles barrington when sir walter barrington visited his grandson to tell him the terrible news that harry clifton had been killed at sea giles felt numb as if hed lost a limb in fact he would have been happy to lose a limb if it would have brought harry back the two of them had been inseparable since childhood and giles had always assumed they would both score one of lifes centuries harrys pointless unnecessary death made giles even more determined not to make the same mistake himself giles was in the drawing room listening to mr churchill on the radio when emma asked do you have any plans to join up yes i shant be returning to oxford i intend to sign up immediately his mother was clearly surprised but told him that she understood emma gave him a huge hug and said harry would be proud of you grace who rarely displayed any emotion burst into tears giles drove into bristol the following morning and parked his yellow mg ostentatiously outside the front door of the recruiting office he marched in with what he hoped was resolution written across his face a sergeant major from the gloucesters captain jack tarrants old regiment stood smartly to attention the moment he saw young mr barrington he handed giles a form which he dutifully filled in and an hour later he was invited to step behind a curtain and be examined by an army doctor the doctor placed a tick in every box after hed thoroughly checked this latest recruit ears nose throat chest and limbs before finally testing his eyesight giles stood behind a white line and recited the letters and numbers on demand after all he could dispatch a leather ball coming straight at him at ninety miles an hour to the most distant boundary he was confident he would pass with flying colours until the doctor asked him if he was aware of any hereditary ailments or diseases in his family giles replied truthfully both my father and grandfather are colourblind the doctor carried out a further series of tests and giles noticed that the ums and ahs turned into tuttuts im sorry to have to tell you mr barrington he said when he came to the end of his examination that given your familys medical history i will not be able to recommend you for active service but of course theres nothing to stop you joining up and doing a desk job cant you just tick the relevant box doctor and forget i ever raised the damn subject said giles trying to sound desperate the doctor ignored his protest and in the final box on the form he wrote c unfit for active service giles was back at the manor house in time for lunch his mother elizabeth didnt comment on the fact that he drank almost a bottle of wine he told everyone who asked and several who didnt that hed been rejected by the gloucesters because he suffered from colourblindness it didnt stop grandfather fighting the boers grace reminded him after hed been served with a second helping of pudding they probably had no idea the condition existed back then said giles trying to make light of her barb emma followed up with a punch below the belt you never intended to sign up in the first place did you she said looking her brother in the eye giles was staring down at his shoes when she delivered the knockout blow pity your friend from the docks isnt here to remind you that he was also colourblind when giless mother heard the news she was clearly relieved but didnt comment grace didnt speak to her brother again before she returned to cambridge giles drove back to oxford the following day trying to convince himself that everyone would accept the reason hed been unable to sign up and intended to continue his life as an undergraduate when he strolled through the college gates he found that the quad resembled a recruiting centre rather than a university with young men in uniform outnumbering those wearing subfusc in giless opinion the only good thing to come out of all this was that for the first time in history there were as many women as men up at the university unfortunately most of them were only willing to be seen on the arm of someone in uniform giless old school friend deakins was one of the few undergraduates who didnt seem uncomfortable about not signing up mind you there wouldnt have been much point in deakins taking a medical it would have been one of the rare exams in which he failed to get a tick in any box but then he suddenly disappeared to somewhere called bletchley park no one could tell giles what they got up to there except it was all hushhush and deakins warned giles that he wouldnt be able to visit him at any time under any circumstances as the months passed giles began to spend more time alone in the pub than in the crowded lecture theatre while oxford began to fill up with servicemen returning from the front some with one arm others with one leg a few who were blind and they were just in his college he tried to carry on as if he hadnt noticed but the truth was by the end of term he began to feel more and more out of place giles drove up to scotland at the end of term to attend the christening of sebastian arthur clifton only the immediate family and one or two close friends were invited to the ceremony that took place in the chapel at mulgelrie castle emma and giless father was not among them giles was surprised and delighted when emma asked him to be a godfather although he was somewhat taken aback when she admitted that the only reason shed even considered him was that despite everything she had no doubt he would have been harrys first choice as he was going down to breakfast the following morning giles noticed a light coming from his grandfathers study as he passed the door on his way to the dining room giles heard his name come up in conversation he stopped in his tracks and took a step nearer to the halfopen door he froze in horror when he heard sir walter saying it pains me to have to say this but like father like son i agree replied lord harvey and id always thought so highly of the boy which makes the whole damn business all the more distasteful no one said sir walter could have been prouder than i was as chairman of the governors when giles was appointed head boy of bristol grammar school id assumed said lord harvey that he would put those remarkable talents of leadership and courage he displayed so often on the playing field to good use on the battlefield the only good thing to come out of all this suggested sir walter is that i no longer believe that harry clifton could possibly be hugos son giles strode across the hallway past the breakfast room and out of the front door he climbed into his car and began the long journey back to the west country the following morning he parked the car outside a recruiting office once again he stood in line not for the gloucesters this time but on the other side of the avon where the wessex regiment were signing up new recruits after hed filled in the form he was put through another rigorous medical this time when the doctor asked him are you aware of any hereditary ailments or diseases in your family that might prevent you from carrying out active service he replied no sir at noon the following day giles left one world and entered another thirtysix raw recruits with nothing in common other than the fact that they had signed up to take the kings shilling clambered aboard a train with a corporal acting as their nanny as the train pulled out of the station giles stared through the grimy thirdclass window and was certain of only one thing they were heading south but not until the train shunted into lympstone four hours later did he realize just how far south during the journey giles remained silent and listened attentively to all those men around him who would be his companions for the next twelve weeks a bus driver from filton a policeman from long ashton a butcher from broad street a builder from nailsea and a farmer from winscombe once they disembarked from the train the corporal ferried them on to a waiting bus where are we going asked the butcher youll find out soon enough laddie replied the corporal revealing his birthplace for an hour the bus trundled across dartmoor until there was no sign of houses or people just the occasional hawk flying overheard in search of prey they eventually stopped outside a desolate group of buildings displaying a weathered sign that announced ypres barracks training camp for the wessex regiment it didnt lift giless spirits a soldier marched out of the gatehouse and raised the barrier to allow the bus to continue for another hundred yards before coming to a halt in the middle of a parade ground a solitary figure stood waiting for them to disembark when giles climbed off the bus he came face to face with a giant of a man barrelchested and dressed in a khaki uniform who looked as if he had been planted on the parade ground there were three rows of medals on his chest and a pace stick under his left arm but what struck giles most about him was the knifeedge crease in his trousers and the fact that his boots were so highly polished he could see his reflection in them good afternoon gentlemen the man said in a voice that boomed around the parade ground not someone who would find any use for a megaphone thought giles my name is sergeant major dawson sir to you its my responsibility to turn you from a shambolic rabble into a fighting force in just twelve weeks by then you will be able to call yourselves members of the wessex the finest regiment of the line for the next twelve weeks i will be your mother your father and your sweetheart and let me assure you i only have one purpose in life and that is to make sure that when you meet your first german youll be able to kill him before he kills you that process will begin at five tomorrow morning a groan went up which the sergeant major ignored until then ill leave corporal mccloud to take you to the canteen before you settle into your barracks be sure to get a good nights rest because youll need every ounce of energy you possess when we meet again carry on corporal giles sat down in front of a fishcake whose ingredients had never seen salt water and after one sip of lukewarm brown water posing as tea he put his mug back on the table if youre not going to eat your fishcake can i have it asked the young man sitting next to him giles nodded and they swapped plates he didnt speak again until hed devoured giless offering i know your mum the man said giles gave him a closer look wondering how that could be possible we supply the meat for the manor house and barrington hall the man continued i like your mum he said very nice lady im bates by the way terry bates he shook giles firmly by the hand never thought id end up sitting next to you right chaps lets be avin you said the corporal the new recruits leapt up from the benches and followed the corporal out of the canteen and across the parade ground to a nissen hut with marne painted on the door another wessex battle honour the corporal explained before opening the door to reveal their new home thirtysix beds eighteen on each side had been crammed into a space no larger than the dining room at barrington hall giles had been placed between atkinson and bates not unlike prep school he thought though he did come across one or two differences during the next few days right chaps time to get undressed and have a kip long before the last man had climbed into bed the corporal switched off the lights and bellowed make sure you get some shuteye youve got a busy day ahead of you tomorrow it wouldnt have surprised giles if like fisher his old school prefect hed added no talking after lights out as promised the lights came back on at five oclock the following morning not that giles had a chance to look at his watch after sergeant major dawson entered the hut and bellowed the last man with both feet on the ground will be first to be bayoneted by a kraut a large number of feet quickly hit the floor as the sergeant major marched down the centre of the hut his pace stick banging the end of any bed whose incumbent still didnt have both feet on the ground now listen and listen carefully he continued im going to give you four minutes to wash and shave four minutes to make your bed four minutes to get dressed and eight minutes to have breakfast twenty minutes in all i dont recommend any talking on account of the fact you cant afford to waste the time and in any case im the only one whos allowed to talk is that understood it most certainly is said giles which was followed by a ripple of surprised laughter a moment later the sergeant major was standing in front of him whenever you open your mouth sonny he barked placing his pace stick on giless shoulder all i want to hear is yes sir no sir three bags full sir is that clear yes sir said giles i dont think i heard you sonny yes sir shouted giles thats better now get yourself in the washroom you horrible little man before i put you on jankers giles had no idea what jankers was but it didnt sound enticing bates was already on his way out of the washroom when giles walked in by the time hed shaved bates had made his bed dressed and was on his way to the canteen when giles eventually caught up with him he took a seat on the bench opposite how do you manage it asked giles in admiration manage what asked bates to be so wide awake when the rest of us are still half asleep simple really im a butcher like me dad up every mornin at four and off to the market if i want the best cuts i have to be waitin for them the moment theyre delivered from the docks or the station only have to be a few minutes late and im gettin second best half an hour late and its scragends and your mum wouldnt thank me for that would she giles laughed as bates leapt up and began heading back to the barracks only to discover that the sergeant major hadnt allowed any time for cleaning teeth most of the morning was spent fitting up the sprogs as they were referred to with uniforms one or two of which looked as if theyd had a previous owner berets belts boots tin hats blanco brasso and boot polish followed once they had been kitted out the recruits were taken on to the parade ground for their first drill session having served if somewhat inattentively in the schools combined cadet force giles started with a slight advantage but he had a feeling it wouldnt be too long before terry bates caught up with him at twelve they were marched off to the canteen giles was so hungry he ate almost everything on offer after lunch they returned to the barracks and changed into their gym kit before being herded across to the gymnasium giles silently thanked his prep school pt instructor for having taught him how to climb a rope how to balance on a beam and how to use the wall bars for stretching he couldnt help noticing that bates shadowed his every move the afternoon ended with a fivemile run across the devon moors only eight of the thirtysix raw recruits came back through the barracks gates at the same time as their gym instructor one even managed to get lost and a search party had to be sent out to look for him tea was followed by what the sergeant major described as recreation which for most of the lads turned out to be collapsing on their bunks and falling into a deep sleep at five the following morning the door to the barracks flew open once again and this time several pairs of feet were already on the ground before the sergeant major had switched the lights on breakfast was followed by another hour of marching on the parade ground and by now almost everyone was in step the new recruits then sat in a circle on the grass and learnt how to strip clean load and fire a rifle the corporal pulled a by through the barrel in one clean movement reminding them that the bullet doesnt know which side its on so give it every chance to leave the barrel from the front and kill the enemy and not backfire and kill you the afternoon was spent on the rifle range where the instructors taught each recruit to nestle the butt of the rifle firmly into their shoulder line up the foresight and rearsight with the centre circle of the target and squeeze the trigger gently never snatch at it this time giles thanked his grandfather for the hours spent on his grouse moor that ensured he kept hitting the bullseye the day ended with another fivemile run tea and recreation followed by lights out at ten most of the men had collapsed on their beds long before that wishing the sun would fail to rise the next morning or at least that the sergeant major would die in his sleep they didnt get lucky the first week felt like a month to giles but by the end of the second he was beginning to master the routine although he never once got to the washroom ahead of bates although he didnt enjoy basic training any more than the next man giles did relish the challenge of competition but he had to admit that as each day went by he was finding it more and more difficult to shake off the butcher from broad street bates was able to match him punch for punch in the boxing ring trade bullseyes on the rifle range and when they started wearing heavy boots and having to carry a rifle on the fivemile run the man who for years had been hauling carcasses of beef around on his shoulder morning noon and night suddenly became a lot harder to beat at the end of the sixth week no one was surprised that it was barrington and bates who were selected for promotion to lance corporal and each given a section of their own no sooner had they sewn on their stripes than the two sections they led became deadly rivals not just on the parade ground or in the gymnasium but whenever they went out on night ops or were involved in field exercises and troop movements at the end of each day like a couple of schoolboys giles and bates would both declare themselves the winner often the sergeant major would have to prise them apart as they approached the day of the passingout parade giles could sense the pride in both sections whod begun to believe they might just be worthy of calling themselves wessexions by the time they passed out although the sergeant major repeatedly warned them that it wouldnt be long before they had to take part in a real battle against a real enemy with real bullets he also reminded them that he wouldnt be around to hold their hands for the first time giles accepted that he was going to miss the damn man bring em on was all bates had to say on the subject when they finally passed out on the friday of the twelfth week giles assumed that he would be returning to bristol with the other lads to enjoy a weekends leave before reporting to the regimental depot the following monday but when he walked off the parade ground that afternoon the sergeant major took him to one side corporal barrington youre to report to major radcliffe immediately giles would have asked why but he knew he wouldnt get an answer he marched across the parade ground and knocked on the office door of the adjutant a man hed only ever seen at a distance enter said a voice giles walked in stood to attention and saluted barrington major radcliffe said after hed returned the salute i have some good news for you youve been accepted for officer training school giles didnt even realize he was being considered for a commission youll have to travel straight to mons tomorrow morning where you will begin an induction course on monday many congratulations and good luck thank you sir said giles before asking will bates be joining me bates said major radcliffe do you mean corporal bates yes sir good heavens no replied the adjutant hes not officer material giles could only hope that the germans were just as shortsighted when it came to selecting their officers when giles reported to the mons officer cadet training unit in aldershot the following afternoon he was unprepared for how quickly his life would change again it took him some time to get used to corporals sergeants even the sergeant major calling him sir he slept in a single room where the door didnt fly open at five in the morning with an nco banging the end of his bed with a stick demanding he place both feet on the ground the door only opened when giles chose to open it he had breakfast in the mess with a group of young men who didnt need to be taught how to hold a knife and fork although one or two of them looked as if they would never learn how to handle a rifle let alone fire it in anger but in a few weeks time these same men would be in the front line leading inexperienced volunteers whose lives would depend on their judgement giles joined these men in a classroom where they were taught military history geography map reading battle tactics german and the art of leadership if hed learnt one thing from the butcher from broad street it was that the art of leadership couldnt be taught eight weeks later the same young men stood on a passingout parade and were awarded the kings commission they were presented with two crowned pips one for each shoulder a brown leather officers cane and a letter of congratulations from a grateful king all giles wanted to do was to rejoin his regiment and team up with his old comrades but he knew that wouldnt be possible because when he walked off the parade ground that friday afternoon the corporals the sergeants and yes even the sergeant major saluted him sixty young second lieutenants left aldershot that afternoon for every corner of the land to spend a weekend with their families some of them for the last time giles spent most of saturday jumping on and off trains as he made his way back to the west country he arrived at the manor house just in time to join his mother for dinner when she first saw the young lieutenant standing in the hallway elizabeth made no attempt to hide her pride giles was disappointed that neither emma nor grace was at home to see him in uniform his mother explained that grace who was in her second term at cambridge rarely came home even during the vacation over a onecourse meal served by jenkins several of the staff were now serving on the frontline not at the dinner table his mother explained giles told his mother about what theyd got up to in training camp on dartmoor when she heard about terry bates she sighed bates and son they used to be the best butchers in bristol used to be every shop in broad street was razed to the ground so weve been deprived of bates the butcher those germans have a lot to answer for giles frowned and emma he asked couldnt be better except except repeated giles it was some time before his mother quietly added how much more convenient it would have been if emma had produced a daughter rather than a son why is that important asked giles as he refilled his glass his mother bowed her head but said nothing oh god said giles as the significance of her words sank in i had assumed that when harry died i would inherit im afraid you cant assume anything darling said his mother looking up that is not until it can be established that your father is not also harrys father until then under the terms of your greatgrandfathers will it will be sebastian who eventually inherits the title giles hardly spoke again during the meal while he tried to take in the significance of his mothers words once coffee had been served his mother said she felt tired and went to bed when giles climbed the stairs to his room a few moments later he couldnt resist dropping into the nursery to see his godson he sat alone with the heir to the barrington title sebastian gurgled in blissful sleep clearly untroubled by war and certainly not giving a thought to his grandfathers will or the significance of the words and all that therein is the following day giles joined his grandfathers for lunch at the savage club it was a very different atmosphere from the weekend theyd shared five months earlier at mulgelrie castle the only thing the two old men seemed keen to find out was where his regiment would be posted ive no idea replied giles who would like to have known himself but he would have given the same response even if he had been briefed despite the fact that these two venerable old gentlemen were boer war veterans lieutenant barrington rose early on the monday morning and after breakfast with his mother was driven by hudson to the headquarters of the st wessex regiment he was held up by a steady stream of armoured vehicles and lorries filled with troops pouring out of the main gate he got out of the car and walked to the guard house good morning sir said a corporal after giving him a crisp salute something giles still hadnt got used to the adjutant has requested that you report to his office as soon as you arrive id be happy to do so corporal said giles returning his salute if i knew where major radcliffes office was far side of the square sir green door you cant miss it giles marched across the square returning several more salutes before he reached the adjutants office major radcliffe looked up from behind his desk as giles entered the room ah barrington old chap good to see you again he said we werent certain if youd make it in time in time for what sir asked giles the regiments been posted abroad and the colonel felt you should be given the opportunity of joining us or staying behind and waiting for the next shindig where are we going sir havent a clue old chap way above my rank but i can tell you one thing for certain it will be a damn sight closer to the germans than bristol harry clifton harry would never forget the day lloyd was released from lavenham and although he wasnt disappointed to see him go he was surprised by maxs parting words would you do me a favour tom lloyd said as they shook hands for the last time im enjoying your diaries so much id like to go on reading them if youd send them to this address he said handing harry a card as if he were already on the outside ill return them to you within a week harry was flattered and agreed to send max each exercise book once hed completed it the following morning harry took his place behind the librarians desk but didnt consider reading the previous days newspaper before hed completed his duties he continued to update his diaries every evening and whenever he came to the end of a notebook he would post his latest efforts to max lloyd he was relieved and a little surprised when they were always returned as promised as the months passed harry began to accept the fact that prison life was mostly routine and mundane so when the warden charged into the library one morning brandishing his copy of the new york times he was taken by surprise harry put down the stack of books he had been replacing on the shelves do we have a map of the united states swanson demanded yes of course harry replied he walked quickly over to the reference section and extracted a copy of huberts map of america anywhere in particular warden he asked pearl harbor for the next twentyfour hours there was only one subject on everyones lips prisoners and guards alike when would america enter the war swanson returned to the library the following morning president roosevelt has just announced on the radio that the united states has declared war on japan thats all very well said harry but when will the americans help us defeat hitler harry regretted the word us the moment hed uttered it he looked up to find swanson staring at him quizzically and quickly returned to shelving the previous days books harry found out the answer some weeks later when winston churchill boarded the queen mary and sailed to washington to conduct discussions with the president by the time the prime minister had arrived back in britain roosevelt had agreed that the united states would turn their attention to the war in europe and the task of defeating nazi germany harry filled page after page of his diary with the reaction of his fellow prisoners to the news that their country was at war he concluded that most of them fell into one of two distinct categories the cowards and the heroes those who were relieved to be safely locked up in jail and only hoped the hostilities would be over long before they were released and those who couldnt wait to get out and take on an enemy they hated even more than the prison guards when harry asked his cellmate which category he fell into quinn replied have you ever met an irishman who didnt relish a scrap for his part harry became even more frustrated convinced that now the americans had entered the war it would be over long before hed been given the chance to play his part for the first time since being locked up he thought about trying to escape harry had just finished reading a book review in the new york times when an officer marched into the library and said the warden wants to see you in his office immediately bradshaw harry wasnt surprised although after glancing once again at the advertisement at the bottom of the page he still wondered how lloyd imagined he would get away with it he folded the paper neatly placed it back in the rack and followed the officer out of the room any idea why he wants to see me mr joyce harry asked as they walked across the yard dont ask me said joyce not attempting to hide his sarcasm ive never been one of the wardens confidants harry didnt speak again until they were standing outside the wardens office joyce gave a quiet tap on the door enter said an unmistakable voice joyce opened the door and harry walked into the room he was surprised to find another man hed never seen before seated opposite the warden the man was wearing an army officers uniform and looked as smart as harry felt unkempt he never took his eyes off the prisoner the warden rose from behind his desk good morning tom it was the first time swanson had addressed him by his christian name this is colonel cleverdon of the fifth texas rangers good morning sir said harry cleverdon stood up and shook hands with harry another first have a seat tom said swanson the colonel has a proposition he wants to put to you harry sat down its good to meet you bradshaw began colonel cleverdon as he sat back down im the commanding officer of rangers harry gave him a quizzical look you wont find us listed in any recruitment manuals i train groups of soldiers who will be dropped behind enemy lines with the purpose of causing as much mayhem for the enemy as possible so the infantry will have a better chance to do their job nobody knows yet where or when our troops will be landing in europe but ill be among the first to be told as my boys will be parachuted into the target area a few days before the invasion harry was sitting on the edge of his seat but before that balloon goes up ill be putting together a small specialist unit to prepare for any eventuality this unit will consist of three groups each comprising ten men one captain one staff sergeant two corporals and six private soldiers during the past few weeks ive been in touch with several prison wardens to ask if they had any exceptional men who they felt might be suited for such an operation your name was one of the two put forward by mr swanson once i checked your record from when you served in the navy i had to agree with the warden that youd be better off in uniform rather than wasting your time in here harry turned to the warden thank you sir but may i ask who the other person is quinn said swanson the two of you have caused me so many problems during the past couple of years i thought it was the germans turn to be subjected to your special brand of subterfuge harry smiled if you decide to join us bradshaw continued the colonel you will begin an eightweek basic training course immediately followed by a further six weeks with special operations before i go any further i need to know if the idea appeals to you when do i start said harry the colonel smiled my cars outside in the yard and i left the engine running ive already arranged for your civilian clothes to be collected from the stores said the warden obviously we need to keep the reason youve left at such short notice between ourselves should anyone ask ill say you and quinn have been transferred to another prison the colonel nodded any questions bradshaw has quinn agreed to join you asked harry hes sitting in the back seat of my car probably wondering whats taking you so long but you do know the reason im in prison colonel desertion said colonel cleverdon so ill have to keep a close eye on you wont i both men laughed youll be joining my group as a private soldier but i can assure you your past record wont hinder your chances of promotion however while were on that subject bradshaw a change of name might be appropriate given the circumstances we wouldnt want some smartass in records to get their hands on your navy files and start asking embarrassing questions any ideas harry clifton sir he said a little too quickly the warden smiled ive always wondered what your real name was emma barrington emma wanted to leave kristins apartment as soon as possible escape from new york and return to england once she was back in bristol she could grieve alone and devote her life to bringing up harrys son but escape wasnt proving to be that easy im so sorry said kristin placing an arm around emmas shoulders i had no idea you didnt know what had happened to tom emma smiled weakly i want you to know continued kristin that richard and i never doubted even for a moment that he was innocent the man i nursed back to life wasnt capable of murder thank you said emma i have some photographs of tom while he was with us on the kansas star would you like to see them asked kristin emma nodded politely although she had no interest in seeing any photographs of lieutenant thomas bradshaw she decided that once kristin had left the room she would quietly slip out of the apartment and return to her hotel she had no desire to continue making such a fool of herself in front of a complete stranger as soon as kristin went out emma jumped up as she did so she knocked her cup off the table and on to the floor spilling some coffee on the carpet she fell to her knees and began weeping again just as kristin came back into the room clutching a handful of photographs when she saw emma on her knees in tears she tried to comfort her please dont worry about the carpet its not important here why dont you look at these while i find something to clear it up she handed the photographs to emma and quickly left the room again emma accepted she could no longer make good her escape so she returned to her chair and reluctantly began to look at the photos of tom bradshaw oh my god she said out loud she stared in disbelief at a picture of harry standing on the deck of a ship with the statue of liberty in the background and then at another with the skyscrapers of manhattan as the backdrop tears came to her eyes once again even if she was unable to explain how it was possible she waited impatiently for kristin to return it wasnt long before the conscientious housewife reappeared knelt down and began to remove the small brown stain with a damp cloth do you know what happened to tom after he was arrested emma asked anxiously didnt anyone tell you asked kristin looking up apparently there wasnt enough evidence to try him for murder and jelks got him off he was charged with desertion from the navy pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years emma just didnt understand how harry could have ended up in jail for a crime he obviously hadnt committed did the trial take place in new york yes kristin replied as his lawyer was sefton jelks richard and i assumed he wasnt in need of any financial help im not sure i understand sefton jelks is the senior partner of one of new yorks most prestigious law practices so at least tom was being well represented when he came to see us about tom he seemed genuinely concerned i know he also visited dr wallace and the ships captain and he assured all of us that tom was innocent do you know which prison they sent him to emma asked quietly lavenham in upstate new york richard and i tried to visit him but mr jelks told us he didnt want to see anyone youve been so kind said emma perhaps i can ask one more small favour before i leave may i be allowed to keep one of these photographs keep them all richard took dozens he always does photography is his hobby i dont want to waste any more of your time said emma rising unsteadily to her feet youre not wasting my time kristin replied what happened to tom never made sense to either of us when you see him please pass on our best wishes she said as they walked out of the room and if hed like us to visit him wed be happy to thank you said emma as the chain was removed once again as kristin opened the door she said we both realized tom was desperately in love but he didnt tell us you were english emma switched on the bedside light and once again studied the photographs of harry standing on the deck of the kansas star he looked so happy so relaxed and clearly unaware what awaited him when he stepped ashore she drifted in and out of sleep as she tried to work out why harry would be willing to face a murder trial and would plead guilty to desertion from a navy hed never signed up for she concluded that only sefton jelks could provide the answers the first thing she needed to do was make an appointment to see him she glanced again at the bedside clock she got out of bed put on a dressing gown sat down at the little table and filled several sheets of hotel stationery with notes in preparation for her meeting with sefton jelks it felt like prepping for an exam at six she showered and dressed then went downstairs to breakfast a copy of the new york times had been left on her table and she quickly turned the pages only stopping to read one article the americans were becoming pessimistic about britain being able to survive a german invasion which was looking increasingly likely above a photograph of winston churchill standing on the white cliffs of dover staring defiantly out across the channel his trademark cigar in place was the headline we will fight them on the beaches emma felt guilty about being away from her homeland she must find harry get him released from prison and together they would return to bristol the hotel receptionist looked up jelks myers abernathy in the manhattan telephone directory wrote out an address on wall street and handed it to emma the cab dropped her outside a vast steel and glass building that stretched high into the sky she pushed through the revolving doors and checked a large board on the wall that listed the names of every firm on the fortyeight floors jelks myers abernathy was located on floors and all enquiries at reception on the twentieth floor emma joined a horde of greyflannelsuited men who filled the first available elevator when she stepped out on the twentieth floor she was greeted by the sight of three smart women dressed in openneck white blouses and black skirts who sat behind a reception desk something else she hadnt seen in bristol she marched confidently up to the desk id like to see mr jelks do you have an appointment the receptionist asked politely no admitted emma whod only ever dealt with a local solicitor who was always available whenever a member of the barrington family dropped in the receptionist looked surprised clients didnt just turn up at the front desk hoping to see the senior partner they either wrote or their secretary phoned to make an appointment in mr jelkss crowded diary if i could take your name ill have a word with his assistant emma barrington please have a seat miss barrington someone will be with you shortly emma sat alone in a little alcove shortly turned out to be more than half an hour when another greysuited man appeared carrying a yellow pad my name is samuel anscott he said offering his hand i understand that you wish to see the senior partner that is correct im his legal assistant said anscott as he took the seat opposite her mr jelks has asked me to find out why you want to see him its a private matter said emma im afraid he wont agree to see you unless im able to tell him what its about emma pursed her lips im a friend of harry clifton she watched anscott closely but it was obvious that the name meant nothing to him although he did make a note of it on his yellow pad i have reason to believe that harry clifton was arrested for the murder of adam bradshaw and that mr jelks represented him this time the name did register and the pen moved more swiftly across the pad i wish to see mr jelks in order to find out how a lawyer of his standing could have allowed my fiancé to take thomas bradshaws place a deep frown appeared on the young mans face he clearly wasnt used to anyone referring to his boss in this way i have no idea what youre talking about miss barrington he said which emma suspected was true but i will brief mr jelks and come back to you perhaps you could give me a contact address im staying at the mayflower hotel said emma and im available to see mr jelks at any time anscott made another note on his pad stood up gave a curt nod but this time didnt offer to shake hands emma felt confident that she wouldnt have to wait long before the senior partner agreed to see her she took a taxi back to the mayflower hotel and could hear the phone ringing in her room even before shed opened the door she ran across the room but by the time she picked up the receiver the line had gone dead she sat down at the desk and began to write to her mother to say shed arrived safely although she didnt mention the fact that she was now convinced harry was alive emma would only do that when shed seen him in the flesh she was on the third page of the letter when the phone rang again she picked it up good afternoon miss barrington good afternoon mr anscott she said not needing to be told who it was ive spoken to mr jelks concerning your request for a meeting but im afraid hes unable to see you because it would create a conflict of interest with another client he represents he is sorry not to be more helpful the line went dead emma remained at the desk stunned still clutching the phone the words conflict of interest ringing in her ears was there really another client and if so who could it be or was that just an excuse not to see her she placed the receiver back in its cradle and sat still for some time wondering what her grandfather would have done in these circumstances she recalled one of his favourite maxims theres more than one way to skin a cat emma opened the desk drawer thankful to find a fresh supply of stationery and made a list of people who might be able to fill in some of the gaps created by mr jelkss supposed conflict of interest she then went downstairs to reception knowing that she was going to be fully occupied for the next few days the receptionist tried to hide her surprise when the softly spoken young lady from england asked for the address of a courthouse a police station and a prison before she left the mayflower emma dropped into the hotels shop and purchased a yellow pad of her own she walked out on to the pavement and hailed another cab it dropped her in a very different part of town to the one mr jelks inhabited as she climbed the courthouse steps emma thought about harry and how he must have felt when hed entered that same building in very different circumstances she asked the guard on the door where the reference library was in the hope of finding out what those circumstances were if you mean the records room miss its in the basement the guard said after walking down two flights of stairs emma asked a clerk behind the counter if she could see the records for the case of the state of new york v bradshaw the clerk handed her a form to fill in which included the question are you a student to which she answered yes a few minutes later emma was handed three large box files we close in a couple hours she was warned when the bell goes you must return the records to this desk immediately once emma had read a few pages of documents she couldnt understand why the state hadnt proceeded with tom bradshaws trial for murder when they seemed to have such a strong case against him the brothers had been sharing a hotel room the whiskey decanter had toms bloody fingerprints all over it and there was no suggestion anyone else had entered the room before adams body had been found lying in a pool of blood but worse why had tom fled the scene of the crime and why had the state attorney settled for a guilty plea on the lesser charge of desertion even more puzzling was how harry had ever become involved in the first place might the letter on maisies mantelpiece contain the answers to all these questions or was it simply that jelks knew something he didnt want her to find out her thoughts were interrupted by a clanging bell demanding that she return the files to the desk some questions had been answered but far more remained unanswered emma made a note of two names she hoped could supply most of those answers but would they also claim a conflict of interest she emerged from the courthouse just after five clutching several more sheets of paper covered in her neat longhand she grabbed something called a hershey bar and a coke from a street vendor before she hailed another cab and asked the driver to take her to the th precinct police station she ate and drank on the move something her mother would never have approved of on arrival at the police station emma asked to speak to either detective kolowski or detective ryan theyre both on nights this week she was told by the desk sergeant so wont be back on duty until ten emma thanked him and decided to return to the hotel and have supper before going back to the th precinct at ten after a caesar salad and her first knickerbocker glory emma returned to her room on the fourth floor she lay down on the bed and thought about what she needed to ask kolowski or ryan assuming either of them agreed to see her did lieutenant bradshaw have an american accent emma fell into a deep sleep to be jolted back to consciousness by the unfamiliar sound of a police siren blaring from the street below now she understood why the rooms on the upper floors were more expensive she checked her watch it was damn she cursed as she leapt off the bed ran to the bathroom soaked a flannel under the cold tap and covered her face she quickly left the room and took the lift to the ground floor when she stepped out of the hotel she was surprised to find the street was just as busy and the pavement every bit as crowded as it had been at midday she hailed another cab and asked the driver to take her back to the th precinct the new york cabbies were beginning to understand her or was she beginning to understand them she climbed the steps to the police station a few minutes before two another desk sergeant asked her to take a seat and promised to let kolowski or ryan know she was waiting in reception emma settled down for a long wait but to her surprise a couple of minutes later she heard the desk sergeant say hey karl theres some lady sitting over there who says she wants to see you he gestured in emmas direction detective kolowski a coffee in one hand a cigarette in the other walked across and gave emma a half smile she wondered how quickly that smile would disappear when he discovered why she wanted to see him how can i help you maam he asked my name is emma barrington she said exaggerating her english accent and i need to seek your advice on a private matter then lets go to my office miss barrington kolowski said and began to walk down a corridor until he came to a door which he kicked open with the heel of his shoe have a seat he said pointing to the only other chair in the room can i get you a coffee he asked as emma sat down no thank you a wise decision maam he said as he placed his mug on the table lit his cigarette and sat down so how can i help i understand that you were one of the detectives who arrested my fiancé whats his name thomas bradshaw she was right the look the voice the demeanour everything about him changed yes i was and i can tell you maam it was an open and shut case until sefton jelks became involved but the case never came to trial emma reminded him only because bradshaw had jelks as his lawyer if that guy had defended pontius pilate he would have convinced the jury that he was simply assisting a young carpenter who wanted to buy some nails for a cross he was working on are you suggesting that jelks no said kolowski sarcastically before emma could finish her sentence i always thought it was a coincidence that the da was coming up for reelection that year and some of jelkss clients were among his biggest campaign contributors anyway he continued after exhaling a long cloud of smoke bradshaw ended up getting six years for desertion when the precincts sweepstakes had him down for eighteen months two years tops what are you suggesting asked emma that the judge accepted bradshaw was guilty kolowski paused and blew out another cloud of smoke before adding of murder i agree with you and the judge said emma tom bradshaw probably was guilty of murder kolowski looked surprised but did the man you arrested ever tell you that youd made a mistake and that he wasnt tom bradshaw but harry clifton the detective gave emma a closer look and thought for a moment he did say something like that early on but jelks must have told him that it wouldnt fly because he never mentioned it again would you be interested mr kolowski if i was able to prove that it would fly no maam said kolowski firmly that case was closed a long time ago your fiancé is doin six years for a crime he pleaded guilty to and ive got too much work on my desk he placed a hand on a stack of files to be reopening old wounds now unless you got anything else i can help you with will they allow me to visit tom at lavenham i cant see why not said kolowski write to the warden hell send you a visiting order after youve filled it in and sent it back theyll give you a date it shouldnt take more than six to eight weeks but i havent got six weeks protested emma i need to return to england in a couple of weeks time isnt there anything i can do to speed up the process thats only possible on compassionate grounds said the detective and thats limited to wives and parents what about the mother of the prisoners child countered emma in new york maam that gives you the same rights as a wife as long as you can prove it emma produced two photos from her handbag one of sebastian and one of harry standing on the deck of the kansas star thats good enough for me said kolowski handing back the picture of harry without commenting if you promise to leave me in peace ill speak to the warden and see if anything can be done thank you said emma how do i reach you im staying at the mayflower hotel ill be in touch said kolowski making a note but i dont want you to be in any doubt maam that tom bradshaw killed his brother im sure of it and i dont want you to be in any doubt officer that the man locked up in lavenham is not tom bradshaw im sure of that emma placed the photographs back in her bag and rose to leave a frown appeared on the detectives face as she walked out of the room emma returned to her hotel undressed and went straight back to bed she lay awake wondering if kolowski might be having second thoughts about whether hed arrested the right man she still couldnt work out why jelks had allowed harry to be sentenced to six years when it would have been so easy for him to prove that harry wasnt tom bradshaw she finally fell asleep grateful not to be woken by any nocturnal visitors the phone rang when she was in the bathroom but by the time shed picked it up there was only a dial tone the second call came just as she was closing the door of her room on her way down to breakfast she dashed back inside and grabbed the phone to hear a voice she recognized on the other end of the line good morning officer kolowski she replied the news isnt good said the detective who didnt deal in small talk she collapsed on to the bed fearing the worst i spoke to the warden of lavenham just before i came off duty and he told me that bradshaw has made it clear he doesnt want any visitors no exceptions it seems that mr jelks has issued an order that hes not even to be informed when someone asks to see him couldnt you try to get a message to him somehow begged emma im sure that if he knew it was me not a hope lady said kolowski you have no idea how far jelkss tentacles reach he can overrule a prison warden a prison warden is small fry the da and half the judges in new york are under his thumb just dont tell anyone i said so the line went dead emma didnt know how much time had passed before she heard a knock on the door who could it possibly be the door opened and a friendly face peered in can i clean the room miss asked a woman pushing a trolley ill only be a couple of minutes said emma she checked her watch and was surprised to find it was ten past ten she needed to clear her head before she could consider her next move and decided to take a long walk in central park she strolled around the park before making a decision the time had come to visit her greataunt and seek her advice about what she should do next emma headed off in the direction of th and park and was so deep in thought about how she was going to explain to greataunt phyllis why she hadnt visited her earlier that what she saw didnt fully register she stopped turned and retraced her steps checking every window until she reached doubledays a pyramid of books dominated the centre window alongside a photograph of a man with slickedback black hair and a pencil moustache he was smiling out at her the diary of a convict my time at lavenham maximum security prison by max lloyd the author of the runaway bestseller will be signing books in this store at pm on thursday dont miss this opportunity to meet the author giles barrington giles had no idea where the regiment was going for days he seemed to be perpetually on the move never able to sleep for more than a couple of hours at a time first he boarded a train followed by a truck before he climbed up the gangway of a troop carrier that ploughed through the ocean waves at its own pace until it finally disgorged soldiers from the wessex at the egyptian port of alexandria on the north african coast during the voyage giles had been reunited with his chums from ypres camp on dartmoor who he had to accept were now under his command one or two of them bates in particular didnt find it easy to call him sir and found it even more difficult to salute him every time they bumped into each other a convoy of army vehicles awaited the wessex regiment as they disembarked from the ship giles had never experienced such intense heat and his fresh khaki shirt was soaked in sweat within moments of him stepping on foreign soil he quickly organized his men into three groups before they climbed on board the waiting trucks the convoy progressed slowly along a narrow dusty coastal road not stopping for several hours until they finally reached the outskirts of a badly bombed town that bates announced in a loud voice tobruk told you so and money began to change hands once theyd entered the town the convoy dropped the men at various points giles and the other officers jumped off outside the majestic hotel which had been requisitioned by the wessex as their company hq giles pushed his way through the revolving doors and quickly discovered there wasnt much majestic about the hotel makeshift offices had been crammed into every available space charts and maps were pinned on walls where paintings had once hung and the plush red carpet that welcomed vips from all over the world had worn thin with the continual tramping of studded boots the reception area was the only feature to remind them this might once have been a hotel a duty corporal checked off second lieutenant barringtons name on a long list of new arrivals room twoonenine he said handing him an envelope youll find everything you need in there sir giles strode up the wide staircase to the second floor and let himself into the room he sat on the bed opened the envelope and read his orders at seven oclock he was to report to the ballroom when the colonel of the regiment would address all officers giles unpacked his suitcase took a shower put on a clean shirt and went back downstairs he grabbed a sandwich and a cup of tea from the officers mess and made his way to the ballroom just before seven the large room with its high imperial ceiling and magnificent chandeliers was already filled with boisterous officers who were being reunited with old friends and introduced to new ones as they waited to find out which square on the chessboard they would be moved to giles caught a glimpse of a young lieutenant on the far side of the room whom he thought he recognized but then lost sight of him at one minute to seven lieutenant colonel robertson marched up on to the stage and everyone else in the room quickly fell silent and sprang to attention he stopped in the centre of the stage and waved the men down feet apart hands on hips he began to address them gentlemen it must seem strange to you to have travelled from all parts of the empire to do battle with the germans in north africa however field marshal rommel and his afrika korps are also here with the purpose of maintaining a supply of oil for their troops in europe it is our responsibility to send him back to berlin with a bloody nose long before their last tank has run out of petrol cheers erupted around the hall accompanied by the stamping of feet general wavell has granted the wessex the privilege of defending tobruk and i have told him that we will all sacrifice our lives before rommel books a suite at the majestic hotel this was greeted with even louder cheers and more stamping of feet now i want you all to report to your company commanders who will brief you on our overall plan to defend the town and the responsibilities each of you will be expected to carry out gentlemen we havent a moment to waste good luck and happy hunting the officers all sprang to attention again as the colonel left the stage giles checked his orders once more hed been allocated to platoon c company which was to meet in the hotel library following the colonels address for a briefing by major richards you must be barrington said the major when giles walked into the library a few minutes later giles saluted it was good of you to join us so soon after being commissioned ive put you in charge of seven platoon as understudy to your old friend you will have three sections of twelve men and your responsibility will be to patrol the west perimeter of the city you will have a sergeant and three corporals to assist you the lieutenant will brief you on the finer details as you were at school together you wont have to spend too much time getting to know each other giles wondered who it could be and then he recalled the familiar lone figure on the other side of the ballroom second lieutentant giles barrington would have liked to give lieutenant fisher the benefit of the doubt although he would never be able to erase the memory of him as a prefect at st bedes when he thrashed harry every night during his first week for no reason other than that he was a dockers son its good to catch up with you barrington after such a long time said fisher i cant see any reason why we shouldnt work well together can you he obviously also recalled his treatment of harry clifton giles managed a weak smile weve got over thirty men under our command along with three corporals and a sergeant some of them youll remember from your days at training camp in fact ive already put corporal bates in charge of number one section terry bates corporal bates repeated fisher never use a christian name when youre referring to the other ranks in the mess and when were on our own giles you can call me alex but never in front of the men im sure you understand you always were an arrogant little shit and clearly nothing has changed thought giles this time he didnt smile now its our responsibility to patrol the western perimeter of the town in fourhour watches dont underestimate the importance of our task because if rommel does attack tobruk intelligence is that hell try and enter the city from the west so we have to remain vigilant at all times ill leave it to you to fix the rotas i usually manage a couple of shifts a day but i cant do a lot more because of my other responsibilities like what giles wanted to ask him giles enjoyed patrolling the west side of the town with his men and quickly got to know all thirtysix of them not least because corporal bates kept him so well informed and although he tried to keep them on perpetual alert following fishers warning as the weeks passed without incident he began to wonder if theyd ever come face to face with the enemy it was on a hazy evening in early april when all three of giless patrols were out on an exercise that a volley of bullets came from nowhere the men instantly hit the ground and quickly crawled to the nearest building to find whatever cover they could giles had been with the leading section when the germans presented their calling card then fired off a second volley the bullets fell nowhere near their target but he knew it wouldnt be long before the enemy identified his position dont fire until i say so he ordered as he slowly scanned the horizon with his binoculars he decided to brief fisher before he made a move he picked up the field phone and got an immediate response how many of them are there do you think fisher asked id guess no more than seventy at most eighty if you bring forward number two and three sections that should be more than enough to hold them off until reinforcements arrive a third volley followed but after giles had scanned the horizon he once again gave the order hold your fire ill send up two section under sergeant harris to support you said fisher and if you keep me briefed ill decide whether to join you with three section the phone went dead a fourth volley quickly followed the third and this time when giles focused his binoculars he could see a dozen men crawling across the open ground towards them take aim but dont fire until the target is in range and make sure every bullet counts bates was the first to squeeze his trigger got you he said as a german collapsed into the desert sand as he reloaded he added thatll teach you to bomb broad street shut up bates and concentrate said giles sorry sir giles continued to scan the horizon he could see two possibly three men whod been hit and were lying face down in the sand a few yards from their dugouts he gave the order to fire another volley and giles watched as several more germans scampered back to safety like ants scurrying down a hole cease fire shouted giles aware that they couldnt afford to waste precious ammunition he looked to his left and could see section already in position under sergeant harris awaiting their orders he picked up the field phone and fisher came back on the line my ammunition wont last much longer sir my left flanks now covered by sergeant harris but my right flanks exposed if you were able to come forward wed have a better chance of holding them off now that youve got two section to strengthen your position barrington id better stay back and cover you in case they break through another volley of bullets flew in their direction the germans had clearly worked out exactly where they were positioned but giles still instructed his two sections to hold fire he cursed put down the phone and ran across the open gap to join sergeant harris a volley followed his trouble what do you think sergeant its a halfcompany sir about eighty men in all but i think theyre just a reconnaissance party so all we have to do is bed down and be patient i agree said giles what do you think theyll do the krauts will know that they outnumber us so theyll want to mount an attack before any reinforcements arrive if lieutenant fisher brought up three section to cover our right flank it would strengthen our position i agree repeated giles as another volley greeted them ill go back and speak to fisher await my orders giles zigzagged across the open terrain this time the bullets were a little too close to risk that trick again he was just about to call fisher when the field phone rang he grabbed it barrington said fisher i believe the time has come for us to take the initiative giles needed to repeat fishers words to be sure hed heard them correctly you want me to lead an attack on the germans position while you bring forward three section to cover me if we do that said bates wed be like sitting ducks on a rifle range shut up bates yes sir sergeant harris thinks and i agree with him continued giles that if you bring up three section to cover our right flank the germans will have to mount an attack and then we could im not interested in what sergeant harris thinks said fisher i give the orders and youll carry them out is that clear yes sir giles said as he slammed down the phone i could always kill him sir said bates giles ignored him as he loaded his pistol and attached six hand grenades to his webbed belt he stood up so that both platoons could see him and said in a loud voice fix bayonets and prepare to advance he then stepped out from behind his cover and shouted follow me as giles began to run across the deep scorching sand with sergeant harris and corporal bates only a stride behind him he was greeted with yet another volley of bullets and wondered how long he would survive against such overwhelming odds with forty yards still to cover he could see exactly where the three enemy dugouts were situated he snatched a hand grenade from his belt removed the pin and tossed it towards the centre dugout as if he was returning a cricket ball from the deep boundary into the wicketkeepers gloves it landed just above the stumps giles saw two men fly into the air while another fell back he swung round and hurled a second grenade to his left a definite runout because the enemys firepower suddenly dried up the third grenade took out a machine gun as giles charged on he could see the men who had him in their sights he took his pistol out of its holster and began to fire as if he was on a shooting range but this time the bullseyes were human beings one two three went down and then giles saw a german officer lining him up in his sights the german pulled the trigger just a moment too late and collapsed on the ground in front of him giles felt sick when he was only a yard from the dugout a young german dropped his rifle on the ground while another threw his arms high into the air giles stared into the desperate eyes of the defeated men he didnt need to speak german to know they didnt want to die cease fire screamed giles as what was left of and sections quickly overwhelmed the enemy positions round them up and disarm them sergeant harris he added then turned back to see harris head down in the sand blood trickling out of his mouth only yards from the dugout giles stared back across the open terrain they had crossed and tried not to count the number of soldiers who had sacrificed their lives because of one mans weak decision stretcher bearers were already removing the dead bodies from the battlefield corporal bates line up the enemy prisoners in threes and march them back to camp yes sir said bates sounding as if he meant it a few minutes later giles and his depleted band headed back across the open ground they had covered about fifty yards when giles saw fisher running towards him with section following in his wake right barrington ill take over he shouted you bring up the rear follow me he ordered as he led the captured german soldiers triumphantly back towards the town by the time they reached the majestic hotel a small crowd had gathered to cheer them fisher returned the salutes of his brother officers barrington see that the prisoners are interned then take the lads off to the canteen for a drink theyve earned it meanwhile ill report to major richards can i kill him sir asked bates when giles came down for breakfast the following morning several officers some of whom hed never spoken to before went out of their way to shake hands with him as he strolled into the mess several heads turned and smiled in his direction which he found slightly embarrassing he grabbed a bowl of porridge two boiled eggs and an outofdate copy of punch he sat alone hoping to be left in peace but a few moments later three australian officers he didnt recognize joined him he turned a page of punch and laughed at an eh shepard cartoon of hitler retreating from calais on a penny farthing an incredible act of courage said the australian on his right giles could feel himself turning red i agree said a voice from the other side of the table quite remarkable giles wanted to leave before they what did you say the fellows name was giles took a spoonful of porridge fisher giles nearly choked it seems that fisher against all odds led his platoon over open terrain and with only hand grenades and a pistol took out three dugouts full of german soldiers unbelievable said another voice at least giles could agree with that and is it true that he killed a hun officer and then took fifty of the bastards prisoner with only twelve men to back him up giles removed the top of his first boiled egg it was hard it must be true said another voice because hes been promoted to captain giles sat and stared at the yolk of his egg im told hell be recommended for a military cross thats the least he deserves the least he deserved thought giles was what bates had recommended anyone else involved in the action asked the voice from the other side of the table yes his second in command but im damned if i can remember his name giles had heard enough and decided to let fisher know exactly what he thought of him leaving his second egg untouched he marched out of the mess and headed straight for the ops room he was so angry that he barged in without knocking the moment he entered the room he sprang to attention and saluted i do apologize sir he said i had no idea you were here this is mr barrington colonel said fisher youll remember that i told you he assisted me in yesterdays action ah yes barrington good show you may not have seen company orders this morning but youve been promoted to full lieutenant and having read captain fishers report i can tell you that youll also be mentioned in dispatches many congratulations giles said fisher well deserved indeed said the colonel and while youre here barrington i was just saying to captain fisher now that hes identified rommels preferred route into tobruk well need to double our patrols on the west side of the city and deploy a full squadron of tanks to back you up he jabbed the map spread out on the table with his finger here here and here i hope you both agree i do sir said fisher ill set about getting the platoon in place immediately cant be too soon said the colonel because i have a feeling it wont be long before rommel returns and this time he wont be on a reconnaissance mission but leading the full force of the afrika korps we must be lying in wait and be sure that he walks straight into our trap well be ready for him sir said fisher good because im putting you in charge of our new patrols fisher barrington you will remain second in command ill have my report on your desk by midday sir said fisher good show fisher ill leave you to work out the details thank you sir said fisher standing to attention and saluting as the colonel left the room giles was about to speak but fisher quickly jumped in ive put in a recommendation that sergeant harris should be awarded a posthumous military medal and corporal bates should also be mentioned in dispatches i hope youll support me am i also to understand that youve been put up for a military cross asked giles thats not in my hands old fellow but im happy to go along with whatever the commanding officer sees fit now lets get down to business with six patrols now under our command i propose that we after what had become known by and sections as fishers fantasy everyone from the colonel downwards was on red alert two platoons patrolled the western edge of the town one on one off night and day no longer wondering if only when rommel would appear over the horizon at the head of his afrika korps even fisher in his newly elevated state as hero had to appear occasionally on the outer perimeter if simply to maintain the myth of his heroic deed but only long enough to be sure everyone had seen him he would then report back to the tank squadron commander three miles to the rear and set up his field phones the desert fox chose april th to begin his assault on tobruk the british and australians couldnt have fought more bravely when defending the perimeter against the german onslaught but as the months passed and supplies of food and ammunition began to run low few doubted though it was never voiced that it could only be a matter of time before the sheer size of rommels army would overwhelm them it was a friday morning just as the desert haze was clearing that lieutenant barrington scanned the horizon with his binoculars and focused on rows and rows of german tanks shit he said he grabbed the field phone as a shell hit the building he and his men had selected as their observation post fisher came on the other end of the line i can see forty possibly fifty tanks heading towards us giles told him and what looks like a full regiment of soldiers to back them up permission to withdraw my men to a more secure position where we can regroup and take up battle formation hold your ground said fisher and once the enemys within range engage them engage them said giles what with bows and arrows this isnt agincourt fisher ive got barely a hundred men facing a regiment of tanks with nothing more than rifles to protect ourselves for gods sake fisher allow me to decide whats best for my men hold your ground repeated fisher and engage the enemy when they come within range thats an order giles slammed the phone down for some reason best known to himself said bates that man doesnt want you to survive you should have let me shoot him another shell hit the building while masonry and rubble began to fall around them giles no longer needed binoculars to see just how many tanks were advancing towards them and to accept that he only had moments left to live take aim he suddenly thought of sebastian who would inherit the family title if the boy turned out to be half as good as harry had been the barrington dynasty need have no fear for its future the next shell hit the building behind them and giles could clearly see a german soldier returning his stare from the turret of his tank fire as the building began to collapse around him giles thought about emma grace his father his mother his grandfathers and the next shell brought the entire edifice crashing down giles looked up to see a large piece of masonry falling falling falling he leapt on top of bates who was still firing at an advancing tank the last image giles saw was harry swimming to safety emma barrington emma sat alone in her hotel room reading the diary of a convict from cover to cover she didnt know who max lloyd was but she was sure of one thing he wasnt the author only one man could have written this book she recognized so many familiar phrases and lloyd hadnt even bothered to change all the names unless of course he had a girlfriend called emma whom he still adored emma turned the last page just before midnight and decided to make a phone call to someone who would still be at work just one more favour she begged when his voice came on the line try me he said i need the name of max lloyds parole officer max lloyd the author no less im not even going to ask why she began to read the book a second time making pencil notes in the margin but long before the new deputy librarian had started she had fallen asleep she woke around five the next morning and didnt stop reading until a prison officer entered the library and said lloyd the warden wants to see you emma took a long lazy bath and considered the fact that all the information shed been trying so hard to discover had been available for a dollar fifty from any bookstore once she was dressed she went down to breakfast and picked up a copy of the new york times she was taken by surprise as she turned the pages to come across a review of the diary of a convict we should be grateful to mr lloyd for bringing to our attention what is happening in our prisons today lloyd is a gifted writer with real talent and we must hope that now hes been released he will not put down his pen he never picked it up in the first place thought emma indignantly as she signed her bill before going back up to her room she asked the receptionist to recommend a good restaurant near doubledays bookstore the brasserie madam it has a firstclass reputation would you like me to book a table for you yes please said emma id like a table for one at lunch today and another for two this evening the receptionist was quickly learning not to be surprised by the lady from england emma returned to her room and settled down to read the diary once more she was puzzled why the narrative opened with harrys arrival at lavenham despite the fact that there were several references scattered throughout the book which suggested that his previous experiences had also been recorded even if they hadnt been seen by the publisher and certainly not the public in fact this convinced emma that there had to be another notebook in existence which would not only describe harrys arrest and trial but might explain why he had put himself through such an ordeal when a lawyer of mr jelkss standing must have known that he was not tom bradshaw after reading marked pages of the diaries for a third time emma decided another long stroll in the park was required as she walked up lexington avenue she dropped into bloomingdales and placed an order that she was assured would be ready for collection by three oclock in bristol the same order would have taken a fortnight as she walked through the park a plan was beginning to form in her mind but she needed to return to doubledays and take a closer look at the stores layout before she could apply the finishing touches when she walked into the bookstore the staff were already preparing for the author signing a table was in place and a ropedoff area showed clearly where the line should form the poster in the window now had a bold red banner across it declaring today emma selected a gap between two rows of shelves from which she would have a clear view of lloyd while he was signing and would be able to observe her prey while setting him a trap she left doubledays just before pm and made her way across fifth avenue to the brasserie a waiter showed her to a table that would never have been considered acceptable by either of her grandfathers but the meal was as promised first class and when the bill was presented she took a deep breath and left a large tip ive booked a table for this evening she said to the waiter would it be possible to be seated in an alcove the waiter looked doubtful until emma produced a dollar bill which seemed to remove any doubt she was getting the hang of how things worked in america whats your name emma asked as she passed him the note jimmy the waiter replied and another thing jimmy yes maam may i keep a copy of the menu of course maam on the way back to the mayflower emma called in at bloomingdales and picked up her order she smiled when the clerk showed her an example of the card i hope its satisfactory madam couldnt be better said emma once she was back in her room she went over her prepared questions again and again and after deciding on the best possible order she pencilled them neatly on to the back of the menu exhausted she lay down on the bed and fell into a deep sleep when the persistent ringing of the phone woke her it was already dark outside she checked her watch pm damn she said as she picked up the phone i know the feeling said a voice on the other end of the line even if that wasnt the fourletter word i would have chosen emma laughed the name youre looking for is brett elders i didnt tell you thank you said emma ill try not to bother you again i wish said the detective and the line went dead emma wrote the name brett elders neatly in pencil at the top righthand corner of the menu she would like to have taken a quick shower and changed her clothes but she was already running late and she couldnt afford to miss him she grabbed the menu and three of the cards stuffing them into her bag she then dashed out of the door and down the staircase not waiting for the elevator she hailed a cab and leapt into the back doubledays on fifth she said and make it snappy oh no emma thought as the taxi sped away whats happening to me emma entered the crowded bookstore and took her chosen spot between politics and religion from where she could observe max lloyd at work he was signing each book with a flourish basking in the glow of his adoring fans emma knew it should have been harry sitting there receiving the accolades did he even know his work had been published would she find out tonight as it turned out she neednt have rushed because lloyd went on signing his runaway bestseller for another hour until the line began to dwindle he was taking longer and longer with each message in the hope that it might entice others to join the queue as he was chatting expansively to the last customer in the line emma deserted her post and strolled across and how is your dear mother the customer was asking effusively very well thank you said lloyd no longer having to work in a hotel he added following the success of my book the customer smiled and emma dare i ask were going to be married in the fall said lloyd after hed signed her copy are we indeed thought emma oh im so glad said the customer she sacrificed so much for you do give her my best wishes why dont you turn around and do it in person emma wanted to say i most certainly will said lloyd as he handed her the book and gave her his backcover smile emma stepped forward and handed a card to lloyd he studied it for a moment before the same smile reappeared a fellow agent he said standing to greet her emma shook his outstretched hand and somehow managed to return his smile yes she said and several publishers in london are showing considerable interest in the rights to your book of course if youve already signed a contract or are represented by another agent in england i wouldnt want to waste your time no no dear lady im very happy to consider any proposal you might have then perhaps you would join me for dinner so we can talk further i think theyre expecting me to have dinner with them whispered lloyd waving an expansive hand in the direction of some of the members of the doubleday staff what a pity said emma im flying to la tomorrow to visit hemingway then ill have to disappoint them wont i said lloyd im sure theyll understand good shall we meet at the brasserie then when youve finished signing youll do well to get a table at such short notice i dont think that will be a problem said emma before one last customer stepped forward still hoping to get a signature ill look forward to seeing you later mr lloyd max please emma made her way out of the bookstore and walked across fifth avenue to the brasserie this time she wasnt kept waiting jimmy she said as the waiter accompanied her to an alcove table i have a very important client joining me and i want it to be an evening he wont forget you can rely on me madam the waiter said as emma sat down after hed gone she opened her bag took out the menu and went over her list of questions once more when she saw jimmy heading towards her with max lloyd in his wake she turned the menu over youre obviously well known here said lloyd as he slipped into the seat opposite her its my favourite new york restaurant said emma returning his smile can i get you a drink sir manhattan on the rocks and you madam my usual jimmy the waiter hurried off emma was curious to discover what he would come back with why dont we order said emma and then we can get down to business good idea replied lloyd although i know exactly what i want he added as the waiter reappeared and placed a manhattan in front of him and a glass of white wine by emmas side the drink shed ordered at lunch emma was impressed jimmy i think were ready to order the waiter nodded and turned to emmas guest ill have one of your juicy sirloin steaks make it medium and dont spare on the trimmings certainly sir turning to emma he asked what can i tempt you with this evening madam a caesar salad please jimmy but light on the dressing once the waiter was out of earshot she turned her menu back over although she didnt need to be reminded of the first question the diary only covered eighteen months of your incarceration she said but you served more than two years so i hope we can look forward to another volume i still have a notebook full of material said lloyd relaxing for the first time ive been thinking about incorporating some of the more extraordinary events i experienced in a novel that i have planned because if you ever wrote them as a diary any publisher would realize you werent the author emma wanted to say the sommelier appeared by lloyds side summoned by the demand of an empty glass would you care to see the wine list sir something to complement the steak perhaps good idea said lloyd opening the thick leatherbound book as if he were the host he ran his finger down a long list of burgundies and paused near the bottom a bottle of the thirtyseven i think an excellent choice sir emma presumed that meant it wasnt cheap but this was not an occasion to quibble over price and what a nasty piece of work hessler turned out to be she said glancing at her second question i thought that sort of person only existed in trashy novels or bmovies no he was real enough said lloyd but i did get him transferred to another prison if you remember i do said emma as a large steak was placed in front of her guest and a caesar salad on her side of the table lloyd picked up his knife and fork clearly ready for the challenge so tell me what sort of proposal do you have in mind he asked as he dug into the steak one where you get exactly what youre worth said emma the tone of her voice changing and not a penny more a puzzled look appeared on lloyds face and he put down his knife and fork as he waited for emma to continue i am well aware mr lloyd that you didnt write one word of the diary of a convict other than to replace the real authors name with your own lloyd opened his mouth but before he had time to protest emma continued if youre foolish enough to keep up the pretence that you wrote the book my first visit in the morning will be to mr brett elders your parole officer and it wont be to discuss how well your rehabilitation is going the sommelier reappeared uncorked a bottle and waited to be told who would be tasting the wine lloyd was staring at emma like a rabbit caught in the glare of headlights so she gave a slight nod she took her time swirling the wine around in her glass before taking a sip excellent she eventually said i particularly like the thirtyseven the sommelier bowed slightly poured two glasses and went off in search of another victim you cant prove i didnt write it said lloyd defiantly yes i can said emma because i represent the man who did she took a sip of wine before adding tom bradshaw your deputy librarian lloyd sank back into his seat and lapsed into a sullen silence so let me outline the deal im proposing mr lloyd while at the same time making it clear that there is no room for negotiation unless of course you want to go back to prison on a charge of fraud as well as theft should you end up in pierpoint i have a feeling mr hessler will be only too happy to escort you to your cell as he doesnt come out of the book very well lloyd didnt look as if the idea appealed to him emma took another sip of wine before continuing mr bradshaw has generously agreed to allow you to continue the myth that you wrote the diary and he wont even expect you to give back the advance you were paid which in any case i suspect youve already spent lloyd pursed his lips however he wishes to make it clear that should you be foolish enough to attempt to sell the rights in any other country a writ for copyright theft will be issued against you and the publisher concerned is that clear yes mumbled lloyd clutching the arms of his chair good then thats settled said emma and after taking another sip of wine added i feel sure youll agree mr lloyd that theres no purpose in us continuing this conversation so perhaps the time has come for you to leave lloyd hesitated well meet again at ten oclock tomorrow morning at fortynine wall street fortynine wall street the office of mr sefton jelks tom bradshaws lawyer so its jelks whos behind this well that explains everything emma didnt understand what he meant but said you will bring every single notebook with you and hand them over should you be even one minute late i will instruct mr jelks to call your probation officer and tell him what youve been up to since you left lavenham stealing a clients earnings is one thing but claiming you wrote his book lloyd continued to grip the arms of his chair but said nothing you may go now mr lloyd said emma i look forward to seeing you in the lobby of fortynine wall street at ten tomorrow morning dont be late unless you want your next appointment to be with mr elders lloyd rose unsteadily to his feet and made his way slowly across the restaurant leaving one or two customers wondering if he was drunk a waiter held the door open for him then hurried over to emmas table seeing the untouched steak and a full glass of wine he asked anxiously i hope everything was all right miss barrington it couldnt have gone better jimmy she said pouring herself another glass of wine once emma had returned to her hotel room she checked the back of her lunch menu and was delighted to confirm that shed been able to tick off almost every question she thought her demand that the notebooks should be handed over in the lobby of wall street was inspired because it must have left lloyd with the distinct impression that mr jelks was her lawyer which would have put the fear of god into a perfectly innocent man although she was still puzzled by what lloyd had meant when hed let slip the words so its jelks whos behind this well that explains everything she switched off the light and slept soundly for the first time since shed left england emmas morning routine followed much the same pattern as previous days after a leisurely breakfast shared only with the new york times she left the hotel and took a cab to wall street she had planned to be a few minutes early and the cab dropped her off outside the building at am as she handed the driver a quarter she was relieved that her visit to new york was coming to an end it had turned out to be far more expensive than she had anticipated two meals at the brasserie with a fivedollar bottle of wine plus tips didnt help however she wasnt in any doubt that the trip had been worthwhile not least because the photographs taken on board the kansas star had confirmed her belief that harry was still alive and had for some reason assumed tom bradshaws identity once shed got her hands on the missing notebook the rest of the mystery would unravel and surely she would now be able to convince officer kolowski that harry should be released she didnt intend to return to england without him emma joined a stampede of office workers as they made their way into the building they all headed towards the nearest available elevator but emma didnt join them she placed herself strategically between the reception desk and the bank of twelve lifts which allowed her an unimpeded view of everyone who entered wall street she checked her watch no sign of lloyd she checked it again at and oclock he must have been held up by traffic her eyes rested for a split second on every person who came in had she missed him she glanced towards reception still no sign of him she tried to stop negative thoughts from entering her mind had he called her bluff would her next appointment have to be with mr brett elders how much longer was she willing to hang about and a voice behind her said good morning miss barrington emma swung round and came face to face with samuel anscott who said politely mr jelks wonders if youd be kind enough to join him in his office without another word anscott turned and walked towards a waiting elevator emma only just managed to jump in before the doors closed conversation was out of the question as the packed elevator made its slow interrupted journey to the nd floor where anscott stepped out and led emma down a long oakpanelled thickly carpeted corridor lined with portraits of previous senior partners and their colleagues on the board giving an impression of honesty integrity and propriety emma would have liked to question anscott before she met jelks for the first time but he remained several paces ahead of her when he reached a door at the end of the corridor anscott knocked and opened it without waiting for a response he stood aside to allow emma to enter then closed the door but didnt join them there sitting in a comfortable highbacked chair by the window was max lloyd he was smoking a cigarette and gave emma the same smile hed bestowed on her when they had first met at doubledays she turned her attention to a tall elegantly dressed man who rose slowly from behind his desk no hint of a smile or any suggestion that they should shake hands behind him was a wall of glass beyond which skyscrapers towered into the sky suggesting unfettered power its kind of you to join us miss barrington he said please have a seat emma sank into a leather chair so deep that she almost disappeared from sight she noticed a stack of notebooks on the senior partners desk my name is sefton jelks he began and i have the privilege of representing the distinguished and acclaimed author mr max lloyd my client visited me earlier this morning to tell me that he had been approached by someone claiming to be a literary agent from london who was making an accusation a slanderous accusation that he was not the author of the diary of a convict which bears his name it may interest you to know miss barrington continued jelks that i am in possession of the original manuscript every word of which is written in mr lloyds hand he placed a fist firmly on top of the notebooks and allowed himself the suggestion of a smile may i be allowed to see one asked emma of course replied jelks he removed the book on top of the pile and handed it to her emma opened it and began to read the first thing she saw was that it wasnt written in harrys bold hand but it was harrys voice she handed the book back to mr jelks who replaced it at the top of the pile may i have a look at one of the others she asked no weve proved our point miss barrington said jelks and my client will take advantage of every remedy the law provides should you be foolish enough to repeat your slander emma kept her eyes on the pile of notebooks while jelks continued in full flow i also felt it appropriate to have a word with mr elders to warn him you might be in touch and to let him know that should he agree to see you he would undoubtedly be called as a witness were this matter to end up in court mr elders felt on balance that his best course of action would be to avoid meeting you a sensible man emma continued to look at the pile of notebooks miss barrington it didnt take a lot of research to discover that you are the granddaughter of lord harvey and sir walter barrington which would account for your misplaced confidence when dealing with americans allow me to suggest that if you intend to continue trying to pass yourself off as a literary agent perhaps i can offer you some free advice which is a matter of public record ernest hemingway left america to live in cuba in how very generous of you mr jelks interrupted emma before he could continue allow me to offer you some free advice in return i know perfectly well that it was harry clifton jelkss eyes narrowed and not your client who wrote the diary of a convict if you were foolish enough mr jelks to issue a writ for slander against me you might well find yourself in court having to explain why you defended a man on a charge of murder who you knew wasnt lieutenant tom bradshaw jelks began frantically pressing a button underneath his desk emma rose from her chair smiled sweetly at both of them and left the room without another word she marched quickly down the corridor towards the elevator as mr anscott and a security guard hurried past her on their way to mr jelkss office at least shed avoided the humiliation of being escorted off the premises when she stepped into the lift the attendant enquired which floor miss ground please the attendant chuckled you must be english why do you say that in america we call it the first floor of course you do said emma giving him a smile as she stepped out of the elevator she walked across the lobby pushed through the revolving doors and ran down the steps and out on to the pavement quite clear what she had to do next there was only one person left she could turn to after all any sister of lord harvey had to be a formidable ally or would greataunt phyllis turn out to be a close friend of sefton jelks in which case emma would be taking the next boat back to england she hailed a cab but when she jumped in she almost had to shout to make herself heard above the blare of the radio sixtyfourth and park she said working out how she might explain to her greataunt why she hadnt visited her earlier she leant forward and would have asked the driver to turn the volume down if she hadnt heard the words president roosevelt will address the nation from the oval office at twelve thirty this afternoon eastern time giles barrington the first thing giles saw was his right leg hitched to a pulley and encased in plaster he could dimly remember a long journey during which the pain had become almost unbearable and he had assumed he would die long before they got him to a hospital and he would never forget the operation but then how could he when theyd run out of anaesthetic moments before the doctor made the first incision he turned his head very slowly to the left and saw a window with three bars across it then to the right thats when he saw him no not you giles said for a moment i thought id escaped and gone to heaven not yet said bates first you have to do a spell in purgatory for how long at least until your legs mended possibly longer are we back in england giles asked hopefully i wish said bates no were in germany weinsberg pow camp which is where we all ended up after being taken prisoner giles tried to sit up but could only just raise his head off the pillow enough to see a framed picture on the wall of adolf hitler giving him a nazi salute how many of our boys survived only a handful the lads took the colonels words to heart we will all sacrifice our lives before rommel books a suite at the majestic hotel did anyone else from our platoon make it you me and dont tell me fisher no because if theyd sent him to weinsberg id have asked for a transfer to colditz giles lay still staring up at the ceiling so how do we escape i wondered how long it would be before you asked that and whats the answer not a chance while your legs still in plaster and even after that it wont be easy but ive got a plan of course you have the plans not the problem said bates the problem is the escape committee they control the waiting list and youre at the back of the queue how do i get to the front its like any queue in england you just have to wait your turn unless unless unless brigadier turnbull the senior ranking officer thinks theres a good reason why you should be moved up the queue like what if you can speak fluent german its a bonus i picked up a bit when i was at ots just wish id concentrated more well there are lessons twice a day so someone of your intelligence shouldnt find that too difficult unfortunately even that list is still fairly long so what else can i do to get bumped up the escapelist faster find yourself the right job thats what got me moved up three places in the past month how did you manage that as soon as the krauts found out i was a butcher they offered me a job in the officers mess i told them to fuck off excuse my french but the brigadier insisted i took the job why would he want you to work for the germans because occasionally i can manage to steal some food from the kitchen but more important i pick up the odd piece of information thats useful to the escape committee thats why im near the front of the queue and youre still at the back youre going to have to get both feet on the ground if youre still hoping to make it to the washroom before me any idea how long it will be before i can do that asked giles the prison doc says itll be at least another month possibly six weeks before they can remove the plaster giles settled back on the pillow but even when i do get up how can i hope to be offered a job in the officers mess unlike you i dont have the right qualifications but you do said bates in fact you can go one better than me and get yourself a job in the camp commandants dining room because i know theyre looking for a wine waiter and what makes you think im qualified to be a wine waiter asked giles making no attempt to hide the sarcasm in his voice if i remember correctly said bates you used to have a butler called jenkins working for you at the manor house still do but that hardly qualifies me and your grandfather lord harvey is in the wine trade frankly youre overqualified so what are you suggesting once you get out of here theyll make you fill in a labour form listing your previous employment ive already told them you were a wine waiter at the grand hotel bristol thanks but theyll know within minutes believe me they dont have a clue all you have to do is get your german up to scratch and try to remember what jenkins did then if we can come up with a decent plan to present to the escape committee well march to the front of the queue in no time mind you theres a catch there has to be if youre involved but ive found a way round it whats the catch you cant get a job workin for the krauts if you take german lessons because theyre not that stupid they make a list of everyone who attends the classes because they dont want no one eavesdropping on their private conversations you said youd found a way around that youll have to do what all toffs do to keep ahead of people like me take private lessons ive even found you a tutor a bloke who taught german at solihull grammar school its only his english youll find difficult to understand giles laughed and since youll be locked up in here for another six weeks and havent anything better to do you can start straight away youll find a germanenglish dictionary under your pillow im in your debt terry said giles grasping his friend by the hand no i owe you dont i on account of the fact that you saved my life by the time giles was released from the sick bay five weeks later he knew a thousand german words but he hadnt been able to work on his pronunciation hed also spent countless hours lying in bed trying to recall how jenkins had gone about his job he practised saying good morning sir with a deferential nod of the head and would you care to sample this wine colonel while pouring a jug of water into a specimen bottle always appear modest never interrupt and dont speak till youre spoken to bates reminded him in fact do exactly the opposite of everythin youve always done in the past giles would have hit him but he knew he was right although bates was only allowed to visit giles twice a week for thirty minutes he used every one of those minutes to brief him about the daytoday workings of the commandants private dining room he taught him the names and ranks of each officer their particular likes and dislikes and warned him that major müller of the ss who was in charge of camp security was not a gentleman and was certainly not susceptible to charm especially oldschool another visitor was brigadier turnbull who listened with interest to what giles told him he had in mind for when he was moved out of the sick bay and into the camp the brigadier went away impressed and returned a few days later with some thoughts of his own the escape committee arent in any doubt that the krauts will never allow you to work in the commandants dining room if they think youre an officer he told giles for your plan to have any chance of succeeding youll need to be a private soldier since bates is the only man to have served under you hes the only one wholl have to keep his mouth shut hell do what i tell him said giles not any longer he wont warned the brigadier when giles finally emerged from the sick bay and moved into camp he was surprised to find how disciplined the life was especially for a private soldier it brought back memories of his days at ypres training camp on dartmoor feet on the floor at six every morning with a sergeant major who certainly didnt treat him like an officer bates still beat him to the washroom and to breakfast every morning there was full parade on the square at seven when the salute was taken by the brigadier once the sergeant major had screamed parade dismissed everyone became engaged in frantic activity for the rest of the day giles never missed the fivemile run twentyfive times around the perimeter of the camp or an hours quiet conversation in german with his private tutor while sitting in the latrines he quickly discovered that the weinsberg pow camp had a lot of other things in common with ypres barracks cold bleak barren terrain and dozens of huts with wooden bunks horsehair mattresses and no heating other than the sun which like the red cross only made rare visits to weinsberg they also had their own sergeant major who endlessly referred to giles as an idle little sod as on dartmoor there was a high wire fence surrounding the compound and only one way in and out the problem was that there were no weekend passes and the guards armed with rifles certainly didnt salute as you drove out of the gates in your yellow mg when giles was asked to fill in the camp labour form under name he wrote private giles barrington and under previous occupation sommelier what the hells that when its at home asked bates wine waiter said giles in a superior tone then why not bloody well say so bates said as he tore up the form unless of course you were hoping to get a job at the ritz youll have to fill in another one of these he added sounding exasperated once giles had handed in the second form he waited impatiently to be interviewed by someone in the commandants office he used the endless hours to keep fit in both mind and body mens sana in corpore sano was about the only latin he could still remember from his schooldays bates kept him informed about what was happening on the other side of the fence and even managed to smuggle out the odd potato or crust of bread and on one occasion half an orange cant overdo it he explained the last thing i need is to lose my job it was about a month later that they were both invited to appear before the escape committee and present the batesbarrington plan which quickly became known as the bed and breakfast plan bed in weinsberg breakfast in zurich their clandestine presentation went well and the committee agreed that they should be allowed to climb a few more places up the order but no one was yet suggesting that they should open the batting in fact the brigadier told them bluntly that until private barrington had landed a job in the commandants dining room they were not to bother the committee again why is it taking so long terry asked giles after theyd left the meeting corporal bates grinned im quite happy for you to call me terry he said that is when were on our own but never in front of the men you understand he added giving a passable imitation of fisher giles punched him on the arm court martial offence that bates reminded him a private soldier attacking a noncommissioned officer giles punched him again now answer my question he demanded nothing moves quickly in this place youll just have to be patient giles you cant call me giles until were sitting down for breakfast in zurich suits me if youre payin everything changed the day the camp commandant had to host lunch for a group of visiting red cross officials and needed an extra waiter dont forget youre a private soldier said bates when giles was escorted to the other side of the wire for his interview with major müller you have to try to think like a servant not someone whos used to being served if müller suspects even for a moment that youre an officer well both be out on our arses and youll go back to the bottom of the snakes and ladders board i can promise you one thing the brigadier wont ever invite us to throw the dice again so act like a servant and never even hint that you understand a word of german got it yes sir said giles giles returned an hour later with a large grin on his face you got the job asked bates i got lucky said giles the commandant interviewed me not müller i start tomorrow and he never suspected you were an officer and a gentleman not after i told him i was a friend of yours before the lunch for the visiting red cross officials was served giles uncorked six bottles of merlot to allow them to breathe once the guests were seated he poured half an inch of wine into the commandants glass and waited for his approval after a nod he served the guests always pouring from the right he then moved on to the officers according to rank finally returning to the commandant as host during the meal he made sure no ones glass was ever empty but he never served anyone while they were speaking like jenkins he was rarely seen and never heard everything went as planned although giles was well aware that major müllers suspicious eyes rarely left him even when he tried to melt into the background after the two of them had been escorted back to the camp later that afternoon bates said the commandant was impressed what makes you say that asked giles fishing he told the head chef that you must have worked for a grand household because although you were obviously from the lower classes youd been well taught by a consummate professional thank you jenkins said giles so what does consummate mean asked bates giles became so skilled in his new vocation that the camp commandant insisted on being served by him even when he dined alone this allowed giles to study his mannerisms the inflections in his voice his laugh even his slight stutter within weeks private barrington had been handed the keys to the wine cellar and allowed to select which wines would be served at dinner and after a few months bates overheard the commandant telling the chef that barrington was erstklassig whenever the commandant held a dinner party giles quickly assessed which tongues could be loosened by the regular topping up of glasses and how to make himself invisible whenever one of those tongues began to wag he passed on any useful information hed picked up the previous evening to the brigadiers batman while they were out on the communal fivemile run these titbits included where the commandant lived the fact that hed been elected to the town council at the age of thirtytwo and been appointed mayor in he couldnt drive but he had visited england three or four times before the war and spoke fluent english in return giles learnt that he and bates had climbed several more rungs up the escape committees ladder giless main activity during the day was to spend an hour chatting to his tutor never a word of english was spoken and the man from solihull even told the brigadier that private barrington was beginning to sound more and more like the commandant on december rd corporal bates and private barrington made their final presentation to the escape committee the brigadier and his team listened to the bed and breakfast plan with considerable interest and agreed that it had a far better chance of succeeding than most of the halfbaked schemes that were put before them when would you consider the best time to carry out your plan asked the brigadier new years eve sir said giles without hesitation all the officers will be joining the commandant for dinner to welcome in the new year and as private barrington will be pouring the drinks added bates there shouldnt be too many of them who are still sober by the time midnight strikes except for müller the brigadier reminded bates who doesnt drink true but he never fails to toast the fatherland the führer and the third reich if you add in the new year and his host i have a feeling hell be pretty sleepy by the time hes driven home what time are you usually escorted back to camp after one of the commandants dinner parties asked a young lieutenant who had recently joined the committee around eleven said bates but as its new years eve it wont be before midnight dont forget gentlemen giles chipped in i have the keys to the wine cellar so i can assure you several bottles will find their way to the guard house during the evening we wouldnt want them to miss out on the celebrations thats all very well said a wing commander who rarely spoke but how do you plan to get past them by driving out through the front gate in the commandants car said giles hes always a dutiful host and never leaves before his last guest which should give us at least a couple of hours start even if you are able to steal his car said the brigadier however drunk the guards are theyll still be able to tell the difference between a wine waiter and their commanding officer not if im wearing his greatcoat hat scarf and gloves and holding his baton said giles the young lieutenant clearly wasnt convinced and is it part of your plan for the commandant to meekly hand all his clothes over to you private barrington no sir said giles to an officer he outranked the commandant always leaves his coat cap and gloves in the cloakroom but what about bates said the same officer theyll spot him a mile off not if im in the boot of the car they wont said bates what about the commandants driver who we must assume will be stonecold sober said the brigadier were working on it said giles and if you do manage to overcome the problem of the driver and get past the guards how far is it to the swiss border the young lieutenant again one hundred and seventythree kilometres said bates at a hundred kilometres an hour we should reach the border in just under two hours thats assuming there are no holdups on the way no escape plan can ever be foolproof interjected the brigadier in the end it all comes down to how you cope with the unforeseen both giles and bates nodded their agreement thank you gentlemen said the brigadier the committee will consider your plan and well let you know our decision in the morning whats that young sprog got against us asked bates once theyd left the meeting nothing said giles on the contrary i suspect he wishes he was the third member of our team on december th the brigadiers batman told giles during he fivemile run that their plan had been given the green light and the committee wished them bon voyage giles quickly caught up with corporal bates and passed on the news barrington and bates went over their b b plan again and again until like olympic athletes they became bored with the endless hours of preparation and longed to hear the starters pistol at six oclock on december st corporal terry bates and private giles barrington reported for duty in the commandants quarters aware that if their plan failed at best they would have to wait for another year but if they were caught redhanded youcomebackatsixthirty terry almost shouted at the german corporal who had escorted them from the camp to the commandants quarters the blank look on the corporals face left giles in little doubt that he was never going to make sergeant comebackatsixthirty repeated terry enunciating each word slowly he grabbed the corporals wrist and pointed to the six on his watch giles only wished he could say to the corporal in his own language if you return at sixthirty corporal therell be a crate of beer for you and your friends in the guard house but he knew that if he did he would be arrested and be spending new years eve in solitary confinement terry once again pointed to the corporals watch and imitated a man drinking this time the corporal smiled and mimicked the same action i think hes finally got the message said giles as they made their way into the commandants quarters we still have to make sure he picks the beer up before the first officer arrives so wed better get a move on yes sir said terry as he headed off in the direction of the kitchen natural order restored giles went to the cloakroom removed the waiters uniform from its peg and changed into the white shirt black tie black trousers and white linen jacket he spotted a pair of black leather gloves on the bench that an officer must have left behind on some previous occasion and tucked them into his pocket thinking they might prove useful later he closed the cloakroom door and made his way to the dining room three waitresses from the town including greta the only one hed ever been tempted to flirt with but he knew jenkins wouldnt have approved were laying a table for sixteen he checked his watch pm he left the dining room and went downstairs to the wine cellar a single bulb lit a room that had once stored filing cabinets full of archives since giless arrival they had been replaced by wine racks giles had already decided he would need at least three cases of wine for the dinner that night as well as a crate of beer for the thirsty corporal and his comrades in the guard house he studied the racks carefully before selecting a couple of bottles of sherry a dozen bottles of italian pinot grigio two cases of french burgundy and a crate of german beer just as he was leaving his eyes settled on three bottles of johnnie walker red label two bottles of russian vodka half a dozen bottles of rémy martin and a flagon of vintage port giles felt that a visitor might be forgiven for not being sure who was at war with whom for the next fifteen minutes he lugged the cases of wine and beer up the stairs constantly stopping to check his watch and at he opened the back door to find the german corporal jumping up and down and slapping his sides in an effort to keep warm giles raised the palms of both hands to indicate that he should stay put for a moment he then moved swiftly back down the corridor jenkins never ran picked up the crate of beer returned and handed it to him greta who was clearly running late watched the handover and grinned at giles he returned her smile before she disappeared into the dining room the guard house said giles firmly pointing towards the outer perimeter the corporal nodded and headed off in the right direction terry had asked giles earlier if he should smuggle some food from the kitchen for the corporal and his friends in the guard house certainly not giles had replied firmly we want them drinking all night on an empty stomach giles closed the door and returned to the dining room where the waitresses had almost finished laying the table he uncorked the dozen bottles of merlot but only placed four on the sideboard discreetly hiding the other eight underneath it he didnt need müller to work out what he was up to he also put a bottle of whisky and two of sherry at one end of the sideboard before lining up like soldiers on parade a dozen tumblers and half a dozen sherry glasses everything was in place giles was polishing a tumbler when colonel schabacker walked in the commandant checked the table made one or two adjustments to the seating plan then turned his attention to the array of bottles on the sideboard giles wondered if he might comment but he simply smiled and said im expecting the guests to arrive around seventhirty and i have told the chef we will sit down for dinner at eight giles could only hope that in a few hours time his german would prove as fluent as colonel schabackers english the next person to enter the dining room was a young lieutenant who had recently joined the officers mess and was attending his first commandants dinner giles noticed him eyeing the whisky and stepped forward to serve him pouring him half a glass he then handed the commandant his usual sherry the second officer to make an appearance was captain henkel the camps adjutant giles handed him his usual glass of vodka and spent the next thirty minutes serving each new guest always having their favourite tipple to hand by the time the guests sat down for dinner several empty bottles had been replaced by the reserves giles had secreted under the sideboard moments later waitresses appeared carrying plates of borscht while the commandant sampled the white wine italian said giles showing him the label excellent he murmured giles then filled every glass except that of major müller who continued to sip his water some of the guests drank more quickly than others which kept giles moving around the table always making sure that no one had an empty glass once the soup bowls had been whisked away giles melted into the background because terry had warned him what would happen next with a flourish the double doors opened and the chef entered carrying a large boars head on a silver salver the waitresses followed and placed dishes of vegetables and potatoes along with jugs of thick gravy in the centre of the table as the chef began to carve colonel schabacker sampled the burgundy which caused another smile to appear on his face giles returned to the task of topping up any halfempty glasses with one exception hed noticed that the young lieutenant hadnt spoken for some time so he left his glass untouched one or two of the other officers were beginning to slur their words and he needed them to stay awake until at least midnight the chef returned later to serve second helpings and giles obliged when colonel schabacker demanded that everyones glasses should be replenished by the time terry made his first appearance to remove what was left of the boars head major müller was the only officer still sober a few minutes later the chef made a third entrance this time carrying a black forest gateau which he placed on the table in front of the commandant the host plunged a knife into the cake several times and the waitresses distributed generous portions to each of the guests giles continued topping up their glasses until he was down to the last bottle as the waitresses cleared the dessert plates giles removed the wine glasses from the table replacing them with brandy balloons and port glasses gentlemen announced colonel schabacker just after eleven please charge your glasses as i would like to propose a toast he rose from his place held his glass high in the air and said the fatherland fifteen officers rose at various speeds and repeated the fatherland müller glanced towards giles and tapped his glass to indicate that he would require something for the toast not wine you idiot said müller i want some brandy giles smiled and filled his glass with burgundy müller had failed to trap him loud convivial chatter continued as giles carried a humidor around the table and invited the guests to select a cigar the young lieutenant was now resting his head on the table and giles thought he detected a snore when the commandant rose a second time to drink the health of the führer giles poured müller some more red wine he raised his glass clicked his heels together and gave a nazi salute a toast to frederick the great followed and this time giles made sure müllers glass had been topped up long before he rose at five minutes to midnight giles checked that every glass was full when the clock on the wall began to chime fifteen officers cried almost in unison and then broke into deutschland deutschland über alles slapping each other on the back as they welcomed in the new year it was some time before they resumed their places the commandant remained standing and tapped his glass with a spoon everyone fell silent in anticipation of his annual speech he began by thanking his colleagues for their loyalty and dedication during a difficult year he then spoke for some time about the destiny of the fatherland giles remembered that schabacker had been the local mayor before he took over as commandant of the camp he ended by declaring that he hoped the right side would have won the war by this time next year giles wanted to scream hear hear in any language but müller swung round to see if the colonels words had evoked any reaction giles stared blankly ahead as if he hadnt understood a word he had passed another of müllers tests it was a few minutes after am when the first guest rose to leave im on duty at six in the morning colonel he explained this was greeted with mock applause as the officer bowed low and left without another word several other guests departed during the next hour but giles knew he couldnt consider executing his own wellrehearsed exit while müller was still on the premises he became a little anxious when the waitresses started to clear away the coffee cups a sign that their evening was coming to an end and he might be ordered back to the camp giles kept himself busy continuing to serve those officers who didnt seem in any hurry to leave müller finally rose as the last waitress left the room and bade goodnight to his colleagues but not before clicking his heels and giving his comrades another nazi salute giles and terry had agreed that their plan couldnt be put into motion until at least fifteen minutes after müller had departed and they had checked that his car was no longer in its usual place giles refilled the glasses of the six officers who remained seated around the table they were all close friends of the commandant two of them had been at school with him another three had served on the town council and only the camp adjutant was a more recent acquaintance information giles had picked up during the past few months it must have been about twenty past two when the commandant beckoned giles over its been a long day he said in english go and join your friend in the kitchen and take a bottle of wine with you thank you sir said giles placing a bottle of brandy and a decanter of port in the centre of the table the last words he heard the commandant say before he left were to the adjutant who was seated on his right when weve finally won this war franz i intend to offer that man a job i cant imagine hell want to return to england while a swastika flies over buckingham palace giles removed the only bottle of wine still on the sideboard left the room and closed the door quietly behind him he could feel the adrenaline pumping through his body and was well aware that the next fifteen minutes would decide their fate he took the back stairs down to the kitchen where he found terry chatting to the chef a halfempty bottle of cooking sherry by his side happy new year chef said terry as he rose from his chair got to dash otherwise ill be late for breakfast in zurich giles tried to keep a straight face as the chef just about raised a hand in acknowledgement they ran up the stairs the only two sober people in the building giles passed the bottle of wine to terry and said two minutes no more terry walked down the corridor and slipped out of the back door giles withdrew into the shadows at the top of the stairs just as an officer came out of the dining room and headed for the lavatory moments later the back door reopened and a head appeared giles waved furiously at terry and pointed to the lavatory terry ran over to join him in the shadows just before the officer emerged to make his way unsteadily back to the dining room once the door had closed behind him giles asked hows our tame german corporal half asleep i gave him the bottle of wine and warned him we could be at least another hour do you think he understood i dont think he cared good enough your turn to act as lookout said giles as he stepped back out into the corridor he clenched his fists to stop his hands trembling and was just about to open the cloakroom door when he thought he heard a voice coming from inside he froze put his ear to the door and listened it only took him a moment to realize who it must be for the first time he broke jenkinss golden rule and charged back down the corridor to rejoin terry in the shadows at the top of the stairs whats the problem giles put a finger up to his lips as the cloakroom door opened and out stepped major müller doing up his fly buttons once hed pulled on his greatcoat he glanced up and down the corridor to make sure no one had spotted him then slipped through the front door and out into the night which girl asked giles probably greta ive had her a couple of times but never in the cloakroom isnt that fraternizing whispered giles only if youre an officer said terry they only had to wait for a few moments before the door opened again and greta appeared looking a little flushed she walked calmly out of the front door without bothering to check if anyone had seen her second attempt said giles who moved swiftly back down the corridor opened the cloakroom door and disappeared inside just as another officer came out of the dining room dont turn right dont turn right terry begged silently the officer turned left and headed for the lavatory terry prayed for the longest pee in history he began counting the seconds but then the cloakroom door opened and out stepped the commandant in all but name get back inside terry waved frantically giles ducked back into the cloakroom and pulled the door closed when the adjutant reappeared terry feared he would go to the cloakroom to collect his cap and coat and find giles dressed as the commandant in which case the game would be up before it had even begun terry followed each step fearing the worst but the adjutant stopped at the dining room door opened it and disappeared inside once the door had closed terry bolted down the corridor and opened the cloakroom door to find giles dressed in a greatcoat scarf gloves and peaked cap and carrying a baton beads of sweat on his forehead lets get out of here before one of us has a heart attack said terry terry and giles left the building even more quickly than müller or greta had relax said giles once they were outside dont forget were the only two people who are sober he tucked the scarf around his neck so that it covered his chin pulled down his cap gripped the baton firmly and stooped slightly as he was a couple of inches taller than the commandant as soon as the driver heard giles approaching he leapt out of the car and opened the back door for him giles had rehearsed a sentence hed heard the colonel say to his driver many times and as he fell into the back seat he pulled his cap even further down and slurred take me home hans hans returned to the drivers seat but when he heard a click that sounded like the boot closing he looked back suspiciously only to see the commandant tapping his baton on the window whats holding you up hans giles asked with a slight stutter hans switched on the ignition put the car into first gear and drove slowly towards the guard house a sergeant emerged from the sentry box when he heard the vehicle approaching he tried to open the barrier and salute at the same time giles raised his baton in acknowledgement and nearly burst out laughing when he noticed that the top two buttons of the sentrys tunic were undone colonel schabacker would never have let that pass without comment even on new years eve major forsdyke the escape committees intelligence officer had told giles that the commandants house was approximately two miles from the compound and the last two hundred yards were down a narrow unlit lane giles remained slumped into the corner of the back seat where he couldnt be seen in the rearview mirror but the moment the car swung into the lane he sat bolt upright tapped the driver on the shoulder with his baton and ordered him to stop i cant wait he said before jumping out of the car and pretending to undo his fly buttons hans watched as the colonel disappeared into the bushes he looked puzzled after all they were only a hundred metres from his front door he stepped out of the car and waited by the back door when he thought he heard his master coming back he turned around just in time to see a clenched fist an instant before it broke his nose he slumped to the ground giles ran to the back of the car and opened the boot terry leapt out walked across to hanss prostrate body and began to unbutton the drivers uniform before pulling off his own clothes once bates had finished putting on his new uniform it became clear just how much shorter and fatter hans was it wont matter said giles reading his thoughts when youre behind the wheel no one will give you a second look they dragged hans to the back of the car and bundled him into the boot i doubt if hell wake up before we sit down for breakfast in zurich said terry as he tied a handkerchief around hanss mouth the commandants new driver took his place behind the wheel and neither of them spoke again until they were back on the main road terry didnt need to stop and check any signposts as hed studied the route to the border every day for the past month stay on the righthand side of the road said giles unnecessarily and dont drive too fast the last thing we need is to be pulled over i think weve made it terry said as they passed a signpost for schaffhausen i wont believe weve made it until were being shown to our table at the imperial hotel and a waiter hands me the breakfast menu i wont need a menu said terry eggs bacon beans sausage and tomato and a pint of beer thats my usual down at the meat market every morning how about you a kipper lightly poached a slice of buttered toast a spoonful of oxford marmalade and a pot of earl grey tea it didnt take you long to go back from butler to toff giles smiled he checked his watch there were few cars on the road that new years morning so they continued to make good progress that was until terry spotted the convoy ahead of them what do i do now he said overtake them we cant afford to waste any time theyll have no reason to be suspicious youre driving a senior officer who wouldnt expect to be held up once terry caught up with the rear vehicle he eased out into the centre of the road and began to overtake a long line of armoured trucks and motorcycles as giles had predicted no one took any interest in a passing mercedes that was clearly going about official business when terry overtook the leading vehicle he breathed a sigh of relief but he didnt fully relax until he swept round a corner and could no longer see any headlights in his rearview mirror giles continued to check his watch every few minutes the next signpost confirmed they were making good time but giles knew they had no control over when the commandants last guest would leave and colonel schabacker would go in search of his car and driver it was another forty minutes before they reached the outskirts of schaffhausen they were both so nervous that hardly a word had passed between them giles was exhausted just sitting in the back seat doing nothing but he knew they couldnt afford to relax until they had crossed the swiss border when they entered the town the locals were just beginning to wake up the occasional tram the odd car a few bicycles ferrying people who were expected to work on new years day terry didnt need to look for signs to the border as he could see the swiss alps dominating the skyline freedom felt as if it was touching distance away bloody hell said terry as he slammed on the brakes whats the problem said giles leaning forward look at that queue giles stuck his head out of the window to see a line of about forty vehicles bumper to bumper ahead of them all waiting to cross the border he checked to see if any of them were official cars when he was sure there were none he said drive straight to the front thats what theyd expect us to do if we dont well only draw attention to ourselves terry drove slowly forward only stopping when he reached the barrier get out and open the door for me but dont say anything terry turned off the engine got out and opened the back door giles marched up to the customs post a young officer leapt up from behind his desk and saluted when he saw the colonel enter the room giles handed over two sets of papers that the camp forger had assured him would pass muster at any border post in germany he was about to find out if hed exaggerated as the officer flicked through the documents giles tapped the side of his leg with his baton and glanced repeatedly at his watch i have an important meeting in zurich he snapped and im running late im sorry colonel ill get you on your way as soon as possible it should only take me a few moments the officer checked the photograph of giles on his papers and looked puzzled giles wondered if hed have the nerve to ask him to remove his scarf because if he did he would immediately realize that he was too young to be a colonel giles stared defiantly at the young man who must have been weighing up the possible consequences of holding up a senior officer by asking him unnecessary questions the scales came down in giless favour the officer nodded his head stamped the papers and said i hope you wont be late for your meeting sir thank you said giles he put the documents back in an inside pocket and was walking towards the door when the young officer stopped him in his tracks heil hitler he shouted giles hesitated turned slowly around and said heil hitler giving a perfect nazi salute as he walked out of the building he had to suppress his laughter when he noticed that terry was holding open the back door with one hand and holding up his trousers with the other thank you hans said giles as he slumped into the back seat that was when they heard a banging noise coming from the boot oh my god said terry hans the brigadiers words came back to haunt them no escape plan can ever be foolproof in the end it all comes down to how you cope with the unforeseen terry closed the back door and returned to his place behind the wheel as quickly as he could as he feared the guards would hear the banging he tried to remain calm as the barrier rose inch by inch and the banging became louder and louder drive slowly said giles dont give them any reason to become suspicious terry eased the gear lever into first and drove slowly under the barrier giles glanced out of the side window as they passed the customs post the young officer was speaking on the phone he looked out of the window stared directly at giles jumped up from his desk and ran out on to the road giles estimated that the swiss border post was no more than a couple of hundred yards away he looked out of the back window to see the young officer waving frantically as guards carrying rifles poured out of the customs post change of plan said giles step on the accelerator he shouted as the first bullets hit the back of the car terry was changing gear when the tyre burst he tried desperately to keep the car on the road but it swerved from side to side careered into the side railings and came to a standstill midway between the two border posts another volley of shots quickly followed my turn to beat you to the washroom said giles not a hope said terry who had both feet on the ground before giles had dived out of the back door they both began running flat out towards the swiss border if either of them was ever going to run a tensecond hundred it would be today although they were dodging and changing direction in their attempt to avoid the bullets giles still felt confident that he would cross the finishing line first the swiss border guards were cheering them on and when giles dipped at the tape he raised his arms in triumph having finally defeated his greatest rival he turned around to gloat and saw terry lying in the middle of the road about thirty yards away a bullet wound in the back of his head and blood trickling from his mouth giles fell on his knees and began to crawl towards his friend more shots rang out as two swiss border guards grabbed him by the ankles and pulled him back to safety he wanted to explain to them that he didnt care to have breakfast alone hugo barrington hugo barrington couldnt remove the smile from his face when he read in the bristol evening news that harry clifton had been buried at sea within hours of war being declared at last the germans had done something worthwhile a uboat commander had singlehandedly solved his biggest problem hugo began to believe it might even be possible that given time he could return to bristol and resume his place as deputy chairman of the barrington shipping line he would begin to work on his mother with regular phone calls to barrington hall but only after his father had left for work each day that night he went out to celebrate and arrived home as drunk as a lord when hugo first migrated to london following his daughters aborted wedding he rented a basement flat in cadogan gardens for a pound a week the only good thing about the threeroomed accommodation was the address which created the impression that he was a man of means although he still had a few bob in the bank it soon dwindled while he had time on his hands and no regular source of income it wasnt long before he had to let go of the bugatti which kept him solvent for a few more weeks but only until the first cheque bounced he couldnt turn to his father for help because hed cut him off and frankly sir walter would have given maisie clifton a helping hand before hed lift a finger to assist his son after a fruitless few months in london hugo tried to find a job but it wasnt easy if any potential employer knew his father he never even got an interview and when he did his new boss expected him to work hours he hadnt realized existed and for a wage that wouldnt have covered his bar bill at the club hugo began to dabble what little he had left on the stock exchange he listened to too many old school chums telling him about deals that couldnt fail and even got involved in one or two more shady enterprises that brought him into contact with what the press described as spivs and his father would have considered crooks within a year hugo had resorted to borrowing money from friends and even friends of friends but when you dont have any means of repaying your debts you are quickly dropped from most dinnerparty guest lists and are no longer invited to join countryhouse shooting parties at the weekend whenever he was desperate hugo would ring his mother but not until he was sure his father was at the office mama could always be relied on for a tenner just as shed been for ten bob when he was at school an old school chum archie fenwick was also good for the occasional lunch at his club or an invitation to one of his fashionable chelsea cocktail parties and that was where hugo first met olga it wasnt her face or figure that immediately attracted his attention but the pearls three rows of them that were draped around her neck hugo cornered archie and asked if they were real they most certainly are he said but be warned youre not the only person hoping to dip your paw into that honey pot olga piotrovska archie told him had recently arrived in london having escaped from poland after the german invasion her parents had been taken away by the gestapo for no other reason than that they were jewish hugo frowned archie wasnt able to tell hugo much more about her except that she lived in a magnificent townhouse on lowndes square and possessed a fine art collection hugo had never taken a great deal of interest in art but even hed heard of picasso and matisse hugo strolled across the room and introduced himself to miss piotrovska when olga told him why shed had to leave germany he expressed outrage and assured her that his family had been proud to do business with the jews for over a hundred years after all his father sir walter barrington was a friend of the rothschilds and the hambros long before the party was over he had invited olga to join him for lunch at the ritz the following day but as he was no longer allowed to sign the bill he had to cadge another fiver from archie the lunch went well and for the next few weeks hugo courted olga assiduously within the limits of his resources he told her that hed left his wife after shed admitted having an affair with his best friend and hed asked his lawyer to instigate divorce proceedings in fact elizabeth had already divorced him and the judge had awarded her the manor house and everything hugo hadnt removed after hed left in such a hurry olga was very understanding and hugo promised her that the moment he was free he would ask her to marry him he never stopped telling her how beautiful she was and how her rather lifeless efforts in bed were so exciting compared to elizabeth he continually reminded her that when his father died she would become lady barrington and his temporary financial difficulties would be resolved when he inherited the barrington estate he may have given her the impression that his father was a lot older and less robust than he actually was fading fast was the expression he used a few weeks later hugo moved into lowndes square and over the next few months he returned to a lifestyle he assumed was his by right several chums commented on how lucky he was to have the company of such a charming and beautiful woman and some of them couldnt resist adding and shes not short of a bob or two hugo had almost forgotten what it was like to eat three meals a day wear new clothes and be chauffeured around town he paid off most of his debts and it wasnt too long before doors began to reopen that had until recently been slammed in his face however he was beginning to wonder how long it could last because he certainly had no intention of marrying a jewish refugee from warsaw derek mitchell climbed on board the express train from temple meads to paddington the private detective was back working full time for his old employer now that his stipend was once again paid on the first day of the month and his expenses were redeemed on presentation hugo expected mitchell to report to him once a month on what the barrington family were up to in particular hugo was interested in the comings and goings of his father his exwife giles emma and even grace but he was still paranoid about maisie clifton and expected mitchell to brief him on everything she got up to and he meant everything mitchell would travel to london by train and the two of them would meet in the waiting room opposite platform seven at paddington station an hour later mitchell would take the train back to temple meads that was how hugo knew that elizabeth continued to live at the manor house while grace rarely came home since shed won a scholarship to cambridge emma had given birth to a son whom shed christened sebastian arthur giles had enlisted in the wessex regiment as a private soldier and after completing a twelveweek basic training course had been sent to mons officer cadet training unit this came as a surprise to hugo as he knew giles had been passed unfit for active service by the gloucesters shortly after the outbreak of war because like him and his father he was colourblind hugo had used the same excuse to avoid being called up in as the months passed olga began to ask more and more frequently when hugos divorce would be finalized he always tried to make it sound as if it were imminent but it wasnt until she suggested he move back into his flat in cadogan square until he could confirm that papers had been lodged with the court that he decided to do something about it he waited another week before he told her his lawyers had begun proceedings a few more months of domestic harmony followed what he hadnt told olga was that hed given his landlord in cadogan square a months notice on the day he moved in with her if she threw him out he would have nowhere to live it was about a month later that mitchell phoned hugo and said he needed to see him urgently a most unusual request they agreed to meet at four oclock the following afternoon at their usual rendezvous when mitchell walked into the station waiting room hugo was already sitting on a bench hidden behind a copy of the london evening news he was reading about rommels sacking of tobruk not that he could have placed tobruk on a map he continued reading when mitchell sat down beside him the private detective spoke softly and never once looked in hugos direction i thought youd want to know that your eldest daughter took a job as a waitress at the grand hotel using the name miss dickens isnt that where maisie clifton works yes shes the restaurants manageress and was your daughters boss hugo couldnt imagine why emma could possibly want to work as a waitress does her mother know she must because hudson dropped her a hundred yards from the hotel every morning at five fortyfive but that isnt the reason i needed to see you hugo turned the page of his newspaper to see a photograph of general auchinleck standing outside his tent in the desert addressing the troops your daughter took a taxi to the docks yesterday morning she was carrying a suitcase when she boarded a passenger ship called the kansas star where she was given a job in reception she told her mother she was going to new york to visit her greataunt phyllis who i believe is lord harveys sister hugo would have been fascinated to know how mitchell had picked up that particular piece of information but he was still trying to work out why emma would want to take a job on the ship harry clifton had died on none of this made any sense he instructed mitchell to dig deeper and let him know immediately he picked up any more information about what emma was up to just before mitchell left to catch the train back to temple meads he told hugo that german bombers had razed broad street to the ground hugo couldnt imagine why this would be of any interest to him until mitchell reminded him that it was the street on which tillys tea shop had stood he thought mr barrington ought to know that some developers were taking an interest in mrs cliftons old site hugo thanked mitchell for the information without suggesting that it was of any real interest to him hugo telephoned mr prendergast at the national provincial bank the moment he got back to lowndes square i expect youre calling about broad street were the bank managers opening words yes i heard the site of tillys tea shop might be up for sale the whole streets up for sale following the bombing said prendergast most of the shopkeepers have lost their livelihoods and because it was an act of war they cant claim insurance so could i pick up the tillys site for a reasonable price frankly you could pick up the whole street for next to nothing in fact if you have any spare cash mr barrington i would recommend it as a shrewd investment thats assuming were going to win the war hugo reminded him i admit its a gamble but it could show a handsome return how much are we talking about for mrs cliftons site i think i could talk her into accepting two hundred pounds in fact as half the traders in that street bank with me i suspect you could pick up the whole shooting match for around three thousand its like playing monopoly with loaded dice ill look into it hugo said before putting the phone down what he couldnt tell prendergast was that he didnt even have monopoly money he tried to think of some way of raising that amount when all his usual contacts were unwilling to lend him even a fiver he couldnt ask olga for any more money unless he was willing to walk down the aisle with her and that was out of the question he wouldnt have given the matter another thought if he hadnt bumped into toby dunstable at one of archies parties toby and hugo had been contemporaries at eton hugo couldnt remember much about dunstable except that he regularly helped himself to the younger boys tuck when he was finally caught removing a tenshilling note from one of the boys lockers everyone assumed he would be expelled and possibly he would if he hadnt been the second son of the earl of dunstable when hugo asked toby what he was up to nowadays he said rather vaguely that he dabbled in property hugo told him about the investment opportunity broad street presented but he didnt seem that interested in fact hugo couldnt help noticing that toby didnt take his eyes off the diamond necklace that sparkled around olgas neck toby handed hugo his card saying if youre ever in need of some ready cash it shouldnt prove too difficult if you get my drift old fellow hugo got his drift but didnt take his hinted proposal at all seriously until olga asked him over breakfast one morning if a date had been fixed for the decree nisi hugo assured her it was imminent he left the house went straight to his club checked tobys card and gave him a call they agreed to meet at a pub in fulham where they sat alone in a corner drinking double gins and chatting about how our lads were faring in the middle east they only changed the subject when they were certain they couldnt be overheard all ill need is a key to the flat said toby and the exact location of her jewellery that shouldnt prove difficult hugo assured him the only thing youll have to do old chum is make sure youre both off the premises long enough for me to carry out the job when olga suggested over breakfast that she would like to see a production of rigoletto at sadlers wells hugo agreed to book a couple of tickets he would usually have made some excuse but on this occasion he readily agreed and even suggested that they have dinner at the savoy afterwards to celebrate celebrate what she asked my decree nisi has been granted he said casually she threw her arms around him just another six months my darling and youll be mrs barrington hugo took a small leather box out of his pocket and presented her with an engagement ring hed bought on approval in burlington arcade the previous day she approved he intended to return it in six months time the opera seemed to last for three months rather than the three hours suggested in the programme however hugo didnt complain as he knew toby would be making good use of the time over dinner in the river room hugo and olga discussed where they might spend their honeymoon as they couldnt travel abroad olga favoured bath which was a little too close to bristol for hugos liking but as it was never going to happen he happily went along with her suggestion in the taxi on the way back to lowndes square hugo wondered how long it would be before olga discovered that her diamonds were missing sooner than hed bargained for because when they opened the front door they found the whole place had been ransacked all that was left on the walls where the paintings had once hung were clear outlines to show what size they had been while olga broke down in hysterics hugo picked up the phone and dialled it took the police several hours to complete an inventory of everything that was missing because olga couldnt remain calm enough to answer their questions for more than a few moments at a time the chief inspector in charge of the case assured them that the details of the stolen items would be circulated to all the leading diamond merchants and art dealers in london within fortyeight hours hugo hit the roof when he caught up with toby dunstable in fulham the following afternoon his old school chum calmly took it on the chin like a heavyweight boxer when hugo was finally spent toby pushed a shoebox across the table i dont need a new pair of shoes hugo snapped perhaps not but youll be able to buy a shoe shop with whats inside there he said tapping the box hugo lifted the lid and stared into the box which contained no shoes but was packed with fivepound notes you neednt bother to count them said toby youll find theres ten thousand pounds in readies hugo smiled suddenly calm again youre a good fellow he said as he placed the lid back and ordered another two double ginandtonics as the weeks passed and the police failed to come up with any suspects the chief inspector didnt leave hugo in much doubt that he thought it was an inside job an expression he used again and again whenever they met however toby reassured him that they would never consider arresting the son of sir walter barrington unless they had castiron proof of his guilt that would convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt olga asked hugo where his new suits had come from and how he could possibly afford a bugatti he showed her the cars logbook which confirmed that hed owned it before they met what he didnt tell her was how fortunate hed been that the dealer hed reluctantly sold it to still had it on his books as the end of the period after which the decree absolute would be granted was fast approaching hugo began to prepare for what they call in military circles an exit strategy that was when olga announced that she had some wonderful news to share with him wellington once told a junior officer that timing was everything in life and who was hugo to disagree with the victor of waterloo especially when the great mans prophecy was about to apply to him he was reading the times over breakfast when he turned to the obituaries and saw a picture of his father staring out at him he tried to read it without olga discovering that both their lives were about to change in hugos opinion the thunderer had given the old man a good sendoff but it was the last paragraph of his record that most interested him sir walter barrington is succeeded by his only surviving son hugo who will inherit the title however what the times didnt add was and all that therein is maisie clifton maisie could still remember the pain shed experienced when her husband didnt come home at the end of his evening shift she knew arthur was dead even though it would be years before her brother stan was willing to tell her the truth about how her husband had died at the dockyard that afternoon but that pain was nothing compared to being told that her only son had been buried at sea after the devonian had been struck by a german torpedo hours after war had been declared maisie could still recall the last time shed seen harry hed come to visit her at the grand hotel that thursday morning the restaurant was packed with a long queue of customers waiting to be seated hed stood in line but when he saw his mother bustling in and out of the kitchen without a moment to spare he slipped away assuming she hadnt noticed him he was always a thoughtful boy and he knew she didnt approve of being interrupted at work and if the truth be told he also knew she wouldnt have wanted to hear that hed left oxford to join the navy sir walter barrington dropped by the next day to let maisie know that harry had sailed on the morning tide as fourth officer on the ss devonian and would be back within the month to join the crew of hms resolution as an ordinary seaman as he intended to go off in search of german uboats in the atlantic what he didnt realize was that they were already searching for him maisie planned to take the day off when harry returned but it was not to be knowing how many other mothers had lost their offspring because of this evil and barbaric war didnt help dr wallace the senior medical officer on the ss kansas star was waiting by her front door in still house lane when she returned home after work that october evening he didnt need to tell her why he was there it was etched on his face they sat in the kitchen and the doctor told her hed been responsible for the welfare of those sailors whod been dragged from the ocean following the sinking of the devonian he assured her that hed done everything in his power to save harrys life but unhappily hed never regained consciousness in fact of the nine sailors he tended to that night only one had survived a tom bradshaw the devonians third officer who was evidently a friend of harrys bradshaw had written a letter of condolence which dr wallace had promised to deliver to mrs clifton as soon as the kansas star returned to bristol he had kept his word maisie felt guilty the moment the doctor had left to return to his ship she hadnt even offered him a cup of tea she placed tom bradshaws letter on the mantelpiece next to her favourite photograph of harry singing in the school choir when she returned to work the following day her colleagues at the hotel were kind and solicitous and mr hurst the hotel manager suggested she took a few days off she told him that was the last thing she needed instead she took on as much overtime as she could handle in the hope that it might dull the pain it didnt many of the young men who worked at the hotel were leaving to join the armed forces and their places were being taken by women it was no longer considered a stigma for a young lady to work and maisie found herself taking on more and more responsibility as the number of male staff dwindled the restaurant manager was due to retire on his sixtieth birthday but maisie assumed that mr hurst would ask him to stay on until the end of the war it came as a shock when he called her into his office and offered her the job youve earned it maisie he said and head office agrees with me id like a couple of days to think about it she replied before leaving the office mr hurst didnt raise the subject for another week and when he did maisie suggested that perhaps she should be put on a months trial he laughed its usual he reminded her for the employer not the employee to insist on a months trial within a week theyd both forgotten about the trial period because although the hours were long and her new responsibilities were onerous maisie had never felt more fulfilled she knew that when the war was over and the lads returned from the front shed go back to being a waitress shed have gone back to being a prostitute if it had meant harry would be among those who came home maisie didnt need to be able to read a newspaper to know that the japanese air force had destroyed the american fleet at pearl harbor and the citizens of the united states had risen as one against a common enemy and joined the allies because for days it was the only subject on everyones lips it wasnt long before maisie met her first american thousands of yanks found their way to the west country over the next couple of years and many of them were billeted in an army camp on the outskirts of bristol some of the officers began to dine in the hotel restaurant but no sooner had they become regulars than they would disappear never to be seen again maisie was continually painfully reminded that some of them were no older than harry but that changed when one of them did return maisie didnt immediately recognize him when he wheeled himself into the restaurant and asked for his usual table she had always thought she was good at remembering names and even better when it came to faces you have to be when you cant really read and write but the moment she heard that southern drawl the penny dropped its lieutenant mulholland isnt it no mrs clifton its major mulholland now ive been sent back here to recuperate before they pack me off home to north carolina she smiled and showed him to his usual table although he wouldnt allow her to assist him with his wheelchair mike as he insisted maisie call him did become a regular turning up twice even three times a week maisie laughed when mr hurst whispered you know hes sweet on you i think youll find my courting days are over she replied dont kid yourself he countered youre in your prime maisie i can tell you major mulhollands not the first man whos asked me if youre walking out with anyone try not to forget mr hurst that im a grandmother i wouldnt tell him that if i was you said the manager maisie failed to recognize the major a second time when he came in one evening on crutches the wheelchair clearly having been abandoned another month and the crutches were replaced by sticks and it wasnt much longer before they too became relics of the past one evening major mulholland telephoned to book a table for eight he had something to celebrate he told maisie she assumed he must be returning to north carolina and for the first time she realized how much she would miss him she didnt consider mike a handsome man but he had the warmest smile and the manners of an english gentleman or as he once pointed out a southern gentleman it had become fashionable to badmouth the americans since theyd taken up residence on bases in britain and the oft repeated jibe that they were oversexed overpaid and over here could be heard on the lips of many bristolians whod never even met an american not least maisies brother stan and nothing she could say would change his mind by the time the majors celebration dinner had come to an end the restaurant was almost empty on the stroke of ten a fellow officer rose to toast mikes health and congratulate him as the party was about to leave and return to camp before curfew maisie told him on behalf of the whole staff how pleased they all were that he had fully recovered and was well enough to go home im not going home maisie he said laughing we were celebrating my promotion to deputy commander of the base im afraid youre stuck with me until this war is over maisie was delighted by the news and was taken by surprise when he added its the regimental dance next saturday and i wonder if you would do me the honour of being my guest maisie was speechless she couldnt remember the last time shed been asked out on a date she wasnt sure how long he stood there waiting for her to respond but before she could do so he said im afraid it will be the first time ive stepped on to a dance floor for several years me too maisie admitted maisie always deposited her wages and her tips in the bank on friday afternoon she didnt take any money home because she didnt want stan to find out she was earning more than he was her two accounts were always in credit and every time the current account showed a balance of ten pounds five would be transferred to her savings account her little nest egg as she described it just in case something went wrong after her financial setback with hugo barrington she always assumed that something would go wrong that friday she emptied her purse out on to the counter and the teller began to sort the coins into neat little piles as he did every week thats four shillings and nine pence mrs clifton he said filling in her account book thank you said maisie as he slid the book under the grille she was putting it back in her purse when he added mr prendergast wondered if he could have a word with you maisies heart sank she considered bank managers and rent collectors a breed who only ever dispensed bad news and she had good cause in mr prendergasts case because the last time hed asked to see her it was to remind her there were insufficient funds in her account to cover harrys fees for his last term at bristol grammar school she reluctantly headed off in the direction of the managers office good morning mrs clifton said mr prendergast rising from behind his desk as maisie entered his office he motioned her to a seat i wanted to speak to you about a private matter maisie felt even more apprehensive she tried to recall if shed written any cheques during the past couple of weeks that might have caused her account to be overdrawn she had bought a smart dress for the dance mike mulholland had invited her to on the american base but it was secondhand and well within her budget a valued client of the bank mr prendergast began has enquired about your plot of land in broad street where tillys tea shop once stood but i assumed id lost everything when the building was bombed not everything said prendergast the deeds of the land remain in your name but what could it possibly be worth said maisie now that the germans have flattened most of the neighbourhood when i last walked down chapel street it was nothing more than a bomb site that may well be the case replied mr prendergast but my client is still willing to offer you two hundred pounds for the freehold two hundred pounds repeated maisie as if shed won the pools that is the sum he is willing to pay confirmed prendergast how much do you think the land is worth asked maisie taking the bank manager by surprise ive no idea madam he replied im a banker not a property speculator maisie remained silent for a few moments please tell your client that id like a few days to think about it yes of course said prendergast but you ought to be aware that my client has instructed me to leave the offer on the table for one week only then ill have to make my decision by next friday wont i said maisie defiantly as you wish madam said prendergast when maisie rose to leave ill look forward to seeing you next friday when maisie left the bank she couldnt help thinking that the manager had never addressed her as madam before during her walk home past blackcurtained houses she only ever took the bus when it was raining she started to think about how she might spend two hundred pounds but these thoughts were soon replaced by wondering who could advise her as to whether it was a fair price mr prendergast had made it sound like a reasonable offer but which side was he on perhaps shed have a word with mr hurst but long before she reached still house lane she decided that it would be unprofessional to involve her boss in a personal matter mike mulholland seemed a shrewd intelligent man but what would he know about the value of land in bristol as for her brother stan there would be absolutely no point in seeking his opinion as hed be sure to say take the money and run girl and come to think about it the last person she wanted to know about her potential windfall was stan by the time maisie had turned into merrywood lane darkness was falling and the residents were preparing for blackout she was no closer to resolving the problem as she passed the gates of harrys old primary school a flood of happy memories returned and she silently thanked mr holcombe for all hed done for her son while he was growing up she stopped on the spot mr holcombe was a clever man after all hed been to bristol university and got a degree surely he could advise her maisie turned back and walked towards the school gates but when she entered the playground there was no one to be seen she checked her watch a few minutes past five all the children would have gone home some time ago so mr holcombe had probably already left for the day she walked across the playground opened the school door and stepped into a familiar corridor it was as if time had stood still the same red brick walls just a few more initials etched into them the same colourful paintings pinned up on the wall just by different children the same football cups just won by another team although where school caps had once hung gas masks had taken their place she recalled the first time shed come to see mr holcombe to complain about the red marks shed found on harrys backside at bathtime hed remained calm while she lost her temper and maisie had left an hour later in no doubt who the guilty party was maisie noticed a light coming from under the door of mr holcombes classroom she hesitated took a deep breath and knocked softly on the pebbled glass come on in said the cheerful voice she remembered so well she entered the room to find mr holcombe seated behind a large pile of books pen scratching across paper she was about to remind him who she was when he leapt up and said this is a pleasant surprise mrs clifton especially if its me youre looking for yes it is maisie replied a little flustered im sorry to bother you mr holcombe but i need some advice and i didnt know who else to turn to im flattered said the schoolmaster offering her a tiny chair normally occupied by an eightyearold how can i help maisie told him about her meeting with mr prendergast and the offer of for her piece of land on broad street do you think its a fair price she asked ive no idea said mr holcombe shaking his head i have no experience of such matters and id be worried about giving you the wrong advice actually i thought it might be another matter youd come to see me about another matter repeated maisie yes i hoped youd seen the notice on the board outside the school and wanted to apply apply for what she asked one of the governments new schemes for night classes designed to help people like you who are clearly intelligent but havent had the opportunity to continue their education maisie didnt want to admit that even if shed seen the notice she would have struggled to read it im too overworked to consider taking on anything else at the moment she said what with the hotel and and im sorry to hear that said mr holcombe because i think youd be an ideal candidate ill be taking most of the classes myself and it would have given me particular pleasure to teach the mother of harry clifton its just that it would only be for an hour twice a week he continued refusing to give up the classes are in the evenings and theres nothing to stop you dropping out if you decided they werent for you it was kind of you to think of me mr holcombe perhaps when i havent got quite so much on my plate she stood up and shook hands with the schoolmaster im sorry i couldnt help you with your problem mrs clifton he said as he accompanied her to the door mind you its a nice problem to have it was good of you to spare the time mr holcombe she replied before leaving maisie walked back down the corridor across the playground and out through the school gates she stood on the pavement and stared at the notice board how she wished she could read maisie had only taken a taxi a couple of times in her life once to harrys wedding in oxford and then only from the local station and on a second occasion quite recently when shed attended her fathers funeral so when an american staff car drew up outside still house lane she felt a little embarrassed and only hoped the neighbours had their curtains drawn as she came down the staircase wearing her new red silk dress with padded shoulders and belted at the waist very fashionable before the war she spotted her mother and stan staring out of the window the driver got out of the car and knocked on the front door he looked unsure that hed come to the right address but when maisie opened the door he understood immediately why the major had invited this particular belle to the regimental dance he gave maisie a smart salute and opened the back door of the car thank you she said but id prefer to sit in the front once the driver had found his way back on to the main road maisie asked him how long hed been working for major mulholland all my life maam man and boy im not sure i understand said maisie we both come from raleigh north carolina once this wars over ill be goin home to my old job in the majors factory i didnt know the major owned a factory several maam in raleigh hes known as the cornonthecob king corn on the cob queried maisie you aint seen nothin like it in bristol maam to truly appreciate corn on the cob it has to be boiled covered in melting butter and eaten straight after its picked and preferably in north carolina so whos running the factories while the cornonthecob king is away fighting the germans young joey his second son with a little help from his sister sandy would be my guess he has a son and a daughter back home had two sons and a daughter maam but sadly mike junior was shot down over the philippines maisie wanted to ask the corporal about mike seniors wife but felt that the young man might have been embarrassed by questions on that subject so she moved on to safer ground and asked about his home state finest in the fortyeight he replied and didnt stop talking about north carolina until they reached the camp gate when the guard spotted the car he immediately raised the barrier and gave maisie a smart salute as they drove on into the compound the major asked me to take you straight to his quarters maam so you can have a drink before going across to the dance the car drew up outside a small prefabricated house and she spotted mike standing on the doorstep waiting to greet her she jumped out of the car before the driver could open the door and walked quickly up the path to join him he bent down kissed her on the cheek and said come on in honey id like you to meet some of my colleagues he took her coat and added you look just swell like one of your corn on the cobs suggested maisie more like one of our north carolina peaches he said as he guided her towards a noisy room full of laughter and animated voices now lets make everyone jealous because theyre about to find out that im escorting the belle of the ball maisie entered a room filled with officers and their dates she couldnt have been made to feel more welcome she couldnt help wondering if shed been the guest of an english major a few miles up the road at the wessex regimental hq would they also have treated her as their equal mike guided her around the room introducing her to all his colleagues including the camp commander who clearly approved as she moved from group to group she couldnt help noticing several photographs scattered around the room on tables bookshelves and the mantelpiece of what could only have been mikes wife and children just after nine oclock the guests made their way to the gymnasium where the dance was being held but not before the dutiful host had helped all the ladies on with their coats this gave maisie the opportunity to look more closely at one of the photographs of a beautiful young woman my wife abigail said mike when he came back into the room a great beauty like you i still miss her she died of cancer almost five years ago now thats something all of us should be declaring war on im so sorry said maisie i didnt mean no now youve discovered just how much we have in common i understand exactly how you feel having lost a husband and a son but hell this is an evening to celebrate not to feel sorry for ourselves so come on honey now youve made all the officers jealous lets go and make the other ranks sore maisie laughed as she took his arm they left the house and joined a stream of boisterous young people who were all heading in the same direction once she was on the dance floor the youthful and exuberant americans made maisie feel as if shed known them all her life during the evening several of the officers asked her for a dance but mike rarely let her out of his sight when the band struck up the last waltz she couldnt believe how quickly the evening had flown by once the applause had died down everyone remained on the floor the band played a number unfamiliar to maisie but which served to remind everyone else in the room that their country was at war many of the young men who stood to attention with hand on heart lustily singing the starspangled banner would not live to celebrate their next birthday like harry what an unnecessary waste of life maisie thought as they walked off the dance floor mike suggested that they return to his quarters and enjoy a glass of southern comfort before the corporal drove her home it was the first bourbon maisie had ever drunk and it quickly loosened her tongue mike i have a problem she said once shed settled on the sofa and her glass had been refilled and as ive only got a week to solve it i could do with a dollop of your southern common sense fire away honey said mike but i ought to warn you that if limeys are involved ive never been able to get on their wavelength in fact youre the first one ive been able to relax with are you sure youre not an american maisie laughed thats sweet of you mike she took another swig of bourbon by which time she felt ready to do far more than just tell him her immediate problems it all began many years ago when i owned a tea shop in broad street called tillys its now nothing more than a derelict bomb site but someone is offering me two hundred pounds for it so whats the problem asked mike i have no idea what its really worth well one things for certain as long as theres a chance the germans might return and continue their bombing raids no one is going to be rebuilding anything on that site at least not until the war is over mr prendergast described his client as a property speculator sounds more like a profiteer to me said mike someone who buys derelict land on the cheap so when the war is over theyll be able to make a quick killing frankly that sort of spiv will do anything to make a fast buck and ought to be strung up but isnt it just possible that two hundred pounds is a fair price depends on your marriage value maisie sat bolt upright not sure shed heard him correctly i dont understand what you mean you say the whole of broad street was bombed and not one building survived yes but why would that make my little plot any more valuable if this speculator guy has already got his hands on every other bit of land in the street youre in a strong position to strike a bargain in fact you should demand a dowry because your plot may be the one piece of land that withheld will prevent him from rebuilding the entire block although thats the last thing hed want you to find out so how do i discover if my little site has marriage value tell your bank manager that you wont settle for less than four hundred pounds and youll find out soon enough thank you mike said maisie thats good advice she smiled took another swig of southern comfort and passed out in his arms when maisie came down for breakfast the following morning she couldnt remember whod driven her home or how shed got upstairs to her room i put you to bed said her mother as she poured her a cup of tea a nice young corporal drove you home he even helped me get you up the stairs maisie sank into a chair before taking her mother slowly through the evening leaving her in no doubt how much shed enjoyed mikes company and youre sure hes not married asked her mother hold your horses mum it was only our first date did he seem keen i think he asked me to the theatre next week but im not sure which day or which theatre she said as her brother stan came into the room stan plonked himself down at the end of the table and waited for a bowl of porridge to be placed in front of him before gulping down the contents like a dog drinking water on a hot day when hed finished he flicked off the top of a bottle of bass and drank it in one draught ill have another he said as its sunday he added burping loudly maisie never spoke during stans morning ritual and she usually slipped off to work before he had time to air his opinions on anything that crossed his mind she rose from her place and was just about to leave for the morning service at st marys when he bellowed sit down woman i want a word with you before you go to church maisie would have liked to walk out without responding but stan wasnt beyond dragging her back and giving her a black eye if the mood took him she sat back down so what are you doin about that two hundred nicker youre in line for he demanded how did you find out mum told me all about it last night when you were out on the town getting laid by your american fancy man maisie frowned at her mother who looked embarrassed but said nothing for your information stan major mulholland is a gentleman and what i do in my spare time is none of your business if hes an american you stupid bitch let me warn you they dont wait to be asked they think everythins theirs by right you speak with your usual firsthand knowledge on the subject no doubt said maisie trying to remain calm yanks are all the same said stan they only want one thing and once theyve got it they bugger off back home and leave us to finish the job just like they did in the first war maisie realized there was no point in continuing the conversation so she just sat there hoping this particular storm would blow over quickly you still havent told me what youre doin about the two hundred quid said stan i havent made up my mind yet said maisie in any case how i spend my money has got nothing to do with you its got everything to do with me said stan because half of its mine and how do you work that out asked maisie on account of the fact that youre livin in my house for a start so im entitled and let me warn you girl in case youre thinkin of doublecrossin me if i dont get my fair share ill beat you so black and blue even an american negro wont give you a second look you make me sick stan said maisie not half as sick as ill make you if you dont cough up because then ill maisie stood up marched out of the kitchen ran down the hall grabbed her coat and was out of the front door before stan had come to the end of his tirade when she checked the lunch bookings that sunday maisie quickly realized shed have to make sure that two of her customers were seated as far away from each other as possible she put mike mulholland on his usual table and patrick casey on the far side of the room so there wasnt any chance of them bumping into each other she hadnt set eyes on patrick for nearly three years and wondered if hed changed did he still have those irresistible good looks and irish charm that had so captivated her when theyd first met one of her questions was answered the moment he entered the room how nice to see you after all this time mr casey she said before accompanying him to his table several middleaged women took a second look at the handsome irishman as he crossed the room will you be staying with us for long this time mr casey maisie asked as she passed him a menu that depends on you said patrick he opened the menu but didnt study its contents maisie hoped that no one noticed her blush she turned to see mike mulholland waiting by reception he would never allow anyone but maisie to show him to his table she hurried across and whispered hello mike ive reserved your usual table would you like to follow me i sure would once mike had turned his attention to the menu although he always had the same two dishes every sunday soup of the day followed by boiled beef and yorkshire pudding she walked back across the room to take patricks order during the next two hours maisie kept a close eye on both men while at the same time trying to supervise a hundred other customers when the diningroom clock struck three there were only two people left in the room john wayne and gary cooper thought maisie waiting to see who would draw first at the ok corral she folded mikes bill put it on a plate and took it across to him he paid it without checking another great meal he said before adding in a whisper i hope were still on for the theatre tuesday night we sure are honey said maisie teasing him then ill see you at the old vic at eight he said as a waitress passed by his table ill look forward to that sir and you can be sure ill pass on your compliments to the chef mike stifled a laugh before leaving the table and strolling out of the dining room he looked back at maisie and smiled once he was out of sight maisie took patricks bill across to him he checked every item and left a large tip are you doing anything special tomorrow evening he asked giving maisie that smile she remembered so well yes im attending an evening class youre kidding me said patrick no and i mustnt be late because its the first lesson of a twelveweek course she didnt tell him that she hadnt finally decided whether to go through with it or not then it will have to be tuesday said patrick i already have a date on tuesday do you really or are you just saying that to get rid of me no im going to the theatre then what about wednesday or is that your night for algebraic equations no composition and reading out loud thursday said patrick trying not to sound exasperated yes im free on thursday said maisie as another waitress passed by their table thats a relief said patrick i was beginning to think id have to book in for a second week just to get an appointment maisie laughed so what do you have in mind i thought wed start by going to mrs clifton maisie swung round to find the hotel manager mr hurst standing behind her when youve finished with this customer he said perhaps youd be kind enough to join me in my office maisie thought shed been discreet but now she feared she might even get the sack because it was against company policy for members of staff to fraternize with the customers that was how shed lost her previous job and pat casey had been the customer in question on that occasion she was grateful that patrick slipped out of the restaurant without another word and once shed checked the till she reported to mr hursts office take a seat mrs clifton i have a rather serious matter to discuss with you maisie sat down and gripped the arms of the chair to stop herself shaking i could see you were having another busy day a hundred and fortytwo covers said maisie almost a record i dont know how im going to replace you he said before adding but management make these decisions not me you understand its out of my hands but i enjoy my job said maisie that may well be the case but i have to tell you that on this occasion i agree with head office maisie sat back ready to accept her fate they have made it clear continued mr hurst that they no longer want you to work in the dining room and have asked me to replace you as soon as possible but why because theyre keen for you to go into management frankly maisie if you were a man youd already be running one of our hotels congratulations thank you said maisie as she began to think about the implications lets get the formalities out of the way shall we said mr hurst as he pulled open his desk drawer and extracted a letter youll need to study this carefully he said it details your new terms of employment once youve read it sign it return it to me and ill send it back to head office that was when she made the decision maisie was fearful of making a fool of herself when she reached the school gate she nearly turned back and would have done if she hadnt seen another woman older than herself entering the building she followed her through the front door and along the corridor stopping when she reached the classroom she peeped inside hoping to find the room so full that no one would notice her but there were only seven other people present two men and five women she crept to the back of the classroom and took a seat behind the two men hoping she couldnt be seen maisie immediately regretted her decision because if shed taken a seat by the door she could have escaped more easily she bowed her head when the door opened and mr holcombe swept into the room he took his place behind the desk in front of the blackboard tugged the lapels of his long black gown and peered down at his pupils he smiled when he spotted mrs clifton seated near the back im going to start by writing out all twentysix letters of the alphabet he began and i want you to call them out as i write them down he picked up a piece of chalk and turned his back on the class he wrote the letter a on the blackboard and several voices could be heard in unison b a veritable chorus c everyone except maisie when he came to z maisie mouthed the letter im now going to point to a letter at random and see if you can still identify it the second time round maisie called out over half of them and on her third attempt she was leading the chorus when the hour was up only mr holcombe would have realized it was her first lesson in twenty years and maisie wasnt in any hurry to go home by the time we meet again on wednesday said mr holcombe you must all be able to write the twentysix letters of the alphabet in their correct order maisie intended to have the alphabet mastered by tuesday so there would be no possibility of her making a mistake to those of you who are unable to join me in the pub for a drink ill see you on wednesday maisie assumed you had to be invited to join mr holcombe so she slipped out of her chair and headed for the door while the others surrounded the schoolmasters desk with a dozen questions will you be coming to the pub mrs clifton asked the schoolmaster just as maisie reached the door thank you mr holcombe id like that she heard herself saying and joined the others as they left the room and strolled across the road to the ship inn one by one the other pupils drifted off until only the two of them were seated at the bar do you have any idea just how bright you are asked mr holcombe after hed bought her another orange juice but i left school at twelve and i still cant read or write you may have left school too early but youve never stopped learning and as youre harry cliftons mother youll probably end up teaching me harry taught you daily without realizing it but then i knew very early on that he was brighter than me i only hoped i could get him to bristol grammar school before he found it out for himself and did you asked maisie smiling it was a damn closerun thing admitted holcombe last orders shouted the barman maisie looked at the clock behind the bar she couldnt believe it was already and blackout regulations had to be adhered to it seemed natural that mr holcombe should walk her home after all theyd known each other for so many years on the way through the unlit streets he told her many more stories about harry which made her both happy and sad it was clear that mr holcombe also missed him and she felt guilty for not thanking him many years before when they reached the front door of her home in still house lane maisie said i dont know your first name arnold he said shyly it suits you she said may i call you arnold yes of course and you must call me maisie she took out her front door key and placed it in the lock goodnight arnold see you on wednesday an evening at the theatre brought back many happy memories for maisie of the days when patrick casey would take her to the old vic whenever he visited bristol but just as the memory of patrick had faded and shed begun to spend time with another man with whom she felt there might be a future the damned leprechaun bounced back into her life hed already told her that there was a reason he wanted to see her and she wasnt in much doubt what that reason was she didnt need him to throw her life into turmoil yet again she thought about mike one of the kindest and most decent men shed ever come across and guileless in his attempts to hide his feelings for her one thing patrick had instilled in her was never to be late for the theatre he felt there was nothing more embarrassing than treading on peoples toes as you made your way in darkness to the inevitable centre seats after the curtain had risen mike was already standing in the foyer holding a programme when maisie walked into the theatre ten minutes before the curtain was due to rise as soon as she saw him she smiled and couldnt help thinking how he always raised her spirits he returned her smile and gave her a gentle kiss on the cheek i dont know a lot about noël coward he admitted as he handed her the programme but ive just been reading a synopsis of the play and it turns out to be about a man and a woman who cant make up their mind who they should marry maisie said nothing as they entered the stalls she began to follow the letters of the alphabet backwards until she reached h when they made their way to the centre of the row she wondered how mike had managed to get such superb seats for a soldout show once the lights faded and the curtain rose he took her hand he only let go when owen nares made his entrance and the audience burst into applause maisie became entranced by the story even if it was a little too close for comfort but the spell was broken when the loud whine of a siren drowned out mr naress words an audible groan went up around the auditorium as the actors hurried off stage to be replaced by the theatre manager who efficiently organized an exit strategy that would have gladdened the heart of a regimental sergeant major bristolians had long been familiar with flying visits from germans who had no intention of paying for their theatre tickets mike and maisie made their way out of the theatre and down the steps to a bleak but familiar shelter that had become a home from home for regular theatregoers the audience grabbed any place that was available for the unticketed performance the great social equalizer as clement attlee had described life in an airraid shelter not my idea of a date said mike placing his jacket on the stone floor when i was young said maisie as she sat down on the jacket many a young fellow tried to get me down here but youre the first one whos succeeded mike laughed as she began to scribble something on the cover of the programme im flattered he said placing an arm gently around her shoulder as the ground started to shake with bombs that sounded perilously close youve never been to america have you maisie he asked trying to take her mind off the air raid ive never been to london admitted maisie in fact the furthest ive ever travelled is to westonsupermare and oxford and as both trips turned out to be disastrous id be perhaps better off staying at home mike laughed id love to show you america he said particularly the south i think wed have to ask the germans to take a few nights off before we could consider doing that said maisie as the allclear sounded a ripple of applause burst out in the shelter and everyone emerged from the unscheduled interval and made their way back into the theatre once theyd taken their seats the theatre manager walked on to the stage the performance will continue with no interval he announced but should the germans decide to pay us another visit it will have to be cancelled im sorry to say there will be no refunds german regulations he announced a few people laughed within moments of the curtain going back up maisie once again lost herself in the story and when the actors finally took their bows the whole audience rose in appreciation not only for the performance but for another small victory over the luftwaffe as mike described it harveys or the pantry asked mike as he picked up the programme on which each letter of the plays title had been crossed out and rewritten below arranged in alphabetical order a e e i i l p r s t v v the pantry said maisie not wanting to admit that on the one occasion shed been to harveys with patrick shed spent the entire evening glancing around the tables dreading the thought that lord harveys daughter elizabeth might be dining there with hugo barrington mike took a long time studying the menu which surprised maisie because the choice of dishes was so limited he usually chatted about what was taking place back at camp or the fort as he liked to call it but not tonight not even the oftrepeated grumbles about limeys not understanding baseball she began to wonder if he wasnt feeling well is everything all right mike she asked he looked up theyre sending me back to the states he said as a waiter appeared by their side and asked if they would like to order great timing thought maisie but at least it gave her a little time to think and not about what she wanted to eat once theyd ordered and the waiter had left them mike tried again ive been assigned to a desk job in washington maisie leaned across the table and took his hand i pressed them to let me stay for another six months so i could be with you but they turned my request down im sorry to hear that said maisie but please dont say anything maisie because im finding this difficult enough already though god knows ive given it enough thought this was followed by another long silence i realize weve only known each other for a short time but my feelings havent changed since the first day i set eyes on you maisie smiled and i wondered he continued hoped prayed that you might consider coming back to america with me as my wife maisie was speechless im so very flattered she eventually managed but couldnt think of anything else to say of course i realize youll need time to think it over im sorry that the ravages of war dont allow for the niceties of a long courtship when do you go home at the end of the month so if you did say yes we could get married at the base and fly back together as man and wife he leant forward and took her hand ive never felt more certain about anything in my whole life he said as the waiter reappeared by their side so which one of you is the chopped liver maisie didnt sleep that night and when she came down to breakfast the following morning she told her mother that mike had proposed to her jump at it was mrs tancocks immediate response youll never get a better chance to begin a new life and lets face it she added glancing sadly at the photograph of harry on the mantelpiece theres no longer any reason for you to stay here maisie was about to express her one reservation when stan burst into the room she got up from the table id better get a move on if im not going to be late for work dont think ive forgotten about that undred quid you owe me he shouted as she left the room maisie was sitting on the edge of her seat in the front row when mr holcombe entered the classroom at seven that evening her hand shot up several times during the next hour like a tiresome schoolgirl who knows all the answers and wants teacher to notice her if he did he didnt let on could you start coming in on tuesdays and thursdays in future maisie mr holcombe asked as they strolled across to the pub with the rest of the class why asked maisie arent i good enough am i not good enough corrected the schoolmaster without thinking on the contrary he added ive decided to put you into the intermediate class before this lot he said indicating her fellow classmates with the sweep of an arm become overwhelmed but wont i be out of my depth arnold i do hope so but no doubt youll have caught up by the end of the month by which time ill have to put you into the advanced class maisie didnt respond as she knew it wouldnt be too long before she would have to tell arnold that shed made other plans for the end of the month once again they ended up sitting alone together at the bar and once again he accompanied her back to still house lane only this time when maisie took the frontdoor key out of her bag she thought he looked as if he might be trying to summon up the courage to kiss her surely not hadnt she got enough problems to cope with i was just wondering he said which book you ought to read first it wont be a book said maisie as she placed the key in the lock it will be a letter patrick casey had breakfast lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant on monday tuesday and wednesday maisie assumed that he would take her to dinner at the plimsoll line in the hope that it might evoke past memories in fact she hadnt been back to the restaurant since patrick had disappeared off to ireland she was right and it did maisie was determined that she would not be seduced once again by patricks charm and good looks and she intended to tell him about mike and their plans for the future but as the evening progressed she found it more and more difficult to raise the subject so what have you been up to since i was last in bristol patrick asked her over a predinner drink in the lounge bar not that anyone could miss the fact that youre running the best hotel restaurant in the city while somehow managing to fit in evening classes at the same time yes i shall miss all that when she began wistfully when what asked patrick its only a twelveweek course said maisie trying to recover in twelve weeks time said patrick my bet is youll be the one whos giving the classes what about you what have you been up to she asked as the head waiter came over to tell them their table was ready patrick didnt answer the question until theyd sat down at a quiet table in the corner of the room you may remember i was promoted to deputy manager of the company about three years ago which is why i had to go back to dublin i havent forgotten why you had to go back to dublin said maisie with some feeling i tried to return to bristol several times but once war broke out it proved almost impossible and it didnt help that i couldnt even write to you well that problem may well be solved in the near future then you can read to me in bed and how has your company fared during these hard times asked maisie steering the conversation back on to safer ground actually a lot of irish companies have done rather well out of the war because of the countrys neutrality weve been able to deal with both sides youre willing to do business with the germans said maisie in disbelief no as a company weve always made it clear where our allegiances lie but you wont be surprised to know that quite a few of my countrymen are happy to do business with the germans because of that we had a couple of tough years but once the americans entered the war even the irish began to believe the allies might end up on the winning side that was her chance to tell patrick about one american in particular but she didnt take it so what brings you to bristol now she asked the simple answer is you me maisie quickly tried to think of a convincing way of bringing the conversation back on to a less personal footing yes our managing director will be retiring at the end of the year and the chairman has asked me to take his place congratulations said maisie relieved to be back on safer ground and you want me to take over as your deputy she added trying to make light of it no i want you to be my wife maisies tone changed didnt it cross your mind patrick just for one moment during the past three years that someone else might have come into my life daily said patrick which is why i came over to find out if there was someone else maisie hesitated yes there is and has he asked you to marry him yes she whispered have you accepted his proposal no but ive promised to let him have my answer before he returns to america at the end of the month she said more firmly does that mean im still in with a chance frankly patrick the odds are stacked against you you havent been in touch for nearly three years and suddenly you turn up out of the blue as if nothings changed patrick made no attempt to defend himself while a waiter served their main courses i wish it was that easy he said patrick it was always that easy if youd asked me to marry you three years ago i would have happily jumped on the first boat to ireland i couldnt ask you then maisie put down her knife and fork without taking a bite i always wondered if you were married why didnt you say something at the time i was so much in love with you patrick i was even willing to suffer that indignity and to think i only returned to ireland because i couldnt ask you to be my wife and has that changed yes bryony left me over a year ago she met someone who took more interest in her than i did which wouldnt have been difficult oh my god said maisie why is my life always so complicated patrick smiled im sorry if ive disrupted your life again but i wont give in so easily this time not while i still believe theres even the slightest chance he leant across the table and took her hand a moment later the waiter reappeared by their side an anxious look on his face as he looked at the two untouched plates of food that had been allowed to go cold is everything all right sir he asked no said maisie its not maisie lay awake and thought about the two men in her life mike so reliable so kind who she knew would be faithful until his dying day and patrick so exciting so alive with whom there would never be a dull moment she changed her mind several times during the night and it didnt help that she had so little time to make her decision when she came down to breakfast the following morning her mother didnt mince her words when maisie asked her if given the choice which of the two men she should marry mike she said without hesitation hell be far more reliable in the long run and marriage is for the long run in any case she added ive never trusted the irish maisie considered her mothers words and was about to ask another question when stan barged into the room once hed gulped down his porridge he barged into her thoughts arent you seeing the bank manager today maisie didnt reply i thought so just make sure you come straight home with my undred quid if you dont my girl ill come looking for you how nice to see you again madam said mr prendergast as he ushered maisie into a chair just after four oclock that afternoon he waited for maisie to settle before he ventured have you been able to give my clients generous offer some thought maisie smiled with one word mr prendergast had given away whose interests he was looking after i most certainly have maisie replied and i would be obliged if you would tell your client that i wouldnt consider accepting a penny less than four hundred pounds mr prendergasts mouth opened and as its possible that i might be leaving bristol at the end of the month perhaps youd also be kind enough to tell your client that my generous offer will only remain on the table for one week mr prendergast closed his mouth ill try to drop by again at the same time next week mr prendergast when you can let me know your clients decision maisie rose from her place and gave the manager a sweet smile before adding i do hope you have a pleasant weekend mr prendergast maisie was finding it difficult to concentrate on mr holcombes words and not just because the intermediate class was proving far more demanding than the beginners which she already regretted forsaking when her hand did go up it was more often to ask a question than to answer one arnolds enthusiasm for his subject was contagious and he had a real gift for making everyone feel equal and the most insignificant contribution seem important after twenty minutes of going back over what he called the basics he invited the class to turn to page of little women numbers werent a problem for maisie and she quickly turned to the correct page he then invited a woman in the third row to stand and read the first paragraph while the rest of the class followed each sentence word for word maisie placed a finger at the top of the page and tried desperately to follow the narrative but she soon lost her place when the schoolmaster asked an elderly man in the front row to read the same passage a second time maisie was able to identify some of the words but she was praying that arnold wouldnt ask her to be next she breathed a sigh of relief when someone else was invited to read the paragraph again when the new reader sat down maisie bowed her head but she didnt escape and finally im going to ask mrs clifton to stand up and read us the same passage maisie rose uncertainly from her place and tried to concentrate she recited the entire paragraph almost word for word without once looking down at the page but then she had spent so many years having to remember long complicated restaurant orders mr holcombe gave her a warm smile as she sat down what a remarkable memory you have mrs clifton no one else seemed to pick up the significance of his words i would now like to move on and discuss the meaning of certain words in that paragraph in the second line for example youll see the word betrothal an oldfashioned word can anyone give me a more modern example that has the same meaning several hands shot up and maisies would have been among them if she hadnt recognized a familiar heavy step heading towards the classroom door miss wilson said the schoolmaster marriage said miss wilson as the door burst open and maisies brother barged into the room he stopped in front of the blackboard his eyes darting from person to person can i help you asked mr holcombe politely no said stan ive come to collect whats rightfully mine so keep your mouth shut schoolmaster if you know whats good for you and mind your own business his eyes settled on maisie maisie had intended to tell him at breakfast that it would be another week before she found out if mr prendergasts valued customer had accepted her counteroffer but as stan walked purposefully towards her she knew she wasnt going to be able to convince him that she didnt have the money wheres my cash he demanded long before hed reached her desk i havent got it yet said maisie youre going to have to wait another week like hell i am said stan who grabbed her by the hair and began to drag her screaming out from behind her desk as he moved towards the door the rest of the class sat mesmerized only one man stood in his path get out of my way schoolmaster i suggest you let go of your sister mr tancock if you dont want to be in even more trouble than you already are from you and whose army laughed stan if you dont fuck off mate ill knock your teeth right down your throat and i promise you that wont be a pretty sight stan didnt see the first punch coming and when it landed in his solar plexus he bent double so he could be excused for not recovering before the second blow landed on his chin the third sent him sprawling to the ground like a felled oak stan lay on the floor clutching his stomach expecting a boot to be put in the schoolmaster towered over him and waited for him to recover when he finally did stan rose unsteadily to his feet never once taking his eyes off the schoolmaster as he edged slowly towards the door when he thought he was at a safe distance he looked back at maisie who was still lying on the floor curled up in a ball sobbing quietly youd better not come home till youve got my money my girl he growled if you know whats good for you without another word he stormed out into the corridor even after maisie heard the door slam she was still too frightened to move the rest of the class gathered up their books and slipped quietly out of the room no one would be visiting the pub that night mr holcombe walked quickly across the room knelt down beside his charge and gathered her trembling body in his arms it was some time before he said youd better come home with me tonight maisie ill make up a bed in the spare room you can stay for as long as you want to emma barrington sixtyfourth and park said emma as she jumped into a taxi outside sefton jelkss wall street office she sat in the back of the cab and tried to think about what she would say to greataunt phyllis when or if she got past her front door but the car radio was so loud that she couldnt concentrate she thought about asking the driver to turn the volume down but she had already learnt that new york cabbies are deaf when it suits them although rarely dumb and never mute while listening to the commentator describe in an excited voice what had taken place at somewhere called pearl harbor emma accepted that her greataunts first question was bound to be what brings you to new york young lady followed by how long have you been here and then why has it taken you so long to come and see me to none of these questions did she have a plausible answer unless she was willing to tell greataunt phyllis everything something she wanted to avoid because she hadnt even told her own mother everything she might not even realize she has a greatniece thought emma and was it possible there was a longstanding family feud that emma didnt know about or perhaps her greataunt was a recluse divorced remarried or insane all emma could remember was once seeing a christmas card signed phyllis gordon and alistair was one a husband and the other a son to make matters worse emma didnt have any proof that she really was phylliss greatniece emma was even less confident about facing her by the time the cab drew up outside the front door and shed handed over another quarter emma stepped out of the cab looked up at the imposing fourstorey brownstone and changed her mind several times about knocking on the door she finally decided to walk round the block in the hope that she would feel more confident by the time she returned as she walked down th street emma couldnt help noticing that new yorkers were scurrying back and forth at an unusually frantic pace with shocked and anxious looks on their faces some were looking up at the sky surely they didnt believe the next japanese air raid would be on manhattan a paperboy standing on the corner of park kept shouting out the same headline america declares war read the latest by the time emma arrived back outside the front door she had decided she couldnt have picked a worse day to call on her greataunt perhaps it might be wise to return to her hotel and leave it until tomorrow but why would tomorrow be any different her money had almost run out and if america was now at war how would she get back to england and more important to sebastian whom shed never intended to be apart from for more than a couple of weeks she found herself climbing the five steps to face a shiny black door with a large highly polished brass knocker perhaps greataunt phyllis was out perhaps shed moved emma was about to knock when she noticed a bell in the wall with the word tradesmen printed underneath she pressed the bell took a pace back and waited far happier to face the person who dealt with tradesmen a few moments later a tall elegantly dressed man wearing a black jacket striped trousers a white shirt and grey tie opened the door how may i help you maam he enquired clearly having decided that emma wasnt a tradesman my name is emma barrington she told him i wondered if my greataunt phyllis is at home she is indeed miss barrington monday being her bridge afternoon if youll be kind enough to step inside ill let mrs stuart know youre here i could always come back tomorrow if it isnt convenient stammered emma but hed closed the door behind her and was already halfway down the corridor as emma stood waiting in the hall she couldnt have missed which country the stuarts hailed from a portrait of bonnie prince charlie above crossed swords and a stuart clan shield hung on the wall at the far end of the hall emma walked slowly up and down admiring paintings by peploe fergusson mctaggart and raeburn she remembered that her grandfather lord harvey owned a lawrence that hung in the drawing room of mulgelrie castle she had no idea what her greatuncle did for a living but he clearly did it well the butler returned a few minutes later the same impassive look on his face perhaps he hadnt heard the news about pearl harbor madam will receive you in the drawing room he said how like jenkins he was no surplus words an even pace that never varied and somehow he managed to display deference without being deferential emma wanted to ask him which part of england he came from but knew he would consider that an intrusion so she followed him along the corridor without another word she was about to start climbing the stairs when the butler stopped pulled back a lift grille and stood aside to allow her to step in a lift in a private house emma wondered if greataunt phyllis was an invalid the lift shuddered as it reached the third floor and she stepped out into a beautifully furnished drawing room if it were not for the noise of traffic blaring horns and police sirens coming from the street below one might have been in edinburgh if youll wait here please madam emma remained by the door while the butler walked across the room to join four elderly ladies who were seated around a log fire enjoying tea and crumpets while listening intently to a radio that had never blared when the butler announced miss emma barrington they all turned and looked in emmas direction she couldnt mistake which one of them was lord harveys sister long before she rose to greet her the flamingred hair the impish smile and the unmistakable air of someone who isnt first generation it surely cant be little emma she declared as she left the group and sailed across to her greatniece the hint of a highland lilt still in her voice the last time i saw you dear girl you were wearing a gymslip short white socks and daps and carrying a hockey stick i felt quite concerned for the little boys playing in the opposing team emma smiled the same sense of humour as her grandfather and now look at you youve blossomed into such a beautiful creature emma blushed so what brings you to new york my dear im sorry to intrude like this greataunt emma began glancing nervously towards the other three ladies dont worry about them she whispered after the presidents announcement theyve got more than enough to keep themselves occupied now where are your bags my bag is at the mayflower hotel emma told her parker she said turning to the butler send someone round to pick up miss emmas things from the mayflower and then prepare the main guest bedroom because after todays news i have a feeling my greatniece is going to be with us for quite some time the butler melted away but greataunt no buts she said raising a hand and i must insist that you stop calling me greataunt it makes me sound like an old battleaxe now its quite possible that i am an old battleaxe but i do not wish to be reminded of it on a regular basis so please call me phyllis thank you greataunt phyllis emma said phyllis laughed i do so love the english she said now come and say hello to my friends they will be fascinated to meet such an independent young lady so frightfully modern quite some time turned out to be more than a year and as each day passed emma was more and more desperate to be reunited with sebastian but was only able to follow her sons progress from letters sent by her mother and occasionally grace emma wept when she learned of the death of gramps because shed thought hed live for ever she tried not to think about who would take over the company and assumed her father wouldnt have the nerve to show his face in bristol phyllis couldnt have made emma feel more at home if shed been her own mother emma quickly discovered that her greataunt was a typical harvey generous to a fault and the page defining the words impossible implausible and impractical must have been torn out of her dictionary at an early age the main guest bedroom as phyllis called it was a suite of rooms overlooking central park which came as a pleasant surprise after emmas cramped single room at the mayflower emmas second surprise was when she came down for dinner on her first evening and found her greataunt dressed in a flamingred gown drinking a glass of whiskey and smoking a cigarette in a long holder she smiled at the thought of being described as modern by this woman my son alistair will be joining us for dinner she announced before parker had been given a chance to pour emma a glass of harveys bristol cream hes a lawyer and a bachelor she added two disadvantages from which hes most unlikely to recover but at times he can be quite amusing if somewhat dry cousin alistair arrived a few minutes later dressed in a dinner jacket for a meal with his mother thus embodying the british abroad emma guessed that he was around fifty and a good tailor had disguised the fact that he was carrying a few surplus pounds his humour may have been a little dry but he was unquestionably bright fun and well informed even if he did go on a bit about the case he was currently working on it came as no surprise when his proud mother told emma over dinner that alistair was the youngest partner in his law firm since the death of her husband emma assumed that phyllis knew why he wasnt married she couldnt be sure if it was the delicious food the excellent wine or simply american hospitality that caused her to relax so much that she ended up telling them everything that had happened to her since greataunt phyllis had last seen her on a hockey field at red maids school by the time emma had explained why she crossed the atlantic despite the risks involved they were both staring at her as if shed just landed from another planet once alistair had devoured the last morsel of his fruit tart and turned his attention to a large brandy he spent the next thirty minutes crossexamining their unexpected guest as if he were opposing counsel and she a hostile witness well i must say mother he said as he folded his napkin this case looks far more promising than amalgamated wire versus new york electric i cant wait to cross swords with sefton jelks whats the point of wasting our time on jelks emma said when its far more important to find harry and clear his name i couldnt agree more said alistair but i have a feeling that one will lead to the other he picked up emmas copy of the diary of a convict but didnt open it just studied the spine whos the publisher asked phyllis viking press said alistair removing his glasses harold guinzburg no less do you think he and max lloyd might have collaborated in this deception alistair asked turning to his mother certainly not she replied your father once told me hed come up against guinzburg in court i remember he described him as a formidable adversary but a man who would never consider bending the law let alone breaking it then were in with a chance said alistair because if thats the case he wont be pleased to discover whats been perpetrated in his name however ill need to read the book before i arrange a meeting with the publisher alistair looked across the table and smiled at emma i shall be fascinated to discover what mr guinzburg makes of you young lady and i said phyllis will be equally fascinated to discover what emma makes of harold guinzburg touché mama alistair conceded after parker had poured alistair a second brandy and relit his cigar emma ventured to ask him what he thought her chances were of being allowed to visit harry in lavenham ill make an application on your behalf tomorrow he promised between puffs lets see if i cant do a little better than your helpful detective my helpful detective repeated emma unusually helpful said alistair once he realized jelks was involved im amazed detective kolowski even agreed to see you im not at all surprised that he was helpful said phyllis winking at emma and you say your husband wrote this book no mr guinzburg said emma harry clifton and i are not married although i am the mother of his child but yes harry did write the diary of a convict while he was incarcerated at lavenham harold guinzburg removed the halfmoon spectacles from the end of his nose and took a closer look at the young woman seated on the opposite side of his desk i do have a slight problem with your claim he said and i feel i should point out that every sentence of the diary was written in mr lloyds hand he copied harrys manuscript word for word for that to be possible mr lloyd would have had to share a cell with tom bradshaw which shouldnt be difficult to check or they could have worked together in the library suggested alistair if you were able to prove this said guinzburg it would place my company and by that i mean me in an invidious position to say the least and in the circumstances i might be wise to seek legal advice we would like to make it clear from the start interjected alistair who was sitting on emmas right that we came here in a spirit of goodwill as we felt you would wish to be acquainted with my cousins story it was the only reason i agreed to see you said guinzburg as i was a great admirer of your late father i didnt realize you knew him i didnt said guinzburg he appeared for the other side in a dispute my company was involved in and i left the courtroom wishing hed been on my side however if i am to accept your cousins story he continued i hope you wont mind if i ask miss barrington one or two questions im happy to answer any questions you might have mr guinzburg said emma but may i ask if youve read harrys book i make a point of reading every book we publish miss barrington i cant pretend i find all of them enjoyable or even finish every one but in the case of the diary of a convict i knew the moment id finished the first chapter that it would be a bestseller i also made a note in the margin on page twoeleven guinzburg picked up the book and flicked through its pages before beginning to read ive always wanted to be an author and am currently working on an outline plot for the first in a series of detective novels based in bristol bristol said emma interrupting the old man how could max lloyd possibly know anything about bristol there is a bristol in mr lloyds home state of illinois miss barrington said guinzburg as max pointed out when i told him id be interested in reading the first in the series you never will emma promised him hes already submitted the opening chapters of mistaken identity said guinzburg and i have to say theyre rather good and were those chapters written in the same style as the diary yes and before you ask miss barrington they are also written in the same hand unless youre suggesting that they were also copied hes got away with it once why wouldnt he try it on a second time but do you have any real proof that mr lloyd didnt write the diary of a convict said guinzburg beginning to sound a little irritated yes sir i am the emma in the book if that is the case miss barrington i agree with the authors judgement that you are indeed a great beauty and you have already proved to quote him to be both spirited and combative emma smiled and youre an old flatterer mr guinzburg as he wrote spirited and combative said guinzburg placing his halfmoon spectacles back on his nose nevertheless i doubt your claim would stand up in a court of law sefton jelks could put half a dozen emmas on the witness stand who would swear blind they had known lloyd all their lives i need something more substantial dont you find it a little too much of a coincidence mr guinzburg that the day thomas bradshaw arrives at lavenham just happens to be the first day of the diary mr lloyd explained that he didnt start writing the diary until he became the prison librarian when he had more time on his hands but how do you explain there being no mention of his last night in prison or the morning hes released he just has breakfast in the canteen and reports to the library for another days work what explanation do you have asked guinzburg peering at her over the top of his glasses whoever wrote the diary is still in lavenham and probably working on the next volume that shouldnt be difficult for you to verify said guinzburg raising an eyebrow i agree said alistair and ive already submitted an application for miss barrington to visit mr bradshaw on compassionate grounds and am waiting for the warden of lavenham to give his approval may i be allowed to ask a few more questions miss barrington in the hope of removing any lingering doubts asked guinzburg yes of course said emma the old man smiled pulled his waistcoat down pushed up his spectacles and studied a list of questions on a notepad in front of him who is captain jack tarrant sometimes known as old jack my grandfathers oldest friend they served in the boer war together which grandfather sir walter barrington the publisher nodded and did you consider mr tarrant to be an honourable man like caesars wife he was beyond reproach he was probably the single biggest influence in harrys life but isnt he to blame for the fact that you and harry are not married is that question relevant asked alistair jumping in i suspect were about to find out said guinzburg not taking his eyes off emma jack felt it was his duty to alert the vicar to the possibility that my father hugo barrington might also be harrys father said emma her voice breaking was that necessary mr guinzburg snapped alistair oh yes said the publisher picking up the copy of the diary of a convict from his desk i am now convinced that it was harry clifton and not max lloyd who wrote this book emma smiled thank you she said even if im not sure what i can do about it i know exactly what im going to do about it said guinzburg to start with i shall release a revised edition as quickly as the presses can print it with two major changes harry cliftons name will replace max lloyds on the front cover and his photograph will appear on the back cover assuming you have one miss barrington several said emma including one of him on the kansas star as it sailed into new york harbour ah that would also explain began guinzburg but if you were to do that interrupted alistair all hell will break loose jelks will issue a writ on behalf of his client for defamation and claim punitive damages lets hope so said guinzburg because if he does the book will undoubtedly go back to number one on the bestseller lists and remain there for several months however if he does nothing as i suspect will be the case it will show that he believes hes the only person who has seen the missing exercise book harry clifton wrote about ending up in lavenham i knew there was another one said emma there certainly is said guinzburg and it was your mention of the kansas star that made me realize the manuscript mr lloyd submitted as the opening chapters of mistaken identity is nothing more than an account of what happened to harry clifton before he was sentenced for a crime he didnt commit may i be allowed to read it said emma the moment emma walked into alistairs office she knew something had gone badly wrong the familiar warm welcome and gracious smile had been replaced by a furrowed brow theyre not going to let me visit harry are they she said no said alistair your application was turned down but why you told me i was well within my rights i phoned the warden earlier this morning and asked him exactly the same question and what reason did he give you can hear for yourself said alistair because i made a tape recording of our conversation listen carefully because it gives us three very important clues without another word he leant forward and pressed the play button on his grundig two spools began to whirl lavenham correctional facility id like to speak to the warden whos calling alistair stuart im a new york attorney silence followed by another ringing tone a longer silence then ill put you through sir emma was sitting on the edge of her seat when the warden came on the line good morning mr stuart this is warden swanson how can i help you good morning mr swanson i made an application ten days ago on behalf of my client miss emma barrington requesting a visit on compassionate grounds to an inmate thomas bradshaw at the earliest possible opportunity i received a letter from your office this morning saying the application has been turned down i can find no legal reason for mr stuart your application was processed in the usual way but i was unable to grant your request because mr bradshaw is no longer being held at this establishment another long silence followed although emma could see that the tape was still turning alistair eventually said and which institution has he been transferred to i am not at liberty to disclose that information mr stuart but under the law my client has the right to the prisoner has signed a document waiving his rights a copy of which id be happy to send to you but why would he do that said alistair casting a line into the water i am not at liberty to disclose that information repeated the warden not rising to the bait are you at liberty to divulge anything at all concerning thomas bradshaw asked alistair trying not to sound exasperated another long silence followed and although the tape was still running emma wondered if the warden had put his phone down alistair placed a finger to his lips and suddenly the voice was back on the line harry clifton was released from prison but continued to serve his sentence another long pause and i lost the best librarian this prisons ever had the phone went dead alistair pressed the stop button before he spoke the warden went as far as he could to assist us by mentioning harry by name said emma yes but also by letting us know he served in the prison library until very recently that explains how lloyd got his hands on the diaries emma nodded but you said there were three important clues she reminded him what was the third that harry was released from lavenham but continues to serve his sentence then he must be in another prison said emma i dont think so said alistair now were at war my bet is that tom bradshaw will be serving the rest of his sentence in the navy what makes you think that its all in the diaries said alistair he picked up a copy of the diary of a convict from his desk turned to a page marked by a bookmark and read the first thing ill do when i get back to bristol is join the navy and fight the germans but theyd never have allowed him to return to england before hed completed his sentence i didnt say hed joined the british navy oh god said emma as the significance of alistairs words sank in at least we know harrys still alive said alistair cheerfully i wish he was still in prison hugo barrington sir walters funeral was held at st marys redcliffe and the late chairman of barringtons shipping line would surely have been proud to see such a packed congregation and to hear the heartfelt eulogy delivered by the bishop of bristol after the service the mourners lined up to offer their condolences to sir hugo as he stood at the north door of the church alongside his mother he was able to explain to those who asked that his daughter emma was marooned in new york although he couldnt tell them why shed gone there in the first place and his son giles of whom he was inordinately proud was interned in a german pow camp in weinsberg information his mother had passed on to him the previous evening during the service lord and lady harvey hugos exwife elizabeth and their daughter grace had all been seated in the front row of the church on the opposite side of the aisle from hugo all of them had paid their respects to the grieving widow and had then pointedly left without acknowledging his presence maisie clifton had sat at the back of the church her head bowed throughout the service and left moments after the bishop had delivered the final blessing when bill lockwood the managing director of barringtons stepped forward to shake hands with his new chairman and to express his condolences all hugo had to say was i expect to see you in my office at nine oclock tomorrow morning mr lockwood gave a slight bow a reception was held at barrington hall after the funeral and hugo mingled among the mourners several of whom were about to discover that they no longer had a job with barringtons when the last guest had departed hugo went up to his bedroom and changed for dinner he entered the dining room with his mother on his arm once she was seated he took his fathers place at the head of the table during the meal while there were no servants in attendance he told his mother that despite his fathers misgivings he was a reformed character he went on to assure her that the company was in safe hands and that he had exciting plans for its future hugo drove his bugatti through the gates of barringtons shipyard for the first time in over two years at the following morning he parked in the chairmans space before making his way up to his fathers old office as he stepped out of the lift on the fourth floor he saw bill lockwood pacing up and down the corridor outside his office a red folder under his arm but then hugo had always intended to keep him waiting good morning hugo said lockwood stepping forward hugo strolled past him without responding good morning miss potts he said to his old secretary as if hed never been away ill let you know when im ready to see mr lockwood he added before walking through to his new office he sat down at his fathers desk that was how he still thought of it and he wondered how long that feeling would last and began to read the times once the americans and russians had entered the war far more people were beginning to believe in an allied victory he put down the paper ill see mr lockwood now miss potts the managing director entered the chairmans office with a smile on his face welcome back hugo he said hugo gave him a fixed stare and said chairman im sorry chairman said a man who had served on the board of barringtons when hugo was in short trousers id like you to bring me up to date on the companys financial position of course chairman lockwood opened the red folder hed been carrying under his arm as the chairman hadnt invited him to sit he remained standing your father he began managed to guide the company prudently through troubled times and despite several setbacks not least the germans continually targeting the docks during their nightly bombing raids in the early part of the war with the help of government contracts we have managed to weather the storm so we should be in good shape once this dreadful war is over cut the waffle said hugo and get to the bottom line last year continued the managing director turning a page the company made a profit of thirtyseven thousand four hundred pounds and ten shillings wouldnt want to forget the ten shillings would we said hugo that was always your fathers attitude said lockwood missing the sarcasm and this year our half yearly results suggest that were well placed to equal possibly even surpass last years results lockwood turned another page how many places are currently available on the board asked hugo the change of subject took lockwood by surprise and he had to turn several pages before he could respond three as unfortunately lord harvey sir derek sinclair and captain havens all resigned following your fathers death im glad to hear that said hugo it will save me the trouble of sacking them i presume chairman you would not wish me to record those sentiments in my minutes of this meeting i dont give a damn if you do or dont hugo said the managing director bowed his head and when are you due to retire was hugos next question ill be sixty in a couple of months time but if you felt chairman given the circumstances what circumstances as you will only just have got your feet under the table so to speak i could be persuaded to stay on for a couple more years thats good of you said hugo and the managing director smiled for the second time that morning but please dont put yourself out on my account two months will be just fine by me so whats the biggest challenge were facing at the moment we have recently applied for a major government contract to lease out our merchant fleet to the navy said lockwood once hed recovered were not the favourites but i think your father gave a good account of himself when the inspectors visited the company earlier this year so we should be taken seriously when will we find out not for some time i fear civil servants arent built for speed he added laughing at his own joke i have also prepared several discussion papers for your consideration chairman so that you will be well briefed before you chair your first board meeting i dont anticipate holding that many board meetings in the future said hugo i believe in leading from the front making decisions and standing by them but you can leave your briefing papers with my secretary and ill get round to them when i find the time as you wish chairman within moments of lockwood leaving his office hugo was on the move im going to visit my bank he said as he passed miss pottss desk shall i call mr prendergast and let him know youd like to see him miss potts asked as she hurried after him down the corridor certainly not said hugo i want to take him by surprise is there anything you need me to do before you return sir hugo miss potts enquired as he stepped into the lift yes see that the name on my door is changed before i get back miss potts turned round to look at the office door sir walter barrington chairman was displayed in gold leaf the lift door closed as hugo drove into the centre of bristol he felt that his first few hours as chairman could not have gone better all was finally right with the world he parked his bugatti outside the national provincial bank in corn street leant across and picked up a packet hed left under the passenger seat he strolled into the bank past the reception desk and headed straight for the managers office giving a little tap on the door before marching in a startled mr prendergast leapt up as hugo placed a shoebox on his desk and sank into the chair opposite him i hope im not interrupting anything important said hugo of course not sir hugo said prendergast staring at the shoebox im available for you at any time thats good to know prendergast why dont you begin by bringing me up to date on broad street the bank manager scurried across the room pulled open the drawer of a filing cabinet and extracted a thick folder which he placed on the table he sorted through some papers before he spoke again ah yes he said eventually heres what i was looking for hugo was tapping the arm of his chair impatiently of the twentytwo businesses which have ceased to trade in broad street since the bombing began seventeen have already accepted your offer of two hundred pounds or less for their freehold namely roland the florist bates the butcher makepeace what about mrs clifton has she accepted my offer im afraid not sir hugo mrs clifton said she wouldnt settle for less than four hundred pounds and has only given you until next friday to accept her offer has she be damned well you can tell her that two hundred pounds is my final offer that woman has never had a brass farthing to her name so i dont expect well have to wait too much longer before she comes to her senses prendergast gave a slight cough that hugo remembered well if you succeed in purchasing every property in the street except mrs cliftons four hundred pounds might turn out to be quite reasonable shes bluffing all we have to do is bide our time if you say so i do say so and in any case i know exactly the right man to convince the clifton woman that shed be wise to settle for two hundred pounds prendergast didnt look convinced but satisfied himself by asking is there anything else i can do to assist you yes said hugo removing the lid from the shoebox you can deposit this money into my personal account and issue me with a new cheque book of course sir hugo said prendergast looking into the box ill count it and issue you with a receipt and a cheque book but ill need to make an immediate withdrawal as i have my eye on a lagonda v winner of le mans said prendergast but then youve always been a pioneer in that particular field hugo smiled as he rose from his chair give me a call the moment mrs clifton realizes that two hundred pounds is all shes going to get do we still employ stan tancock miss potts hugo asked as he marched back into the office yes sir hugo replied his secretary following him into the room he works as a loader in the stock yard i want to see him immediately said the chairman as he slumped down behind his desk miss potts hurried out of the room hugo stared at the files piled on his desk which he was supposed to have read before the next board meeting he flicked open the cover of the top one a list of the unions demands following their last meeting with management he had reached number four on the list two weeks paid holiday each year when there was a tap on the door tancock to see you chairman thank you miss potts send him in stan tancock walked into the room removed his cloth cap and stood in front of the chairmans desk you wanted to see me guv he said looking a little nervous hugo glanced up at the squat unshaven docker whose beer belly didnt leave much doubt where most of his wage packet went on a friday night ive got a job for you tancock yes guv said stan looking more hopeful it concerns your sister maisie clifton and the plot of land she owns on broad street where tillys tea shop used to stand do you know anything about it yes guv some geezer offered her two hundred quid for it is that right said hugo removing his wallet from an inside pocket he extracted a crisp fivepound note and laid it on the desk hugo remembered the same licking of the lips and the same piggy eyes the last time hed bribed the man i want you to make sure tancock that your sister accepts the offer without the suggestion that im in any way involved he slid the fivepound note across the desk no problem said stan no longer looking at the chairman only at the fivepound note there will be another of those hugo said tapping his wallet the day she signs the contract consider it done guv hugo added casually i was sorry to hear about your nephew dont make much odds to me said stan got far too big for his boots in my opinion buried at sea i was told yeah moren two years back how did you find out ships doctor came to visit me sister didnt he and was he able to confirm that young clifton was buried at sea sure did even brought a letter from some mate who was on board the ship when harry died a letter said hugo leaning forward what did this letter say no idea guv maisie never opened it so what did she do with the letter still on the mantelpiece isnt it hugo extracted another fivepound note id like to see that letter hugo threw on the brakes of his new lagonda when he heard a paperboy shouting his name from a street corner sir hugo barringtons son decorated for gallantry at tobruk read all about it hugo leapt out of his car handed the paperboy a halfpenny and looked at a photograph of his son when he was school captain of bristol grammar that dominated the front page he climbed back into his car turned off the ignition and read all about it second lieutenant giles barrington of the st battalion the wessex son of sir hugo barrington bt has been awarded the military cross following action in tobruk lt barrington led a platoon across eighty yards of open desert killing a german officer and five other soldiers before overrunning an enemy dugout and capturing german infantry men from rommels crack afrika korps ltcol robertson of the wessex described lt barringtons action as displaying remarkable leadership and selfless courage in the face of overwhelming odds lt barringtons platoon commander captain alex fisher also an old bristolian was involved in the same action and mentioned in dispatches as was corporal terry bates a local butcher from broad street lt giles barrington mc was later captured by the germans when rommel sacked tobruk neither barrington nor bates is aware of their award for gallantry because both of them are currently prisoners of war in germany captain fisher has been reported as missing in action full story pages hugo sped home to share the news with his mother how proud walter would have been she said once shed finished reading the report i must call elizabeth immediately in case she hasnt heard the news it was the first time anyone had mentioned his former wifes name for a long while i thought youd be interested to know said mitchell that mrs clifton is wearing an engagement ring who would want to marry that bitch a mr arnold holcombe it seems whos he a schoolmaster teaches english at merrywood elementary in fact he used to teach harry clifton before he went to st bedes but that was years ago why havent you mentioned his name before theyve only recently met up again when mrs clifton began attending evening classes evening classes repeated hugo yes said mitchell shes been learning to read and write seems shes a chip off the young block what do you mean snapped hugo when the class took their final exam at the end of the course she came top did she now said hugo perhaps i should visit mr holcombe and let him know exactly what his fiancée was up to during the years he lost touch with her perhaps i should mention that holcombe boxed for bristol university as stan tancock found to his cost i can handle myself said hugo meanwhile i want you to keep an eye on another woman who just might prove every bit as dangerous for my future as maisie clifton mitchell removed a tiny notebook and pencil from an inside pocket her name is olga piotrovska and she lives in london at number fortytwo lowndes square i need to know everyone she comes into contact with particularly if shes ever interviewed by any members of your former profession spare no details however trivial or unpleasant you may consider them once hugo had finished speaking the notebook and pencil disappeared he then handed mitchell an envelope a sign that the meeting was over mitchell slipped his pay packet into his jacket pocket stood up and limped away hugo was surprised how quickly he became bored with being chairman of barringtons endless meetings to attend countless papers to read minutes to be circulated memos to be considered and a stack of mail that should have been replied to by return of post and on top of that before he left every evening miss potts would hand him a briefcase bulging with even more papers that had to be gone over by the time he was back behind his desk at eight the following morning hugo invited three chums to join the board including archie fenwick and toby dunstable in the hope that they would lessen his load they rarely showed up for meetings but still expected to receive their stipend as the weeks passed hugo began turning up at the office later and later and after bill lockwood reminded the chairman that it was only a few days to his sixtieth birthday when he would be retiring hugo capitulated and said that hed decided lockwood could stay on for another couple of years how kind of you to reconsider my position chairman said lockwood but i feel that having served the company for almost forty years the time has come for me to make way for a younger man hugo cancelled lockwoods farewell party that younger man was ray compton lockwoods deputy who had only been with the company for a few months and certainly hadnt got his feet under the table when he presented barringtons year results to the board hugo accepted for the first time that the company was only just breaking even and agreed with compton that the time had come to start laying off some of the dock labourers before the company couldnt afford to pay their wages as barringtons fortunes dwindled the nations future looked more hopeful with the german army retreating from stalingrad the british people began to believe for the first time that the allies could win the war confidence in the future started to seep back into the nations psyche as theatres clubs and restaurants began to reopen all over the country hugo longed to be back in town and to rejoin his social set but mitchells reports continued to make it clear that london was one city hed be wise to steer clear of the year didnt begin well for barringtons there were several cancelled contracts from customers who became exasperated when the chairman couldnt be bothered to answer their letters and several creditors began demanding payment one or two of them even threatening writs and then one morning a ray of sunlight appeared that hugo believed would solve all of the immediate cashflow problems it was a call from prendergast that raised hugos hopes the bank manager had been approached by the united dominion real estate company who were showing an interest in purchasing the broad street site i think sir hugo it would be prudent not to mention the figure over the phone prendergast intoned slightly pompously hugo was sitting in prendergasts office forty minutes later and even he gasped when he heard how much they were willing to offer twentyfour thousand pounds repeated hugo yes said prendergast and im confident thats their opening bid and i can push them up to nearer thirty remembering that your original outlay was less than three thousand pounds i think we can consider it a shrewd investment but theres a fly in the ointment a fly said hugo sounding anxious in the form of mrs clifton said prendergast the offer is conditional on you obtaining the freehold for the entire site including her plot offer her eight hundred hugo barked the prendergast cough followed although he didnt remind his client that had he taken his advice they could have closed a deal with mrs clifton for four hundred pounds some months ago and if she were ever to find out about united dominions offer ill let you know the moment ive heard from her was all prendergast said do that said hugo and while im here i need to withdraw a little cash from my private account im sorry sir hugo but that account is overdrawn at the present time hugo was sitting in the front seat of his sleek royal blue lagonda when holcombe pushed through the school door and began to walk across the playground he stopped to speak to a handyman who was giving the front gates a fresh coat of lilac and green paint the merrywood school colours thats a fine job youre doing alf thank you mr holcombe hugo heard the handyman say but i still expect you to concentrate more on your verbs and do try not to be late on wednesday alf touched his cap holcombe began walking along the pavement and pretended not to see hugo sitting behind the wheel of his car hugo allowed himself a smirk everyone gave his lagonda v a second look three young lads loitering on the pavement opposite hadnt been able to take their eyes off it for the past half hour hugo stepped out of the car and stood in the middle of the pavement but holcombe still ignored him he couldnt have been more than a stride away when hugo said i wonder if we could have a word mr holcombe my name is im well aware of who you are said holcombe and walked straight past him hugo chased after the schoolmaster its just that i felt you ought to know know what said holcombe stopping in his tracks and turning to face him what your fiancée did for a living not so very long ago she was forced into prostitution because you wouldnt pay for her sons he looked hugo straight in the eye your sons school fees when he was in his last two years at bristol grammar school theres no proof that harry clifton is my son said hugo defiantly there was enough proof for a vicar to refuse to allow harry to marry your daughter how would you know you werent there how would you know you ran away then let me tell you something you certainly dont know said hugo almost shouting this paragon of virtue that youre planning to spend the rest of your life with has swindled me out of a piece of land i owned in broad street let me tell you something you do know said holcombe maisie paid off every penny of your loan with interest and all you left her with was less than ten pounds to her name that lands now worth four hundred pounds said hugo immediately regretting his words and it belongs to me if it belonged to you said holcombe you wouldnt be trying to buy the site for twice that amount hugo was livid that he had allowed himself to reveal the extent of his interest in the site but he wasnt finished so when you have sex with maisie clifton do you have to pay for it schoolmaster because i certainly didnt holcombe raised a fist go on hit me goaded hugo unlike stan tancock id sue you for every penny youre worth holcombe lowered his fist and marched off annoyed with himself for having allowed barrington to rile him hugo smiled he felt he had delivered the knockout blow he turned round to see the lads on the other side of the road sniggering but then theyd never seen a lilac and green lagonda before when the first cheque bounced hugo simply ignored it and waited a few days before he presented it a second time when it came back again stamped refer to drawer he began to accept the inevitable for the next few weeks hugo found several different ways of getting around the immediate cash problem he first raided the office safe and removed the that his father always kept for a rainy day this was a thunderstorm and the old man had certainly never had to resort to the cash reserve to pay his secretarys wages once that had run out he reluctantly let go of the lagonda however the dealer politely pointed out that lilac and green werent this years colours and as sir hugo required cash he could only offer him half the original purchase price because the bodywork would have to be stripped and repainted hugo survived for another month with no other available assets to dispose of he began to steal from his mother first any loose change left lying about the house followed by coins in purses and then notes in bags it wasnt long before he bagged a small silver pheasant that had graced the centre of the diningroom table for years followed by its parents all of which flew to the nearest pawn shop hugo then moved on to his mothers jewellery he started with items she wouldnt notice a hat pin and a victorian brooch were quickly followed by an amber necklace she rarely wore and a diamond tiara which had been in the family for over a century and was only worn at weddings or ceremonial occasions he didnt anticipate there being many of those in the near future he finally turned to his fathers art collection first taking off the wall a portrait of his grandfather by a young john singer sargent but not before the housekeeper and the cook had handed in their notice having received no wages for over three months jenkins conveniently died a month later his grandfathers constable the mill at dunning lock was followed by his greatgrandfathers turner swans on the avon both of which had been in the family for over a century hugo was able to convince himself that it wasnt theft after all his fathers will had stated and all that therein is this irregular source of funds ensured that the company survived and only showed a small loss for the first quarter of the year that is if you didnt count the resignation of three more directors and several other senior members of staff who hadnt received their pay cheques on the last day of the month when asked hugo blamed the temporary setbacks on the war one elderly directors parting words were your father never found it necessary to use that as an excuse soon even the removable assets began to dwindle hugo knew that if he were to put barrington hall and its acres of parkland on the market it would announce to the world that a company that had declared a profit for over a hundred years was insolvent his mother continued to accept hugos assurances that the problem was only temporary and that given time everything would sort itself out after a time he started to believe his own propaganda when the cheques started to bounce again mr prendergast reminded him that there was an offer of on the table for his properties in broad street which prendergast pointed out would still show him a profit of what about the thirty thousand i was promised hugo shouted down the phone that offer is also still on the table sir hugo but it remains subject to your purchasing mrs cliftons freehold offer her a thousand he barked as you wish sir hugo hugo slammed the phone down and wondered what else could go wrong the phone rang again hugo was hidden away in a corner alcove of the railway arms a hotel hed never frequented before and never would again he nervously checked his watch every few minutes while he waited for mitchell to arrive the private detective joined him at am only minutes after the paddington express had pulled into temple meads station mitchell slipped into the chair opposite his only client although he hadnt received any remuneration for several months what is so urgent that it couldnt wait demanded hugo once a half pint of beer had been placed in front of the private detective im sorry to report sir mitchell began after taking a sip that the police have arrested your friend toby dunstable hugo felt a shiver shoot through his body theyve charged him with the theft of the piotrovska diamonds along with several paintings including a picasso and a monet that he tried to offload on agnews the mayfair art dealer toby will keep his mouth shut said hugo i fear not sir i am reliably informed that he has turned kings evidence in exchange for a lighter sentence it seems scotland yard are more interested in arresting the man behind the crime hugos beer went flat while he tried to take in the significance of mitchells words after a long silence the private detective continued i thought youd also want to know that miss piotrovska has hired sir francis mayhew kc to represent her why doesnt she just leave the police to deal with the case she did not seek sir franciss advice on the burglary but on two other matters two other matters repeated hugo yes i understand a writ is about to be served on you for breach of promise and miss piotrovska is also lodging a paternity suit naming you as the father of her daughter shell never be able to prove it among the evidence that will be presented to the court is the receipt for an engagement ring purchased from a burlington arcade jeweller and both her resident housekeeper and her ladys maid have signed affidavits confirming that you resided at fortytwo lowndes square for over a year for the first time in ten years hugo asked mitchell for his advice what do you think i should do he almost whispered if i found myself in your position sir id leave the country as soon as possible how long do you think ive got a week ten days at the most a waiter appeared by their side that will be one shilling and nine pence sir as hugo didnt move mitchell handed the waiter a florin and said keep the change once the private detective had left to return to london hugo sat alone for some time considering his options the waiter came over again and asked if hed like another drink but hugo didnt even bother to reply eventually he heaved himself up from his chair and made his way out of the bar hugo headed towards the city centre slower and slower with each pace until hed finally worked out what he had to do next he marched into the bank a few minutes later can i help you sir asked the young man on reception but hugo was halfway across the hall before hed had time to call the manager and warn him that sir hugo barrington was heading towards his office prendergast was no longer surprised that sir hugo always assumed he would be available at a moments notice but he was shocked to see that the chairman of barringtons hadnt bothered to shave that morning i have a problem that needs to be dealt with urgently hugo said as he sank into the chair opposite the manager yes of course sir hugo how can i be of assistance whats the most you could hope to raise for my properties on broad street but only last week i sent a letter advising you that mrs clifton has rejected your latest offer im well aware of that said hugo i meant without her site there is still an offer on the table of three thousand five hundred but i have reason to believe that were you to offer mrs clifton a little more she would release her site and the thirtythousandpound bid would still be valid i dont have any more time said hugo without explanation if that is the case im confident that i could press my client to raise his bid to four thousand which would still show you a handsome profit if i were to accept that offer i would need your assurance on one thing mr prendergast allowed himself a raised eyebrow that your client does not have and never has had any connection with mrs clifton i am able to give you that assurance sir hugo if your client was to pay me four thousand how much would that leave in my current account mr prendergast opened sir hugos file and checked the balance sheet eight hundred and twentytwo pounds and ten shillings he said hugo no longer joked about the ten shillings in which case i require eight hundred pounds in cash immediately and ill instruct you later where to send the proceeds of the sale the proceeds of the sale repeated prendergast yes replied hugo ive decided to place barrington hall on the market no one saw him leave the house he was carrying a suitcase and was dressed in a warm tweed suit a pair of stout brown shoes that had been made to last a heavy topcoat and a brown felt hat a casual glance and you would have taken him for a commercial traveller he walked to the nearest bus stop which was just over a mile away most of it his own land forty minutes later he boarded a green singledecker bus a mode of transport hed never used before he sat in the back seat not letting the suitcase out of his sight he handed the clippie a tenshilling note despite the fact that he was only asked for thruppence his first mistake if he hoped to avoid drawing attention to himself the bus continued on its way into bristol a journey he would normally cover in about twelve minutes in the lagonda but today it took over an hour before they finally pulled into the bus station hugo was neither the first nor the last passenger to get off he checked his watch pm hed left himself enough time he walked up the slope to temple meads station hed never noticed the slope but then hed never had to carry his own suitcase before where he joined a long queue and purchased a thirdclass single to fishguard he asked which platform the train would be leaving from and once hed found it stood at the far end under an unlit gas light when the train eventually pulled in he climbed aboard and found a seat in the middle of a thirdclass compartment which quickly filled up he placed his suitcase on the rack opposite him and rarely took his eyes off it a woman pulled open the carriage door and glanced into the crowded compartment but he didnt offer her his seat as the train pulled out of the station he let out a sigh of relief delighted to see bristol disappearing into the distance he sat back and thought about the decision hed made by this time tomorrow hed be in cork he wouldnt feel safe until his feet were treading on irish soil but they had to arrive in swansea on schedule if he hoped to link up with the train for fishguard the train pulled into swansea with half an hour to spare time for a cup of tea and a chelsea bun in the station buffet it wasnt earl grey or carwardines but he was too tired to care as soon as hed finished he exchanged the buffet for another dimly lit platform and waited for the fishguard train to appear the train was late but he was confident that the ferry wouldnt leave the harbour before all the passengers were on board after an overnight stay in cork he would book a passage on a ship any ship that was sailing to america there he would begin a new life with the money he made from the sale of barrington hall the idea of his ancestral home going under the hammer made him think about his mother for the first time where would she live once the house had been sold she could always join elizabeth at the manor house after all it had more than enough room failing that she could move in with the harveys who had three houses not to mention numerous cottages on their estates his thoughts then turned to the barrington shipping line a business that had been built up by two generations of the family while the third had managed to bring it to its knees quicker than a bishops blessing for a moment he thought about olga piotrovska thankful that he would never see her again he even spared a passing thought for toby dunstable who had been the cause of all his trouble emma and grace crossed his mind but not for very long hed never seen the point of daughters and then he thought about giles who had avoided him after escaping from weinsberg pow camp and returning to bristol people regularly asked after his war hero son and hugo had to make up some new story every time that would no longer be necessary because once he was in america the umbilical cord would finally be severed although in time and hugo was still determined it would be some considerable time giles would inherit the family title even if all that therein is was no longer worth the paper it was written on but most of the time he thought about himself an indulgence that was only interrupted when the train arrived at fishguard he waited for everyone else to leave the carriage before he took his suitcase down from the rack and stepped out on to the platform he followed the megaphone directions buses to the harbour buses to the harbour there were four he chose the third this time it was only a short journey and he couldnt miss the terminal despite the blackout another long thirdclass queue this time for the cork ferry after buying a oneway ticket he walked up the gangway stepped on board and found a nook that no selfrespecting cat would have curled up in he didnt feel safe until he heard two blasts on the foghorn and in the gentle swell felt the ship drifting away from the quayside once the ferry had passed the harbour wall he relaxed for the first time and was so exhausted he rested his head on the suitcase and fell into a deep sleep hugo couldnt be sure how long hed been asleep when he felt a tap on his shoulder he looked up to see two men towering over him sir hugo barrington one of them asked there didnt seem much point in denying it they yanked him up by the shoulders and told him he was under arrest they took their time reading out a long list of the charges but im on my way to cork he protested surely we must be beyond the twelvemile limit no sir said the second officer youre on your way back to fishguard several passengers leaned over the ships railings to get a closer view of the handcuffed man being escorted down the gangway who had been the cause of them being delayed hugo was bundled into the back of a black wolseley car and moments later he began the long journey back to bristol when the cell door opened a uniformed man brought in some breakfast on a tray not the kind of breakfast not the kind of tray and certainly not the kind of uniformed man sir hugo was accustomed to seeing first thing in the morning one look at the fried bread and tomatoes bathed in oil and he pushed the tray to one side he wondered how long it would be before this became part of his staple diet the constable returned a few minutes later took away the tray and slammed the cell door closed the next time the door opened two officers entered the cell and escorted hugo up the stone steps to the charge room on the first floor ben winshaw the barrington shipping lines company solicitor was waiting for him im so very sorry chairman he said hugo shook his head a look of resignation on his face what happens next he asked the superintendent told me theyll be charging you in the next few minutes youll then be taken to court where youll appear before a magistrate all you have to do is plead not guilty the superintendent made it clear that they would oppose any request for bail and would point out to the magistrate that you were arrested while trying to leave the country in possession of a suitcase containing eight hundred pounds the press i fear are going to have a field day hugo and his solicitor sat alone in the charge room and waited for the superintendent to appear the solicitor warned hugo that he should be prepared to spend several weeks in prison before the trial opened he suggested the names of four kcs who might be retained to defend him they had just settled on sir gilbert gray when the door opened and a sergeant walked in you are free to leave sir he said as if hugo had committed some minor traffic offence it was some time before winshaw recovered enough to ask will my client be expected to return later in the day not that im aware of sir hugo walked out of the police station a free man the story only made a small paragraph on page of the bristol evening news the hon toby dunstable second son of the eleventh earl of dunstable died of a heart attack while in custody at wimbledon police station it was derek mitchell who later filled in the details behind the story he reported that the earl had visited his son in his cell just a couple of hours before toby took his own life the officer on duty overheard several sharp exchanges between father and son during which honour the familys reputation and the decent thing to do in the circumstances were repeated again and again by the earl at the inquest held a fortnight later at wimbledon crown court the magistrate asked the officer in question if hed seen any pills pass between the two men during the earls visit no sir he replied i did not death by natural causes was the verdict delivered by the magistrates panel at wimbledon crown court later that afternoon mr prendergast has telephoned several times this morning chairman said miss potts as she followed sir hugo into his office and on the last occasion he emphasized that it was urgent if she was surprised to see the chairman unshaven and wearing a tweed suit that looked as if hed slept in it she said nothing hugos first thought on hearing that prendergast wanted to speak to him urgently was that the broad street deal must have fallen through and the bank would expect him to return its forthwith prendergast could think again and tancock said miss potts checking her notepad says he has some news that youll want to hear the chairman didnt comment but the most important thing she continued is the letter ive left on your desk i have a feeling youll want to read it immediately hugo began reading the letter even before hed sat down he then read it a second time but still couldnt believe it he looked up at his secretary many congratulations sir get prendergast on the phone barked hugo and then i want to see the managing director followed by tancock in that order yes chairman said miss potts and hurried out of the room while hugo waited for prendergast to come on the line he read the minister of shippings letter a third time dear sir hugo i am delighted to inform you that barrington shipping has been awarded the contract for the phone on hugos desk rang mr prendergast on the line announced miss potts good morning sir hugo the deference was back in the voice i thought youd want to know that mrs clifton has finally agreed to sell her site on broad street for a thousand pounds but ive already signed a contract to sell the rest of my property in the street to united dominion for four thousand and that contract is still on my desk said prendergast unfortunately for them and more fortunately for you the earliest time they could make an appointment to see me was at ten oclock this morning did you exchange contracts yes sir hugo i most certainly did hugos heart sank for forty thousand pounds i dont understand once i was able to assure united dominion that you were in possession of mrs cliftons plot as well as the deeds for every other freehold in the street they wrote out a cheque for the full amount well done prendergast i knew i could rely on you thank you sir all you need to do now is countersign mrs cliftons agreement and then i can bank united dominions cheque hugo glanced at his watch as its already gone four ill drop in to the bank first thing tomorrow morning the prendergast cough first thing sir hugo is nine oclock and may i ask if you still have the eight hundred pounds i advanced to you in cash yesterday yes i do but how can that still be of any significance i do consider it would be prudent sir hugo to pay mrs clifton her thousand pounds before we bank united dominions cheque for forty thousand we wouldnt want any embarrassing questions from head office at a later date quite so said hugo as he looked at his suitcase relieved that he hadnt spent one penny of the theres nothing more for me to say said prendergast other than to congratulate you on closing a most successful contract how do you know about the contract i beg your pardon sir hugo said prendergast sounding a little puzzled oh i thought you were referring to something else said hugo its of no importance prendergast forget i mentioned it he added as he put the phone down miss potts came back into the room the managing director is waiting to see you chairman send him straight in youve heard the good news ray said hugo as compton entered the room i have indeed chairman and it couldnt have come at a better time im not sure i understand said hugo youre due to present the companys annual results at next months board meeting and although well still have to declare a heavy loss this year the new contract will guarantee that we go into profit next year and for five years after that hugo reminded him waving the ministers letter triumphantly why dont you prepare the agenda for the board meeting but dont include the news about the government contract id rather like to make that announcement myself as you wish chairman ill see that all the relevant papers are on your desk by noon tomorrow compton added before leaving the room hugo read the ministers letter a fourth time thirty thousand a year he said out loud just as the phone on his desk rang again a mr foster from savills the estate agency is on the line said miss potts put him through good morning sir hugo my name is foster im the senior partner of savills i thought perhaps we ought to get together to discuss your instructions to sell barrington hall perhaps a spot of lunch at my club no need to bother foster ive changed my mind barrington hall is no longer on the market hugo said and put the phone down he spent the rest of the afternoon signing a stack of letters and cheques his secretary put in front of him and it was just after six oclock when he finally screwed the cap back on his pen when miss potts returned to collect all the correspondence hugo said ill see tancock now yes sir said miss potts with a hint of disapproval while hugo waited for tancock to appear he fell on his knees and opened the suitcase he stared at the that would have made it possible for him to survive in america while he waited for the funds raised by the sale of barrington hall now that same would be used to make him a fortune on broad street when he heard a knock on the door he snapped the lid of the suitcase closed and quickly returned to his desk tancock to see you said miss potts before closing the door behind her the docker marched confidently into the room and approached the chairmans desk so whats this news that cant wait asked hugo ive come to collect the other five quid what you owe me tancock said with a look of triumph in his eyes i owe you nothing said hugo but i talked my sister into selling that land you wanted didnt i we agreed on two hundred pounds and i ended up having to pay five times that amount so as i said i owe you nothing get out of my office and go back to work stan didnt budge and ive got that letter you said you wanted what letter the letter what our maisie got from that doctor off the american ship hugo had completely forgotten about the letter of condolence from harry cliftons shipmate and couldnt imagine that it would be of any significance now maisie had agreed to the sale ill give you a pound for it you said youd give me a fiver i suggest you leave my office while youve still got a job tancock ok ok said stan backing down you can have it for a quid whats it to me he took a crumpled envelope out of his back pocket and handed it over to the chairman hugo extracted a tenshilling note from his wallet and placed it on the desk in front of him stan stood his ground as hugo put his wallet back in an inside pocket and stared defiantly at him you can have the letter or the tenbob note take your choice stan grabbed the tenbob note and left the room grumbling under his breath hugo put the envelope to one side leant back in his chair and thought about how he would spend some of the profit hed made on the broad street deal once hed been to the bank and signed all the necessary documents he would walk across the road to the car saleroom he had his eye on a litre seater aston martin he would then drive it across town and visit his tailor he hadnt had a suit made for longer than he cared to remember and after the fitting lunch at the club where he would settle his outstanding bar bill during the afternoon he would set about replenishing the wine cellar at barrington hall and might even consider redeeming from the pawnbroker some of the jewellery his mother seemed to miss so much in the evening there was a tap at the door im just leaving said miss potts i want to get to the post office before seven to catch the last delivery do you need anything else sir no miss potts but i may be in a little late tomorrow as i have an appointment with mr prendergast at nine oclock of course chairman said miss potts as the door closed behind her his eyes settled on the crumpled envelope he picked up a silver letter opener slit the envelope open and pulled out a single sheet of paper his eyes impatiently scanned the page searching for relevant phrases new york september th my dearest mother i did not die when the devonian was sunk i was plucked out of the sea the vain hope that at some time in the future i might be able to prove that arthur clifton and not hugo barrington was my father i must beg you to keep my secret as steadfastly as you kept your own for so many years your loving son harry hugos blood ran cold all the triumphs of the day evaporated in an instant this was not a letter he wanted to read a second time or more important that he wished anyone else to become aware of he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and took out a box of swan vestas he lit a match held the letter over the wastepaper basket and didnt let it go until the frail black cinders had evaporated into dust the best ten shillings hed ever spent hugo was confident that he was the only person who knew clifton was still alive and he intended it to remain that way after all if clifton kept his word and continued to go by the name of tom bradshaw how could anyone else find out the truth he suddenly felt sick when he remembered that emma was still in america had she somehow discovered that clifton was alive but surely that wasnt possible if she hadnt read the letter he needed to find out why shed gone to america he had picked up the phone and begun to dial mitchells number when he thought he heard footsteps in the corridor he replaced the receiver assuming it must be the night watchman checking to see why his light was still on the door opened and he stared at a woman he had hoped never to see again how did you get past the guard on the gate he demanded i told him we had an appointment to see the chairman a long overdue appointment we said hugo yes ive brought you a little present not that you can give something to someone when its already theirs she placed a wicker basket on hugos desk and removed a thin muslin cloth to reveal a sleeping baby i felt it was about time you were introduced to your daughter olga said standing aside to allow hugo to admire her what makes you think i would have the slightest interest in your bastard because shes also your bastard said olga calmly so i will assume you want to give her the same start in life you gave emma and grace why would i even consider making such a ridiculous gesture because hugo she said you bled me dry and now its your turn to face up to your responsibility you cant assume you will always get away with it the only thing i got away from was you said hugo with a smirk so you can bugger off and take that basket with you because i wont be lifting a finger to help her then perhaps ill have to turn to someone who just might be willing to lift a finger to help her like who snapped hugo your mother might be a good place to start although shes probably the last person on earth who still believes a word you say hugo leapt up from his seat but olga didnt flinch and if i cant convince her she continued my next stop would be the manor house where i would take afternoon tea with your exwife and we could talk about the fact that shed already divorced you long before we even met hugo stepped out from behind his desk but it didnt stop olga continuing and if elizabeth is not at home i can always pay a visit to mulgelrie castle and introduce lord and lady harvey to yet another of your offspring what makes you think theyd believe you what makes you think they wouldnt hugo moved towards her only stopping when they were a few inches apart but olga still hadnt finished and then finally id feel i owe it to myself to visit maisie clifton a woman i greatly admire because if all ive heard about her hugo grabbed olga by the shoulders and began to shake her he was only surprised that she made no attempt to defend herself now you listen to me you yid he shouted if you so much as hint to anyone that im the father of that child ill make your life so miserable that youll wish youd been dragged off by the gestapo with your parents you dont frighten me any longer hugo said olga with an air of resignation i only have one interest left in life and thats to make sure you dont get away with it a second time a second time repeated hugo you think i dont know about harry clifton and his claim to the family title hugo let go of her and took a step back clearly shaken clifton is dead buried at sea everyone knows that you know hes still alive hugo however much you want everyone else to believe he isnt but how can you possibly know because ive learnt to think like you behave like you and more important act like you which is why i decided to hire my own private detective but it would have taken you years began hugo not if you come across someone whos out of work whose only client has run away a second time and who hasnt been paid for six months olga smiled when hugo clenched his fists a sure sign that her words had hit home even when he raised his arm she didnt flinch just stood her ground when the first blow came crashing into her face she toppled back clutching her broken nose just as a second punch landed in her stomach causing her to double up hugo stood back and laughed while she swayed from side to side trying to stay on her feet he was about to hit her a third time when her legs crumpled and she collapsed to the ground in a heap like a puppet whose strings have been cut now you know what you can expect if youre ever foolish enough to bother me again shouted hugo as he towered over her and if you dont want more of the same youll get out while youve still got the chance just be sure to take that bastard with you back to london olga slowly pushed herself up off the floor and on to her knees blood still pouring from her nose she attempted to stand but was so weak that she stumbled forward only breaking her fall by clinging on to the edge of the desk she paused for a moment and took several deep breaths as she tried to recover when she finally raised her head she was distracted by a long thin silver object that glistened in a circle of light thrown out by the desk lamp didnt you hear what i said hugo hollered as he stepped forward grabbed her by the hair and yanked her head back with all the force she could muster olga jerked her leg back and rammed the heel of her shoe into his groin you bitch screamed hugo as he let go of her hair and fell back allowing olga a split second to grab the letter opener and conceal it inside the sleeve of her dress she turned to face her tormentor when hugo had caught his breath he once again moved towards her as he passed a side table he grabbed a heavy glass ashtray and raised it high above his head determined to deliver a blow from which she would not so easily recover when he was only a pace away she pulled up her sleeve gripped the letter opener with both hands and pointed the blade towards his heart just as he was about to bring the ashtray crashing down on her head he spotted the blade for the first time tried to swerve to one side tripped and lost his balance falling heavily on top of her there was a moments silence before he sank slowly to his knees and let out a scream that would have woken all hades olga watched as he grabbed at the handle of the letter opener she stood mesmerized as if she was watching a slowmotion clip from a film it must have been only a moment although it felt interminable to olga before hugo finally collapsed and slumped to the floor at her feet she stared down at the blade of the letter opener the tip was sticking out of the back of his neck and blood was spurting in every direction like an outofcontrol fire hydrant help me hugo whimpered trying to raise a hand olga knelt by his side and took the hand of a man shed once loved there is nothing i can do to help you my darling she said but then there never was his breathing was becoming less regular although he still gripped her hand tightly she bent down to be sure that he could hear her every word you only have a few more moments to live she whispered and i wouldnt want you to go to your grave without knowing the details of mitchells latest report hugo made one last effort to speak his lips moved but no words came out emma has found harry said olga and i know youll be pleased to hear hes alive and well hugos eyes never left her as she leant even closer until her lips were almost touching his ear and hes on his way back to england to claim his rightful inheritance it wasnt until hugos hand went limp that she added ah but i forgot to tell you ive also learnt how to lie like you the bristol evening post and the bristol evening news ran different headlines on the first editions of their papers the following day sir hugo barrington stabbed to death was the banner headline in the post while the news preferred to lead with unknown woman throws herself in front of london express only detective chief inspector blakemore the head of the local cid worked out the connection between the two emma barrington good morning mr guinzburg said sefton jelks as he rose from behind his desk it is indeed an honour to meet the man who publishes dorothy parker and graham greene guinzburg gave a slight bow before shaking hands with jelks and miss barrington said jelks turning to emma how nice to see you again as i am no longer representing mr lloyd i hope we can be friends emma frowned and sat down without shaking jelkss outstretched hand once the three of them were settled jelks continued perhaps i might open this meeting by saying i thought it would be worthwhile for the three of us to get together and have a frank and open discussion and see if it were possible to come up with a solution to our problem your problem interjected emma mr guinzburg pursed his lips but said nothing i am sure continued jelks focusing his attention on guinzburg that you will want to do what is best for all concerned and will that include harry clifton this time asked emma guinzburg turned to emma and gave her a disapproving grimace yes miss barrington said jelks any agreement we might reach would certainly include mr clifton just as it did last time mr jelks when you walked away at the time he most needed you emma said guinzburg reproachfully i should point out miss barrington that i was doing no more than carrying out my clients instructions mr and mrs bradshaw both assured me that the man i was representing was their son and i had no reason to believe otherwise and of course i did prevent tom from being tried for and then you left harry to fend for himself in my defence miss barrington when i finally discovered that tom bradshaw was in fact harry clifton he begged me to keep my counsel as he didnt want you to discover that he was still alive thats not harrys version of what happened said emma who appeared to regret her words the moment shed said them guinzburg made no attempt to mask his displeasure he looked like a man who realizes his trump card has been played too soon i see said jelks from that little outburst i must assume you have both read the earlier notebook every word said emma so you can stop pretending you only did what was in harrys best interests emma said guinzburg firmly you must learn not to take things so personally and try to consider the bigger picture is that the one where a leading new york lawyer ends up in jail for falsifying evidence and perverting the course of justice said emma her eyes never leaving jelks i apologize mr jelks said guinzburg my young friend gets quite carried away when it comes to you bet i do said emma now almost shouting because i can tell you exactly what this man she pointed at jelks would have done if harry had been sent to the electric chair he would have pulled the lever himself if he thought it would save his own skin that is outrageous said jelks jumping up from his seat i had already prepared an appeal that would have left the jury in no doubt that the police had arrested the wrong man so you did know it was harry all along said emma sitting back in her chair jelks was momentarily stunned by emmas rebuke she took advantage of his silence let me tell you whats going to happen mr jelks when viking publishes harrys first notebook in the spring not only will your reputation be shattered and your career in ruins but like harry youll discover at first hand what life is like at lavenham jelks turned to guinzburg in desperation i would have thought it in both our interests to reach an amicable settlement before this whole affair gets out of hand what do you have in mind mr jelks asked guinzburg trying to sound conciliatory youre not going to give this crook a lifeline are you said emma guinzburg raised a hand the least we can do emma is hear him out just as he heard harry out jelks turned to guinzburg if you felt able not to publish the earlier notebook i can assure you i would make it worth your while i cant believe youre taking this seriously said emma jelks continued to address guinzburg as if emma wasnt in the room of course i realize that you stand to lose a considerable amount of money if you decide not to go ahead if the diary of a convict is anything to go by said guinzburg over a hundred thousand dollars the figure must have taken jelks by surprise because he didnt respond and theres also the twentythousanddollar advance that was paid to lloyd continued guinzburg that will have to be reimbursed to mr clifton if harry were here hed be the first to tell you that hes not interested in the money mr guinzburg only in making sure that this man ends up in jail guinzburg looked appalled my company has not built its reputation on scandalmongering emma so before i make a final decision on whether or not to publish the notebook i have to consider how my more distinguished authors might react to a publication of that kind how right you are mr guinzburg reputation is everything how would you know demanded emma while were on the subject of distinguished authors continued jelks a little pompously ignoring the interruption you may be aware that my firm has the privilege of representing the f scott fitzgerald estate he leaned back in his chair i remember so well scotty telling me that if he were to change publishers he would want to move to viking youre not going to fall for that line are you said emma emma my dear there are times when it is wise to take the long view how long have you got in mind six years emma im only doing what is in everyones best interests it sounds to me as if what youre doing will end up in your best interests because the reality is that once money becomes involved youre no better than him she said pointing at jelks guinzburg appeared wounded by emmas accusation but quickly recovered he turned to the lawyer and asked what do you have in mind mr jelks if youll agree not to publish the first notebook in any form i would be happy to pay compensation equivalent to the sum you have earned for the diary of a convict and on top of that i would repay in full the twenty thousand dollars you advanced to mr lloyd why dont you just kiss me on the cheek mr guinzburg said emma and then hell know who to give the thirty pieces of silver to and fitzgerald said guinzburg ignoring her i will grant you the publishing rights of the f scott fitzgerald estate for a period of fifty years on the same terms as his current publisher guinzburg smiled draw up a contract mr jelks and ill be happy to sign it and what pseudonym will you use when you sign the contract asked emma judas guinzburg shrugged his shoulders business is business my dear and you and harry wont go unrewarded im glad you mention that mr guinzburg said jelks because ive been holding a cheque for ten thousand dollars made payable to harry cliftons mother for some time but because of the outbreak of war i had no way of getting it to her perhaps miss barrington you would be kind enough to give it to mrs clifton when you return to england he slid the cheque across the table emma ignored it you would never have mentioned that cheque if i hadnt read about it in the first notebook when you gave harry your word that youd send mrs clifton ten thousand dollars once he agreed to take the place of tom bradshaw emma stood up before adding you both disgust me and i only hope i never come across either of you again in my life she stormed out of the office without another word leaving the cheque on the desk headstrong girl said guinzburg but im sure given time ill be able to convince her we made the right decision i feel confident harold said jelks that youll handle this minor incident with all the skill and diplomacy that have become the hallmark of your distinguished company thats kind of you to say so sefton said guinzburg as he rose from his chair and picked up the cheque and ill make sure that mrs clifton gets this he added placing it in his wallet i knew i could rely on you harold you most certainly can sefton and i look forward to seeing you again once the contract has been drawn up ill have it ready by the end of the week jelks said as they left the room together and walked down the corridor surprising we havent done any business before i agree said guinzburg but i have a feeling this is just the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship lets hope so said jelks when they reached the lift ill be in touch as soon as the contract is ready to sign he added as he pressed the down button ill look forward to that sefton said guinzburg and shook jelks warmly by the hand before stepping into the lift when the lift reached the ground floor guinzburg stepped out and the first thing he saw was emma heading straight for him you were brilliant my dear he said i confess that for a moment i wondered if youd gone a little too far with your comment about the electric chair but no youd got the measure of the man he added as they strolled out of the building arm in arm emma spent most of the afternoon sitting alone in her room rereading the first exercise book in which harry had written about the time before he was sent to lavenham as she turned each page and was made aware once again what he had been willing to put himself through in order to release her from any obligation she might feel she owed him emma resolved that if she ever found the idiotic man again she wouldnt let him out of her sight with mr guinzburgs blessing emma became involved with every aspect of publishing the revised edition of the diary of a convict or the first edition as she always referred to it she attended editorial meetings discussed the cover lettering with the head of the art department chose the photograph that would go on the back cover wrote the blurb about harry for the inside flap and even addressed a sales conference six weeks later boxes of books were transported from the printer by rail truck and plane to depositories all across america on publication day emma was standing on the pavement outside doubledays waiting for the doors of the bookstore to open she was able to report to greataunt phyllis and cousin alistair that evening that the book had been running out of the shop confirmation of this came in the form of the new york times bestseller list the following sunday when the revised edition ofthe diary of a convict appeared in the top ten after only a weeks sales journalists and magazine editors from all over the country were desperate to interview harry clifton and max lloyd but harry couldnt be found in any penal establishment in america while lloyd to quote the times was unavailable for comment the new york news was less prosaic when it ran the headline lloyd on the lam on the day of publication sefton jelkss office issued a formal statement making it clear that the company no longer represented max lloyd although the diary of a convict hit the number one spot on the new york times bestseller list for the next five weeks guinzburg kept to his agreement with jelks and did not publish any extracts from the earlier notebook however jelks did sign a contract giving viking the exclusive right to publish all of f scott fitzgeralds works for the next fifty years jelks considered that hed honoured his side of the bargain and that given time the press would become bored with the story and move on and he might have been right if time magazine hadnt run a fullpage interview with the recently retired detective karl kolowski of the new york police department and i can tell you kolowski was quoted as saying that so far theyve only published the boring bits just wait until you read what happened to harry clifton before he arrived at lavenham the story hit the wires around pm eastern time and mr guinzburg had received over a hundred calls by the time he walked into his office the following morning jelks read the article in time as he was driven to wall street when he stepped out of the lift on the twentysecond floor he found three of his partners waiting outside his office which do you want first asked phyllis holding up two letters the good news or the bad news the good news said emma without hesitation as she buttered another piece of toast phyllis placed one letter back on the table adjusted her pincenez and began to read the other dear mrs stuart ive just finished reading the diary of a convict by harry clifton there was an excellent review of the book in the washington post today which towards the end posed a question about what happened to mr clifton after he left lavenham correctional facility seven months ago having completed only a third of his sentence for reasons of national security which i am sure you will appreciate i am unable to go into any great detail in this letter if miss barrington who i understand is staying with you would like any further information concerning lieutenant clifton she is welcome to contact this office and i will be happy to make an appointment to see her as it does not breach the official secrets act may i add how much i enjoyed lieutenant cliftons diary if the rumours in todays new york post are to be believed i cant wait to find out what happened to him before he was shipped off to lavenham yours sincerely john cleverdon col greataunt phyllis looked across to see emma bouncing up and down like a bobbysoxer at a sinatra concert parker poured mrs stuart a second cup of coffee as if nothing unusual was taking place a few feet behind him emma suddenly stood still so whats the bad news she asked sitting back down at the table phyllis picked up the other letter this one is from rupert harvey she declared a second cousin once removed emma stifled a laugh phyllis observed her critically over her pincenez dont mock child she said being a member of a large clan can have its advantages as youre about to discover she turned her attention back to the letter dear cousin phyllis how nice to hear from you after all this time it was kind of you to draw my attention to the diary of a convict by harry clifton which i thoroughly enjoyed what a formidable young lady cousin emma must be phyllis looked up twice removed in your case she said before returning to the letter id be delighted to assist emma in her current dilemma to that end the embassy has an aircraft that will be flying to london next thursday and the ambassador has agreed that miss barrington can join him and his staff on the flight if emma would be kind enough to drop by my office on thursday morning i will make sure that all the necessary paperwork is completed do remind her to bring her passport with her yours affectionately rupert ps is cousin emma half as beautiful as mr clifton suggests in his book phyllis folded the letter and placed it back in the envelope so whats the bad news demanded emma phyllis bowed her head as she did not approve of displays of emotion and said quietly you have no idea child how much i shall miss you you are the daughter i never had i signed the contract this morning said guinzburg raising his glass congratulations said alistair as everyone else around the dinner table raised their glasses do forgive me said phyllis if i appear to be the only one among us who doesnt fully understand if you signed a contract that prevents your company from publishing harry cliftons earlier work what exactly are we celebrating the fact that i put one hundred thousand dollars of sefton jelkss money into my companys bank account this morning guinzburg replied and i said emma have received a cheque for twenty thousand dollars from the same source lloyds original advance for harrys book and dont forget the cheque for ten thousand you failed to pick up for mrs clifton which i retrieved said guinzburg frankly weve all done very well out of it and now the contract has been signed there will be even more to come for the next fifty years possibly said phyllis taking the high ground but im more than a little irked that youve allowed jelks to get away with murder i think youll find hes still on death row mrs stuart said guinzburg though i accept weve granted him a threemonth stay of execution im even more confused said phyllis then allow me to explain said guinzburg you see the contract i signed this morning wasnt with jelks but with pocket books a company who have bought the rights to publish all harrys diaries in softback and what may i ask is a softback said phyllis mama said alistair softbacks have been around for years now so have tenthousanddollar bills but ive never seen one your mother makes a fair point said guinzburg in fact it could explain why jelks was taken in because mrs stuart represents an entire generation who will never come to terms with books being published in softback and would only ever consider reading a hardback what made you realize that jelks was not fully acquainted with the concept of a softback asked phyllis f scott fitzgerald was the clincher said alistair i do wish you wouldnt use slang at the dinner table said phyllis it was alistair who advised us said emma that if jelks was willing to hold a meeting in his office without his legal assistant present it must mean he hadnt alerted his partners to the fact there was a missing notebook and that if it were published it would be even more damning to the firms reputation than the diary of a convict then why didnt alistair attend the meeting said phyllis and make a record of everything jelks said after all that man is one of the slipperiest lawyers in new york which is precisely why i didnt attend the meeting mother we didnt want anything on the record and i was convinced that jelks would be arrogant enough to think that all he was up against was a slip of a girl from england and a publisher he was sure he could bribe which meant we had him by the short and curlies alistair however alistair continued now in full flow it was just after emma had stormed out of the meeting that mr guinzburg displayed a moment of true genius emma looked puzzled he told jelks i look forward to seeing you again once the contract has been drawn up and thats exactly what jelks did said guinzburg because once id gone over his contract i realized it was modelled on one that had originally been drawn up for f scott fitzgerald a man who was only ever published in hardback there was nothing in that contract to suggest that we couldnt publish in softback so the subcontract i signed this morning will allow pocket books to publish harrys earlier diary without breaking my agreement with jelks guinzburg allowed parker to refill his glass with champagne how much did you make demanded emma there are times young lady when you push your luck how much did you make asked phyllis two hundred thousand dollars admitted guinzburg youll need every penny of it said phyllis because once that book goes on sale you and alistair will be spending the next couple of years in court defending yourself against half a dozen libel writs i dont think so said alistair after parker had poured him a brandy in fact id be willing to bet that tenthousanddollar bill youve never seen mama that sefton jelks is now spending his last three months as the senior partner of jelks myers and abernathy what makes you so sure of yourself i have a feeling jelks didnt tell his partners about the first notebook so when pocket books publish the earlier diary he will be left with no choice but to hand in his resignation and if he doesnt then theyll throw him out said alistair a firm which is that ruthless with its clients wont suddenly become humane with its partners and dont forget theres always someone else who wants to be senior partner so im bound to admit emma youre far more interesting than amalgamated wire versus new york electric said the others in unison as they raised their glasses to emma and should you ever change your mind about staying in new york young lady said guinzburg therell always be a job for you at viking thank you mr guinzburg said emma but the only reason i came to america was to find harry and now i discover that hes in europe while im stranded in new york so once ive had my meeting with colonel cleverdon ill be flying home to be with our son harry cliftons a damn lucky man to have you in his corner said alistair wistfully if you ever meet either of them alistair youll realize that im the lucky one emma woke early the following morning and chatted happily to phyllis over breakfast about how much she was looking forward to being reunited with sebastian and her family phyllis nodded but said very little parker collected emmas bags from her room took them down in the lift and left them in the hall shed acquired another two since arriving in new york does anyone ever go home with less than they started out with she wondered ill not come downstairs said phyllis after several attempts to say goodbye ill only make a fool of myself its better that you simply remember an old battleaxe who didnt like to be disturbed during her bridge parties when you visit us next time my dear bring harry and sebastian with you i want to meet the man who captured your heart a taxi blasted its horn in the street below time to go said phyllis go quickly emma gave her one last hug and then she didnt look back when she stepped out of the lift parker was standing by the front door waiting for her the bags already stowed away in the boot of the taxi the moment he saw her he walked out on to the pavement and opened the back door of the cab goodbye parker said emma and thank you for everything my pleasure maam he replied just as she was about to step into the taxi he added if its not inappropriate maam i wondered if i might be allowed to make an observation emma stepped back trying to mask her surprise of course please do i so enjoyed mr cliftons diary he said that i hope it will not be too long before you return to new york accompanied by your husband it wasnt long before the train was speeding through the countryside and new york was no more as they headed towards the capital emma found she couldnt read or sleep for more than a few minutes at a time greataunt phyllis mr guinzburg cousin alistair mr jelks detective kolowski and parker all made their exits and entrances she thought about what needed to be done once she arrived in washington first she had to go to the british embassy and sign some forms so she could join the ambassador on his flight to london as arranged by rupert harvey a second cousin twice removed dont mock child she could hear her greataunt remonstrating and then she fell asleep harry entered her dreams this time in uniform smiling laughing and then she woke with a jolt quite expecting him to be in the carriage with her when the train pulled into union station five hours later emma had trouble lugging her suitcases on to the platform until a porter an exserviceman with one arm came to her rescue he found a taxi for her thanked her for the tip and gave her a salute with the wrong arm someone else whose destiny had been decided by a war he didnt declare the british embassy emma said as she climbed into the cab she was dropped on massachusetts avenue outside a pair of ornate iron gates displaying the royal standard two young soldiers ran across to help emma with her bags who are you visiting maam an english accent an american word mr rupert harvey she said commander harvey certainly said the corporal who picked up her bags and guided emma to an office at the rear of the building emma entered a large room in which the staff most dressed in uniform scurried about in every direction no one walked a figure appeared out of the melee and greeted her with a huge smile im rupert harvey he said sorry about the organized chaos but its always like this when the ambassador is returning to england its even worse this time because weve had a visiting cabinet minister with us for the past week all your paperwork has been prepared he added returning to his desk i just need to see your passport once hed flicked through the pages he asked her to sign here here and here a bus will be leaving from the front of the embassy for the airport at six this evening please make sure youre on time as everyones expected to be on board the plane before the ambassador arrives ill be on time said emma would it be possible to leave my bags here while i go sightseeing that wont be a problem said rupert ill have someone put them on the bus for you thank you said emma she was about to leave when he added by the way i loved the book and just to warn you the minister is hoping to have a private word with you when were on the plane i think he was a publisher before he went into politics whats his name emma asked harold macmillan emma recalled some of mr guinzburgs sage advice everyone is going to want this book hed told her there isnt a publisher who wont open their doors for you so dont be easily flattered try and see billy collins and allen lane of penguin hed made no mention of a harold macmillan then ill see you on the bus around six said her second cousin twice removed before he disappeared back into the melee emma left the embassy walked out on to massachusetts avenue and checked her watch just over two hours to spare before her appointment with colonel cleverdon she hailed a cab where to miss i want to see everything the city has to offer she said how long have you got a couple of years no emma replied a couple of hours so lets get moving the taxi sped away from the kerb first stop the white house minutes on to the capitol minutes circling the washington jefferson and lincoln memorials minutes dashing into the national gallery another minutes ending up at the smithsonian but there was only minutes left until her appointment so she didnt make it past the first floor when she jumped back into the cab the driver asked where to now miss emma checked the address on colonel cleverdons letter adams street she replied and im cutting it fine when the cab drew up outside a large white marble building that occupied the entire block emma handed the cabbie her last fivedollar note she would have to walk back to the embassy after her meeting worth every cent she told him he touched the rim of his cap i thought it was only us americans who did that sort of thing he said with a grin emma walked up the steps past two guards who stared right through her and on into the building she noticed that almost everyone was dressed in different shades of khaki although few of them wore battle ribbons a young woman behind the reception desk directed her to room emma joined a mass of khaki uniforms as they headed towards the lifts and when she stepped out on the ninth floor she found colonel cleverdons secretary waiting to greet her im afraid the colonel has got caught up in a meeting but he should be with you in a few minutes she said as they walked along the corridor emma was shown into the colonels office once she had sat down she stared at a thick file on the centre of the desk as with the letter on maisies mantelpiece and the notebooks on jelkss desk she wondered how long she would have to wait before its contents were revealed the answer was twenty minutes when the door eventually swung open a tall athletic man around the same age as her father burst into the room a cigar bobbing up and down in his mouth so sorry to have kept you he said shaking hands but there just arent enough hours in the day he sat down behind his desk and smiled at her john cleverdon and i would have recognized you anywhere emma looked surprised until he explained youre exactly as harry described you in his book would you like coffee no thank you said emma trying not to sound impatient as she glanced at the file on the colonels desk i dont even have to open this he said tapping the file i wrote most of it myself so i can tell you everything harrys been up to since he left lavenham and now thanks to his diaries we all know he should never have been there in the first place i cant wait to read the next instalment and find out what happened to him before he was sent to lavenham and i cant wait to find out what happened to him after he left lavenham emma said hoping she didnt sound impatient then lets get on with it said the colonel harry volunteered to join a special services unit which i have the privilege of commanding in exchange for his prison sentence being commuted having begun his life in the united states army as a gi he was recently commissioned in the field and is currently serving as a lieutenant hes been behind enemy lines now for several months he continued hes been working with resistance groups in occupied countries and helping to prepare for our eventual landing in europe emma didnt like the sound of that what does behind enemy lines actually mean i cant tell you exactly because its not always easy to track him down when hes on a mission he often cuts off communication with the outside world for days on end but what i can tell you is that he and his driver corporal pat quinn another lavenham graduate have turned out to be two of the most effective operatives to come out of my group theyre like two schoolboys whove been given a giant chemistry set and told they can go and experiment on the enemys communications network they spend most of their time blowing up bridges dismantling railway lines and bringing down electricity pylons harrys specialty is disrupting german troop movements and on one or two occasions the krauts have nearly caught up with him but so far hes managed to stay a step ahead of them in fact hes proved such a thorn in their flesh that theyve put a price on his head which seems to go up every month thirty thousand francs when i last checked the colonel noticed that emmas face had gone as white as a sheet im so sorry he said i didnt mean to alarm you but i sometimes forget when im sitting behind a desk just how much danger my boys face every day when will harry be released asked emma quietly im afraid hes expected to serve out his sentence said the colonel but now that you know hes innocent cant you at least send him back to england i dont think that would make a great deal of difference miss barrington because if i know harry the moment he set foot in his homeland hed only swap one uniform for another not if i have anything to do with it the colonel smiled ill see what i can do to help he promised as he rose from behind his desk he opened the door and saluted her have a safe journey back to england miss barrington i hope it wont be long before the two of you end up in the same place at the same time harry clifton ill report back sir as soon as ive located them said harry before putting the field phone down located who asked quinn kertels army colonel benson seems to think they could be in the valley on the other side of that ridge he said pointing to the top of the hill theres only one way were going to find out said quinn shifting the jeep noisily into first gear take it easy harry told him if the hun are there we dont need to alert them quinn remained in first as they crept slowly up the hill thats far enough said harry when they were less than fifty yards from the brow of the hill quinn put the handbrake on and turned the ignition off and they jumped out and ran on up the incline when they were only a few yards from the top they fell flat on their stomachs then like two crabs scurrying back into the sea they crawled until they stopped just below the crest harry peeped over the top and caught his breath he didnt need a pair of binoculars to see what they were up against field marshal kertels legendary nineteenth armoured corps was clearly preparing for battle in the valley below tanks were lined up as far as the eye could see and the support troops would have filled a football stadium harry estimated that the second division of the texas rangers would be outnumbered by at least three to one if we get the hell out of here whispered quinn we might just have enough time to prevent custers secondtolast stand not so fast said harry we might be able to turn this to our advantage dont you think weve used up enough of our nine lives during the past year ive counted eight so far said harry so i think we can risk just one more he began to crawl back down the hill before quinn could offer an opinion have you got a handkerchief harry asked as quinn climbed behind the wheel yes sir he said taking one out of his pocket and passing it to harry who tied it to the jeeps radio mast youre not going to surrender yes its our one chance said harry so drive slowly to the top of the ridge corporal and then on down into the valley harry only ever called pat corporal when he didnt want to prolong the discussion into the valley of death suggested quinn not a fair comparison said harry there were six hundred in the light brigade and we are but two so i see myself more like horatius than lord cardigan i see myself more like a sitting duck thats because youre irish said harry as they crested the ridge and began the slow journey down the other side dont exceed the speed limit he said trying to make light of it he was expecting a hail of bullets to greet their impudent intrusion but clearly curiosity got the better of the germans whatever you do pat harry said firmly dont open your mouth and try to look as if this has all been planned in advance if quinn had an opinion he didnt express it which was most unlike him the corporal drove at a steady pace and didnt touch the brake until they reached the front line of tanks kertels men stared at the occupants of the jeep in disbelief but no one moved until a major pushed his way through the ranks and headed straight for them harry leapt out of the jeep stood to attention and saluted hoping his german would be up to it what in gods name do you imagine youre doing asked the major harry thought that was the gist of it he maintained a calm exterior i have a message for field marshal kertel from general eisenhower supreme commander of the allied forces in europe harry knew that when the major heard the name eisenhower he couldnt risk not taking it to a higher level without another word the major climbed into the back of the jeep tapped quinn on the shoulder with his baton and pointed in the direction of a large wellcamouflaged tent that stood to one side of the assembled troops when they reached the tent the major leapt out wait here he ordered before going inside quinn and harry sat there surrounded by thousands of wary eyes if looks could kill whispered quinn harry ignored him it was several minutes before the major returned whats it going to be sir mumbled quinn the firing squad or will he ask you to join him for a glass of schnapps the field marshal has agreed to see you said the major not attempting to hide his surprise thank you sir harry said as he got out of the jeep and followed him into the tent field marshal kertel rose from behind a long table that was covered in a map that harry recognized immediately but this one had models of tanks and soldiers all heading in his direction he was surrounded by a dozen field officers none below the rank of colonel harry stood rigidly to attention and saluted name and rank the field marshal asked after he had returned harrys salute clifton sir lieutenant clifton i am general eisenhowers adc harry spotted a bible on a small folding table by the field marshals bed a german flag covered the canvas of one side of the tent something was missing and why would general eisenhower send his adc to see me harry observed the man carefully before answering his question unlike goebbelss or goerings kertels battleworn face confirmed that he had seen frontline action many times the only medal he wore was an iron cross with oakleaf cluster which harry knew hed won as a lieutenant at the battle of the marne in general eisenhower wishes you to know that on the far side of clemenceau he has three full battalions of thirty thousand men along with twentytwo thousand tanks on his right flank is the second division of the texas rangers in the centre the third battalion of the green jackets and on their left flank a battalion of the australian light infantry the field marshal would have made an excellent poker player because he gave nothing away he would have known that the numbers were accurate assuming those three regiments were actually in place then it should prove a most interesting battle lieutenant but if your purpose was to alarm me you have failed that is no part of my brief sir harry said glancing down at the map because i suspect i havent told you anything you didnt already know including the fact that the allies have recently taken control of the airfield at wilhelmsberg a fact that was confirmed by a small american flag pinned on the airport on the map what you may not know sir is that lined up on the runway is a squadron of lancaster bombers awaiting an order from general eisenhower to destroy your tanks while his battalions advance in battle formation what harry knew was that the only planes at the airfield were a couple of reconnaissance aircraft stranded because theyd run out of fuel get to the point lieutenant said kertel why did general eisenhower send you to see me i will try to recall the generals exact words sir harry attempted to sound as if he were reciting a message there can be no doubt that this dreadful war is fast drawing to a close and only a deluded man with a limited experience of warfare could still believe victory is possible the allusion to hitler did not go unnoticed by the officers who surrounded their field marshal that was when harry realized what was missing there was no nazi flag or picture of the führer in the field marshals tent general eisenhower holds you and the nineteenth corps in the highest regard harry continued he has no doubt that your men would lay down their lives for you whatever the odds but in the name of god he asks for what purpose this engagement will end with your troops being decimated while we will undoubtedly lose vast numbers of men everyone knows that the end of the war can only be a matter of weeks away so what can be gained by such unnecessary carnage general eisenhower read your book the professional soldier when he was at west point sir and one sentence in particular has remained indelibly fixed in his memory throughout his military career harry had read kertels memoirs a fortnight before when he realized they might be up against him so he was able to recite the sentence almost word for word sending young men to an unnecessary death is not an act of leadership but of vainglory and unworthy of a professional soldier that sir is something you share with general eisenhower and to that end he guarantees that if you lay down your arms your men will be treated with the utmost dignity and respect as set out in the third geneva convention harry expected the field marshals response to be good try young man but you can tell whoever it is commanding your puny brigade on the other side of that hill that i am about to wipe them off the face of the earth but what kertel actually said was i will discuss the generals proposal with my officers perhaps you would be kind enough to wait outside of course sir harry saluted left the tent and returned to the jeep quinn didnt speak when he climbed back into the front seat and sat beside him it was clear that kertels officers were not of one opinion as raised voices could be heard from inside the tent harry could imagine the words honour commonsense duty realism humiliation and sacrifice being bandied about but the two he feared most were hes bluffing it was almost an hour before the major summoned harry back into the tent kertel was standing apart from his most trusted advisers a worldweary look on his face he had made his decision and even if some of his officers didnt agree with it once he had given the order they would never question him he didnt need to tell harry what that decision was do i have your permission sir to contact general eisenhower and inform him of your decision the field marshal gave a curt nod and his officers quickly left the tent to see that his orders were carried out harry returned to his jeep accompanied by the major and watched men lay down their arms climb out of their tanks and line up in columns of three as they prepared to surrender his only fear was that having bluffed the field marshal he wouldnt be able to pull off the same trick with his area commander he picked up his field phone and only had to wait a few moments before colonel benson came on the line harry hoped the major hadnt noticed the bead of sweat that was trickling down his nose have you discovered how many of them were up against clifton were the colonels first words could you put me through to general eisenhower colonel this is lieutenant clifton his adc have you gone out of your mind clifton yes i will hold on sir while you go and look for him his heart couldnt have beaten faster if hed just run a hundred yards and he began to wonder how long it would be before the colonel worked out what he was up to he nodded at the major but the major didnt respond was he standing there hoping to find a chink in his armour as he waited harry watched thousands of fighting men some perplexed while others looked relieved joining the ranks of those who had already abandoned their tanks and laid down their arms its general eisenhower here is that you clifton said colonel benson when he came back on the line yes sir im with field marshal kertel and he has accepted your proposal that the nineteenth corps lay down their arms and surrender under the terms of the geneva convention in order to avoid if i remember your words correctly sir unnecessary carnage if you bring forward one of our five battalions they should be able to carry out the operation in an orderly fashion i anticipate coming over clemenceau ridge accompanied by the nineteenth corps he looked at his watch at approximately hours well be waiting for you lieutenant thank you sir fifty minutes later harry crossed the clemenceau ridge for the second time that day the german battalion following him as if he were the pied piper over the hill and into the arms of the texas rangers as the men and tanks surrounded the nineteenth corps kertel realized he had been duped by an englishman and an irishman whose only weapons were a jeep and a handkerchief the field marshal pulled a pistol from inside his tunic and harry thought for a moment that he was going to shoot him kertel stood to attention saluted placed the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger harry felt no pleasure in his death once the germans had been rounded up colonel benson invited harry to lead the nineteenth unarmoured corps in triumph to the compound as they drove at the head of the column even pat quinn had a smile on his face they must have been about a mile away when the jeep passed over a german landmine harry heard a loud explosion and remembered pats prophetic words dont you think weve used up enough of our nine lives during the past year as the jeep cartwheeled into the air before bursting into flames and then nothing do you know when youre dead does it happen in an instant and then suddenly youre no longer there all harry could be sure of was the images that appeared before him were like actors in a shakespearian play each making their exits and entrances but he couldnt be sure if it was a comedy a tragedy or a history the central character never changed and was played by a woman who gave a remarkable performance while others seemed to flit on and off the stage at her bidding and then his eyes opened and emma was standing by his side when harry smiled her whole face lit up she bent down and kissed him gently on the lips welcome home she said that was the moment when he realized not only how much he loved her but also that now nothing would ever keep them apart he took her gently by the hand youre going to have to help me he began where am i and how long have i been here bristol general and just over a month it was touch and go for a while but i wasnt going to lose you a second time harry gripped her hand firmly and smiled he felt exhausted and drifted back into a deep sleep when he woke again it was dark and he sensed that he was alone he tried to imagine what might have happened to all those characters during the past five years because as in twelfth night they must have believed hed died at sea had his mother read the letter he wrote to her had giles used his colourblindness as an excuse not to be called up had hugo returned to bristol once he was convinced harry was no longer a threat were sir walter barrington and lord harvey still alive and one other thought kept returning again and again was emma waiting for the right moment to tell him there was someone else in her life suddenly the door to his room was thrown open and a little boy came running in shouting daddy daddy daddy before leaping on to his bed and throwing his arms around him emma appeared moments later and watched as the two men in her life met for the first time harry was reminded of the photograph of himself as a boy that his mother kept on the mantelpiece in still house lane he didnt have to be told that this was his child and he felt a thrill he couldnt have begun to imagine before he studied the boy more closely as he leapt up and down on the bed his fair hair blue eyes and square jaw just like harrys father oh my god said harry and fell into a deep sleep when he woke again emma was sitting on the bed beside him he smiled and took her hand now ive met my son any other surprises he asked emma hesitated before adding with a sheepish grin im not sure where to start at the beginning possibly said harry like any good story just remember that the last time i saw you was on our wedding day emma began with her trip to scotland and the birth of their son sebastian shed just pressed the doorbell of kristins apartment in manhattan when harry fell asleep when he woke again she was still with him harry liked the sound of greataunt phyllis and her cousin alistair and although he could only just remember detective kolowski he would never forget sefton jelks when emma came to the end of her story she was on a plane crossing the atlantic back to england sitting next to mr harold macmillan emma presented harry with a copy of the diary of a convict all harry said was i must try and find out what happened to pat quinn emma found it difficult to find the right words was he killed by the landmine harry asked quietly emma bowed her head harry didnt speak again that night each day produced new surprises because inevitably everyones life had moved on in the five years since harry had seen them when his mother came to visit him the following day she was on her own he was so proud to learn that she was excelling at reading and writing and was deputy manager of the hotel but was saddened when she admitted she had never opened the letter delivered by dr wallace before it disappeared i thought it was from a tom bradshaw she explained harry changed the subject i see youre wearing an engagement ring as well as a wedding ring his mother blushed yes i wanted to see you on my own before you met your stepfather my stepfather said harry anyone i know oh yes she said and would have told him who shed married if he hadnt fallen asleep the next time harry woke it was the middle of the night he switched on the bedside light and began to read the diary of a convict he smiled several times before he reached the last page nothing emma told him about max lloyd came as a surprise especially after sefton jelks had made a reappearance however he was surprised when emma told him that the book had been an instant bestseller and that the followup was doing even better the followup enquired harry the first diary you wrote about what happened to you before you were sent to lavenham has just been published in england its racing up the charts here as it did in america that reminds me mr guinzburg keeps asking when he can expect your first novel the one you hinted at in the diary of a convict ive got enough ideas for half a dozen harry said then why dont you get started asked emma when harry woke that afternoon his mother and mr holcombe were standing by his side holding hands as if they were on their second date hed never seen his mother looking so happy you cant be my stepfather harry protested as the two shook hands i most certainly am said mr holcombe truth is i should have asked your mother to be my wife twenty years ago but i simply didnt think i was good enough for her and youre still not good enough sir said harry with a grin but then neither of us ever will be truth be known i married your mother for her money what money said harry the ten thousand dollars mr jelks sent which made it possible for us to buy a cottage in the country for which we will be eternally grateful chipped in maisie dont thank me said harry thank emma if harry was taken by surprise when he discovered that his mother had married mr holcombe it was nothing compared to the shock when giles walked into the room dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant in the wessex regiment if that wasnt enough his chest was covered in combat medals including the military cross but when harry asked how hed won it giles changed the subject im planning to stand for parliament at the next election he announced to which seat have you granted this honour asked harry bristol docklands giles replied but thats a safe labour seat and i intend to be the labour candidate harry made no attempt to hide his surprise what caused this saint paullike conversion he asked a corporal i served with on the frontline called bates not terry bates said harry yes did you know him sure did the brightest kid in my class at merrywood elementary and the best sportsman he left school at twelve to work in his fathers business bates and son butchers thats why im standing as a labour candidate said giles terry had just as much right to be at oxford as you or me the following day emma and sebastian returned armed with pens pencils pads and an india rubber she told harry the time had come for him to stop thinking and start writing during the long hours when he couldnt sleep or was simply alone harrys thoughts turned to the novel he had intended to write if he hadnt escaped from lavenham he began to make outline notes of the characters that must turn the page his detective would have to be a oneoff an original who he hoped would become part of his readers everyday lives like poirot holmes or maigret he finally settled on the name william warwick the hon william would be the second son of the earl of warwick and have turned down the opportunity to go to oxford much to his fathers disgust because he wanted to join the police force his character would be loosely based on his friend giles after three years on the beat walking the streets of bristol bill as he was known to his colleagues would become a detective constable and be assigned to chief inspector blakemore the man whod intervened when harrys uncle stan had been arrested and wrongly charged with stealing money from hugo barringtons safe lady warwick bills mother would be modelled on elizabeth barrington bill would have a girlfriend called emma and his grandfathers lord harvey and sir walter barrington would make the occasional entrance on the page but only to offer sage advice every night harry would read over the pages hed written that day and every morning his wastepaper basket needed emptying harry always looked forward to sebastians visits his young son was so full of energy so inquisitive and so goodlooking just like his mother as everyone teased him sebastian often asked questions no one else would have dared to whats it like being in prison how many germans did you kill why arent you and mama married harry sidestepped most of them but he knew sebastian was far too bright not to work out what his father was up to and feared it wouldnt be long before the boy trapped him whenever harry was alone he continued to work on the outline plot for his novel hed read over a hundred detective novels while he was working as deputy librarian at lavenham and he felt that some of the characters hed come across in prison and in the army could provide material for a dozen novels max lloyd sefton jelks warden swanson officer hessler colonel cleverdon captain havens tom bradshaw and pat quinn especially pat quinn during the next few weeks harry became lost in his own world but he had to admit that the way some of his visitors had spent the last five years had also turned out to be stranger than fiction when emmas sister grace paid him a visit harry didnt comment on the fact that she looked so much older than when hed last seen her but then shed only been a schoolgirl at the time now grace was in her final year at cambridge and about to sit her exams she told him with pride that for a couple of years shed worked on a farm not going back up to cambridge until she was convinced the war was won it was with sadness that harry learnt from lady barrington that her husband sir walter had passed away a man harry had admired second only to old jack his uncle stan never visited him as the days went by harry thought about raising the subject of emmas father but he sensed that even the mention of his name was offlimits and then one evening after harrys doctor had told him that it wouldnt be too long before they released him emma lay down next to him on the bed and told him that her father was dead when she came to the end of her story harry said youve never been good at dissembling my darling so perhaps the time has come to tell me why the whole family is so on edge harry woke the next morning to find his mother along with the whole barrington family seated around his bed the only absentees were sebastian and his uncle stan neither of whom it was felt would have made a serious contribution the doctor has said you can go home said emma great news said harry but wheres home if it means going back to still house lane and living with uncle stan id prefer to stay in hospital even go back to prison no one laughed im now living at barrington hall said giles so why dont you move in with me heaven knows there are enough rooms including a library said emma so youll have no excuse not to continue working on your novel and you can come and visit emma and sebastian whenever you want to added elizabeth barrington harry didnt respond for some time youre all being very kind he eventually managed and please dont think im not grateful but i cant believe it needed the whole family to decide where im going to live theres another reason we wanted to talk to you said lord harvey and the family have asked me to speak on their behalf harry sat bolt upright and gave emmas grandfather his full attention a serious issue has arisen concerning the future of the barrington estate began lord harvey the terms of joshua barringtons will have turned out to be a legal nightmare rivalled only by jarndyce and jarndyce and could end up being just as financially crippling but i have no interest in either the title or the estate said harry my only desire is to prove that hugo barrington was not my father so i can marry emma amen to that said lord harvey however complications have arisen that i must acquaint you with please do sir because i cant see that theres any problem ill try to explain following hugos untimely death i advised lady barrington that as she had recently suffered two onerous demands for death duties and remembering that i am over seventy it might be wise for our two companies barringtons and harveys to join forces this you understand was at a time when we still believed you were dead therefore it seemed that any dispute over who would inherit the title and the estate had however unhappily been resolved making it possible for giles to take his place as head of the family and he still can as far as im concerned said harry the problem is that other interested parties have become involved and the implications now go far beyond the people in this room when hugo was killed i took over as chairman of the newly merged company and asked bill lockwood to return as managing director without blowing my own trumpet barrington harvey has paid its shareholders a handsome dividend for the past two years despite herr hitler once we realized you were still alive we took legal advice from sir danvers barker kc to be sure that we were not in breach of the terms of joshua barringtons will if only id opened that letter said maisie almost to herself sir danvers assured us continued lord harvey that as long as you renounce any claim to the title or the estate we could continue trading as we had for the previous two years and indeed he drew up a document to that effect if someone hands me a pen said harry ill happily sign it i wish it were that easy said lord harvey and it might have been if the daily express hadnt picked up the story im afraid im to blame for that emma interrupted because following the success of your book on both sides of the atlantic the press have become obsessed with finding out who will inherit the barrington title will it be sir harry or sir giles theres a cartoon in the news chronicle this morning said giles of the two of us on horseback jousting with emma sitting in the stands offering you her handkerchief while the men in the crowd boo and the women cheer what are they alluding to asked harry the nation is divided right down the middle said lord harvey the men only seem interested in wholl end up with the title and the estate while the women all want to see emma walking up the aisle a second time in fact between you youre keeping cary grant and ingrid bergman off the front pages but once ive signed the document renouncing any claim to the title or the estate surely the public will lose interest and turn their attention to something else this might well have been the case had the garter king of arms not become involved and whos he asked harry the kings representative when it comes to deciding who is next in line for any title ninetynine times out of a hundred he simply sends letters patent to the next of kin on the rare occasions when theres a disagreement between two parties he recommends that the matter be settled by a judge in chambers dont tell me its come to that said harry im afraid it has lord justice shawcross ruled in favour of giless claim but only on the condition that once you were fully fit you signed a disclaimer waiving your rights to the title and the estate while allowing the succession to progress from father to son well i am fully fit now so lets make an appointment to see the judge and get this settled once and for all id like nothing more said lord harvey but im afraid the decision has been taken out of his hands by who this time asked harry a labour peer called lord preston said giles he picked up the story in the press and tabled a written question to the home secretary asking him to make a ruling on which one of us was entitled to inherit the baronetcy he then held a press conference at which he claimed that i had no right to succeed to the title because the real candidate was lying unconscious in a bristol hospital unable to put his case why would a labour peer give a damn if it was me or giles who inherited the title when the press asked him the same question said lord harvey he told them if giles inherited the title it would be a classic example of class prejudice and that it was only fair that the dockers son should be able to put forward his claim but that defies logic said harry because if i am a dockers son then giles would inherit the title anyway several people wrote to the times making exactly that point said lord harvey however as were so close to a general election the home secretary ducked the issue and told his noble friend that he would refer the matter to the lord chancellors office the lord chancellor passed it on to the law lords and seven learned men took their time deliberating and came down by four votes to three in favour of you harry but this is madness why wasnt i consulted you were unconscious lord harvey reminded him and in any case they were debating a point of law not your opinion so the verdict will stand unless its overturned on appeal in the house of lords harry was speechless so as things stand continued lord harvey you are now sir harry and the major shareholder in barrington harvey as well as owner of the barrington estate and to quote the original will all that therein is then ill appeal against the law lords judgment making it clear that i wish to renounce the title said harry firmly thats the irony said giles you cant only i can appeal against the verdict but i have no intention of doing so unless i have your blessing of course you have my blessing said harry but i can think of a far easier solution they all looked at him i could commit suicide i dont think so said emma sitting down on the bed beside him youve tried that twice and look where it got you emma burst into the library clutching a letter as she rarely interrupted harry when he was writing he knew it had to be important he put down his pen sorry darling she said as she pulled up a chair but ive just had some important news that i had to come across and share with you harry smiled at the woman he adored her idea of important could range from seb pouring water over the cat to its the lord chancellors office on the phone and they need to speak to you urgently he leaned back in his chair and waited to see which category this would fall into ive just had a letter from greataunt phyllis she said whom we all hold in such awe teased harry dont mock child said emma shes raised a point that may help us prove papa wasnt your father harry didnt mock we know that your blood group and your mothers are rhesus negative continued emma if my father is rhesus positive he cant be your father weve discussed this on numerous occasions harry reminded her but if we were able to prove that my fathers blood group wasnt the same as yours we could get married that is assuming you still want to marry me not this morning my darling said harry feigning boredom you see im in the middle of committing a murder he smiled in any case we have no idea which blood type your father was because despite considerable pressure from your mother and sir walter he always refused to be tested so perhaps you ought to write back explaining that it will have to remain a mystery not necessarily said emma unbowed because greataunt phyllis has been following the case closely and thinks she may have come up with a solution neither of us has considered picks up a copy of the bristol evening news from a newsstand on the corner of sixtyfourth street every morning does she no but she does read the times said emma still unbowed even if it is a week out of date and said harry wanting to get on with his murder she says its now possible for scientists to identify blood groups long after the person has died thinking of employing burke and hare to exhume the body are we darling no i am not said emma but she also points out that when my father was killed an artery was severed so a great deal of blood would have been spilt on the carpet and the clothes he was wearing at the time harry stood up walked across the room and picked up the phone who are you calling asked emma detective chief inspector blakemore who was in charge of the case it may be a long shot but i swear ill never mock you or your greataunt phyllis again do you mind if i smoke sir harry not at all chief inspector blakemore lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply dreadful habit he said i blame sir walter sir walter said harry raleigh not barrington you understand harry laughed as he sat down in the chair opposite the detective so how can i help you sir harry i prefer mr clifton as you wish sir i was hoping you might be able to supply me with some information concerning the death of hugo barrington im afraid that will depend on whom im addressing because i can have that conversation with sir harry barrington but not with mr harry clifton why not with mr clifton because i can only discuss details of a case like this with a member of the family then on this occasion i shall revert to being sir harry so how can i help sir harry when barrington was murdered he was not murdered said the chief inspector but the newspaper reports led me to believe it is what the newspapers didnt report that is significant but to be fair they were unable to study the crime scene had they done so said blakemore before harry could ask his next question they would have spotted the angle at which the letter opener entered sir hugos neck and severed his artery why is that significant when i examined the body i noticed that the blade of the letter opener was pointing upwards not down if i wanted to murder someone continued blakemore rising from his chair and picking up a ruler and i was taller and heavier than that person i would raise my arm and strike down into his neck like this but if i was shorter and lighter than him and more important if i was defending myself blakemore knelt down in front of harry and looked up at him pointing the ruler towards his neck that would explain the angle at which the blade entered sir hugos neck it is even possible from that angle that he fell on to the blade which led me to conclude that he was far more likely to have been killed in selfdefence than murdered harry thought about the chief inspectors words before he said you used the words shorter and lighter chief inspector and defending myself are you suggesting that a woman might have been responsible for barringtons death youd have made a firstclass detective said blakemore and do you know who that woman is asked harry i have my suspicions admitted blakemore then why havent you arrested her because its quite difficult to arrest someone who later throws herself under the london express oh my god said harry i never made any connection between those two incidents why should you you werent even in england at the time true but after i was released from hospital i trawled through every newspaper that even mentioned sir hugos death did you ever find out who the lady was no the body was in no state to be identified however a colleague from scotland yard who was investigating another case at the time informed me that sir hugo had been living with a woman in london for over a year and she gave birth to a daughter not long after he returned to bristol was that the child discovered in barringtons office the same said blakemore and where is that child now i have no idea can you at least tell me the name of the woman barrington was living with no i am not at liberty to do so said blakemore stubbing out his cigarette in an ashtray full of butts however its no secret that sir hugo employed a private detective who is now out of work and might be willing to talk for a modest remuneration the man with the limp said harry derek mitchell a damn fine policeman until he was invalided out of the force but theres one question mitchell wont be able to answer which i suspect you can you said the letter opener severed an artery so there must have been a great deal of blood there was indeed sir replied the chief inspector by the time i arrived sir hugo was lying in a pool of blood do you have any idea what happened to the suit sir hugo was wearing at the time or even the carpet no sir once a murder enquiry is closed all the personal belongings of the deceased are returned to the next of kin as for the carpet it was still in the office when id completed my investigation thats very helpful chief inspector im most grateful my pleasure sir harry blakemore stood up and accompanied harry to the door may i say how much i enjoyed the diary of a convict and although i dont normally deal in rumour ive read that you might be writing a detective novel after our chat today i shall look forward to reading it would you consider looking at an early draft and giving me your professional opinion in the past sir harry your family havent cared too much for my professional opinion let me assure you chief inspector that mr clifton does harry replied once harry had left the police station he drove over to the manor house to tell emma his news emma listened attentively and when hed come to the end she surprised him with her first question did inspector blakemore tell you what happened to the little girl no he didnt seem that interested but then why should he be because she might just be a barrington and therefore my halfsister how thoughtless of me said harry taking emma into his arms it never crossed my mind why should it asked emma you have enough to cope with why dont you start by calling my grandfather and asking him if he knows what happened to the carpet and leave me to worry about the little girl im a very lucky man you know said harry as he reluctantly released her get on with it said emma when harry telephoned lord harvey to ask him about the carpet he was once again taken by surprise i replaced it within days of the police completing their investigation what happened to the old one harry asked i personally threw it into one of the shipyards furnaces and watched it burn until there was nothing left but ashes lord harvey said with considerable feeling harry wanted to say damn but held his tongue when he joined emma for lunch he asked mrs barrington if she knew what had happened to sir hugos clothes elizabeth told harry that shed instructed the police to dispose of them in any way they considered appropriate after lunch harry returned to barrington hall and called the local police station he asked the desk sergeant if he could remember what had happened to sir hugo barringtons clothes once the investigation had been closed everything will have been entered in the log book at the time sir harry if you give me a moment ill check it turned out to be several moments before the sergeant came back on the line how time flies he said id forgotten how long ago that case was but ive managed to track down the details you wanted harry held his breath we threw out the shirt underwear and socks but we gave one overcoat grey one hat brown felt one suit lovatgreen tweed and one pair of brogues brown leather to miss penhaligon who distributes all unclaimed goods on behalf of the sally army not the easiest of women the sergeant added without explanation the sign on the counter read miss penhaligon this is most irregular sir harry said the woman standing behind the name most irregular harry was glad that hed brought emma along with him but it could prove incredibly important for both of us he said taking emmas hand i dont doubt that sir harry but its still most irregular i cant imagine what my supervisor will make of it harry couldnt imagine miss penhaligon having a supervisor she turned her back on them and began to study a neat row of box files on a shelf dust was not allowed to settle on she finally pulled out one marked and placed it on the counter she opened it and had to turn several pages before she came across what she was looking for no one seemed to want the brown felt hat she announced in fact my records show that we still have it in store the overcoat was allocated to a mr stephenson the suit to someone who goes by the name of old joey and the brown brogues to a mr watson do you have any idea where we might find any of those gentlemen asked emma they are rarely to be found apart said miss penhaligon in the summer they never stray far from the municipal park while in the winter we accommodate them in our hostel i feel confident that at this time of year youll find them in the park thank you miss penhaligon said harry giving her a warm smile you couldnt have been more helpful miss penhaligon beamed my pleasure sir harry i could get used to being addressed as sir harry he said to emma as they walked out of the building not if youre still hoping to marry me she said because i have no desire to be lady barrington harry spotted him lying on a park bench with his back to them he was wrapped up in a grey overcoat im sorry to bother you mr stephenson said harry touching him gently on the shoulder but we need your help a grimy hand shot out but he didnt turn over harry placed a half crown in the outstretched palm mr stephenson bit the coin before cocking his head to take a closer look at harry what do you want he asked were looking for old joey said emma softly the corporals got bench number one on account of his age and seniority this is bench number two and ill take over bench number one when old joey dies which shouldnt be long now mr watsons got bench number three so hell get bench number two when i get bench number one but ive already warned him hes going to have to wait a long time and do you by any chance know if old joey is still in possession of a green tweed suit asked harry never takes it off said mr stephenson grown attached to it you might say he added with a slight chuckle he got the suit i got the overcoat and mr watson got the shoes he says theyre a bit tight but he doesnt complain none of us wanted the hat so where will we find bench number one asked emma where its always been in the bandstand under cover joey calls it his palace but hes a bit soft in the head on account of the fact he still suffers from shellshock mr stephenson turned his back on them on account of the fact that he felt hed earned his half crown it wasnt difficult for harry and emma to find the bandstand or old joey who turned out to be its only occupant he was sitting bolt upright in the middle of bench number one as if he were seated on a throne emma didnt need to see the faded brown stains to recognize her fathers old tweed suit but how would they ever get him to part with it she wondered what do you want said old joey suspiciously as they walked up the steps and into his kingdom if its my bench youre after you can forget it because possession is ninetenths of the law as i keep reminding mr stephenson no said emma gently we dont want your bench old joey but we wondered if youd like a new suit no thank you miss very happy with the one i got it keeps me warm so i dont need no other one but wed give you a new suit that would be just as warm said harry old joeys done nothing wrong he said turning to face him harry stared at the row of medals on his chest the mons star the long service medal and the victory medal and a single stripe that had been sewn on to his sleeve i need your help corporal he said old joey sprang to attention saluted and said bayonet fixed sir just give the order and the lads are ready to go over the top harry felt ashamed emma and harry returned the next day with a herringbone overcoat a new tweed suit and a pair of shoes for old joey mr stephenson paraded around the park in his new blazer and grey flannels while mr watson bench number three was delighted with his doublebreasted sports jacket and cavalry twills but as he didnt need another pair of shoes he asked emma to give them to mr stephenson she handed the rest of sir hugos wardrobe to a grateful miss penhaligon harry left the park with sir hugo barringtons bloodstained lovatgreen tweed suit professor inchcape studied the blood stains under a microscope for some time before he offered an opinion ill need to carry out several more tests before i make a final assessment but on a preliminary inspection im fairly confident that ill be able to tell you which blood group these samples came from thats a relief said harry but how long will it be before you know the results a couple of days would be my guess said the professor three at the most ill give you a call as soon as i find out sir harry lets hope you have to make the call to mr clifton ive phoned the lord chancellors office said lord harvey and let them know that blood tests are being carried out on hugos clothes if the blood group is rhesus positive im sure hell ask the law lords to reconsider their verdict in light of the fresh evidence but if we dont get the result were hoping for said harry then what the lord chancellor will schedule a debate in the parliamentary calendar soon after the house is reconvened after the general election but lets hope professor inchcapes findings make that unnecessary by the way does giles know what youre up to no sir but as im spending the afternoon with him ill be able to bring him up to date dont tell me hes talked you into doing a stint of canvassing im afraid so although hes well aware ill be voting tory at the election but i have assured him that my mother and uncle stan will both be supporting him dont let the press find out that you wont be voting for him because theyll be looking for any opportunity to drive a stake between the two of you bosom pals is not on their agenda all the more reason to hope that the professor comes up with the right result and were all put out of our misery amen to that said lord harvey william warwick was just about to solve the crime when the phone rang harry still had the gun in his hand as he walked across the library and picked up the receiver its professor inchcape can i have a word with sir harry fiction was replaced by fact in a cruel moment harry didnt need to be told the results of the blood tests speaking he said im afraid my news isnt what you were hoping for said the professor sir hugos blood type turns out to be rhesus negative so the possibility of him being your father cant be eliminated on those grounds harry telephoned ashcombe hall harvey here said the voice he knew so well its harry sir im afraid youre going to have to phone the lord chancellor and tell him the debate will be going ahead giles had become so preoccupied with getting elected to the house of commons as the member of parliament for bristol docklands and harry was so involved with the publication of william warwick and the case of the blind witness that when they received an invitation to join lord harvey at his country home for sunday lunch they both assumed it would be a family gathering but when they turned up at ashcombe hall there was no sign of any other member of the family lawson did not escort them to the drawing room or even the dining room but to his lordships study where they found lord harvey seated behind his desk with two empty leather chairs facing him he didnt waste any time on small talk ive been informed by the lord chancellors office that thursday september th has been reserved in the parliamentary calendar for a debate that will determine which of you will inherit the family title we have two months to prepare i will be opening the debate from the front bench said lord harvey and i expect to be opposed by lord preston whats he hoping to achieve asked harry he wants to undermine the hereditary system and to do him justice he doesnt make any bones about it perhaps if i could get an appointment to see him said harry and let him know my views hes not interested in you or your views said lord harvey hes simply using the debate as a platform to air his wellknown opinions on the hereditary principle but surely if i were to write to him i already have said giles and even though were in the same party he didnt bother to reply in his opinion the issue is far more important than any one individual case said lord harvey wont such an intransigent stance go down badly with their lordships asked harry not necessarily replied lord harvey reg preston used to be a trade union firebrand until ramsay macdonald offered him a seat in the lords hes always been a formidable orator and since joining us on the red benches has become someone you cant afford to underestimate do you have any sense of how the house might divide asked giles the government whips tell me it will be a closerun thing the labour peers will get behind reg because they cant afford to be seen supporting the hereditary principle and the tories asked harry the majority will support me not least because the last thing theyll want is to see the hereditary principle being dealt a blow in their own back yard although there are still one or two waverers ill have to work on what about the liberals asked giles heaven alone knows although theyve announced that it will be a free vote a free vote queried harry there will be no party whip explained giles each member can decide which corridor to go into as a matter of principle and finally there are the crossbenchers continued lord harvey they will listen to the arguments on both sides and then go where their conscience guides them so well only discover how they intend to vote when the division is called so what can we do to help asked harry you harry as a writer and you giles as a politician can start by assisting me with my speech any contribution either of you would care to make will be most welcome lets start by drawing up an outline plan over lunch neither giles nor harry thought it worth mentioning to their host such frivolous matters as forthcoming general elections or publication dates as the three of them made their way through to the dining room whens your book being published giles asked as they drove away from ashcombe hall later that afternoon july twentieth said harry so it wont be out until after the election my publishers want me to do a tour of the country and carry out some signing sessions as well as a few press interviews be warned said giles the journalists wont ask you any questions about the book only your views on who should inherit the title how often do i have to tell them that my sole interest is emma and ill sacrifice anything to be allowed to spend the rest of my life with her asked harry trying not to sound exasperated you can have the title you can have the estate you can have all that therein is if i can have emma william warwick and the case of the blind witness was well received by the critics but giles turned out to be right the press didnt seem to be particularly interested in the ambitious young detective constable from bristol only the writers alter ego giles barrington and his chances of regaining the family title whenever harry told the press that he had no interest in the title it only made them more convinced he did in what the journalists regarded as the battle for the barrington inheritance all the newspapers with the exception of the daily telegraph supported the handsome brave selfmade popular smart grammarschool boy who they repeatedly reminded their readers had been raised in the back streets of bristol harry took every opportunity to remind the same journalists that giles had been a contemporary at bristol grammar school was now the labour mp for bristol docklands just happened to have won the mc at tobruk a cricket blue in his first year at oxford and certainly wasnt responsible for which cot he was born in harrys loyal support of his friend only made him even more popular with both the press and the public despite the fact that giles had been elected to the house of commons by over three thousand votes and had already taken his place on the green benches he knew it would be a debate that was due to take place on the red benches at the other end of the corridor in just over a months time that would decide both his and harrys future harry was used to being woken by birds chirping happily in the trees that surrounded barrington hall and sebastian charging into the library uninvited and unannounced or the sound of emma arriving for breakfast after her early morning gallop but today it was different he was woken by street lights the noise of traffic and big ben chiming relentlessly every fifteen minutes to remind him how many hours were left before lord harvey would rise to open a debate after which men hed never met would cast a vote that would decide his and giless futures for a thousand years he had a long bath as it was too early to go down for breakfast once he was dressed he phoned barrington hall only to be told by the butler that miss barrington had already left for the station harry was puzzled why would emma catch the early train when they hadnt planned to meet up until lunch when harry walked into the morning room just after seven he wasnt surprised to find giles already up and reading the morning papers is your grandfather up asked harry long before either of us i suspect when i came down just after six the light was on in his study once this dreadful business is behind us whatever the result we must get him to spend a few days in mulgelrie castle and take a wellearned rest good idea said harry as he slumped into the nearest armchair only to shoot back up again a moment later when lord harvey entered the room time for breakfast chaps never wise to go to the gallows on an empty stomach despite lord harveys advice the three of them didnt eat a great deal as they considered the day ahead lord harvey tried out a few key phrases while harry and giles made some lastminute suggestions to be added or taken away from his script i wish i could tell their lordships how much of a contribution both of you have made said the old man once hed added a couple of sentences to his peroration right chaps time to fix bayonets and go over the top both of them were nervous i was hoping you might be able to help me said emma unable to look him in the eye i will if i can miss he said emma looked up at a man who although he was cleanshaven and his shoes must have been polished that morning wore a shirt with a frayed collar and the trousers of his wellworn suit were baggy when my father died emma could never bring herself to say was killed the police found a baby girl in his office do you have any idea what happened to her no said the man but as the police werent able to contact her next of kin she would have been placed in a church mission and put up for adoption do you have any idea which orphanage she ended up in asked emma no but i could always make some enquiries if how much did my father owe you thirtyseven pounds and eleven shillings said the private detective who took out a wad of bills from an inside pocket emma waved a hand opened her purse and extracted two crisp fivepound notes ill settle the balance when we meet again thank you miss barrington mitchell said as he rose from his place assuming the meeting was now over ill be in touch as soon as i have news just one more question said emma looking up at him do you know the little girls name jessica smith he replied why smith thats the name they always give a child nobody wants lord harvey locked himself in his office on the third floor of the queens tower for the rest of the morning he didnt leave his room even to join harry giles and emma for lunch preferring a sandwich and a stiff whisky while he went over his speech once again giles and harry sat on the green benches in the central lobby of the house of commons and chatted amiably as they waited for emma to join them harry hoped that anyone who saw them peers commoners and press alike would be left in no doubt that they were the closest of friends harry kept checking his watch as he knew they had to be seated in the visitors gallery of the house of lords before the lord chancellor took his place on the woolsack at two oclock harry allowed himself a smile when he saw emma come rushing into the central lobby just before one giles gave his sister a wave as both men rose to greet her what have you been up to asked harry even before hed bent down to kiss her ill tell you over lunch promised emma as she linked arms with both of them but first i want to be brought up to date on your news too close to call seems to be the general consensus said giles as he guided his guests towards the visitors dining room but it wont be long now before we all learn our fates he added morbidly the house of lords was full long before big ben struck twice and by the time the lord high chancellor of great britain entered the chamber there wasnt a place to be found on the packed benches in fact several members were left standing at the bar of the house lord harvey glanced across to the other side of the chamber to see reg preston smiling at him like a lion who had just spotted his lunch their lordships rose as one when the lord chancellor took his place on the woolsack he bowed to the assembled gathering and they returned the compliment before resuming their seats the lord chancellor opened his goldtasselled red leather folder my lords we are gathered to give judgment as to whether mr giles barrington or mr harry clifton is entitled to inherit the title estate and accoutrements of the late sir hugo barrington baronet defender of the peace lord harvey looked up to see harry emma and giles seated in the front row of the visitors gallery he was greeted with a warm smile from his granddaughter and could lipread her words good luck gramps i call upon lord harvey to open the debate said the lord high chancellor before taking his seat on the woolsack lord harvey rose from his place on the front bench and gripped the sides of the dispatch box to help steady his nerves while his colleagues on the benches behind him greeted their noble and gallant friend with cries of hear hear he looked around the house aware that he was about to deliver the most important speech of his life my lords he began i stand before you today representing my kinsman mr giles barrington a member of the other place in his lawful claim to the barrington title and all the possessions of that lineage my lords allow me to acquaint you with the circumstances that have brought this case to your lordships attention in joshua barrington was created a baronet by queen victoria for services to the shipping industry which included the barrington line a fleet of oceangoing vessels that are to this day still based in the port of bristol joshua was the fifth child in a family of nine and left school at the age of seven unable to read or write before he began life as an apprentice at the coldwater shipping company where it soon became clear to all those around him that this was no ordinary child by the age of thirty he had gained his masters certificate and at fortytwo he was invited to join the board of coldwaters which was experiencing difficult times during the next ten years he rescued the company virtually singlehanded and for the next twentytwo years served as its chairman but my lords you need to know a little more about sir joshua the man to understand why we are gathered here today because it certainly would not have been at his bidding above all sir joshua was a godfearing man who considered his word was his bond a handshake was enough for sir joshua to accept that a contract had been signed where are such men today my lords hear hear echoed around the chamber but like so many successful men my lords sir joshua took a little longer than the rest of us to accept his own mortality a ripple of laughter greeted this statement so when the time came for him to make his first and only will he had already fulfilled the makers contract of three score years and ten that did not stop him approaching the task with his usual vigour and vision to that end he invited sir isaiah waldegrave the leading qc in the land to represent him an advocate who like you my lord he said turning to face the woolsack ended his judicial days as lord high chancellor i mention this my lords to emphasize that sir joshuas testament bears a legal weight and authority that does not allow it to be questioned by his successors in that will he left everything to his first born and next of kin walter barrington my oldest and dearest friend that included the title the shipping company the estates and i quote the exact words of the will all that therein is this debate my lords is not about the validity of sir joshuas last will and testament but only about who can rightfully claim to be his heir at this point my lords i would like you to take something into consideration that would never have crossed sir joshuas godfearing mind the possibility that an heir of his could ever father an illegitimate son hugo barrington became next in line when his elder brother nicholas was killed fighting for his country at ypres in hugo succeeded to the title in on the death of his father sir walter when the house divides my lords you will be called upon to decide between my grandson mr giles barrington who is the legitimate son of a union between the late sir hugo barrington and my only daughter elizabeth harvey and mr harry clifton who i would suggest is the legitimate son of mrs maisie clifton and the late arthur clifton may i at this point my lords seek your indulgence and speak for a moment a little about my grandson giles barrington he was educated at bristol grammar school from where he went on to win a place at brasenose college oxford however he did not complete his degree rather he decided to abandon the life of an undergraduate to join the wessex regiment soon after the outbreak of war while serving in tobruk as a young lieutenant he won the military cross defending that place against rommels afrika korps he was later captured and taken to weinsberg prisoner of war camp in germany from where he escaped to return to england and rejoin his regiment for the remainder of the hostilities in the general election he stood for and indeed won a seat in another place as the honourable member for bristol docklands loud hear hears came from the benches opposite on the death of his father he inherited the title without dispute as it had been widely reported that harry clifton had been buried at sea not long after the declaration of war it is one of the ironies of life my lords that my granddaughter emma through her diligence and determination was the person who discovered that harry was still alive and she unwittingly set in motion the train of events that has brought your lordships to this house today lord harvey looked into the gallery and gave his granddaughter a warm smile there is my lords no dispute that harry clifton was born before giles barrington however there is i would submit no definite or conclusive proof that harry clifton is the result of a liaison between sir hugo barrington and miss maisie tancock later to become mrs arthur clifton mrs clifton does not deny that she had sexual intercourse with hugo barrington on one occasion in and one occasion only however a few weeks later she married mr arthur clifton and a child was later born whose name was entered on the birth certificate as harry arthur clifton you therefore have my lords on the one hand giles barrington the legitimate offspring of sir hugo barrington on the other you have harry clifton who perchance could possibly be the progeny of sir hugo while there can be no doubt that giles barrington is and is that a risk you are willing to take my lords if it is allow me to add just one more factor that might help your lordships decide which lobby they should enter at the conclusion of this debate harry clifton who is seated in the visitors gallery this afternoon has made his own position clear again and again he has no interest in being burdened i use his own word with the title but would far rather it was inherited by his close friend giles barrington several peers looked up into the gallery to see giles and emma barrington seated on either side of harry clifton who was nodding lord harvey did not continue until he had regained the attention of the whole house and so my lords when you cast your votes later tonight i urge you to take into consideration the wishes of harry clifton and the intentions of sir joshua barrington and give the benefit of the doubt to my grandson giles barrington i am grateful to the house for its indulgence lord harvey lowered himself on to the bench to be greeted with loud cheers and the waving of order papers harry felt confident that he had won the day when the house had regained its composure the lord chancellor rose from his place and said i call upon lord preston to respond harry looked down from the gallery and watched as a man hed never seen before rose slowly from the opposition benches lord preston could not have been an inch above five foot and his squat muscular body and furnacelined face would have left no one in any doubt that he had been a labourer all his working life while his pugnacious expression suggested that he feared no man reg preston spent a moment surveying the benches opposite like a private soldier who puts his head above the parapet to take a closer look at the enemy my lords i would like to open my remarks by congratulating lord harvey on a brilliant and moving speech however i would suggest that its very brilliance was its weakness and bears the seeds of its downfall the noble lords contribution was indeed moving but as it progressed he sounded more and more like an advocate whos only too aware that hes defending a weak case preston had created a silence in the chamber that lord harvey had not managed let us my lords consider some of the facts so conveniently papered over by the noble and gallant lord harvey no one disputes that the young hugo barrington had sexual relations with maisie tancock some six weeks before she married arthur clifton or that nine months later almost to the day she gave birth to a son whose name was conveniently entered on the birth certificate as harry arthur clifton well thats sorted out that little problem hasnt it my lords except for the inconvenient fact that if mrs clifton conceived that child on the day she married he was born seven months and twelve days later now my lords id be the first to accept thats a possibility but as a betting man if i was given the choice between nine months and seven months and twelve days i know where id place my wager and i dont think the bookies would offer me very long odds a little laughter broke out on the labour benches and i should add my lords that the child weighed in at nine pounds four ounces that doesnt sound premature to me the laughter was even louder let us next consider something else that must have slipped lord harveys agile mind hugo barrington like his father and his grandfather before him suffered from a hereditary condition known as colourblindness as does his son giles and so does harry clifton the odds are shortening my lords more laughter followed and muttered discussion broke out on both sides of the house lord harvey looked grimly on as he waited for the next punch to land let us shorten those odds still further my lords it was the great dr milne of st thomas hospital who discovered that if parents shared the same rhesus negative blood type then their children will also be rhesus negative sir hugo barrington was rhesus negative mrs clifton is rhesus negative and surprise surprise harry clifton is rhesus negative a blood type that only twelve per cent of the british people share i think the bookies are paying out my lords because the only other horse in the race didnt reach the starting gate more laughter followed and lord harvey slumped even lower on the bench angry that he hadnt pointed out that arthur clifton was also rhesus negative now allow me to touch on one thing my lords on which i am wholeheartedly in agreement with lord harvey no one has the right to question sir joshua barringtons will when it has such a fine legal pedigree therefore all we have to decide is what the words first born and next of kin actually mean most of you in this house will be well aware of my strongly held views on the hereditary principle preston smiled before adding i consider it to be without principle this time the laughter only came from one side of the house while those on the benches opposite sat in stony silence my lords should you decide to ignore legal precedent and tamper with historical tradition simply to suit your own convenience you will bring the hereditary concept into disrepute and in time the whole edifice will surely come crashing down on your lordships heads he said pointing to the benches opposite so let us consider the two young men involved in this sad dispute not i might say my lords a dispute of their making harry clifton we are told would prefer that his friend giles barrington inherit the title how very decent of him but then harry clifton is without question a decent man however my lords should we travel down that road every hereditary peer in the land would in future be able to decide which of his offspring he would prefer to succeed him and that my lords is a road with a deadend sign the house had fallen silent and lord preston was able to lower his voice to barely a whisper did this decent young man harry clifton have any ulterior motive when he told the world that he wanted his friend giles barrington to be acknowledged as the firstborn every eye was on lord preston you see my lords the church of england would not allow harry clifton to marry the woman he loved giles barringtons sister emma barrington because they werent in much doubt that they shared the same father harry had never loathed a man more in his life i see the bishops benches are packed today my lords continued preston turning to face the churchmen i shall be fascinated to discover the ecclesiastical view on this matter because they cannot have it both ways one or two of the bishops looked uneasy and while i am on the subject of harry cliftons pedigree may i suggest that as a candidate in the lists he is every bit the equal of giles barrington brought up in the back streets of bristol against all the odds he wins a place at bristol grammar school and five years later an exhibition to brasenose college oxford and young harry didnt even wait for war to be declared before he left the university with the intention of joining up only being prevented from doing so when his ship was torpedoed by a german uboat leading lord harvey and the rest of the barrington family to believe that he had been buried at sea anyone who has read mr cliftons moving words in his book the diary of a convict knows how he ended up serving in the us army where he won the silver star before being badly wounded by a german landmine only weeks before peace was declared but the germans couldnt kill off harry clifton quite that easily my lords and neither should we the labour benches erupted as one and lord preston waited until the house had fallen silent once again finally my lords we should ask ourselves why we are here today i will tell you why it is because giles barrington is appealing against a judgment made by the seven leading legal minds in the land something else lord harvey failed to mention in his heartfelt speech but i will remind you that in their wisdom the law lords came down in favour of harry clifton inheriting the baronetcy if you are thinking of reversing that decision my lords before you do so you must be certain that they have made a fundamental error of judgment and so my lords said preston as he began his peroration when you cast your votes to decide which of these two men should inherit the barrington title do not base your judgment on convenience but on strong probability because then to quote lord harvey you will give the benefit of the doubt not to giles barrington but to harry clifton as the odds if not the pedigree are stacked in his favour and may i conclude my lords he said staring defiantly at the benches opposite by suggesting that when you enter the division lobby you should take your consciences with you and leave your politics in the chamber lord preston sat down to loud acclamation from his own benches while several peers on the opposite side of the house could be seen nodding lord harvey wrote a note to his opponent congratulating him on a powerful speech that was made even more persuasive by its obvious conviction following the tradition of the house both opening speakers remained in their places to listen to the views of fellow members who followed them there turned out to be several unpredictable contributions delivered from both sides of the house which only left lord harvey even more unsure what the outcome would be when the votes were finally cast one speech that was listened to with rapt attention from all quarters of the chamber was delivered by the bishop of bristol and was clearly endorsed by his noble and ecclesiastical friends who sat on the benches beside him my lords said the bishop if in your wisdom you vote tonight in favour of mr giles barrington inheriting the title my noble friends and i would be left with no choice but to withdraw the churchs objection to a lawful marriage taking place between mr harry clifton and miss emma barrington because my lords were you to decide that harry is not the son of hugo barrington there can be no objection to such a union but how will they vote lord harvey whispered to the colleague sitting beside him on the front bench my colleagues and i will not be casting a vote in either lobby when the division is called as we feel we are not qualified to make either a political or a legal judgment on this issue what about a moral judgment said lord preston loud enough to be heard on the bishops benches lord harvey had at last found something on which the two of them were in agreement another speech that took the house by surprise was delivered by lord hughes a crossbencher and a former president of the british medical association my lords i must inform the house that recent medical research carried out at the moorfields hospital has shown that colourblindness can only be passed down through the female line the lord chancellor opened his red folder and made an emendation to his notes and therefore for lord preston to suggest that because sir hugo barrington was colourblind it is more likely that harry clifton is his son is bogus and should be dismissed as nothing more than a coincidence when big ben struck ten times there were still several members who wished to catch the lord chancellors eye in his wisdom he decided to allow the debate to run its natural course the final speaker sat down a few minutes after three the following morning when the division bell finally rang rows of dishevelled and exhausted members trooped out of the chamber and into the voting lobby harry still seated in the gallery noticed that lord harvey was fast asleep no one commented after all he hadnt left his place for the past thirteen hours lets hope he wakes up in time to vote said giles with a chuckle which he stifled as his grandfather slumped further down on to the bench a badge messenger quickly left the chamber and called for an ambulance while two ushers rushed on to the floor of the house and gently lowered the noble lord on to a stretcher harry giles and emma left the visitors gallery and ran down the stairs and reached the peers lobby just as the stretcher bearers came out of the chamber the three of them accompanied lord harvey out of the building and into a waiting ambulance once members had cast their votes in the lobby of their choice they slowly made their way back into the chamber no one wanted to leave before theyd heard the result of the count members on both sides of the house were puzzled not to see lord harvey in his place on the front bench rumours began to circulate around the chamber and when lord preston was told the news he turned ashenwhite it was several more minutes before the four whips on duty returned to the chamber to inform the house of the result of the division they marched up the centre aisle in step like the guards officers they had been and came to a halt in front of the lord chancellor a hush descended on the house the chief whip raised the voting slip and declared in a loud voice contents to the right two hundred and seventythree votes noncontents to the left two hundred and seventythree votes pandemonium broke out in the chamber and in the gallery above as members and visitors sought guidance as to what would happen next old hands realized that the lord chancellor would have the casting vote he sat alone on the woolsack inscrutable and unmoved by the noise and clamour all around him as he waited patiently for the house to come to order once the last whisper had died away the lord chancellor rose slowly from the woolsack adjusted his fullbottomed wig and tugged the lapels of his black and goldbraided robe before he addressed the house every eye in the chamber was fixed upon him in the packed gallery overlooking the chamber those who had been fortunate enough to acquire a ticket leant over the railings in anticipation there were three empty seats in the distinguished guests gallery those of the three people whose future the lord chancellor held in his gift my lords he began i have listened with interest to each and every contribution your lordships have made during this long and fascinating debate i have considered the arguments so eloquently and so passionately delivered from all parts of the house and find myself facing something of a dilemma i would like to share my concerns with you all in normal circumstances being presented with a tied vote i would not hesitate to support the law lords in their earlier judgment when they came down in favour by four votes to three of harry clifton inheriting the barrington title indeed it would have been irresponsible of me not to do so however your lordships may not be aware that just after the division was called lord harvey the proposer of the motion was taken ill and therefore unable to cast his vote none of us can be in any doubt which corridor he would have entered ensuring that he would have won the day even if it was by the slimmest of margins and the title would therefore have passed to his grandson giles barrington my lords i am sure the house will agree that given these circumstances my final judgment will require the wisdom of solomon muffled hear hears could be heard from both sides of the house however i have to tell the house the lord chancellor continued that i have not yet decided which son i should cut in half and which son i should restore to his birthright a ripple of laughter followed these remarks which helped break the tension in the chamber therefore my lords he said once he had again captured the attention of the whole house i will announce my judgment in the case of barrington versus clifton at ten oclock this morning he resumed his seat on the woolsack without uttering another word the chief usher banged his rod on the ground three times but could barely be heard above the clamour house will reconvene at ten oclock in the forenoon he bellowed when the lord chancellor will deliver his judgment in the case of barrington versus clifton house will rise the lord chancellor rose from his place bowed to the assembled gathering and their lordships repaid the compliment the chief usher once again banged his rod three times on the ground house is adjourned jeffrey archer
