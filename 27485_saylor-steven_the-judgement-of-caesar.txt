steven saylor the judgement of caesar a note on dates by the year bc when this novel takes place the flawed roman calendar had drawn some two months ahead of the actual seasons thus although the story begins on the th of september by the roman calendar the season is actually high summer and the date by modern reckoning is closer to the rd of july chapter i there can you see it the lighthouse bethesda gripped my arm and pointed to a sparkle of light on the dark horizon it was the hour before dawn the deck of the ship rocked gently beneath our feet i squinted and followed her gaze all night bethesda had stayed awake awaiting the first glimpse of the great lighthouse of alexandria it could be any minute now the captain had told us the previous day at twilight and bethesda had staked a place at the prow of the ship her gaze set on the southern horizon where bluegreen sea met azure sky slowly the blues darkened to deepest purple and then to black the sky was pierced with stars and starlight lit the face of the deep a sliver of moon traversed the sky and still the lighthouse did not appear it seemed we were not quite as close to alexandria as the captain thought yet i trusted his navigation the voyage from rome had so far been quick and uneventful and even i could tell from looking at the stars that our course was now due south the steady breeze at our backs was taking us across a calm sea directly toward egypt all night i stood beside bethesda joining in her vigil the night was warm but occasionally she shivered and i held her close many years ago we had departed from alexandria by ship watching the flame atop the lighthouse for hours as it gradually dwindled and finally vanished from sight now we were returning to alexandria and again we stood together on a ship scanning the horizon for a first glimpse of that same undying flame there she said this time in a whisper i squinted uncertainly might the glimmer of light be merely a star twinkling just above the waters edge but no the light was too steady to be a star and as we watched little by little it grew righter pharos i whispered for that was the name of the lighthouse as well as the name of the island upon which it was builtthe oldest and by far the greatest lighthouse in all the world with the brightest flame ever produced by men set atop the tallest tower ever built for hundreds of years it had guided ships to alexandria alexandria bethesda whispered she had been born there and there i had met her during my travels as a young man after i took her home with me to rome neither of us had ever returned but no one forgets alexandria over the years i had dreamed often of the citys broad avenues and magnificent temples in the last few days as the ship brought us ever nearer memories had come flooding back in overwhelming profusionnot only sights and sounds but also flavors and smells and tactile sensations i swooned remembering waves of heat from the paving stones of the canopic way on a hot day the dry kiss of a desert breeze through the palm trees the cool refreshment of a swim in lake mareotis under the looming skyline of the city during the journey bethesda and i made a game of sharing memories trading them back and forth like children playing tag either of us had merely to say a word to spark a memory that sparked yet more memories now with the light of the pharos twinkling in the distance she squeezed my hand and whispered scarab i sighed the jeweler with that little shop just down the hill from the temple of serapis bethesda nodded yes the one with the crooked nose no that was his assistant the jeweler himself had a bald spot and a wattle neck yes i remember now how could you forget bethesda he accused you of stealing that scarab pendant from right under his assistants crooked nose the assistants nose wasnt the only thing crooked about him he was the one who took the scarab as i eventually discovered the poor fellow should be finishing up his sentence in the salt mines about now poor fellow he should never have allowed the blame to fall on an innocent girl her eyes flashed and i saw a glimmer of the mischievous spirit that still dwelled in her despite the terrible illness that had befallen her i squeezed her hand she squeezed it back and my heart ached at the feebleness of her grip bethesdas illness was our reason for coming to egypt for months it had plagued her sapping her of strength and joy eluding every cure propounded by every physician we consulted in rome at last bethesda herself proposed a cure she must return to egypt she must bathe in the waters of the nile only then could she be made whole again how did bethesda come to this knowledge i had no idea one morning she simply announced that we must be off to alexandria having come into a bit of money i had no excuse to refuse her to act as our bodyguard and because he originally came from alexandria we took with us the newest member of my household a hulking young mute named rupa we also brought along my two slave boys the brothers mopsus and androcles their quickness and cleverness would hopefully outweigh their penchant for getting into trouble we were the ships only passengers in such troubled times few traveled who could possibly avoid it rupa and the boys slept as did most of the ships crew in the stillness of that final hour before dawn it seemed that bethesda and i were the only two people alive and that the beacon of the pharos growing gradually steadily brighter shone for us alone little by little the sky lightened the seas black luster faded to the color of slate a faint red glow suffused the eastern horizon the light of the pharos seemed to grow fainter outshone by the sudden flicker of red flame that announced the rising of helios in his fiery chariot i sensed a change on the ship i looked behind us to see that the deck was now swarming with sailors tending to ropes and riggings how long had they been there i seemed to have dozed while watching the dawn yet i could have sworn that i never closed my eyes the light of the pharos had bemused me i blinked and shook my head i looked more closely at the sailors their expressions were grim not joyful among them i saw the captain his face was grimmest of all he was an affable fellow a grizzled greek about my own age sixty or so and we had become friendly over the course of the voyage he saw me staring and strode close by me on his way to bark an order at some of his men under his breath he muttered red sky dont like it i turned toward bethesda her eyes narrowed her lips parted she continued to stare at the beacon of the pharos oblivious to the commotion behind us for the first time i could barely discern the tower of the lighthouse itself a tiny sliver of pale stone beneath the bright point of light so close bethesda whispered we had only to stay on course and maintain a steady progress and the tower of the pharos would little by little grow larger and more distinctto the height of a fingernail a finger a hand we would begin to make out the fluted stonework that decorated its exterior we would see the statutes of gods and kings that ornamented its base and the balconies of its upper reaches beyond the pharos we would see the crowded ships in the great harbor and the jumble of rooftops that made up the skyline of alexandria i felt a tug at the sleeve of my tunic and turned to see little androcles staring up at me his slightly bigger brother mopsus stood behind him and looming over them was rupa rubbing the sleep from his eyes master said androcles whats wrong from amidships the captain spared a glance at me and barked keep those two boys out of the way then to his sailors down the sail raise your oars a sudden wind gusted from the west ripping a loose flap of sail from the hands of the sailors who were attempting to furl it the deck abruptly pitched and rocked beneath us the hull beneath the prow slapped the waves and we were covered with salty spume bethesda blinked and shivered and at last took her eyes from the pharos she looked at me dully husband whats happening im not sure i said perhaps we should take shelter aft i took her arm intending to guide her and my other charges to the small cabin at the stern of the ship but it was too late the storm arising from nowhere was upon us and the captain made a frantic gesture ordering us to stay where we were out of his sailors way grab hold of whatever you can he shouted his voice barely audible above a sudden shriek of wind raindrops stung my face and left grit in my mouth sand grated against my teeth i cursed and spat i had heard of such storms when i lived at alexandria but had never experienced onewhirling desert sandstorms that swept out over the sea combining with furious rainstorms to pelt windtossed ships with both water and earth once after such a storm a ship had sailed into the harbor at alexandria weighted down with sand the broiling sun having burned away the water to leave miniature sand dunes piled high on the decks the red light of the rising sun became a memory banished by howling darkness bethesda pressed close to me i opened my eyes just enough to see that rupa was nearby clutching the boys with both arms yet somehow managing to hold fast to the ships rail mopsus and androcles hid their faces against his broad chest as quickly as it had struck the lashing wind died down the howling diminished but did not cease it seemed merely to draw back in all directions surrounding us but no longer touching us a hole opened in the sky above us showing an incongruous patch of blue amid the swirling darkness all around can you see the lighthouse bethesda whispered i gazed beyond the prow into a mist of deepest purple pierced by flashes of opalescent gray i saw no hint of the horizon much less a glimpse of the pharos beacon i had the uncanny sensation that alexandria no longer lay off the prow anyway the ship had been so spun about that i couldnt begin to guess which direction was southward i looked at the captain who stood amidships breathing hard but otherwise stockstill gripping a taut length of rigging with such force that his knuckles were white have you ever seen a storm like it i said lowering my voice instead of raising it for the circle of stillness around the ship was unnerving the captain made no answer but from his silence i knew that he was as confounded as i was strange days he finally said in the heavens as on earth the comment required no explanation everywhere and at all times men were on the lookout for portents and omens since the day that caesar crossed the rubicon river and marched on rome with his army drawing the whole world into ruinous civil war not a day had passed that could be called normal i myself had witnessed battles on sea and on land had been trapped in cities under siege had been nearly trampled by starving desperate citizens rioting in the roman forum i had seen men burned alive at sea and men drowned in a tunnel beneath the earth i had done things of which i had previously thought myself incapablekilled a man in cold blood disowned my beloved son fallen in love with a stranger who died in my arms i had deliberately turned my back on caesar and his mad ambitions yet caesar continued to call me his friend i had done a better job of alienating caesars rival pompey who had tried to strangle me with his own hands chaos reigned on earth and in the heavens men beheld its reflection birds were seen to fly backwards temples were struck by lightning blood red clouds formed visions of contesting armies in the days just before we left for alexandria word had reached rome of a momentous turn of events caesar and pompey had met at pharsalus in greece and if the reports could be trusted pompeys forces had been utterly destroyed the world held its breath awaiting the next gambit in the great game it was no surprise then that in such an uncanny storm a man like our captain could not help but see yet another manifestation of the chaos that had been loosed by the dogs of war as if to confirm this superstitious dread the circle of blue sky above us abruptly vanished and the ship was again lashed by rain but this rain carried no grit something larger struck my face startling me bethesda slid downward eluding my embrace she knelt to pick up the thing that flopped about on the deck it slipped from her fingers but she nimbly retrieved it i gave a start and shuddered expecting bethesda to squeal and cast the wriggling creature away from her but instead she cradled it in her hands and cooed with delight do you see what it is husband a tiny nile frog from out of the sky and miles from the delta impossible yet here it is it must be a sign from the gods surely but a sign of what i whispered grunting in disgust as another of the clammy creatures fell from the sky and struck my face i looked about and saw that the deck was alive with the leaping creatures some of the sailors laughed some wrinkled their noses in disgust some jumped to avoid being touched by the frogs and bellowed in fright a flash of lightning split the sky followed almost at once by a peal of thunder that rattled my teeth the frog in bethesdas hands leaped free over the parapet and into the void the deck spun beneath our feet making me dizzy i was overwhelmed by a strange illusion that the wind had borne the ship aloft and that we were skimming above the waves flying through the air i lost all sense of time but hours must have passed while we clutched at one another and braced ourselves against the power of the storm then at last the sea abruptly grew calm black clouds receded in all directions tumbling back upon themselves so that they seemed to pile up at the distant horizons like mountain walls steep polished and black tipped along their ragged crests with fire and opening ever and again with flashes of intolerable splendor while the bases were scrawled over with lightning like a written scroll the sun above our heads was small and as red as blood obscured by a thin black shroud of vapor never in all my travels on land or sea had i beheld anything like the uncanny light that suffused the world in that momenta lurid glow that seemed to come from no particular direction but before us far in the distance there was one break of clear blue sky on the horizon where yellow light shone upon a sparkling emerald sea the captain saw the opening in the gloom and ordered his men to sail toward it the sail was unfurled the oarsmen returned to their places the break on the horizon was so distinct that i almost expected to emerge from the gloom all at once as one emerged from the mouth of a cave instead as the oarsmen made steady progress raising and dipping their oars in unison we moved gradually from a world of darkness into a world of light above our heads the black mist thinned and dispersed and the sun turned from blood red to gold to our right a strip of low brown land appeared on the horizon we were proceeding eastward and the westering sun warming our rainsoaked shoulders and backs was at least a couple of hours past midday i looked over the parapet and saw that the water was a confluence of green and brown the brown being mud from the nile the storm had blown us well past alexandria to some point beyond the broad fanshaped delta of the nile so set was the captain on reaching calmer waters that he took no notice of the several ships that lay dead ahead of us their sails as bright as ivory in the glaring sunlight some of the vessels appeared to be warships such a group encountered closer to alexandria would have given no cause for alarm for there the harbor and its guardian fleet would have offered protection from vagabonds and pirates but our location appeared to be far from any port or harbor of consequence so that we might as well have been on the open sea we were acutely vulnerable to robbery and attack even as i was considering this the captain finally appeared to take notice of the vessels ahead of us he gave an order to veer southward toward land even though that arid featureless strip of shoreline appeared to offer very little in the way of succor or concealment but the other ships had already spotted us and whatever their intentions seemed unwilling to let us go without an encounter two smaller vessels struck out toward us the captain maintained a cool expression only a slight squint betraying his anxiety as he peered toward the pursuing ships but in his command to the rowers to accelerate a note of fear rang out as clearly as a trumpets call they doubled their speed so abruptly that the deck gave a slight lurch beneath us rupa i said intending merely to gain his attention but the hulking mute anticipated my query and reached into his tunic to discreetly show me that his dagger was readily at hand little mopsus seeing the glint of rupas blade swallowed hard his younger brother seized the occasion to give him a teasing nudge i found myself jealous of androcless naive courage there are few fates more dreaded by travelers than the prospect of being boarded at sea by hostile sailors far from any prospect of rescue even the mercy of the gods is rarely known to be dispensed at sea perhaps the glint of sunlight on water obscures their view from the heavens i reached into my tunic to test the grip of my own dagger if worse came to worst i might at least be able to spare bethesda the degradations of capture at sea with streaks of silver in her black hair she might no longer be young but even in her weakened state she was still desirable at least to my eyes we made good speed but the pursuing ships were faster as the shoreline drew only slightly closer the pursuers bore down on us their white sails full of wind armed men populated the decks they were warships not trading vessels it was no use attempting to elude them but the captain panicked having kept a cool head throughout the storm which might have capsized the ship and killed us all in an instant he lost his head when confronted with a human menace i scowled at his misjudgment if an encounter was inevitable forcing the pursuers to give chase would only stir excitement in their blood making even men with innocuous intentions more dangerous to deal with he would have been wiser to trim sail and turn about to meet them with whatever dignity and bravado he could muster but instead he gave a hoarse order to row at full speed the shoreline grew nearer yet showed no more features than before it was little more than a duncolored smudge along the horizon without even a palm tree to betray any sign of life that hopeless shore mirrored the hopelessness i felt at that moment but bethesda squeezed my hand and whispered perhaps these are caesars ships husband didnt you say that caesar himself might head for egypt next if the reports of his success in greece were true yes and caesar has always been your friend hasnt he husbandeven when youve been less than friendly to him i almost smiled at this sardonic jibe bethesda was still capable of needling me despite the malady that plagued her anything that gave evidence of her old spirit was cause for hope youre right i said those fellows pursuing us have the look of levantines but they could well be caesars men or men hes won over from pompey if in fact pompey is vanquished or dead if that fleet does belong to caesar and weve encountered him on his way to alexandria then i left the thought unspoken for bethesda knew what i was about to say and to actually speak his name aloud would be too painful if he had survived the travails of battle very likely my adopted son meto would be by caesars side i had seen him last in massilia in gaul where i had upbraided him and publicly disowned him for the intrigues and deceits he had practiced on caesars behalf no one in my family least of all bethesda quite understood why i had turned my back on a son i had adopted who had always been so dear to me i myself did not quite comprehend the violence of my reaction if these were caesars ships and if caesar was among them and if meto was with caesarwhat a jest of the gods that would be to snatch me from a quiet arrival in alexandria and set me down in the midst of caesars fleet faced with a reunion i could not bear to contemplate these thoughts as gloomy as they were at least served to distract me from imagining a more dreadful alternativethat the ships pursuing us were not from caesar after all these men could be pirates or renegade soldiers or something even worse whoever they were they were practiced sailors with considerable skill at pursuit and capture coordinating their movements with admirable precision they drew apart so as to pull alongside us both to starboard and port then slowed their speed to match ours they were close enough now so that i could see the leering faces of the armed men on deck were they bent on our destruction or merely exhilarated by the chase from the ship to our starboard an officer called out give it up captain weve caught you fair and square raise your oars or else well get rid of them for you the threat was literal i had seen warships employ just such a maneuver drawing alongside an enemy vessel veering close then withdrawing their oars so as to shear off the other ships stillextended oars rendering it helpless with two ships such a maneuver could be executed on both sides of us simultaneously given the skill our pursuers had so far displayed i had no doubt that they could pull it off the captain was still in a panic frozen to the spot and speechless his men looked to him for orders but received none we proceeded at full speed the pursuers matching us and drawing closer on either side by hercules i shouted tearing myself from bethesda to run to the captains side i gripped his arm give the order to raise oars the captain looked at me blankly i slapped him across the face he bolted and moved to strike back at me then the glimmer of reason lit his eyes he took a deep breath and raised his arms lift oars he cried trim sail the sailors heaving with exertion obeyed at once our pursuers with flawless seamanship mimicked our actions and all three ships remained side by side even as the waves began to brake our progress the ship to our starboard drew even closer the soldier who had ordered us to stop spoke again though he was now so close that he hardly needed to raise his voice i saw that he wore the insignia of a roman centurion identify yourself the captain cleared his throat this is the andromeda an athenian ship with a greek crew and you cretheus owner and captain why did you flee when we approached what fool wouldnt have done the same the centurion laughed at least he was in good humor where do you sail from ostia the port city of rome destination alexandria wed be there now if not for just answer the questions cargo olive oil and wine in alexandria well be picking up raw linen and passengers only one party a fellow and his wife is that him beside you i spoke up my name is gordianus im a roman citizen are you now the centurion peered at me how many in your party my wife a bodyguard two slave boys are we free to sail on said the captain not yet all ships without exception are to be boarded and searched and the names of all passengers passed on to the great one himself nothing for you to be alarmed about standard procedure now turn about and well escort you to the fleet i cast a wistful glance at the bleak receding shore we had not fallen into the clutches of caesar or pirates or renegade soldiers it was much worse than that only one man in the whole world presumed to call himself magnus great one pompey the fates had delivered me into the hands of a man who had vowed to see me dead chapter ii the fleet as the centurion had called it was a more ragtag assembly than it had appeared to be at a distance there were a few warships to be sure but all seemed to be in varying degrees of disrepair with threadbare sails battered hulls and mismatched oars the other ships were transports the soldiers loaded on their decks had the distracted illdisciplined look of conscripted slaves i had seen enough of those since the outbreak of the war for both sides in desperate bids for advantage had drafted gladiators farmhands and even clerical slaves into their ranks these soldiers with their squints and blank expressions and dented armor were certainly not the crack troops whom pompey had gathered for his campaign in greece those presumably had vanished at pharsalus either slain by caesars legions or else pardoned and absorbed into caesars ranks pompey had escaped from pharsalus with his life but not much else rumor had it that his defeat had caught him completely by surprise the engagement had begun at daybreak as the battle commenced so certain had pompey been of victory that he withdrew to his command pavilion to relax and enjoy a midday repast but caesars forces abruptly overran the opposition and sent them fleeing when they reached pompeys position they stormed the ramparts and went streaming into the camp caesar himself was the first to reach pompeys pavilion when he entered he found sumptuous furnishings strewn with pillows still warm to the touch a banquet table set with silver plates piled high with steaming delicacies and amphorae of fine falernian wine not yet unsealed if pompey had intended a victory banquet the celebration had been premature at the last moment learning that all was lost the great one threw off his scarlet cloak and the other badges of his rank mounted the first horse he could find and rode through the rear gate of the camp barely escaping with his life and now here was pompey with a ragtag fleet of warriors anchored off the coast of egypt and here was i in pompeys power my stomach growled and i realized that i had grown hungry pacing the deck of the little ship and waiting for word from the centurion who had diligently recorded my name before rowing off to his commanders ship for further orders the andromedas captain sat nearby giving me sidelong looks at last he cleared his throat and spoke up look gordianus youre not i mean to say youre not dangerousare you i smiled that depends do you think i could take you in a fair fight cretheus were about the same age the same build thats not what i meant and you know it am i dangerous to know you mean am i dangerous cargo he nodded this is pompey weve run into ive never had dealings with the man myself but everyone knows his reputation hes used to getting what he wants and stopping at nothing to get it i nodded remembering a famous comment from early in the great ones career when he ran roughshod over the sicilians they complained of his illegal tactics in bringing order to their island pompeys response stop quoting laws to us we carry swords pompey had always done whatever was necessary to prevail and throughout his long career he had never tasted defeatuntil now considering what happened at pharsalus i imagine the great one must be in a rather foul mood i said so you do know him gordianus i nodded pompey and i are acquainted and will he be pleased or displeased when that officer tells him youre on my ship i laughed without mirth displeased to learn that im still breathing pleased that he has a chance to do something about that the captain wrinkled his brow he hates you that much yes because youre a partisan of caesar i shook my head i am not and never was in caesars camp despite the fact that my sonmy disowned son i left the sentence unfinished you have a son who fights with caesar theyre closer than that meto sleeps in the same tent eats from the same bowl he helps write the propaganda caesar passes off as memoirs the captain looked at me with fresh eyes whod have thought that such a commonlooking fellow as myself would have such a close connection to the worlds new lord and master something like that what did you do to offend pompey then i leaned against the rail and stared into the water that captain is my own business my business if it means pompey decides to confiscate my ship and throw me overboard to punish me for taking you as a passenger ill ask you again what did you do to offend the great one even as caesar was marching on rome and pompey was scrambling to escape a favorite young cousin of pompeys was murdered just before he left rome pompey charged me with finding the killer and you failed to do so not exactly but the great one was not pleased with the outcome i thought of pompey as i had last seen himhis hands around my throat his eyes bulging determined to see me dead he had been in the process of fleeing italy by ship disembarking from the port of brundisium even as caesar stormed the city id barely managed to escape wrenching free from pompeys grip diving into deep water surfacing amid flaming flotsam dragging myself to the shore while pompey sailed off to fight another day i shook my head to clear it youve done nothing to insult the great ones dignity captain he has no reason to punish you if pompey confiscates your ship itll be because he needs more room for that sadlooking bunch of soldiers crowded on these transports but hell need someone to sail this ship so why throw you overboard ah but perhaps well know the great ones intentions soon enough i see a skiff approaching and i believe its carrying our friend that centurion who detained us the skiff pulled alongside the centurion called up to us ahoy captain ahoy yourself your men finished searching my cargo an hour ago what now am i free to go not yet that passenger youre carrying i leaned over the rail to show my face are you referring to me centurion i am are you the same gordianus whos called the finder who lives in rome i suppose theres no point in denying it you must be a rather important fellow then the great one himself would like a word with you if youll join us here in the skiff well escort you to his galley bethesda who had been standing to one side with rupa and the boys drew near and gripped my hand husband ill be alright im sure i said she squeezed my fingers and averted her eyes weve come so far husband all the way back to where we first began you and i well almost all the way we didnt quite make it to alexandria but we did see the lighthouse didnt we she shook her head i should never have insisted on this journey nonsense these days no place is safer than any other we came to egypt so that you could bathe in the nile and cleanse yourself of the malady that plagues you and so you must promise me you will no matter whether im there to see it or dont say such a thing she whispered i took both her hands but only for a moment the great one doesnt like to be kept waiting i said reluctantly letting her fingertips slip from mine look after her while im gone rupa and you boys behave yourselves androcles and mopsus both looked at me uncertainly sensing trouble a man of my years should never be obliged to climb down a rope ladder into a skiff but i managed the difficult descent with more grace than i thought possible perhaps the gods were watching after all and thought it fitting to allow an old roman to retain a shred of dignity on the way to meet his destiny a beautiful day i said to the centurion not a sign of that storm that blew us here youd never know it happened nothing but blue skies the centurion nodded but did not speak his reserves of bonhomie were apparently spent his face was grim not a very cheerful group i said looking at the rowers they kept their eyes straight ahead and made no response we rowed past warships and transports to the center of the little fleet pompeys galley stood out from the rest its sail was trimmed with crimson its armored hull gleamed in the sunlight and the soldiers on the deck were by far the best outfitted of any in sight it was clearly the handsomest ship in the fleet and yet in some intangible way the gloomiest was i only imagining the air of dread that seemed to thicken around us as each stroke of the oars brought us closer i was spared the challenge of attempting an ascent by ladder for the galley was equipped with a ramp that unfolded from the deck i stepped onto it swaying a bit when the centurion gripped my elbow to steady me i turned to thank him but the way he averted his eyes as if the very sight of me might contaminate him unnerved me mustering my courage i turned and ascended the ramp the moment i stepped onto the deck i was searched my dagger was discovered and taken from me i was told to remove my shoes and those were taken as well i suppose an enterprising assassin might find some way to conceal a deadly weapon in his shoe even the cord i used to belt my tunic was taken armed guards escorted me to the cabin at the stern of the galley its door stood open and well before we reached it i heard pompeys raised voice from within tell the brat and his pet eunuch that ill expect to meet them ashore tomorrow at noonnot an hour earlier and not an hour later ill be able to judge how subservient these egyptians intend to be by what they feed me for lunch if they spring for crocodile steak and swallows tongues with a decent italian wine ill tell the boyking to wipe my bottom for me as well if they think they can get away with serving nile mullets and egyptian beer ill know i have my work cut out for me this was followed by a harsh laugh that made my blood run cold another voice replied in lower tones as you command great one and a moment later an officer emerged from the cabin wearing full regalia and carrying a plumed helmet under his arm he spied me and raised an eyebrow is this the one called gordianus centurion macro it is commander well citizen gordianus i dont envy you but then you probably dont envy me either im off to the mainland to parlay with that haughty boyking and his insufferable advisers the great one expects to receive a fitting welcome when he goes ashore tomorrow but one gets the distinct impression that the boyking had rather be staging another battle against his sister and her rebels in the desert the officer shook his head this sort of thing was so much easier before pharsalus i had merely to snap my fingers and the locals cringed now they look at me as if he seemed to realize he had said too much and scowled ah well perhaps ill see you again when i get back or perhaps not he gave me a nudge in the ribs that was much too hard to be friendly and then he pushed past me i watched the officer descend the ramp and disappear from sight while i was distracted one of the guards had apparently announced my arrival for without further preamble centurion macro pushed me toward the cabin i stepped inside and he shut the door behind me the little room seemed dark after the bright sunshine as my eyes adjusted the first face i saw was that of a young woman a strikingly beautiful roman matron who sat in one corner with her hands folded on her lap fixing me with a condescending stare even at sea she had managed to take considerable pains with her appearance her hair was tinted with henna and piled atop her head in a complicated coif her winedark stola was belted about her shapely torso with chains of gold and more gold shimmered amid the jewelencrusted pectoral that adorned her throat and the lapis baubles that dangled from her earlobes pompeys young wife had no doubt taken a great deal of jewelry with her when she fled from rome with her husband she must have lugged that jewelry from camp to camp as the arena of battle moved if any woman had learned to look her best while on the move and if any woman felt she had earned the right to wear her best jewels for any occasion it was the longsuffering cornelia pompey was not her first husband her previous marriage had been to publius crassus the son of marcus crassus the lifelong rival of caesar and pompey when the elder crassus set out to conquer parthia some five years ago he took his son with him both perished when the parthians massacred the invading romans still young and beautiful and famously well versed in literature music geometry and philosophy cornelia had not remained a widow long some said her marriage to pompey was a political union others said it was a lovematch whatever the nature of their relationship through good times and bad she had remained steadfastly at his side so it is you finder the voice so harsh it gave me a start came from another corner pompey stepped forward emerging from the deepest shadows in the room on the last occasion i saw him he had been possessed by an almost supernatural fury there was a glint of that same fury even now in his eyes he was dressed as if for battle in gleaming armor and carried himself stiffly his chin high his shoulders erecta model of roman dignity and selfcontrol but along with the glint of fury in his eyes there was a glimmer of something elsefear uncertainty defeat those emotions held carefully in check nevertheless undermined the stiffly formal facade he presented and it seemed to me that behind his gleaming armor and scowling countenance pompey the great was a hollow man hollow i thoughtbut hardly harmless he fixed me with a gaze so intense that i had to struggle not to lower my eyes when he saw that i refused to quail he barked out a laugh gordianus as defiant as everor merely stupid no not stupid that cant be since everyone credits you with being so very very clever but cleverness counts for nothing without the favor of the gods and i think the gods must have deserted you eh for here you are delivered into my handsthe last person on earth i should have thought to see today and i must be the last person you expected to encounter weve followed different paths to the same place great one perhaps its because the gods have withdrawn their favor from both of us he blanched you are a fool and i shall see that you end like a fool id thought you dead already when i left brundisium drowned like a rat after you jumped from my ship then domitius ahenobarbus joined me in greece and told me hed seen you alive in massilia impossible i told him you saw the finders lemur no the man himself he assured me and now you stand before me in the flesh and its domitius whos become a lemur marc antony chased him to ground like a fox at pharsalus damn antony damn caesar but who knows mark my words caesar will yet get his just deserts and when he least expects it the gods will abandon caesarlike that he snapped his fingers one moment hell be alive plotting his next triumph and the next momentdead as king numa i see you scoff finder but believe me caesar will yet receive his due what was he talking about did he have spies and assassins close to caesar plotting to do away with him i stared back at pompey and said nothing lower your eyes damn you a man in your positionthink of those traveling with you if not of yourself youre all at my mercy would he really harm bethesda to take vengeance on me i tried to steady the quaver in my voice im traveling with a young mute of simple intelligence two slave boys and my wife who is not well i find it hard to believe that the great one would stoop to exact vengeance on such oh shut up pompey made a noise of disgust and looked sidelong at his wife some unspoken communication passed between them and the exchange seemed to calm him i sensed that cornelia was his anchor the one thing he could count on now that everything else including his own judgment had failed him so miserably pompey now refused to look at me go on get out he said between clenched teeth i blinked not ready to believe that he was dismissing me with my head still on my shoulders well what are you waiting for i turned to leave but dont think im done with you finder pompey snapped at present i have too much on my mind to fully enjoy seeing the life torn out of you after ive met with young king ptolemy and my fortunes have returned to a firmer footingthen ill summon you again when i can deal with you at my leisure centurion macro accompanied me back to the skiff you look as pale as a fish belly he said do i mind your step getting into the boat ive been given orders that nothing untoward must happen to you the dagger that was taken from me he laughed you wont be seeing that again pompey says you mustnt hurt yourself chapter iii night fell the sea was calm the sky clear far away to the west beyond the low marshland of the nile delta i imagined i could descry the pharos a pinpoint of light upon an uncertain horizon there i said to bethesda who stood beside me at the ships rail do you see it the pharos she squinted and frowned no are you sure my vision is dim tonight i held her close do you feel unwell she grimaced it seems such a small thing now to have come so far for such a petty purpose not petty wife you must be well again toward what end our children are all grown eco and diana both have given us grandchildren and now diana is expecting another and no doubt theyll do a splendid job of raising them with or without their grandmother my time on this earth has been good master master what was she thinking to call me that many years had passed since i made her free and married her from that day forward she had called me husband and not once had i known her to slip and address me as her master it was the return to egypt i told myself calling her back to her past confusing her about the present your time on this earth is far from over wife and your time husband she gave no sign of noticing her earlier error when you came back today i gave thanks to isis for it seemed a miracle but the centurion forbade the captain to sail on that means the great one isnt done with you the great one has far greater concerns than me hes come to seek king ptolemys assistance all pompeys other alliesthe eastern potentates and moneylenders and mercenaries who gave him their allegiance before pharsalushave deserted him but his ties to egypt are strong if he can persuade king ptolemy to take his side then he yet has a hope to defeat caesar egypt has grain and gold egypt even has a roman army garrisoned here for the last seven years to keep the peace something theyve singularly failed to do if ptolemy is engaged in a civil war with his sister cleopatra said bethesda so its ever been in egypt at least in our lifetimes to gain power the ptolemaic siblings intermarry conspire among themselves even murder one another sister marrying brother brother murdering sisterwhat a family as savage and peculiar as those animalheaded gods the locals worship dont scoff youre in the realm of those gods now master she had done it again i made no remark but sighed and held her closer so you see pompey has far too much to think about to be bothered with me i said the words with all the conviction i could muster when sleep is distant the night is long bethesda and i lay together on our little cot in the cramped passenger cabin separated from rupa and the boys by a flimsy screen woven from rushes rupa snored softly the boys breathed steadily submerged in the deep sleep of children the ship rocked very slightly on the calm sea i was weary my mind numb but sleep would not come had it not been for the storm we would have been in alexandria that night safe and snug in some inn in the rhakotis district with a steady floor beneath our feet and a proper roof above our heads our bellies full of delicacies from the market our heads awhirl with the sights and sounds of a teeming city i had not seen since i was young come the dawn i would have hired a boat to take us up the long canal to the banks of the nile bethesda would do what she had come to do and i would do what i had come to dofor i too had a reason for visiting the nile a purpose about which bethesda knew nothing at the foot of our sleeping cot where it served each morning as a dressing table for bethesda and each evening as a dining table for all five of us was a traveling trunk inside the trunk nestled amid clothing shoes coins and cosmetics was a sealed bronze urn its contents were the ashes of a woman called cassandra she had been rupas sister and more than that his protector for rupa was simple as well as mute and could not make his own way in the world cassandra had been very special to me as well though our relationship had very nearly proven fatal to us both i had managed to keep the affair secret from bethesda only because of her illness which had dulled her intuition along with her other senses cassandra and rupa had come to rome from alexandria rupa wanted to return his sister to the land of their youth and to scatter her ashes in the nile restoring her remains to the great cycle of earth air fire and water the urn that contained her ashes loomed in my mind like a fifth passenger among us unseen and unheard but often in my thoughts if all had gone well tomorrow bethesda would have bathed in the nile and cassandras ashes would have been mingled with the rivers sacred waters duties discharged health restored the closing of a dark chapter and i had hoped the opening of a brighter one but that was not how things had turned out was i to blame for my own fate i had killed a man disowned my beloved meto fallen in love with cassandra whose ashes were only a few feet away was it any wonder the gods had abandoned me for sixtytwo years they had watched over me and rescued me from one scrape after another either because they were fond of me or merely because they were amused by the peculiar twists and turns of my lifes story had they now grown disinterested distracted by the grander drama of the war that had swept over the world or had they watched my actions judged me harshly and found me no longer worthy of life surely some god somewhere had been laughing that afternoon when pompey and i met two broken men brought to the edge of ruin thus ran my thoughts that night and they kept sleep far away bethesda slept and must have dreamed to judge by her low murmurs and the occasional twitching of her fingers her dreams appeared to be uneasy but i did not rouse her wake a sleeper in middream and the dark phantoms linger but let a dream run its course and the sleeper wakes with no memory of it soon enough bethesda might have to face a nightmare from which there would be no waking how would i die would bethesda be forced to witness the act afterwards how would she remember me above all else a roman must strive to face his end with dignity i would have to remember that and think of bethesda and the last memory of me she would carry the next time the great one summoned me at some point in the middle of that very long very dark night bethesda stirred and sought my hand with hers she twined her fingers with mine and squeezed them so tightly that i feared she must be in pain whats wrong i whispered she rolled toward me and pressed a finger to my lips to silence me in the darkness i could see the glimmer of her eyes but i could not make out her expression i murmured against the finger pressed to my lips bethesda beloved hush she whispered but she removed her finger and replaced it with her lips pressing her mouth to mine in a deep breathless kiss we had not kissed that way in a very long time not since the onset of her illness her kiss reminded me of cassandra and for a brief moment i experienced the illusion that it was cassandra beside me in the bed her ashes made flesh again but as the kiss continued my memory of cassandra faded and i was reminded of bethesda herself when she and i both had been very young and our passion was so fresh it seemed that such a thing had never before been known in the worlda portal to an undiscovered country she pressed herself against me and slid her arms around me the smell of her hair was intoxicating neither illness nor travel had stopped her from the ritual of washing combing and scenting the great mane of black shot with silver that cascaded almost to her waist she rolled atop me and her tresses enclosed me sweeping across my bare shoulders and over my cheeks mingling with the tears that abruptly flowed from my eyes as the boat swayed gently on the waves with rupa and the boys and the urn that contained cassandra very close we made love quietly slowly with a depth of feeling we had not shared in a very long time i feared at first that she might be expending herself beyond her limits but it was she who set the pace bringing me quickly to the point of ecstasy and then holding me there at her leisure stretching each moment to exquisite infinity the paroxysm wracked her body and then again and on the third occasion i joined her peaking and melting into oblivion we separated but remained side by side breathing as one and i sensed that her body had relaxed completelyso completely that i gripped her hand fearing there might be no response but she squeezed my fingers in return even as the rest of her remained utterly limp as if her joints had loosened and her limbs turned as soft as wax it was only in that moment that i realized just how stiffly for month after month she had been holding her body even when she slept she released a long sigh of contentment bethesda i said quietly sleep she whispered the word seemed to act as a magical spell almost at once i felt consciousness desert me as i sank into the warm boundless ocean of somnus the last things i heard were a highpitched whisper followed by a stifled giggle at some point androcles and mopsus must have awakened and been richly amused by the noises in the room in other circumstances i might have been angry but i must have fallen asleep with a smile on my face for that was how i awoke the smile faded quickly as i remembered exactly where i was i blinked my eyes at the dim light that leaked around the cabin door i sensed movement from outside the cabin i heard the sailors calling to one another the sail snapped the oars creaked the captain had set sailbut to where i felt a thrill of hope had we somehow under cover of darkness escaped from pompeys fleet was alexandria in sight i scrambled from the cot slipping into my tunic as i opened the door and stepped out my hopes evaporated in an instant we were in the midst of pompeys fleet surrounded by ships on all sides they were all in motion taking advantage of an onshore breeze to draw closer to the coast the captain saw me and approached get a good nights sleep he asked i figured you needed it didnt have the heart to wake you whats happening im not entirely sure but i suspect it has something to do with them he pointed toward the shore where on the previous day the beach had been a featureless smear of brown lacking any sign of life this morning it was thronged with a great multitude of soldiers arrayed in formal ranks their spears casting long shadows and their armor gleaming in the slanting earlymorning sunlight the plumes atop their helmets appearing to shiver as the leaves of certain trees shiver in the slightest wind brightly colored pavilions with streaming pennants had been erected atop the low hills the largest and most impressive of these pavilions was at the center of the host atop the highest of the hills beneath its canopy a throne sat atop a daisa shimmering chair made of gold ornamented with jewels and worthy to seat a king at the moment the throne was vacant and though i squinted i could not see beyond it into the royal tent king ptolemys army said the captain and the boyking himself if that throne is any indication hes come to parlay with pompey some of those soldiers are outfitted like romans so they are i said a roman legion was garrisoned here seven years ago to help the late king ptolemy hold his throne and keep the peace some of those soldiers once served under pompey as i recall they say the romans stationed here have gone native taking egyptian wives and forgetting roman ways but they wont have forgotten pompey hes counting on them to rally to his side the captain receiving a signal from a nearby ship called to his men to raise their oars the fleet had drawn as close to the shore as the shallow water would permit i turned my eyes toward pompeys galley and felt my heart sink the small skiff that had transported me the previous day was headed toward us the skiff drew alongside centurion macro did not speak but merely cocked his head and motioned for me to board the captain spoke in my ear i hear the others stirring he said shall i wake them i looked at the cabin door no i said my farewells yesterday and last night i descended the rope ladder spots swam before my eyes and my heart began to race i tried to remember that a romans dignity never matters so much as in the moment of his death and that the substance of a mans life is summed up in the manner in which he faces his end stepping into the skiff i stumbled and caused the boat to rock centurion macro gripped my arm to steady me none of the rowers smiled or sniggered instead they averted their eyes and mumbled prayers to ward off the misfortune portended by such a bad omen as we rowed toward pompeys galley i was determined to not look back with that uncanny acumen a man gains over the years i felt eyes on my back yet still i kept my gaze straight ahead but as we pulled alongside the galley i could not resist a final glance over my shoulder quite tiny in the distance i saw them all standing along the railnot only the captain and all his sailors but rupa rubbing the sleep from his eyes and the boys wearing only the loincloths they slept in and bethesda in her sleeping gown at the sight of me looking back she raised her hands and covered her face centurion macro escorted me aboard a crowd of officers had gathered at the prow of the galley clustered around pompey himself to judge from the magnificent purple plume that bristled atop the helmet of the man at the middle of the group who was hidden by the surrounding throng i swallowed hard and braced myself to face pompey but the centurion gripped my elbow and steered me in the opposite direction toward the cabin where i had been received the previous day he rapped on the cabin door cornelia herself opened it come inside finder she said keeping her voice low she closed the door behind me the room was stuffy from the smoke of burning lamp oil against one wall the coverlet on the bed that pompey and his wife presumably shared was pulled down and rumpled on one side but untouched on the other you slept well last night i said she raised an eyebrow well enough considering but the great one never went to bed at all she followed my gaze to the halfmade bed my husband told me youre good at noticing such details a bad habit i cant seem to break i used to make my living by it these days it only seems to get me into trouble all virtues turn at last to vices if one lives long enough my husband is a prime example of that is he when i first married him he was no longer young but he was nonetheless still brash fearless supremely confident that the gods were on his side those virtues had earned him a lifetime of victories and his victories earned him the right to call himself great and to demand that others address him thusly but brashness can turn to arrogance fearlessness to foolhardiness and confidence can become that vice the greeks call hubrisan overweening pride that tempts the gods to strike a man down all this is by way of explaining what happened at pharsalus i presume she blanched as pompey had done the previous day when i said too much youre quite capable of hubris yourself finder is it hubris to speak the truth to a fellow mortal pompeys not a god neither are you to stand up to either of you gives no insult to heaven she breathed in through dilated nostrils fixing me with a catlike stare at last she blinked and lowered her eyes do you know what day this is the date three days before the kalends of october unless ive lost track its my husbands birthdayand the anniversary of his great triumphal parade in rome thirteen years ago he had destroyed the pirates who infested the seas he had crushed sertorius in spain and the marian rebels in africa he had subjugated king mithridates and a host of lesser potentates in asia with all those victories behind him he returned to rome as pompey the great invincible on land and sea he rode through the city in a gemencrusted chariot followed by an entourage of asian princes and princesses and a gigantic portrait of himself made entirely of pearls caesar was nothing in those days pompey had no rivals he might have made himself king of rome he chose instead to respect the institutions of his ancestors it was the greatest day of his life we always celebrate with a special dinner on this date to commemorate the anniversary of that triumph perhaps tonight if all goes well she shook her head somehow we strayed from your original observation that my husband passed yet another night without sleep hes hardly slept at all since pharsalus he sits there at his worktable yelling for slaves to come refill the oil in the lamp poring over that stack of documents sorting bits of parchment scratching out names scribbling notesand all for nothing do you know whats in that pile provision lists for troops that no longer exist advancement recommendations for officers who were left to rot in the greek sun logistical notes for battles that will never be fought to go without sleep unhinges a man it throws the four humors inside him out of balance earth air fire and water i said cornelia shook her head theres nothing but fire inside him now he scorches everyone he touches he shall burn himself out therell be no more pompey the great only a charred husk of flesh that was once a man but he lives in hope this meeting with king ptolemy as if egypt could save us could it not all the wealth of the nile the armed might of the egyptian army along with the old roman garrison thats posted here a safe haven for the forces scattered at pharsalus to regroup along with pompeys remaining allies in africa yes perhaps perhaps the situation is not entirely hopelessprovided that king ptolemy takes our side why should he not she shrugged the king is hardly more than a boy hes only fifteen who knows what those halfegyptian halfgreek eunuchs who advise him are thinking egypt has managed to maintain its independence this long only by playing roman against roman take sides with pompey now and the die is cast once the fighting is over egypt will belong to pompey or else to pompeys rival and egypt will no longer be egypt but just another roman provinceso their thinking must go but have they any choice its either pompey now or else since she had not uttered the name caesar i did not either surely its a good sign that the king has arrived in all his splendor to greet the great one cornelia sighed i suppose but i never imagined it would be like thishere in the middle of nowhere attended by a fleet of leaky buckets arriving with our heads bowed like beggars after a storm and gnaeus dropping all formality she spoke of her husband by his first name gnaeus is in such a strait you should have seen him yesterday after you left he ranted for an hour going on and on about the tortures he intends to inflict on you hoisting you onto the ropes publicly flaying you commanding the troops on the other ships to stand at attention and watch hes lost all sense of proportion theres a kind of madness in him i grew lightheaded and strove not to lose my balance why in hades are you telling me all this what do want from me cornelia she took something from a cabinet and pressed it into my hand it was a small vial made of carved alabaster with a cork stopper the sort of vessel that might ordinarily contain a scented oil whats this i said something ive been saving for myself should the occasion arise one never knows when a quick graceful exit might be required i held the vial to the light and saw that it contained a pale liquid this is your personal trapdoor to oblivion yes but i give it to you finder the man from whom i acquired it calls it nemesisinabottle it acts very quickly with a minimum of pain how do you know that because i tried a sample of the stuff on a slave of course she expired with hardly a whimper and now you think i think that you will be able to maintain your dignity as a roman much more easily this way rather than my husbands way men think their wills are strong that they wont cry out or weep but they forget how weak their bodies are and how very long those frail bodies can be made to suffer before they give up the lemur believe me finder this way will be much better for all concerned including pompey her face hardened i dont want to see him make a spectacle of your death especially not with king ptolemy watching hell take out all his rage against caesar on you can you imagine how pathetic that will look he should know better but hes lost all judgment i stared at the vial in my hand hell be furious if hes deprived of the chance to punish me himself not if the gods decide to take you first thats what it will look like youll swallow the contentseven the taste is not unpleasant or so im toldand afterwards ill throw the vial overboard youll die suddenly and quietly youre not a young man finder no one will be surprised that your heart gave out theyll assume that you were frightened to death by the prospect of facing pompeys wrath my husband will be disappointed but hell get over itespecially if we do somehow manage to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat then there will be countless multitudes upon whom he can vent his rage you intend for me to swallow this now no wait pompeys about to board a small boat that will take him ashore to parlay with king ptolemy swallow it after hes gone so that ill be cold by the time he returns she nodded and if i refuse ill make you a promise finder accept this gift from me and ill see that no harm befalls your family i swear by the shades of my ancestors i pulled out the cork stopper and stared at the colorless liquid inside nemesisinabottle i passed the vial beneath my nose and detected only a vaguely sweet not unpleasant odor death by poison was not among the many ways i had imagined dying or had come close to dying over the years was this how i was to exit the world of the livingas a favor to a woman who wished me to spare her husband the embarrassment of killing me a rap at the door gave me a start the vial nearly jumped from my fingers cornelia gripped my hand and pressed my fingers around it be careful she whispered glaring at me put it away i stoppered the vial and slipped it into the pouch sewn inside my tunic it was centurion macro at the door the great one is almost ready to depart if you wish to bid him farewell of course cornelia collected herself took a deep breath and stepped out of the cabin the centurion ushered me out keeping my hand inside my tunic i tightly clutched the alabaster vial chapter iv amidships pompey was descending the ramp toward a royal egyptian skiff that had just arrived despite its small size the craft was ornately decorated images of crocodiles cranes and nile riverhorses were carved around the rim plated with hammered silver and inlaid with pieces of lapis and turquoise for the eyes the prow of the ship was carved in the shape of a standing ibis with wings outstretched besides the rowers three soldiers stood in the boat one of them was clearly an egyptian of very high rank to judge by the gold filigree that decorated his silver breastplate the other two were outfitted not like egyptians but like roman centurions presumably they were officers from the roman force stationed to keep the peace in egypt while the egyptian officer hung back the two romans stepped forward and saluted pompey as he descended the ramp addressing him in unison great one pompey smiled clearly pleased to be properly addressed to one of the men he gave a nod of recognition septimius isnt it the man bowed his head great one im surprised you remember me a good commander never forgets a man who once served under him even though years may pass how goes your service in egypt these are eventful times great one i cant complain of being bored and you centurion whats your name salvius great one the other roman lowered his eyes not meeting pompeys gaze pompey frowned then looked beyond the centurions to the egyptian whom they escorted he was a powerfully built man with broad shoulders and massive limbs he had the blue eyes of a greek and the dark complexion of an egyptian nearby i overheard centurion macro speaking into cornelias ear thats the boykings mongrel mastiff fellows part greek like his master and part native egyptian his name achillas the man said in a booming voice introducing himself to pompey captain of the kings guards i shall have the honor of escorting you into the presence of king ptolemy great one he added his voice falling flat on the final syllables pompey merely nodded then gestured for his party to begin boarding the boat only four men accompanied him macro and another centurion to act as bodyguards a slave with a box of writing materials to act as a scribe and pompeys loyal freedman philip a small wiry fellow with a neatly trimmed beard who was said to attend all important meetings with the great one on account of his faculty for never forgetting a name face or date after the others had boarded pompey assisted by philip stepped into the boat while the others sat pompey remained standing for a moment he turned and scanned the faces of those assembled on the galley to see him off the crowd parted for cornelia who descended the ramp and extended her hand to him their fingers briefly touched then drew apart as the rowers dipped their oars and the skiff set off remember your manners my dear called cornelia her voice trembling he may be only a boy of fifteen but hes still a king pompey smiled and made a theatrical gesture of submission opening his arms wide and making a shallow bow he that once enters a tyrants door becomes a slave though he were free before he quoted a bit of euripides muttered one of the officers beside me sophocles if im not mistaken i said the man glowered at me pompey gave cornelia a final nod of farewell then moved to sit down with philip assisting him looking up abruptly his eyes came to rest on me it was only for an instant for the business of settling himself on the moving boat required his attention but an instant was all that was required for him to convey in quick order recognition mild surprise a flash of utter hatred and an implicit promise that he would deal with me later at his leisure my throat constricted and i squeezed the vial in my pocket i was worth no more than that single glance in the next instant pompey finished settling himself and turned his attention toward the shore and the company that awaited him at the royal pavilion without a word those of us on the galley watched the skiffs progress everyone on all the other ships watched as well as did the ranks of soldiers assembled on the shore the moment became slightly unreal time seemed to stretch the water so close to shore was quite murky discolored by mud from the nearby nile brought down by the rush of the annual floods the sky was without a cloud but uniformly hazy its color pearly gray rather than blue no breeze stirred the atmosphere was sullen and heavy with humidity sounds carried with peculiar clarity i could clearly hear the noise of pompey clearing his throat on the receding boat and the low mutter as he attempted to engage the centurions septimius and servius in conversation they did not answer but only averted their eyes just as the men who had come for me that morning had averted their eyes the barren colorless shore assumed a peculiarly uninviting aspect the throne set before the royal pavilion remained empty king ptolemy still declined to show himself cornelia stepped back from the crowd along the rail and began to pace the deck keeping her eyes on the royal skiff she touched her mouth with an anxious gesture the tension that hung in the air became so oppressive that i began to think it emanated from me alone perhaps the sky seen though other eyes was a normal blue and the moment no stranger than any otherexcept to me facing my death quickest done is best done the etruscan proverb says i fingered the vial inside my tunic a notunpleasant taste a little discomfort and then oblivion the royal skiff reached the shore where an honor guard awaited the oarsmen jumped out and dragged the boat forward until the hull grounded in the sandy surf salvius and achillas stepped out of the boat followed by philip who turned about and offered his hand to pompey cornelia screamed perhaps she had an instant of precognition perhaps she was simply watching more closely than the rest of us i stared at the boat and at first saw only a confusion of sudden movements only afterwards reviewing those fleeting images in memory would it become clear to me exactly what happened the oarsmen in the surf joined by soldiers awaiting them on shore reached for centurion macro and pompeys other bodyguard and pulled them out of the boat septimius standing in the boat behind pompey drew his sword from its scabbard as he raised it to strike the delayed sound of macros cry reached us in the galley followed in a weird moment of disconnection by the scraping noise of septimius drawing his sword the blade descended at a sharp angle plunging between pompeys shoulder blades pompey stiffened and convulsed in what seemed a bizarre mimicry of his parting gesture to cornelia he flung his arms wide philip was seized by soldiers on the beach and pulled back his mouth open in a cry of anguish salvius and achillas drew swords and clambered back into the boat on either side pompeys two bodyguards were held under the water until their flailing subsided inside the boat while pompeys scribe cowered and ducked the great one collapsed as achillas salvius and septimius swarmed over him their swords flashing in the sun abruptly the stabbing stopped while the other two pulled back their chests heaving and their breastplates spattered with blood achillas squatted down in the boat and performed some operation a few moments later he stood upright his bloody sword in one hand and the severed head of pompey held aloft in the other those of us on the deck of pompeys galley stood frozen and speechless from the various ships around us scattered shrieks and cries echoed across the still water punctuating the unnatural silence achillas deliberately made a point of displaying the head of pompey to the fleet offshore the great ones eyes were wide open his mouth gaped gore dripped from his severed neck then achillas turned about to show the head to the troops on shore in their midst in front of the royal pavilion king ptolemy had at last appeared at some point during the attack he had taken his place upon the throne surrounded by a coterie of attendants he was small in the distance his features hard to make out but he was instantly recognizable by the glittering uraeus crown of the egyptian pharaohs upon his head a jewelencrusted band of gold with a rearing cobra at the center in his crossed arms the king clutched a flail and a staff with a crook at the end both made of bands of gold interspersed with bands of lapis lazuli an adviser spoke in his ear and the king responded by raising his staff in a salute to achillas the assembled egyptian troops broke into a stunning cheer that swept across the water like a thunderclap i turned and looked up at cornelia she was as white as ivory her face contorted like a tragedy mask the galleys captain ran to her whispered in her ear and pointed toward the west looking dazed she turned her head from the direction of the nile a fleet of ships had appeared on the horizon egyptian warships i heard the captain say raising his voice and gripping cornelias arm to rouse her from her trance she stared at the ships then at the shore then again at the approaching fleet the muscles of her face twitched as if she was trying to speak but could not she shivered blinked and finally cried out weigh anchor set sail set sail her cry broke the spell that held us frozen the deck erupted in frenzied movement soldiers and sailors rushed this way and that i was shoved and spun about and almost knocked down amid the chaos i climbed to a higher spot and scanned the nearby ships all the boats were weighing anchor at once with oarsmen struggling to turn them about and sailors frantically setting sail finally i spotted the andromeda bethesda stood at the rail staring toward pompeys galley but clearly not seeing me amid the confusion on the deck she was standing on tiptoes and waving her hands even as i watched rupa grabbed her from behind and pulled her away from the rail and back toward the cabin trying to get her out of the way of the sailors running back and forth i waved my arm and shouted her name but to no effect in the next instant she disappeared into the cabin with rupa and the slave boys i jumped onto the deck and ran to the ramp from which pompey had departed sailors were heaving on ropes to raise the ramp clear of the water i ran to its edge and dove into the waves salt stung my nostrils my heart pounded in my chest i broke the surface and drew a desperate breath all the ships were in motion confusing me and making me lose my sense of direction it seemed that every captain was acting on his own with no coordination among them hardly more than a stones throw from pompeys galley two smaller boats collided knocking some of the sailors overboard i treaded water turning around and trying to orient myself searching for the andromeda i thought i knew the direction where i had last seen her but my view was blocked by a passing ship nonetheless i set off swimming in that direction away from the shore the motion of so many oars from so many ships created waves that rippled and merged and smacked against one another water surged into my nostrils i swallowed air and breathed in water swimming became impossible just to keep my head above water was a struggle from nowhere a galley appeared and went racing by me the long bank of oars one after another crashing into the water beside my head setting up a turbulence that tossed me this way and that and dragged me under spinning me upsidedown beneath the waves by the time i recovered i was more disoriented than ever not even sure in which direction the shore lay it took all my energy just to stay afloat at some point i thought i caught a glimpse of the andromeda and tried desperately to swim after it expending the last measure of my strength to call out bethesdas name but it might very well have been some other boat and in any case my pursuit was hopeless the ship quickly receded and with it my hopes of ever seeing bethesda again at last i gave up or more precisely gave in neptune had his own plans for me and i relinquished all control to the god my limbs turned to lead and i thought that i must surely sink but the gods hand kept me afloat and upright with the hot sun on my face the oarchurned sea grew calmer the multitude of sails receded into the distance from somewhere i heard a great commotion of movement as of an army decamping but even that noise gradually faded until i heard only the shallow sound of my own breath and the gentle lapping of waves upon a shore a sandy bank materialized beneath my back the waves no longer carried me aloft but merely nudged me this way and that the shallow surf sighed and whispered around me i let out a groan and closed my eyes i may have slept but probably not for long above the sighing of the surf i heard another sound the buzzing of flies a great many of them somewhere nearby i opened my eyes and saw a bearded face above me his eyes were wet with tears his lips trembled help me he said for the love of jupiter please help me i recognized him philip the trusted freedman who had accompanied pompey ashore please he said i cant do it myself hes too heavy im too weary i saw you on the galley before we left you were standing with cornelia did you know him well did you fight beside him i thought i knew all his friends but i tried to rise but my limbs were still made of lead philip helped me roll to my side onto all fours i rose to my knees feeling them sink into the wet sand philips hand on my shoulder steadied me the beach was deserted the pavilions were gone the soldiers had all vanished the quietness of the place was eerie i heard only the gentle murmur of waves and the low droning of flies i turned my head and gazed at the sea the same thin haze that blanched the sky obscured the distant horizon in that uncertain expanse of flat water there was not a sail to be seen earth and sea were both empty but not so the sky i looked up and saw carrion birds circling philip slipped his hands under my armpits and lifted eager to bring me to my feet he was a small fellow but obviously quite strong certainly stronger than i was he claimed to need my help but from the look in his eyes i knew it was my company he wanted the presence of another living mortal in that place of desolation philip didnt want to be alone and when he led me down the beach to the place where the royal skiff had landed i saw why the skiff was gone where i began to say they loaded it onto a wagon can you believe it they brought it here just to bring pompey ashore and when it was over they cleaned out the blood with buckets of seawater then turned the boat upsidedown and loaded it onto a wagon and carried it off over those low hills the whole army did an aboutface and vanished in a matter of minutes it was uncanny as if they were phantoms youd almost think theyd never even been here but the army of king ptolemy had indeed been here and the proof lay at our feet surrounded by a swarm of buzzing flies someonephilip i presumedhad dragged the corpses of macro and his fellow centurion onto the beach and laid them on their backs side by side next to them was the slave who had accompanied the party to act as scribe he lay beside his box of writing materials his tunic stained with blood from several wounds he must have gotten in the way when achillas and salvius clambered back aboard the boat with their swords said philip they had no reason to kill him they didnt kill me the poor scribe simply got in the way i nodded to show that i understood then turned my eyes at last upon the sight i had been avoiding beside the bodyguards and the scribe lay the naked remains of pompey the great a mangled body without a head it was around his corpse and especially around the clotted blood where the neck had been severed that flies swarmed in greatest profusion they took his head said philip his voice breaking they cut it off and carried it away like a trophy and his finger i saw that a finger had been cut from the corpses right hand a smaller swarm of flies buzzed about the bloody stump to take his ring you see they couldnt just remove it they cut off his finger and threw it in the sand or in the surfwho knows where philip sobbed and in a sudden frenzy stripped off his tunic using it as a scourge to snap at the flies they dispersed only to come back in greater numbers philip gave up the effort and spoke through sobs i managed to strip off his clothes i washed his wounds with seawater even so the flies wont go away we must build a funeral pyre there must be enough driftwood scattered up and down the beach ive gathered some but we need more youll help me wont you i gazed at pompeys corpse and nodded as a young man he had been famous for his beauty as well as his bravery his physique had been that of a young hercules his chest and shoulders thick with muscle his waist narrow his limbs beautifully molded like most men he had grown softer and thicker with passing time the sagging lump of flesh at my feet was nothing any sculptor would have seen fit to reproduce in marble looking at what remained of pompey i felt neither pity nor revulsion this thing was not pompey any more than the head with which the egyptians had absconded was pompey pompey had been an essence a force of nature a will that commanded fantastic wealth fleets of warships legions of warriors the thing at my feet was not pompey nonetheless it would have to be disposed of as far as i knew neptune himself had saved me from watery oblivion for the singular purpose of paying homage to pompeys remains he should have died at pharsalus said philip not like this but at a time and in the manner of his own choosing when he knew that all was lost he made up his mind to do so help me philip he said help me keep up my courage ive lost the game and i have no stomach for the aftermath let this place be the end of me let the history books say the great one died at pharsalus but at the last instant he lost his nerve pompey the great quailed and fled with me running after him to keep up only to come to this with his head carried off as a trophy for the king philip dropped to his knees on the sand and wept i turned away and scanned the beach for bits of driftwood the sun reached its zenith and sank toward the west and still we gathered wood venturing farther and farther up and down the beach philip insisted that we build three pyres one for the murdered scribe another for the two centurions and another conspicuously larger than the others for pompey by the time the pyres were built and the bodies laid atop them the sun was sinking into the west and shadows were gathering philip started a fire with kindling and flint and set the pyres alight as darkness fell and the flames leaped up i wondered if cornelia aboard her galley would be able to see her husbands funeral pyre as a speck of light in the far distance i wondered if bethesda wherever she was would be able to see the same flame and if it would remind her of the pharos and make her weep as i wept that night at the twist of fate that had turned a journey of hope into a journey of despair chapter v my body exhausted my mind numb i fell asleep that night with the flames of pompeys funeral pyre dancing on my eyelids and the smell of his charred flesh in my nostrils i slept like a dead man hunger woke me i had eaten nothing the previous day and very little the day before my stomach growled as i stirred from a dream of fish roasting on an open spit i smelled cooked fish the fantasy was so real that it stayed with me even after i opened my eyes i was lying on my back on the sand the sun was high i blinked at the brightness and raised a hand to shade my eyes then the figure of a man blocked the sunlight i saw him only as a looming silhouette but i knew at once that it was not philip for this man was much bigger i gave a start and skittered back on my elbows then gave another start as something sharp was poked toward me my stomach fairly roared with hunger the thing in the mans hand was a sharpened stick on the stick was a roasted fish hot from the flames the man above me made a familiar grunt as he poked the fish toward me again in a gesture of offering rupa i whispered is that you i shaded my eyes and squinted and glimpsed his face clearly for only an instant before tears obscured my vision i blinked them away and reached for the spit the next thing i knew the spit in my hand held only the skeleton of a fish and my stomach had stopped growling above me rupa grinned i wiped my mouth and looked up the beach to the spot where rupa had dug a pit in the sand and filled it with coals from the funeral pyres two pieces of driftwood on either side served to hold the spits upon which more fish were roasting i looked toward the water and saw androcles and mopsus along with philip wading naked in the surf armed with sharpened sticks and their own tunics to serve as nets while i watched androcles deftly speared a fish and held it proudly aloft laughing with delight i scanned the beach and felt a stab of panic but where is here husband i turned my head and saw that bethesda sat on a hillock of sand behind me leaning back against our traveling trunk she gave me a weary smile i drew myself beside her and rested my head on her lap she gently stroked my forehead i sighed and closed my eyes the sun was warm on my face the sound of the gentle surf was like a lullaby gone were the flies of the day before my body was rested my hunger satisfied and bethesda restored to me all in the span of a single minute i blinked and looked up at her i reached up to touch her face to reassure myself that i was not still asleep and dreaming how i said she took a deep breath and leaned back against the trunk settling in to tell the tale after we saw pompey killed and those egyptian warships appeared the captain weighed anchor and fled with all the others but the egyptian ships held back they werent looking for a battle they just wanted to scare pompeys fleet away still we were surrounded on all sides by pompeys ships and the captain was afraid to sail off on his own so he bided his time when darkness fell he saw his chance and cut away from the fleet and headed south no one gave chase as far as i knew you were still on pompeys galley with his widow if indeed he hadnt slain you before he set off to meet king ptolemy i wanted the captain to turn back and rejoin the fleet but he wouldnt then we caught sight of the flames on the shore still very far away was it a signal from you i prayed that it might be and i was heartbroken because i thought the captain intended to take us directly to alexandria and how would we ever manage to find you again but the captain wanted to be rid of us as quickly as possible were lucky he didnt simply throw us all overboard he said we must be cursed by the gods and would bring him nothing but trouble as long as any of us were aboard he sailed straight back to this spot maybe because it was the nearest patch of land maybe because the fire served as a beacon by the time we arrived the fire had died down to embers the sky was starting to grow light when he rowed us ashore then he rowed back to his ship and vanished when i saw you lying here on the beach i thought you must be dead but as i stepped closer you started to snore so loudly that i laughed and wept at the same time i wanted to wake you but pompeys freedman begged me not to he said you were like a dead man when you fell asleep last night that you desperately needed to rest she lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper even though philip was splashing in the surf and could not possibly have overheard he seems to be under the impression that youre some sort of important personage a grizzled old veteran with some special tie to pompey he imagines that you were so griefstricken to see the great one beheaded that you swam ashore on a mad impulse to mourn for him i grunted i tried to swim to you but i very nearly drowned instead i was lucky to make it to shore that greek captains a fool were not cursed by the gods bethesda were blessed by them i took one of her hands and pressed it to my lips she smiled wanly so here i sat and waited all morning listening to you snore while rupa and the boys made a meal for us would you care for more i saw that rupa was approaching with another roasted fish my mouth watered and my stomach growled again why dont you have it i said bethesda shook her head im not hungry i tried to think of the last time i had seen her eat and felt a prickle of anxiety was she not paler than before and looking more frail than i had ever seen her or was she merely worn out by the events of the last few days as any woman would be i sat up and took the fish from rupa i had devoured the first one without thinking but this one i was able to savor bethesda smiled taking pleasure in my appetite i licked my fingers and wiped my hand on my tunic and felt something in the pouch the poison cornelia had given me vile stuff what if i had swallowed it in a moment of weakness and despair was cornelia regretting her gift to me now wishing she had kept it for herself i should pour the contents over pompeys ashes and throw the alabaster vial into the sea i thought but simple laziness prevented me it was far more pleasurable to sit beside bethesda feel the warmth of the sun on my face and watch the boys fish in the glinting surf that afternoon philip and i scouted the vicinity and discovered a small fishing village just around a spit of land to the east occupying a territory disputed between ptolemy and his sister cleopatra the warweary villagers were wary of strangers but they had no aversion to the roman sesterces i was able to offer times were hard in egypt and roman silver went a long way for a very reasonable price i was able to hire a wagon and two mules to pull it my egyptian was very rusty and the villagers spoke nothing else philip fluent in many languages negotiated the deal and conveyed the wagonowners assurance that the coastal road was well maintained all the way to alexandria i asked him how we were to cross the nile and he said that at every fording of the many branches of the delta there would be ferrymen competing to carry us across the man had a cousin in the capital when we arrived i was to leave the wagon and the mules with him philip stayed in the village saying he intended to head east not west and so we parted company i gave him some sesterces to see him on his way he gave me a heartfelt embrace still harboring the mistaken assumption that i was one of pompeys devoted veterans anytime one travels one must be prepared for changes to the itinerary i said to the assembled company on the beach that night over our dinner of warmedover fish supplemented by flatbread purchased from the villagers granted weve taken a bit of a detour but now we shall press on to alexandria just as planned except that bethesda will be able to bathe in the nile sooner rather than later since the river lies between us and the city and rupa will be able to scatter the ashes of his sister i thought and silently gave thanks to cassandra for it was her legacy to me that was paying for this excursionthe journey by ship the mules and the wagon even the morsels of flatbread that androcles and mopsus were stuffing into their mouths the villagers had told me that alexandria lay about miles distanta journey of several days over flat terrain wherever the road crossed a branch of the nile there would be a village or at the very least a tavern or an inn the landscape would consist of flat marshland interspersed with cultivated fields where farmers and slaves would be busy tending to irrigation ditches and waterwheels for the annual inundation of the river upon which the life of the country depended had begun the trip might be monotonous but should not be particularly dangerous and we would be safe sleeping in the wagon alongside the road if we wished banditry the villagers maintained was not a part of the egyptian character while this was surely no more than wishful thinkingbandits exist everywhere as do victims and heroesit was true that we had arrived in a part of the world that was much older and arguably more civilized than italy brutally beheading a potential conqueror before he could set foot in egypt was one thing common banditry was another and about that i was not to worry the next morning very early we set out for alexandria the weather was hot the atmosphere muggy and the sky dotted with puffy clouds with occasional potholes and crumbling edges the stonepaved road was definitely not up to roman standards bethesda was jostled about more than i would have liked but the mules made steady progress we reached the easternmost branch of the nile delta at the bustling fortress town of pelusium the idlers at the shop where we purchased provisions were abuzz with speculation about the war between king ptolemy and his sister cleopatra this i gathered from bethesda who was able to understand the locals far better than i she had grown up in alexandria speaking egyptian and though she claimed that the dialect spoken by the locals in pelusium was rough and uncouth she seemed to have little trouble understanding them once we reached alexandria everyone would speak at least a little greek greek was the language of the ptolemies and the official language of the state bureaucracy and the upper classes spoke nothing else but outside the capital the native egyptians even after two and a half centuries of ptolemaic rule clung stubbornly to their native tongue according to bethesda word of pompeys fatal landing had already reached pelusium but only as a rumor some of the locals believed the story some did not just as we were about to show our purchases to the shopkeeper a selfimportant little woman with her nose in the air cut in front of us to purchase a basket of dates and proceeded to address anyone within earshot whos this hen i whispered to bethesda the wife of a local magistrate i imagine whats she saying bethesda listened for a while then snorted some nonsense about how pompey met his end she claims there was a battle between the romans and egyptians and the boyking himself wrestled pompey to the ground and then chopped off his head silly hen catching bethesdas tone if not understanding her latin the woman turned around and flared her nostrils at us i braced for a scrap but bethesda bit her tongue and lowered her eyes and the woman went on with her story the moment left me feeling uneasy it seemed to me yet another symptom of her malady that bethesda should submit so readily to the babblings of a pompous busybody indeed it seemed to me that bethesda became more subdued with each passing mile so that i regretted putting any extra strain upon her by making her deal with the locals as our journey continued an unnatural stillness settled upon her she stared vacantly at the marshes and the muddy fields i tried to draw her out with reminiscences as i had on the sea journey but she seemed disinterested and distant even about her intentions she had little to say we had reached the nile the object of our journey and i asked her where she intended to bathe and what was needed for the ritual of purification she had in mind not here she told me not yet ill know the place when we come to it osiris will show me where to step into the river the river will show me what to do the farther we traveled the more uneasy i found the villagers word of pompeys death invariably preceded us and formed the chief topic of conversation it seemed that the nile had failed to rise as high as in previous years a year of low inundation meant fewer crops with hunger and hardship to follow to cause such a poor inundation something must have displeased the god for in egypt the nile itself is a god the civil strife between ptolemy and his sister cleopatra had previously been blamed for they too were divine and strife between a god and goddess caused repercussions throughout both the natural and the supernatural worlds but now it was perceived that the nile had been withholding its floods in anticipation of an even more cataclysmic event the murder of the great one the only man to claim such a title since alexander himself the discord of civil war was everywhere upon the earth bringing one disaster after another and the people feared that some even more terrible event was yet to come so we passed from pelusium to tanis and thence to thmuis and thence to busiris at the very center of the delta each day the summer sun grew hotter and the air more stifling and humid the rank smell of the muddy nile seeped into my pores along the way following bethesdas dictates we made numerous excursions upriver and downriver which came to nothing she would arrive at a spot and declare it suitable saying she would bathe there the next day only to change her mind when the next day came beyond busiris we came to the particularly squalid little village of sais saying the sun had grown too bright bethesda remained in our private room at the towns shabby little inn refusing to come out rupa androcles mopsus and i found little to do in sais and i passed several idle days drinking egyptian beer stifled by heat boredom and a growing sense of foreboding at last we pressed on from sais and came to naucratis a village on the westernmost branch of the nile we had traversed the entire delta and still bethesda had found no location suitable for the ritual of purification each day as our journey continued bethesda had given me greater cause for concern she ate almost nothing when i questioned her about this she said that fasting was a part of the purification ritual she sat motionless in the wagon for long hours and when pressed to move did so only very slowly and deliberately she seemed less and less to fully occupy a place in this world and more and more to reside in some other realm invisible to the rest of us there were times when i glanced at her and for a startling instant thought i was looking right through her as if she had become transparent then i would blink and the illusion would pass and i would tell myself it was merely a trick of the heat and the moistureheavy air chapter vi beyond naucratis the road turned north the nile and its delta were to our right the road ran parallel to the river but eventually it would turn to the west and leave the delta behind soon i asked bethesda she stared at the river the gleam on the surface lighting her face her features so impassive that i thought she must not have heard me but eventually she answered soon she said and shut her eyes as if the simple utterance exhausted her at midmorning we came to a stretch of the river where palm trees and date trees grew in great profusion the river narrowed and ran swiftly between its muddy banks their exact demarcations obscured by tall reeds underground springs fed into the river making the vegetation especially luxuriant low trees grew close together strewn with vines in great profusion reeds encircled miniature lagoons where lotuses and lily pads spread like carpets across the water dragonflies flitted and swarms of midges hovered above the water the spot teemed with life it seemed somehow timeless and ancient a place set apart from the rest of the world here said bethesda sounding neither happy nor sad i stopped the mules mopsus and androcles jumped from the wagon eager to stretch their limbs youre the cyclops and im ulysses catch me if you can shouted androcles slapping his brothers forehead and racing off mopsus gave a yelp and raced after him rupa jumped out next circled to the front of the wagon and reached up to offer his hand to bethesda with my assistance from above and his from below she alighted from the wagon from nearby androcles gave a shriek as his brother caught up with him and tackled him on a mosscovered stretch of riverbank i would have shouted at them to behave but my eyes were on bethesda who strode slowly but steadily downriver toward a particularly dense patch of reeds low trees and vines i moved to jump from the wagon and follow her but rupa seized my ankle i tried to shake his grip but he tightened it he pointed at the trunk in the wagon from the plaintive look on his face i knew what he wanted the key hung on a chain around my neck i slipped the chain over my head and moved to unlock the trunk but my fingers slipped i tried to open the lock again but fumbled the key seemed determined to thwart me at last i opened the lock and threw back the lid it took some digging to reach the urn which had worked its way to the very bottom of the trunk the bronze seemed cool to the touch i had not held it since packing it away i had forgotten how heavy it was all that remained of cassandra was inside it the ashes and bits of bone and teeth salvaged from her funeral pyre i gazed at the urn for a long moment distracted by memories then realized rupa had circled the wagon and was standing just under me reaching up with both hands reluctantly i leaned over and handed him the urn then jumped from the wagon this is the place then i asked him he nodded shall i come with you he frowned it was not unreasonable that he should wish to be alone with his sisters remains while he scattered them in the nile from birth they had seldom been parted and they had loved one another above all else in the world however strong my passion for her i had known cassandra for only a few months before she died the actual time i had spent with her however special had amounted to mere hours it was right that rupa not i should send her ashes on their final journey to the sea and if he wished to do so in privacy i had no right to object i put my hand on his shoulder to show him that i understood he held the bronze urn to his chest and bowed his head over it tears in his eyes then turned and began to walk upriver afraid they might run after him and disturb him i called to androcles and mopsus to come join me bethesda meanwhile had reached the overgrown copse of trees downriver and had been searching for a means of entry while i watched she finally located a pathway not bothering to look back she stepped into the foliage and disappeared from sight come along boys i said and followed after her i reached the copse and stood baffled before the spot where i had last seen her was it possible a pathway had opened and then closed up behind her wherever i looked reeds grew out of the muddy ground and a tangle of vines hung down to meet them without any perceptible break i called her name she made no answer i searched the soft ground for her footprints i finally found them taken aback at how light were the tread marks she left compared not merely with my footsteps but also with those of the boys truly in the last few days she had dwindled and faded so that now she walked upon the earth as lightly as a child she must have gone this way said mopsus staring at the ground no this way insisted androcles both of you step back before you confuse the track any further i said and then i followed her steps back and forth retracing her faltering search for a way into the copse i finally found it a tangle of vines hung just so obscuring the entrance completely unless one approached it from the correct angle bethesda i called stepping into the copse the boys followed me and recommenced their bickering i told you it was this way said mopsus no you didnt you said androcles fell silent as the dappled shadows abruptly closed in around us the boys sensed what i sensed that we had entered a place that was not like other places the gurgling of the river could be heard from nearby along with the low buzzing of insects and the cries of birds in the treetops ahead through hanging vines i glimpsed sunlight on stone we came to a glade circled by vegetation but open to the sky the little temple in its midst was lit by a shaft of sunlight the shaft was so clouded with motes of dust that it seemed a solid thing and i should not have been surprised to see dragonflies suspended motionless within its light held fast like insects in amber but the dragonflies hovered and flitted unimpeded making way for bethesda who approached the temple mounted the short flight of steps to the colonnaded porch and disappeared inside the temple was of egyptian design with a flat roof squat columns surmounted by capitals carved like lotus leaves and worn hieroglyphs in riotous profusion on every surface it betrayed no hint of greek influence and so almost certainly predated the conquest of alexander and the reign of the ptolemies it was hundreds possibly thousands of years old older than alexandria older than rome perhaps as old as the pyramids beside it from a jumble of ferncovered stones a spring trickled forth forming a tiny pool the spring was life itself the spring accounted for this lush oasis beside the variable banks of the nile and for the sacred spell exerted by the place and for the temple erected beside it i gazed at the hieroglyphs on the temple i listened to the faint gurgle of the spring i felt warm sunlight on my shoulders but i shivered for the place seemed uncannily familiar i raised a finger to my lips instructing the boys to maintain their silence and walked across the clearing to the steps of the temple i smelled the perfume of burning myrrh from within i heard the murmur of two voices one of them belonged to bethesda the other voice might have been male or female i could not tell i mounted the steps to the porch inclined my head toward the opening and squinted at the gloom within in brief uncertain flashes a flickering lamp illuminated brightly painted walls covered with strange images and glyphs the grandest of these images was that of the god osiris the figure of a tall man swathed in white mummy wrapping holding a flail and crook in his crossed arms and wearing on his head the atef crown a tall white cone adorned with ostrich feathers on each side and with a small golden disk at the bulbous top i heard the voices from within more clearly but the language they spoke was strange to menot any version of egyptian of which i had any knowledge to hear bethesdas voice uttering such alien sounds sent a shiver up my spine it was as if some other being had claimed her voice some creature foreign to me i made no move to enter the temple but stayed where i was on the threshold from inside the priestess of the placefor little by little i had decided the voice must be that of a womantook up a chant the chant grew louder until i knew the boys must be able to hear it as well i looked behind me and saw them at the edge of the glade rooted to the spot their eyes trained on the opening of the temple their mouths shut how long the chanting lasted i had no way of knowing for it cast a spell on all of us time stopped even the motes of dust in the air ceased their slow swirling dance and the dragonflies afraid of its magic dispersed i closed my eyes and tried to discern whether the chanting carried some message of healing and hope for had bethesda not come here to find a cure for her malady but the words were strange to me and the feeling the chant inspired in me was not of hope but of resignation resignation to what not to the fates or fortune but to something even older than those to whatever unseen force metes out our measure of life beneath the sun the gods of egypt are older than the gods of rome a roman who comes to egypt finds himself far away from the gods he knows at the mercy of forces older than life itself powers that have no names because they existed before men could give them names i felt stripped of all pretensions to wisdom and worldliness i was naked before the universe and i trembled the chanting ceased there was movement within the temple a silhouette emerged from its uncertain light and in the next moment bethesda stood before me its time she said time for me to bathe in the nile this templeyouve been here before she nodded i know this place but how perhaps my mother brought me here once when i was child im not sure perhaps ive only seen it before in dreams but its just as i remember itor dreamed it it seems to me that i must have been here before too but thats impossible perhaps this is a place everyone sees in dreams whether they remember those dreams or not bethesda seemed satisfied with this explanation for she smiled very faintly i must bathe in the river now husband i stepped aside to let her pass ill come with you i said no the wisewoman says that i should go alone the wisewoman a figure stepped from the shadows from which bethesda had emerged it was an old woman wearing a simple linen gown with a ragged woolen mantle draped over her shoulders despite the heat of the day her hair was white pulled into a knot at the back of her head her skin was like ancient wood burned dark by the sun and carved with deep wrinkles she wore no jewelry her gnarled hands clutching the woolen mantle looked very small so did her feet her sandals were ragged and worn a cat its sleek fur as black as night followed the old woman out of the shadows and rubbed itself against her ankles did my wife make a sufficient offering i reached toward the coin purse in my pouch the woman held up her hand the god requires no offering to satisfy your wifes request the god this place is sacred to osiris the spring is wedded to the nile and in this place the union of the waters is perpetually blessed by osiris i bowed my head not understanding but deferring to the womans authority bethesda walked down the steps i moved to follow but she raised with her hand no husband dont follow what i have to do ill do alone then at least take the boys with you to stand by in case you need them in case anyone else the place is sacred husband no one will disturb me i followed her as far as the little grotto formed by the spring she stepped across the tiny pool and out of sight following a narrow path that appeared to lead down to the rivers edge i would have followed her but some power stopped me instead i found myself staring at the little pool formed by the seeping spring patches of sunlight glinted on the surface tiny translucent creatures wriggled under the water i heard a loud sigh and looked back at the priestess she was stooping down laboriously lowering herself to sit on the temple steps i hurried back to assist her then sat down beside her the black cat purring loudly insinuated itself between us and lifted its chin inviting the woman to stroke its throat with her gnarled forefinger cats were a rarity in rome and little liked but in egypt the creatures were considered divine once in alexandria i had witnessed a furious mob tear a man limb from limb for the crime of killing one the cat looked up at me and mewed loudly as if commanding me to give it pleasure i obliged by stroking its back the woman nodded toward the far side of the glade those two must give you no end of trouble she said i followed her gaze and saw that mopsus and androcles had disappeared i smiled and shrugged theyre no worse than other boys their age why i remember when i first adopted meto i caught myself and fell silent your sons name causes you pain she shivered and pulled her cloak about her ive sworn never to speak it again sometimes i forget i looked at the sundappled vines and listened to the chirping of birds the magic of the place began to fade the priestess was merely a frail thinblooded old woman after all the cat was nothing more than an animal the temple was merely a stone hut constructed by mortals who had died and been forgotten long ago the spring was hardly more than a seep and even as i watched a tiny cloud obscured the sun and the dappled leaves faded from gold to tarnished brass your wife loves you very much the old woman said i smiled was this what women talked about in secret when one came to the other as suppliant to priestessdomestic affairs i stroked the cat gently feeling the vibration of its purring against my palm i love her very much in return she nodded you must be at peace then those who drown in the nile are especially blessed by osiris cold fingers clutched my heart surely you mean to say those who bathe in the nile the old woman made no reply i could not speak i stood up feeling dizzy my head was as light as smoke hearing nothing but the rush of blood in my ears seeing only lights and shadows i rushed to the spring i stamped awkwardly across the little pool and followed the path that bethesda had taken after only a few steps the path forked i took the branch to the right the path led steadily downhill through the tangle of leaves i saw the gleam of the river but before i reached the waters edge the foliage became more tangled and i knew bethesda could not have come this way even so i pushed through the vines and rushes until i reached the water i felt sun on my face and sucked in a breath of air i gazed at the nile and saw it flowing steadily from right to left suddenly the water before me became strangely clouded i gazed at the apparition confounded until i realized what it must be rupa somewhere upriver had only moments before cast his sisters ashes into the water instead of vanishing at once in the flood the ashes somehow held together changing shape and only slowly dispersing as clouds change shape and gradually disperse in a hot sky the ashes of cassandra passed before me on the water and in the rivers gleam the image of her face stared back at me for a long moment i was bemused by the strange illusion then i was jarred to my senses by the sound of a boyish scream the cry came from nearby a little downriver it was androcles screaming for help master oh master come quickly mopsus began to scream as well anyone help us come help us anyone please along with the screaming i heard the sound of splashing water hackles rose on the back of my neck i bolted upright and doubled back forcing my way through the foliage until i came again to the fork in the path i took the left branch and ran toward the waters edge i collided with something and heard a highpitched yelp as i tumbled head over heels it was mopsus i had run into on my hands and knees i looked over my shoulder and saw him lying flat on his back convulsed with weeping i heard more weeping and turned to see androcles on the path ahead of me he was soaking wet whats happened i said in a hoarse whisper gone androcles cried shes gone what do you mean i staggered to my feet and grabbed his shoulders we heard you say that we should go with her so we followed her even though she wanted to go alone it was mopsuss idea i think he just wanted to watch her bathing what happened what did you see androcles speak to me he shivered and clutched himself and blubbered suddenly weeping so hard he couldnt speak i ran past him down to the waters edge the place was quiet and secluded with a leafy canopy overhead and rushes all around bethesda was nowhere to be seen i called her name the shout rousted a covey of birds who flapped and cawed and streamed skyward from the undergrowth i looked at the water and saw the same cloudiness i had seen before upstream the ashes of cassandra were passing by more diluted and dispersed now but still discernible sunlight glinted on the surface and i was certain i saw a face in the water bethesda cassandra i couldnt tell which i dropped to my knees and reached into the water but my hands found only pebbles and moss we watched her from the rushes it was mopsus speaking he must have recovered from the collision and followed me there was a tremor in his voice but he was not as hysterical as his little brother you said we should come with her so we did and not to see her bathing like androcles says she didnt take off her clothes anyway she knelt by the water for a moment then stood and walked into the river and then she just kept walking until the river he searched for words the river swallowed her up she just disappeared under the water and didnt come back we went in after her but the waters too deep i strode into the river the solid sandy bottom quickly gave way to an oozing muck that pulled at my feet the water rose to my chest and with another step to my chin oh bethesda i whispered looking downriver rushes swayed in the warm breeze sunlight glinted on the water the placid surface of the nile gave no indication of her passing for as long as the daylight lasted we searched for her mopsus ran to fetch rupa he was a strong swimmer while the boys ran up and down the riverbank rupa stripped off his tunic and dove beneath the surface again and again but he found nothing with no spring to feed it the opposite bank was sandy and relatively barren but the rushes along the rivers edge might nonetheless conceal a body i swam across and searched that side as well all day we searched and found no trace of bethesda at some point halfmad with grief i ran back to the temple i meant to confront the priestess but she had vanished along with the cat inside the chamber a single lamp burned very low its oil almost depleted by its flickering light i gazed at the images on the wallsgods with the bodies of men and the heads of beasts hieroglyphs of scarabs and birds and staring eyes that meant nothing to me and dominating them all the image of osiris the mummified god what words had passed between the wisewoman and my wife had bethesda intended merely to immerse herself and met with some mishap or had it been her intention all along to sink into the nile and never emerge i stepped out of the temple into the glade again i felt an uncanny shiver of recognition had i visited this place before in dreams afterwards forgotten if i ever saw the place again in my sleep it could only be in a nightmare throughout that long wretched day from time to time my restless fingers chanced upon the vial cornelia had given me still tucked away in my tunic the thought that i still possessed it was the only comfort left to me at last darkness fell and further searching became impossible we retreated to the wagon and made a camp for the night no one was hungry but i built a little fire beside the road nonetheless simply to have something to stare at the boys huddled close together and wept rupa wept as well remembering his sister to whom he had said a final farewell that day despite his muteness his quiet sobbing sounded like any other mans stunned and exhausted i did not weep i merely stared at the fire until by some miracle of somnus sleep came bringing the gift of oblivion chapter vii i was awakened by a spear point poking into my ribs a voice spoke in that reedy accent peculiar to the greekspeakers of egypt im telling you commander this is the fellow i saw he helped the freedman build the funeral pyre then whats he doing here all the way across the delta the voice was deep and heavy with authority good question sir lets see how he answers it you wake up unless you want this spear poked through your ribs i opened my eyes to see two men standing over me one was resplendent in the uniform of an egyptian officer wearing a green tunic beneath a bronze cuirass and a helmet that came to a point the earlymorning sunlight glinting off his armor made me blink and shield my eyes the other man wore a peasants tunic but had a haughty bearing and a foxlike glint in his eyes i instantly took him for a spy more soldiers stood beyond them the officer poked me with the spear again suddenly there was a blur of motion so startling that i covered my face i heard a horse cry and then through laced fingers i saw two hands seize the spear and yank it from the egyptian officers grip there was a scuffle and i scrambled to my feet to see a band of soldiers swarming over rupa knocking the spear from his grasp and bending his arms behind his back dont hurt him i cried hes my bodyguard he was only protecting me he attacked an officer of king ptolemys guard sniffed the man who had been poking me ostentatiously dusting off his forearms one of his underlings bowing his head obsequiously offered him back his spear the officer snatched it without even a nod of acknowledgment and thrust it against my belly backing me against the wagon the point tore through my tunic and scraped naked flesh i looked down to see a trickle of blood on the bright metal were peaceful travelers i protested from rome i presume to judge by that accent i think youre spies said the officer like this fellow i eyed the man in the tunic takes one to know one said the officer he turned to the spy and you should have noticed that the bodyguard was unaccounted for probably down at the river relieving himself when we showed up sneaking up on us like that he could have killed me how many others did you observe in this romans party just the two slave boys the ones over there androcles and mopsus both heavy sleepers had been rousted by soldiers and were getting to their feet rubbing their eyes and looking about in confusion and a woman added the spy a bit younger than this fellow but presumably his spouse he trained an angry gaze at me passing on the hostility the officer had vented on him where is your wife roman the one who joined you the day after you burned pompey did you lose her somewhere in the delta i felt a stab of pain sharper than the spear point pressing against my belly as fearful as the last few moments had been at least however briefly thoughts of bethesda had been driven from my mind my wife went down to bathe in the river yesterday she didnt come back the officer snorted a likely story you arouse my suspicions even more roman he addressed a subordinate take a party of men and search for the woman she cant have gone far im telling you she disappeared yesterday in the river perhaps or perhaps shes a spy as well gone off on a mission of her own this is absurd i said is it the officer poked the spear harder against my flesh we have some idea of who you are roman do you i find that quite unlikely the spy spoke up philip told me ah that takes you by surprise doesnt it his snide tone was particularly grating philip pompeys freedman what are you talking about you thought the beach was deserted that afternoon you spent building pompeys funeral pyre but when ptolemys army withdrew i stayed behind to observe i watched the freedman wailing over the headless body of his old master and then you were washed ashore you could only have come from one of pompeys ships i wasnt close enough to hear what you said but i watched the two of you gather driftwood and build the funeral pyres and the next day that merchant ship brought the rest of your partythe woman and the mute and the two boys oh yes there was a woman of that im quite sure and the next day you parted company with philip at the fishing village i had to choose which of you to follow and philip seemed the obvious choice i joined up with some soldiers and we apprehended him on the road heading east what did you do to him well ask the questions roman said the officer poking me with the spear the spy laughed philip wasnt harmed hes quite comfortable traveling under guard in ptolemys retinue who knows what important bits of information he may have to give us in the coming days but he already told us about you what could he possibly have told you i never met philip before that day exactlyand thats precisely what i find so intriguing because philip says that he saw you on pompeys galley just before the socalled great one came ashore and you appeared to be on quite close terms with pompeys wife philip says you must be one of pompeys veterans from the old daysand yet philip didnt know you and philip knew everyone with whom his master associated how could that be unless you were one of pompeyshow shall i say itsecret associates an agent traveling incognito a spy ridiculous i said even though the presumption was perfectly logical i was treading a daggers edge trying to decide how much of the truth to tell them pompeys spy i certainly was not but in fact i had worked for pompey more than once in the past digging up secrets how good was the spys intelligence would he recognize the name of gordianus even if he didnt someone else in king ptolemys cadre of spies very likely might have heard of me if i lied and told the man i didnt know pompey he might discover the truth and presume i was hiding some more damaging fact if i told too much of the truth he might make his own false assumptions i shook my head at the irony pompey had wanted me dead and in death he might yet achieve that purpose condemning me by association my name is gordianus i said the spy showed no reaction to the name im a roman yes but my wife was born here in egypt we met in alexandria many years ago in recent months she fell ill she came to believe that only a voyage back to egypt to bathe in the nile could save her thats why we came here traveling on a greek merchant ship the lighthouse at pharos was in sight when a storm blew us to the east thats how i fell in with pompey yes i knew him from years gone by but i certainly wasnt his spy when he was killed and his fleet set sail in the confusion i fell overboard i was lucky to reach the shore alive philip asked me to help him build pompeys funeral pyre i could hardly refuse and your party how did they happen to come ashore the greek captain was determined to be rid of them for bringing him bad luck as soon as we parted with philip we headed here to find this spot by the nile theres a temple in that glade with a priestess who serves osiris my wife consulted her yesterday she went to bathe in the river alone she didnt come back i stared steadily at the spy my vision blurred by tears the man was having none of it so you admit to having been in egypt before no doubt thats why you were selected for this mission because you already know the lay of the land what mission this is absurd i havent set foot in egypt in over thirty years so you say perhaps your wife when we find her will tell a different tale the temple you speak of has been abandoned for years the old woman who haunts the place is no priestess shes some sort of halfmad witch the officer interrupted this is getting us nowhere the main body of the army isnt far behind us i need to push forward with the advance guard ill leave behind enough men to secure these prisoners and you can hand them over to captain achillas when he comes through and the woman what if we fail to find her the officer looked at me for a long moment the pressure of his spear against me eased if you ask me he said i think the roman is telling the truth about the woman anyway but what would i know im just a soldier i dont have the devious mind of a spy he stepped back and lowered his spear poking the tip against the earth to remove the streaks of my blood at his signal soldiers came forward to bind my hands behind my back as rupa and the boys had already been bound what about our wagon and mules i said those will be confiscated said the spy along with that trunk youve been carting with you im curious to see whats inside he ordered soldiers to remove the trunk from the wagon if you insist on sorting through our soiled clothing and my wifes toiletries may it bring you pleasure i said we were shackled together by our ankles and made to sit in the cart the boys next to each other at the front and rupa and i on either side opposite one another the spy emptied the trunk onto the roadside and rummaged through the contents he turned out to be no better than a common thief pocketing the coins and the few items of value such as a silverandebony comb that bethesda had insisted on bringing with her he reached into the pouch of my tunic as well and pulled out the alabaster vial ah whats this he said a gift from a lady perfume are roman men scenting themselves like catamites these days vials can contain things other than perfume i said he looked as me knowingly poison ill wager something spies often carry on their persons in case they wish to make a fast clean exit or were you plotting to use it on someone on king ptolemy himself perhaps ha whatevers inside its a pretty little container he said pocketing it along with the coins and the comb soon i began to hear from the direction of naucratis the distant neighing of horses shouted commands the creaking of wagon wheels the tattoo of military drums and the tramp of many feet marching in unison there are few sounds so distinctive or so unnerving as the approach of a great army birds take to the sky a buzz throbs upon the air and the earth itself trembles the spy gathered up the items of no use to him and stuffed them back into the trunk then ordered soldiers to put the trunk back into the wagon the boys yelped drawing back their toes to avoid having them crushed but it was rupa with his long legs who was most inconvenienced from my cramped vantage point in the wagonwith my back to the road facing rupa opposite and the river beyondi had to crane my neck to see the streaming pennants and plumed helmets of the approaching army as they came nearer the soldiers struck up a marching chant the words were egyptian but hearing them repeated over and over i was able eventually to make sense of them he came to knock on ptolemys door but never set foot on egypts shore while he was yet inside the boat captain achillas cut his throat so now hes dead the romans dead as all will know when they see his head hurrah hurrah as all will know when they see the head of the socalled great who now is dead socalled socalled like alexander he was not pompey was cut not the gordian knot hurrah hurrah this song is short but the march is long and so again we sing the song hurrah hurrah he came to knock on ptolemys door but never set foot on egypts shore guards remained posted around the wagon but the spy headed off to meet the advancing troops and i lost sight of him the stamp of marching feet grew louder and louder iron rings bolted along the top rim of the wagon began to rattle and dance against the wood so great was the vibration i would have covered my ears had my hands been free i looked at the boys and saw fear in their eyes rupa squirmed nervously his legs bunched up against the trunk they all looked to me for reassurance so i struggled to keep my face impassive despite the thrill of panic i felt cranes shot skyward from rushes along the nile flapping their wings and emitting shrill cries i watched their flight envious the army reached us and went rumbling by the chant was deafening like alexander he was not pompey was cut not the gordian knot on and on it went as thousands of men marched by next came the clatter of hooves from mounted cavalry after the cavalry came the wagons carrying weapons and provisions amid the rumble of wheels i thought i heard the spys reedy voice nearby conferring with someone it seemed that a decision was reached for the conversation ended and a soldier mounted the wagon and drove the mules forward as we joined the procession of king ptolemys army the spy peeked into the wagon and gave me a sardonic look we never did find any trace of your wife roman she must be quite clever to cover her tracks so completely i dont like it when a spy gives me the slip ill track her down sooner or later and when i do he curled his lip in an expression that froze my blood then disappeared chapter viii as night fell the army reached a fortress somewhere to the east of alexandria vaguely i sensed that the wagon had come to a halt i dozed not from physical weariness but from a kind of mental stupor only by descending into halfformed dreams could my mind escape from an intolerable reality compounded of tedium and dread physical discomfort and numbing grief the shackles on my ankles were loosened something sharp poked me into alertness up roman the spy assisted by a few soldiers rousted us out of the wagon my bones ached from being jostled all day over a particularly rutted stretch of road my legs were weak from having been cramped for hours i staggered like a cripple with a spear at my back to keep me moving forward great walls with huge ramparts of packed earth surrounded us in the vast enclosure of the fortress the army went about the business of unloading provisions and preparing for the night the buildings within the fortress walls were mostly plain and utilitarian but one stood out on account of its opulence magnificent columns painted in bright colors supported a roof of gleaming copper it was to this building that the spy drove us with rupa and the boys i waited outside ringed by soldiers while the spy stepped within he was gone for a considerable time above us the desert sky was ablaze the sinking sun illuminated crimson and saffron clouds that glowed like molten metal then faded to the dull blue of cooling iron then darkened into everdeeper shades of blue fretted by silver stars i had forgotten the awesome beauty of an egyptian sunset but the splendor of the dying day brought me only misery bethesda was not there to share it with me at length the spy returned looking pleased with himself what a lucky day for you roman you shall have the great honor of meeting captain achillas himself the murderer i very nearly said it was hard to imagine how else the killing of pompey could be characterized clearly achillas was a man from whom i could expect no mercy serpentheaded lamps atop iron tripods lined a long hallway decorated with a riotous profusion of hieroglyphs the spy led us into a highceilinged chamber decorated in a fashion more greek than egyptian with geometric rugs underfoot and vast murals depicting battles painted on the walls scribes and other clerics scurried here and there across the large space at the center of all this motion were two men of very different countenance their heads close together as they engaged in a heated conversation i recognized achillas at once from having seen him on pompeys galley he was outfitted in the various regalia that marked him as captain of the kings guards with a red horsetail plume adorning his pointed helmet his tanned face looked very dark and his brawny physique seemed positively bulllike next to the pale slender figure who stood beside him the slighter man had a long face and arresting green eyes his yellow linen robes had a hem of gold embroidery across his forehead he wore a band of solid gold and a magnificent pectoral of gold filigree adorned his narrow chest he was much too old to be king ptolemy yet he had the look of a man used to giving orders and being obeyed as we approached the two of them looked our way and stopped conversing the spy bowed so low that his nose almost touched the ground as a roman i was unused to seeing such displays of servility which are part of the very fabric of egyptian life and indeed of life in any state headed by an absolute ruler your excellencies the spy hissed keeping his eyes lowered here is the man i spoke of the roman spy whom i apprehended this morning near the abandoned shrine of osiris downriver from naucratis the two men looked at methough the term man was not entirely suited to the pale fellow i thought as i began to perceive that he was very likely a eunuchanother feature of court life in hereditary monarchies to which romans are unaccustomed achillas looked at me and scowled what did you say he calls himself gordanius your excellency gordianus i corrected him the steady tone of my voice surprised even me used to hearing their underlings speak in hushed toadying voices achillas and his companion appeared taken aback to hear a captive speak up for himself while daring to look them in the eye the captain of the kings guards furrowed his brow his companion stared at me without blinking gordianus achillas repeated scowling the name means nothing to me as i said excellency he was seen on pompeys galley even while you yourself were departing with the socalled great one on board the royal skiff i didnt notice him gordianus gordianus does it mean anything to you pothinus the eunuch pressed his fingertips together and pursed his lips perhaps he said and clapped his hands a scribe appeared at once to whom pothinus spoke in low tones while staring at me thoughtfully the scribe disappeared through a curtained doorway and these others said achillas the romans traveling companions as you can see i wasnt talking to you snapped the captain the spy winced and groveled i cleared my throat the big fellow is called rupa born mute but not deaf he was a strongman with a mime troupe in alexandria before he came to rome through an obligation to his late sister i adopted him into my family hes a free man and a roman citizen now the two slave boys are brothers even among the three of them im not sure one could scrape up the wits to produce a passable spy master protested mopsus and androcles in a single highpitched voice rupa wrinkled his brow not quite following the train of my comment his simpleness had the virtue of making him a hard man to insult achillas grunted and suppressed a smile the eunuchs face was impassive and remained without expression when the scribe came hurrying back bearing a scroll of papyrus the scroll had been rolled to a specific passage to which the scribe pointed as he handed it over to pothinus gordianus called the finder pothinus read so you are in my book of names after all roman born during the consulship of spurius postumius albinus and marcus minucius rufus in the year of rome that would make you what sixtytwo years old and looking every day of it i must say wife halfegyptian halfjewish called bethesda formerly his slave acquired in alexandria mother to his daughter two sons both adopted one freeborn and called eco the other slaveborn and called metoabout whom see addenda pothinus looked pointedly at the scribe who lowered his head like a scolded dog and ran off to fetch another scroll the eunuch was about to continue reading when catching sight of someone behind me he abruptly assumed a subservient posture with his hands at his sides and his head bowed achillas did the same the piping of a flute accompanied the arrival of the young king all activity in the large chamber ceased the various scribes and officers stopped whatever they were doing as if petrified by medusa some hierarchy unclear to me apparently allowed some of them to remain standing while others dropped to their knees and still others prostrated themselves entirely falling flat on their faces with arms outstretched if i was in doubt as to the procedure incumbent on me the spy informed me of it drop down you roman dog down on your knees with your face to the floor he punctuated this order with several pokes to my ribs i caught only a glimpse of the king resplendent in robes of gold and silver and wearing the cobraheaded uraeus crown with my hands tied behind me it was not easy to drop to my knees and lower my face to the floor the posture was humiliating behind me i heard androcles whisper to his brother look at the master with his backside stuck up in the air this was followed by a tiny yelp as the spy kicked androcles to remind him that he had assumed the same vulnerable posture the spy then dropped to his knees just as the king and his retinue came striding by captain achillas and my lord chamberlain said ptolemy a boy he might be but his voice had already changed into that of a man for it was lower than i expected your majesty the two said in unison my loyal subjects may rise and go about their business said ptolemy pothinus conveyed the order at once the room was abuzz with movement as if statues had abruptly sprung to life the spy stood i began to do the same but he gave me a kick and hissed stay as you are from my position i could see little but i could hear everything the piper continued to play but lowered his volume it was a curious tune simple on first hearing but repeated in odd variations ptolemys father had been dubbed ptolemy auletes the piper on account of his love of the instrument was this one of the late kings compositions for young ptolemy to go about accompanied by this link to his father was the sort of device that roman politicians used in a struggle to the death with his sister cleopatra it behooved the young king to use any means possible to lay claim to his fathers legacy i thought you would be refreshing yourself in the royal quarters your majesty after the rigors of the days journey said pothinus ptolemy did not answer at once he turned from pothinus and stepped toward me until i could sense his presence just above me so close i could smell the perfumed leather of his sandals im told youve captured a roman spy lord chamberlain perhaps your majesty perhaps not im trying to delve to the bottom of the matter ah heres one of my scribes now with the additional information i called for i gathered that another scroll had been delivered while pothinus read muttering to himself the king remained standing over me i kept my eyes on a horned beetle that happened to be traversing the patch of floor just in front of my nose well lord chamberlain said the king what have you discovered pothinus cleared his throat the man is gordianus called the finder hes made a career of gathering evidence for advocates in the roman courts thus it appears hes gained the confidence of any number of powerful romans over the years cicero marc antony and pompey said the spy standing behind me there was a moment of awkward silence the man had spoken out of turn and i could imagine pothinus glaring at him yes pompey said the eunuch dryly but according to my sources the two of them had a severe fallingout at the beginning of the war between pompey and caesar thus its quite unlikely that this roman was a spy for pompey as his captor alleges quite the opposite in all probability what do you mean lord chamberlain the fellow has a son your majesty called meto who happens to be one of caesars closest confidants as a matter of fact the other soldiers refer to him as caesars tentmate i groaned inwardly metos exact relationship with his imperator had long been a puzzlement to me and a vexation when others gossiped about it now it seemed that such speculation had reached even here to egypt ptolemy was intrigued caesars tentmate what exactly does that imply lord chamberlain the eunuch sniffed the romans constantly spread vulgar sexual gossip about one another your majesty politicians insult their rivals with charges of engaging in this or that demeaning act common citizens say anything they please about those who rule them soldiers make up riddles and ditties and even marching songs that boast of their commanders sexual conquests or tease him about his more embarrassing proclivities tease him his soldiers tease caesar the romans are not like us your majesty theyre rather childish when it comes to sexual matters and they respect neither one another nor the gods their primitive form of government with every citizen at war with every other in a neverending struggle for riches and power has made them as impious as they are brutish caesars soldiers are fantastically loyal they fight to the death for him said king ptolemy quietly isnt that what youve told me lord chamberlain so our intelligence would indicate there are many examples to prove the point such as the soldier in the naval engagement at massilia who continued to fight even after losing several limbs and died shouting caesars name and also yet they feel free to make light of him how can this be i had thought his men must be so fiercely devoted to caesar because they recognized some aspect of godhood in him and willingly subjugated themselves to his divinity is he not said to be descended from the roman goddess venus but a mortal does not make fun of a god nor does a god permit his worshippers to ridicule him as i said your majesty the romans are an impious people politically corrupt sexually unsophisticated and spiritually polluted that is why we must take every precaution against them ptolemy stepped even closer to me the beetle under my nose scurried out of the way to make room for the toe of the kings sandal his nails i could not help but notice were immaculately groomed his feet smelled of rosewater so lord chamberlain this man knows caesar yes your majesty and if he is a spy rather than having been employed by pompey it seems more likely in my judgment that he was sent here by caesar to spy upon pompey and witness his arrival on our shores then we certainly gave him an eyeful said achillas abruptly entering the conversation rise to your knees roman said ptolemy i groaned and felt a stab of pain in my back from the effort of rising without using my hands the king took a few steps back and looked down his nose at me i dared to look back at him for a brief moment before lowering my eyes his face was indeed that of a boy of fifteen his greek ancestry was evident in his blue eyes and fair skin he was not particularly handsome with a mouth too broad and a nose too large to satisfy greek ideals of beauty but his eyes flashed with intelligence and the twist at the corner of his mouth hinted at an impish sense of humor gordianuscalledfinder is your name yes your majesty the spy who captured you charges that you were in the employ of pompey true or false not true your majesty my lord chamberlain suggests that you may be in caesars employ nor is that true your majesty but it is true that you know caesar yes your majesty i could see that he was intrigued by caesar and that it was my uncertain relationship with caesar that made him curious about me i cleared my throat if it would please your majesty i might be able to tell him a thing or two about caesar provided i am allowed to keep my head of course while not looking directly at him i could see nonetheless that the corner of his mouth twisted into a crooked smile the young king of egypt was amused you there spy what are you called the man gave a name of numerous syllables that was egyptian not greek ptolemy evidently could not be bothered to pronounce it for he continued to address the man by his profession what caused you to think spy that this roman was pompeys man the spy in his reedy voice proceeded to tell the tale of where and how he had first seen me and of how he had come upon me again near the temple beside the nile ptolemy returned his gaze to me well gordianuscalledfinder what do you have to say for yourself i repeated the tale of why i had come to egypt and how i had fallen in with pompeys fleet ending with the disappearance of bethesda the previous day and my capture that morning we had all been speaking greek abruptly ptolemy spoke to me in latin his accent was odd but his grammar impeccable the spy strikes me as a bit of an idiot what do you say to that gordianuscalledfinder from the corner of my eye i could see that the spy frowned unable to follow the change of tongues i answered in latin who am i to contradict the judgment of your majesty it would seem you are a man of considerable experience gordianuscalledfinder truly what do you have to say about this spy speak candidly i command it i cleared my throat the man may or may not be an idiot your majesty but i do know for a fact that hes a thief how so after i was bound he rummaged through my traveling trunk ostensibly to look for evidence to incriminate me finding nothing of the sort he stole the few things of value for himself the corner of ptolemys mouth twisted in the opposite direction producing a crooked frown he fixed his gaze on the spy and resumed speaking in greek what did you steal from this roman the spys jaw dropped open and quivered he was silent for a heartbeat too long nothing your majesty any spoils taken from an enemy are the property of the king whose officers may dispense them only in accordance with the kings wishes are you not aware of that spy of course i am your majesty i would never think to that is i would never dream of taking anything from a prisoner without first without handing it over directly to in latin ptolemy said to me what did he steal from you gordianuscalledfinder coins your majesty roman sesterces yes your majesty if the man has a few roman coins on his person or even a bag full of them that would hardly constitute proof that he stole them from you i suppose not your majesty to make an unsubstantiated charge of such severity against an agent of the king is an offense worthy of death i tried to swallow but my mouth was as dry as chalk there was something else he stole from my trunk what a comb your majesty a beautiful thing made of silver and ebony my wife insisted on bringing it with her for sentimental reasons my voice caught in my throat ptolemy turned his gaze back to the spy the man had followed none of our exchange in latin but even so he began to tremble and gnash his teeth captain achillas stepped forward your majesty have your men strip the spy of his tunic and whatever else hes wearing turn out all the pockets and pouches and see what you find at once your majesty soldiers converged in the bat of an eyelash the spy was stripped naked he sputtered at the indignity and blushed crimson from head to foot i averted my eyes which chanced to fall on pothinus did i imagine it or was the eunuch discreetly taking a good look at the naked mans scrotum in the background the piper continued to play for a while i had ceased to notice his music though he had never stopped playing the same song in endless variations what did your men find captain coins your majesty bits of parchment a perfumers vial made of alabaster a few a comb yes your majesty achillas held it before the king who looked down his nose at it but did not touch it a comb made of silver and ebony observed ptolemy the spy standing alone and naked wrung his hands and trembled violently there was a sound of splashing and i saw that his bladder was emptying itself he stood in a pool of his own urine blushing furiously biting his lips and whimpering the piper continued to play the tune changed to a brighter key and a quicker tempo have mercy on me your majesty i beg you blubbered the spy captain your majesty have this man executed at once pothinus stepped forward your majesty the man is a valuable agent he possesses a great store of specialized knowledge please consider this man stole from the king he lied to the king you yourself witnessed the lie are you saying lord chamberlain that there is an argument to be made that he should not be executed pothinus lowered his eyes no your majesty the kings words humble me captain achillas your majesty execute the man immediately where he stands so that all present may witness the swiftness of the kings justice achillas strode forward soldiers seized the spys arms not merely to immobilize him but also to keep him upright his legs had gone soft and otherwise he would have collapsed to the floor achillas put his massive hands around the mans throat and proceeded to strangle him where the mans face had been red before it now turned purple his body convulsed weird sounds rose came from his mouth until a sickening crunch put a stop to his gurgling with a snort of disgust achillas released him the mans head flopped to one side and his limp body crumpled to the floor the room fell silent except for the merry tune of the piper lord chamberlain your majesty see to it that the roman and his companions are released from their bonds that the items stolen from him are returned to his keeping that he is given suitable quarters and made comfortable keep him close at hand in case the king should wish to speak to him pothinus bowed low it shall be as your majesty commands the same soldiers who had stripped and immobilized the spy now surrounded me and began to untie the cords around my wrists meanwhile to a new and livelier tune from his piper king ptolemy made his exit from the room thus i made the acquaintance of the egyptian king and his advisers and received my first taste of life in the royal court chapter ix our quarters were simple but adequate a room made of stone with sleeping cots for all mopsus and androcles sharing a brass chamber pot in one corner a rug on the floor and a small lamp that hung from a hook in the ceiling there was even a narrow window that looked down on a sandy courtyard where soldiers were camped above the curve of the fortress wall beyond the sky was dark and full of stars to eat we were each given a bowl of lentil soup a millet biscuit and a few dried dates and figs the food disappeared almost at once eventually two soldiers arrived at the door bearing my trunk they set it in the middle of the room and departed i opened the lid lying on top was bethesdas silverandebony comb i picked it up and ran my fingertips over the prongs underneath was a bag full of coins and beside the bag almost hidden by a fold of cloth was the alabaster vial that cornelia had given me i extinguished the lamp and lay on my cot clutching the silverandebony comb i thought of diana and eco back in rome they would be devastated when they learned what had happened to bethesda how could i bear to tell them and would i ever have the chance rome seemed very far away a coldness settled over me and i thought of the alabaster vial perhaps it was the will of the gods that i should consume its contents after all nearby mopsus and androcles chattered to one another in low voices i was about to tell them to be quiet when mopsus spoke up master is this what rome will be like what do you mean mopsus from outside i heard a sentry give the allclear wind sighed in the tops of the tall palm trees outside the fortress wall the world had become very quiet and still when caesar gets back to rome and makes himself king is this what rome will be like said mopsus i still dont know what you mean what he means said androcles seeing that his brothers question needed clarification is this will everyone have to cringe and fawn and bow to caesar and call him your majesty even free citizens like you master yes master said mopsus and will caesar be able to say i dont like that fellow so kill him right now and the next thing you know just because king caesar said so the mans being strangled to death like this he demonstrated by clamping his hands around his brothers throat androcles joined in the demonstration by flailing his arms and legs against the cot and making a gagging noise from the cot next to them i heard rupa emit a chuckle of amusement but i saw nothing to laugh at i dont know boys when we get back i almost said if we get back but there was no point in planting doubtrome will certainly be different the egyptians have always been ruled by a king before the dynasty of the ptolemies there were the pharaohs whose reigns go back thousands of years back to the days of the pyramids and the sphinx but weve never had a kingwell not in years or so and no roman has ever been a king including caesar we have no experience of monarchy and no rules to go by i imagine like this mess of a war it will be rather like a play that the players make up as they go along now stop this roughhousing and get to sleep and if we dont will you order rupa to strangle us master dont test me mopsus eventually they quieted down until again i heard the sighing breeze in the palm trees i banished all thoughts of the alabaster vial from my mind who would see the boys and rupa through the perilous days ahead if not me i clutched the comb until finally sleepblessed sleep with its blanket of forgetfulnessbegan to draw near in my head the sighing breeze was joined by another sound and i fell asleep hearing the tune played by ptolemys piper repeated over and over again the next morning we set out for alexandria it appeared that the main body of the army would remain at the fortress under the command of achillas while the king and a smaller though substantial armed company would proceed to the capital soldiers loaded my trunk into the wagon another soldier was assigned to drive the mules while i rode in the back with rupa and the boys not bound as on the day before but free to move about the road ran westward away from the nile alongside a wide canal that brought fresh water from the river to the capital and allowed small craft to navigate back and forth i wondered how ptolemy would be transported to the city and assumed he would arrive by chariot but then beyond the ranks of marching soldiers i caught sight of an ornately gilded barge on the canal it was manned by boatmen who propelled it ahead of the slow current by means of long poles stripped to the waist their muscular shoulders and arms gleaming with sweat the boatmen worked with graceful efficiency pushing their poles against the bottom of the canal one after another and then repeating the sequence the middle portion of the barge was shaded by a large saffroncolored canopy beneath which i occasionally caught glimpses of the king and his retinue including the eunuch pothinus every so often when a breeze wafted from the direction of the canal i heard a few notes of music from the kings piper and felt a chill despite the rising heat of the day the hour was nearing midday when a soldier on foot approached our wagon are you gordianuscalledfinder he spoke egyptian but so slowly and distinctly that even i could follow i am come with me is there trouble his majesty ordered me to fetch you and the others in my party they stay behind you come with me rupa helped me descend from the wagon i spoke in his ear while im gone take care of the boys dont let them get into trouble they think theyre smarter than you but youre the strong one dont be afraid to show them whos boss do you understand he looked at me uncertainly but nodded i called to the boys when they came to the back of the wagon and bent toward me i grabbed each one by the nearest ear and pulled them close you will not repeat not get into trouble while im gone youll do as rupa tells you tells us said mopsus but rupa cant speak his words ended in a squeal as i gave his ear a twist you know what i mean when i return if i find that youve disobeyed me i shall twist this ear until it comes off do you understand yes master cried mopsus and you androcles his brother thinking it judicious to keep his mouth shut simply nodded i released them both with a firm grip on my arm the soldier hurried me off when will you be back called mopsus rubbing his ear soon im sure i called back though i was not sure of anything threading our way through ranks of marching infantry the soldier led me across the road and down a ramp set into the embankment of the canal where the royal barge had pulled alongside a landing spot the boatmen were taking advantage of the stop to lean against their poles and rest for a moment as soon as i stepped aboard the crew leader called out for them to resume their work the boatmen at the front of the barge on either side raised their poles and brought them down the barge slowly began to move pothinus peered out from beneath the canopy and gestured for me to follow steps led down to the royal accommodations which were actually below the level of the water the sunken shaded area was deliciously cool the saffroncolored canopy softened the glaring sunlight sumptuous carpets underfoot softened my steps here and there courtiers stood in little groups many wore the nemes a pleated linen headcloth such as that worn by the sphinx with various colors and patterns to denote their rank while others wore ceremonial wigs upon their presumably shaved heads they stood aside to let me pass until at the center of the barge i saw king ptolemy seated on his throne two other chairs hardly less opulent faced his both were chased with silver inlaid with bits of ebony and ivory and their broad seats were strewn with plump cushions in one chair sat pothinus the other was empty sit said pothinus i sat and realized that ptolemys throne was raised on a dais the platform was low but sufficient to force me to tilt my chin up if i dared to look at him if i lowered my eyes they naturally came to rest upon a large covered clay jar next to one of the kings feet it occurred to me that the jar was just the right size to contain a mans head did you sleep well gordianuscalledfinder quite well your majesty the accommodations were adequate yes your majesty good are you hungry perhaps your majesty then you and pothinus must partake of some food i myself am never hungry at midday lord chamberlain call for food small tables were brought and atop them were set silver trays heaped with delicaciesgreen and black olives stuffed with peppers and nutpaste fish cakes sprinkled with poppy seeds millet cakes sweetened with honey and soaked in pomegranate wine despite the lavish spread i had some trouble mustering my appetite for i kept imagining what must be inside the clay jar at the kings feet while pothinus and i ate the kings piper played a tune the man sat at a little distance behind ptolemy crosslegged on the floor the tune was different from the one he had played the night before ptolemy seemed to read my thoughts do you like the music very much i said which seemed the safe answer may i ask who composed the tune my father i nodded it was as i had thought ptolemy went about accompanied by his fathers music to reinforce his link to the piper and thus his legitimacy as the late kings successor but then he said something that prompted me to reconsider my cynical interpretation of his motives my father possessed a remarkable talent for music with his playing he could make a man laugh one moment and weep the next there was a sort of magic in his fingers and lips this fellow who plays my fathers tunes captures the notes but not always the spirit of my fathers compositions still to hear his music reminds me of my father in a way that nothing else can consider the monuments that men leave behind even the greatest men reach out to only one of the five senses our sight we look at the image on a coin or gaze upon a statue or read the words that were written we see and we remember but what about the way a man laughed or sang and the sound of his voice no art can capture those aspects of a man for posterity once a man is dead his voice his song and his laughter die with him gone forever and our memory of them grows less and less exact as time passes i was lucky then that my father made music and that others even if not with his precise skill can reproduce that music i cannot ever again hear the sound of my father speaking my name but i can hear the tunes he composed and so feel his presence persist among the living i dared to lift my eyes to gaze into those of ptolemy but the king was staring into the middle distance it seemed strange to hear such a young man utter sentiments so bittersweet but ptolemy was not after all an ordinary young man he was the descendant of a long line of kings and queens stretching back to the righthand man of alexander the great he had been raised to think of himself as semidivine and the possessor of a unique destiny had he ever played with the boyish careless abandon of mopsus and androcles it seemed unlikely i had interpreted the presence of his attendant piper as a purely political device a calculated ploy in rome such would have been the case but gazing upon ptolemy through jaded roman eyes i had missed something could it be that ptolemy was both more mortal and more kingly than i had thought the bond between father and son is a very special thing i said quietly and my thoughts took a dark turn again ptolemy seemed to read my mind you have two sons i understand the one called eco who lives in rome and the other called meto who travels with caesar but the one called meto you no longer call your son that is correct your majesty you had a fallingout yes your majesty in massilia for the first time i heard him laugh though not with joy you neednt explain gordianuscalledfinder ive had my share of fallingsout with family members if my latest military excursion had been successful id be coming back to alexandria with two heads to show the people not just one across from me pothinus pursed his lips but if he thought the king spoke carelessly he said nothing the king continued tell me gordianuscalledfinder what do they say about egypt where you come from what do the citizens of rome make of our little domestic squabble this opened treacherous ground i answered carefully your father was wellknown in rome of course since for a period of time he resided there in fact the piper had been driven out of egypt by rioting mobs and lived for a while in exile in rome while his eldest daughter berenice seized the opportunity to take over the government in his absence i was very young then said the king too young to accompany my father what did the romans make of him while he lived there your father was wellliked his generosity wasmuch spoken of passing out money and promises of money the piper had petitioned the roman senate for military assistance to restore him to the throne in essence he had ransomed the future wealth of his country to roman senators and bankers for many months your majesty roman politics revolved around the egyptian question the question put the piper back on the throne as a roman puppet or take over the country outright and make it a roman province it was a delicate issue endlessly debated caesar and pompey staged a titanic struggle over who should get the command but to choose either man threatened to upset the precarious balance of power in rome the senate finally picked a relative nonentity aulus gabinius to pacify egypt the people of rome rejoiced when your father was rightfully restored to his throne gabinius with the aid of a dashing young cavalry commander named marc antony routed the forces of berenice back in power the piper as his first act executed his rebellious daughter his second act was to raise taxes so as to start paying the vast sum in bribes he had promised to roman senators and bankers egypt was impoverished and the egyptian people groaned under the burden but the sizable roman garrison left behind by gabinius assured that the piper would remain in power i cleared my throat the sudden death of your father two years ago caused grief and consternation in rome the senators and bankers worried that chaos would overtake egypt and that further payments from whomever succeeded the piper would dry up there were vicious recriminations from those who had argued for annexing egypt outright while the pickings were easy the king nodded thoughtfully and what is the attitude of the citizens of rome regarding affairs in egypt since the death of my father the ground became even more treacherous to be candid your majesty since the death of your father my knowledge and i suspect the knowledge of most romans regarding events in egypt are rather hazy in the last few years our own domestic squabbles have occupied all our attention not a great deal of thought is given to affairs in egypt at least not by common citizens but what was said about my fathers will at the time of his death a mans will is a sacred thing to a roman whatever dispensation your father decreed would be respected in fact there had been a great deal of disappointment that the piper had not bequeathed the governance of egypt to the roman senate other monarchs close to death massively in debt to rome and wishing to spare their countries from inevitable war and conquest had done exactly that but the piper had chosen to leave egypt to his eldest remaining daughter cleopatra and her younger brother ptolemy to be ruled jointly by the two of them presumably brother and sister had married one another as was the custom with coreigning siblings in the ptolemy family incest was abhorrent to romans and looked upon as yet another decadent symptom of monarchy along with court eunuchs ostentatious pageantry and capricious executions the king shifted uneasily on his throne and frowned my father left egypt to meand to my sister cleopatra did you know that gordianuscalledfinder that was my understanding yes my father dreamed of peace in the family and prosperity for egypt but in the world of flesh even the dreams of a god do not always find fulfillment the fates have decreed this to be a time of civil war all across the earth so it is with rome so it is with egypt so it is i take it even within your own family gordianuscalledfinder i bowed my head you speak again of my son meto the tentmate of caesar he said watching me closely i bit my lip ah does that have something to do with your estrangement has the eagle taken your son perhaps too much under his wing i sighed i find it strange that your majesty should show so much interest in the family affairs of a common roman citizen i am interested in all things having to do with caesar he said the gleam in his eyes was partly that of a curious fifteenyearold boy and partly that of a calculating politician for many a roman i said speaking slowly and quietly the choice between caesar and pompey was not an easy one cicero searched frantically for a third way but found none and finally sided with pompeyto his regret marcus caelius leaped to caesars side then grew dissatisfied and betrayed him milo escaped from exile in massilia and sought to raise an army of his own and you have known all these men ptolemy sat forward these heroes and adventurers and madmen of whom we hear only echoes here in egypt i nodded most of them i have known better than i cared to certainly better than was good for me and you know caesar as well yes and is he not the greatest of them the nearest to godhood i know him as a man not a god a man of great power yes yet you begrudge the favoritism he shows your son the matter is complicated your majesty i almost smiled as i said this considering that the person to whom i spoke was married to a sister he loathed and that another of his sisters had been executed by their father i glanced at the clay jar at ptolemys feet i felt slightly queasy if caesar comes to egypt i said will you have him beheaded as you did pompey the king exchanged a look with pothinus who clearly disapproved of this turn in the conversation your majesty he said intending to change the subject but the king spoke over him obliging pothinus to fall silent he was remarkably easy to kill wasnt hepompey i mean the gods deserted him at pharsalus by the time he was ready to step ashore here in egypt there was not a shred of divinity still clinging to his wretched person the gods had stripped him of their armor and when the blades descended the only resistance they met was feeble flesh he thought to stride ashore to remind me of the debts my father owed him and take command of egypt as if our treasury granaries and arms were his for the taking it was not to be put an end to the socalled great one before his feet can touch egyptian soilwere those not your exact words pothinus you even quoted that favorite epigram of my tutor theodotus dead men dont bite i thought long and hard upon this question in dreams i sought the counsel of osiris and serapis the gods agreed with pothinus had i given succor to pompey the same curse that fell upon him would have fallen upon egypt caesar may be another matter i think the gods are still with caesar his divinity must grow stronger with every conquest will he come to egypt gordianuscalledfinder seeking our grain and our gold as pompey did perhaps your majesty and if he comes will he be as easy to kill as pompey was i made no answer ptolemy turned to the eunuch what do you think lord chamberlain i think your majesty said pothinus casting a shrewd glance at the king that you promised audiences with certain of your subjects today here on the royal barge perhaps your conversation with this roman could be postponed while you tend to moreofficial business ptolemy sighed who comes to me today several delegations are here to report on the status of the annual inundation in the regions of the upper nile we have reports from ombos hemonthis latopolis and elsewhere the news they bring is not good i fear there is also a party of merchants from clysma on the gulf of the red sea who wish to petition for tax relief a fire destroyed several warehouses and piers last year and they need money to rebuild ive read their reports and petitions but only you can grant the dispensations they request must i meet these people now lord chamberlain all these groups have come a very long way your majesty and i think it would be best to dispose of these matters before we reach alexandria where your majesty is likely to be greeted by a great many pressing needs that have developed in your absence the king closed his eyes very well lord chamberlain pothinus stood i shall call for the barge to stop at the next landing and find a suitable escort to take the roman back to his no let gordianuscalledfinder stay but your majesty let him stay where he is ptolemy gave him a severe look as your majesty commands i had thought in such a hot climate that all business would cease in the hours just after midday but such was not the case while i sat and struggled not to dozesnoring during a royal audience would surely be frowned ona succession of envoys was admitted to the kings presence what impressed me most was ptolemys facility with languages and dialects all the envoys spoke some greek but many exhausted their vocabulary after a few ritual greetings whereupon the king began to converse with perfect fluency in whatever tongue best suited his subjects all the while the piper played in the background at last the final envoy made obeisance and departed from the kings presence pothinus showed the man out on his way back he was approached by a messenger who whispered something in his ear the message appeared to be quite long and complicated hearing it the eunuch appeared at first alarmed then amused at last he hurried to ptolemys side your majesty you shall soon have a chance to gaze upon the master of rome with your own eyes your advance guards have reached alexandria they send back news caesars ships are in the harbor ptolemy drew a sharp breath in the harbor does caesar like pompey await my coming before he steps onto egyptian soil pothinus flashed a smile actually your majesty caesar arrived some days ago i am told that he set foot on a public pier and attempted to take a stroll through one of the markets it seems he wished to awe the people for he arrived with all the trappings of a roman consul he wore his toga with a purple stripe and twelve armed men called lictors marched before him bearing fasces fasces bundles of birch rods sheathing iron axesancient ceremonial weapons that are part of the trappings of a roman magistrate when he goes about in public suitable for rome perhaps but not for alexandria or so the people thought the crowd was so outraged at this slight to your majestys dignitythat a roman should strut about the city in the kings absence as if egypt were a province of romethat they raised an outcry and gathered up anything they could find in the marketfruit vegetables fishand proceeded to pelt the romans until they withdrew to their ships now caesar awaits your arrival before daring to set foot in the city again ptolemy laughed it seems there was a battle and caesar was forced to retreat as my father used to say it never pays to get on the wrong side of the alexandrian mob we shall have to consider how to welcome the roman consul in a more suitable fashion he gazed down at the jar at his feet and smiled chapter x the approach to alexandria by royal barge was a new experience for me and bittersweet each time i felt a prick of novelty i also felt a stab of grief for bethesda was not there to share the experience fifteen miles east of alexandria the canal from the nile passes through a town called canopus notorious as a pleasure resort for the idle rich of the city out of curiosity i visited canopus once when i lived in alexandria as a young man but in those days even the trinkets in the curio shops were beyond my meager means and i could only peer into the dining establishments gambling houses and brothels along the canal forty years later i again found myself passing through the town but this time i was seated next to the king himself pleasureseekers thronged the waterfront to have a look at the royal barge and steal a peek at its occupant ptolemy remained seated on his throne at the center of the barge and ignored the waving throng but i thought i saw a shadow of a smile on his lips when we heard the cheering spectators cry out his name egypt might be torn by civil war but among the pleasure class of alexandria ptolemys claim to the throne was apparently not in dispute from canopus to alexandria the canal grew considerably wider so as to accommodate the numerous barges traveling back and forth in deference to the royal vessel all others pulled aside and stopped whenever they met us so that our progress was unimpeded barge after barge we passed some privately owned and luxuriously outfitted others serving as common carriers offering various classes of accommodation as a young man i had traveled to canopus standing upright on a barge so crowded i feared it would sink we passed several of those and their occupants seemed distinctly less enthusiastic about their monarch than had the diners and gamblers along the waterfront in canopus some of the faces that stared back at us looked positively hostile did they favor ptolemys sister cleopatra in the struggle for the succession or were they altogether weary of the ptolemies and the chaos they had inflicted on egypt in recent years approaching alexandria the canal split into two branches and we took the one to the left a concentration of palm trees appeared on the flat horizon ahead of us lining the shore of lake mareotis reflecting the sun overhead the lake appeared as a scintillating line beyond the silhouettes of tree trunks the trees grew nearer the scintillating line became a visible expanse of water the banks of the canal grew wilder with rushes on either side we rounded a small bend and entered lake mareotis more an inland sea than a mere lake ahead of us along the distant shore was the low jumbled skyline of alexandria with the pharos lighthouse looming beyond fishing boats and private vessels drew back to make way for the king two small warships manned by soldiers in ceremonial armor sailed out to greet us then turned about and formed an escort for the arrival of the royal barge beneath the city walls at the busy lakeside harbor courtiers and soldiers awaited us on a jetty festooned with colorful pennants the barge pulled beside the landing and came to a gentle stop ptolemy rose from his throne grasping his crook and flail courtiers fell in behind him each seeming to know his exact place in order of rank i hung back not sure where i belonged pothinus whispered in my ear just follow me and keep quiet a ritual ceremony attended the kings arrival on the jetty with various members of the court welcoming ptolemy back to his capital then the king stepped into a fabulously decorated litter its canopy fringed all about with pinkandyellow tassels its beams and posts carved of ebony chased with silver the whole vehicle carried aloft on the shoulders of a team of immensely muscular slaves who were as naked as horses adorned by nothing more than a few straps of leather and swatches of linen behind the kings litter was another conveyance almost as magnificent pothinus ushered me inside and then joined me we were hoisted aloft surrounded by armed guards and preceded by a veritable orchestra of pipers playing in unison a festive tune now quite familiar to me we were carried down the long jetty the walls of alexandria stretched to either side of us before us loomed the high bronze doors of the gate of the sun the doors swung open a warm breeze issued from within as if the city itself released a sigh at the return of its monarch the royal procession entered the city after so many delays and detours i was back in alexandria the scent of the cityfor like a woman alexandria has its own perfume compounded of sea air flowers and hot desert breezesswept over me and with it a nostalgia far more powerful and allencompassing than i had anticipated the flood of memories made me tremble the absence of bethesda made me weep if i had possessed her remains i could at least have given her in death the homecoming she had longed for but even that small consolation was not possible i possessed no urn full of ashes no box containing her mummified remains suppressing a sob i whispered to the air here we are at last after so many years away but there was no one to hear except pothinus who gave me a curious sidelong glance and looked away we traveled up the argeus the principal northsouth street of the city a magnificent promenade one hundred feet wide with fountains obelisks and palm trees down the middle and a colonnade of painted marble statues and fluted columns on each side crowds gathered to watch from a safe distance keeping clear of the armed guards who flanked the kings procession many cheered some drew back scowling some shrieked and babbled and prostrated themselves as if overwhelmed by religious awe i gathered that ptolemy was many things to many people king hero usurper persecutor god would it be so in rome when caesar returned there in glory it was hard to imagine any roman citizen bowing to another man as if he were divine but the fate of the world had taken such a tortuous path in recent years that anything seemed possible due to its flat terrain alexandria is unusual among great cities for being laid out in a grid with the streets intersecting at right angles to form rectangular blocks in rome a city of hills and valleys one comes to a corner where numerous streets intersect each narrow lane winding off in a different direction some heading uphill and others downhill every intersection is unique and together they offer an endless succession of intriguing sights in alexandria the horizon is low and the broad avenues offer distant views in all directions the landmark that dominates all else is the pharos lighthouse towering impossibly high above the great harbor its flaming beacon a rival to the sun itself it would be hard to say which city seems bigger rome is a crowded jumble of shops tenements temples and palaces with one thing built on top of another and no sense of order or proportion a oncequaint village grown madly out of control bustling and swaggering with brash vitality alexandria is a city of wide avenues grand squares magnificent temples impressive fountains and secluded gardens the precision of its greek architecture exudes an aura of ancient wealth and a passion for order even in the humble tenements of the rhakotis district or the poorer sections of the jewish quarter an invincible tidiness holds squalor at bay but while the alexandrians love beauty and precision the heat of the egyptian sun induces a certain languor and the tension between these two thingsorderliness and lassitudegives the city its unique often puzzling character to a roman alexandria seems rather sleepy and selfsatisfied and too sophisticated for its own goodsophisticated to the point of worldweariness like an aging courtesan past caring what others might think to an alexandrian rome must seem impossibly vulgar full of loud brash people bombastic politicians clashing architecture and claustrophobic streets we arrived at the great crossroads of the citythe crossroads of the world some would saywhere the argeus intersects the main eastwest avenue the equally broad canopic way perhaps the longest street in the world the intersection of these two avenues is a grand square with a magnificent fountain at its center where marble naiads and dryads cavort with crocodiles and nile riverhorses or hippopotami as the greeks call them around a towering obelisk the intersection of the argeus and the canopic way marks the beginning of the royal precinct of the city with its state offices temples military barracks and royal residences occupying each of the four corners of the intersection are colonnaded buildings that house the tombs of the ptolemaic kings and queens of egypt the most opulent of these tombs is that of the citys founder alexander the great whose mummified remains are an object of wonder to visitors who travel from all over the world to gaze upon them great tablets adorn the walls of the tomb with painted reliefs that depict the conquerors many exploits on this day as on every day a long queue of people stood waiting for their turn to step inside one by one they would be allowed to shuffle past the body of alexander so as to look for a moment and at a distance for the open sarcophagus lies beyond a protective chain and a row of guards at the face of historys most famous man in the years that i had lived in alexandria i had never entered the conquerors tomb the price of admission had been too dear for a vagabond young roman with no steady income as we passed by the tomb those in the queue turned to watch the royal procession on this day they would catch a glimpse not only of alexander but also of his living heir beside me in the litter pothinus released a heavy sigh i turned to look at him and saw that he gazed abstractedly at his fingernails at casium we almost had her he muttered i said nothing but he turned and saw the puzzlement on my face cleopatra he explained the kings sister south of the village of casium at the outermost eastern frontier we very nearly had her there was a battle i said striving to show polite interest more precisely there was not a battle said pothinus had we been able to confront her in a decisive engagement that would have been the end of cleopatra and her ragtag band of bandits and mercenaries the kings army is bigger better trained better equippedand far more cumbersome rather like matching a nile riverhorse against a sparrow the beast would have no trouble crushing the bird provided he could catch it first time and again they eluded us we were in the middle of engineering a trap in the hills not far from casium when word came that pompey and his fleet had just arrived off the coast you could have crushed cleopatra first then met with pompey that was what achillas advised but the risk seemed too great what if cleopatra eluded us once againand it was to her that pompey made his overture then we would have had cleopatra and pompey on one side of us and caesar on the other not a pretty place to be better to deal with each threat one at a time starting with the one most readily disposed of i suggested what an easy target poor pompey had turned out to be we considered the threat posed by pompey and as you might say decided to head him off pothinus smiled and looked pleased with himself it might have been achillas who struck the blow but i gathered that pothinus was the author of the scheme and not averse to taking credit for it the king himself approved of that decision nothing is done in the kings name that does not have the kings approval that sounds rather formulaic but it is true dont let the kings youth mislead you hes very much the son of his father the culmination of thirteen generations of rulers i am his voice achillas is his swordhand but the king possesses a will of his own is his sister the same she too is the child of her father if anything being a few years older shes even more sure of herself than her brother and even less susceptible to the influence of advisers like pothinus i thought was that why the eunuch had sided with one over the other and so i said having disposed of pompey we hoped to return at once to the problem of cleopatra but the ships that gave chase to pompeys fleet returned with fresh intelligence about caesar he was said to be anchored off the island of rhodes planning to come to alexandria as soon as possible once again it seemed prudent to turn our attention to the roman problem and postpone until a later time our dealings with the kings sister will caesar then be dealt with as was pompey i felt a quiver of dread imagining caesars head in a basket next to that of the great one what would happen to meto if such a thing came to pass i cursed myself for wondering meto had chosen to live by guile and bloodshed and his fate had nothing to do with me caesar presents a more complex challenge said pothinus requiring a more subtle response because he arrives in the wake of his triumph at pharsalus clearly the gods love him acknowledged pothinus but isnt ptolemy a god the will of the king concerning caesar shall be made manifest in the fullness of time first we shall see what awaits us in the harbor pothinus looked at me shrewdly they say gordianuscalledfinder that the gods granted you the gift of compelling outspokenness and forthrightness in those you meet strangers confide in you men like caesar and pompey unburden themselves to you even the king does not seem immune to this power of compelling candid speech even i appear to be susceptible to it they say i quoted back to him its all in your dossier the kings intelligence is quite extensive his eyes and ears are everywhere even in rome especially in rome thus your reputation precedes you the king himself spent an hour last night perusing your dossier and asking questions about you i suppose i should feel flattered or lucky to still be alive ah but weve arrived at the gates of the royal residence time for more formalities i fear and an end to our conversation gates opened and the procession entered the complex of royal residences along the waterfront it was said that each successive ruler in the line of ptolemies had felt obliged to add to the royal habitations thus over the centuries the complex had become the most sumptuous concentration of wealth and luxury in the worlda city within the city with its own temples courtyards living quarters and gardens honeycombed with hidden chambers and secret passages the gates shut behind us we were in a narrow courtyard surrounded by high walls the litters were set upon blocks pothinus stepped out and attended the king who emerged from his litter to the greetings of fawning courtiers for the moment i seemed to have been forgotten and i sat back against the cushions of the litter bemused by the twists of fate that had brought me to such a curious place i felt a prick of anxiety wondering what had become of rupa and the boys and then a sudden overwhelming homesickness for rome what was my daughter diana pregnant with her second child doing at that moment and her son little aulus and her hulking lamb of a husband davus how i missed them how i wished i was there with them and with bethesda and that the two of us had never left rome somewhere in the background of my thoughts i heard the music of ptolemys piper echo between the narrow walls and recede into the distance the courtyard which had been thronged with attendants was now almost deserted i blinked and turned to see a young woman standing beside the litter staring at me her skin had the hue and luster of polished ebony her hair had been styled to take advantage of its natural coarseness so that it formed a circular nimbus around her face like a floating frame made of black smoke that trailed into wisps along the edges her eyes were an unexpected green a shade i had never seen in a nubian before but her high cheekbones and full lips were emblematic of the beauty of nubian women she gave me a demure smile and lowered her eyes my name is merianis she said speaking latin if you care to step from the litter ill show you to your room i have a room in the palace you do shall i take you there now i took a deep breath and stepped from the litter show me the way i followed her through a succession of passages courtyards and gardens we drew closer to the harbor every now and again through an opening in the walls i spied a glimpse of sails and the sparkle of sunlight on water and occasionally above the rooftops i saw the pharos lighthouse looming in the distance we ascended several flights of steps then strode down a long hallway across a bridge of stone between two buildings and down another long hallway here she said opening a wooden door the room was large and simply furnished with a bed against one wall a small table and a chair against the other and a redandyellow rug of geometric greek design on the floor the lack of ornament was more than made up for by the breathtaking view from the tall window from which drapes of pale yellow had been pulled back no painting or mosaic could possibly compete with the majestic image of the pharos perfectly framed in the window and a view of the great harbor dotted with ships in the foreground magnificent i whispered does rome have any sight to match it asked merianis rome has many magnificent sights i said but no other city has a sight such as this have you been to rome ive never been outside alexandria but your latin is excellent thank you we can speak greek if you like which do you prefer merianis i appreciate any opportunity to practice my latin then its a pleasure to accommodate you she smiled you must be famished after the days journey shall i have food brought to you im not hungry then perhaps i could help to relieve the strains of the day i ran my eyes from the lapisencrusted sandals on her feet to the sheer linen skirt that left bare her wellproportioned calves up to the manypleated linen mantle that clung to her shoulders and shapely breasts the mantle left her neck uncovered a necklace strung with lapis baubles nestled against the silky flesh of her throat im rather tired merianis it will require no expenditure of energy on your part if i simply give you a massage i gave her what i imagined to be a very crooked smile i think i should simply lie down and rest for a while whats through there by the way i asked noticing a narrow door covered by a curtain in the wall beside the bed quarters for your slaves and for the young man traveling with you rupa and the boys where are they theyll be here soon along with your trunk the wagon in which they traveled and the mules that pulled it will be delivered to the cousin of the owner as was your intention i looked at her more closely scrutinizing her emerald green eyes i took you for a slave merianis i am a slaveof isis i serve the goddess and belong to her completely body and soul in this world and in the next youre a priestess yes im attached to the temple of isis within the palace but in her absence absence surely isis isnt off on a trip somewhere as a matter of fact my mistress is away from the palace i nodded you speak of queen cleopatra who is also isis they are one and the same queen cleopatra is the incarnation of isis just as king ptolemy is the incarnation of osiris i see why are you not with her now merianis hesitated when she took her leave my mistress left the palace rather abruptly i was unable to accompany her besides my duties keep me here in the palace close to the temple among many other tasks i see to the comfort of distinguished visitors such as yourself i laughed im not sure what distinguishes me except a multitude of misfortunes but i am thankful for your hospitality merianis she bowed her head isis will be pleased will you be seeing to the comfort of that other distinguished roman whos come to visit alexandria she cocked her head quizzically i strode to the window the one in the harbor surely youve noticed that fleet of roman warships out there she joined me at the window there are thirtyfive roman ships in all i counted them myself is it true that you know caesar i drew breath to answer then stopped short weariness and an excess of emotion had dulled my mind otherwise i would have realized before that moment the likelihood that the woman who stood beside meexotic beautiful wellspoken enticingly availablewas something more than a servant or priestess with the king and queen at war with one another the palace must be filled with spies glancing sidelong at merianis feeling her nearness smelling the heady scent of spikenard from her dark flesh i could easily imagine a man letting down his guard in her presence and saying things better left unsaid i turned my gaze to the harbor the long day was slipping gradually toward nightfall ships cast long shadows on flat water pierced by dazzling flashes of reflected sunlight the pharos cast the mightiest shadow of all darkening the entire entrance to the harbor beyond the open sea extended to seeming infinity i thought of the nile emptying endlessly into that sea carrying all that was lost or scattered in its waters im weary merianis leave me now as you wish she departed without another word leaving a faint scent of spikenard behind how long i stood at the window i had no idea the sun continued to sink until it touched a point on the horizon where the earth met the sea it was then swallowed in a great effulgence of crimson and purple mist the great harbor grew dark on the roman galleys lamps were lit lamps were likewise lit on the great causeway called the heptastadion that swept from the city out to the island of pharos beyond that causeway lay another smaller harbor to the south the eunostos or harbor of good return near its center an archway in the heptastadion allowed ships to sail from one harbor into the other there was a knock at the door merianis i thought and part of me was glad but when i opened the door i saw not the priestess of isis but the wideeyed face of rupa whose expression declared his astonishment at being inside the royal palace i lowered my eyes and saw two more astonished faces peering back at me androcles mopsus you have no idea how happy we are to see you cried the boys in unison throwing their arms around me rupa looked as if he would gladly have hugged me too had there been room enough in the narrow doorway but where have you been all this time said androcles and was that really you we caught a glimpse of on the kings barge said mopsus and look at that said androcles running to the window its the lighthouse bigger than a mountain and all those boats in the harbor roman galleys someone said with caesar himself aboard one of them slaves carried my trunk into the room followed by more slaves bearing trays of steaming food until the smell reached my nose i had no idea how hungry i was mopsus said when you were with the king did he show you pompeys eat now talk later i said my stomach growling we would have to be careful when we did speak for in such a place the floors had ears to listen and the walls had eyes to watch but after we ategreat steaming bowls of barley soup pigeon meat roasted on skewers spicy lentil wafers and cups of beer to wash it all downthere was no talk at all only sleep as i fell against my pillow and left it to rupa and the boys to find their own beds chapter xi thirtythree thirtyfour thirtyfive yes thirtyfive roman galleys in the harbor declared mopsus who had just counted them for the second time morning light glinted on the water and lit the face of the pharos the room smelled of the freshly baked bread that slaves had delivered for our breakfast i sat back against the cushions on my bed gnawing a piece of hard crust while the boys stood at the window rupa sat on the trunk shaking his head amused at the boys and their perpetual squabbling thirtyfive you missed one i counted thirtysix insisted androcles then you miscounted said mopsus i did not you never could count higher than the sum of your fingers and toes said mopsus nonsense you obviously missed one did you count that one with the gorgon head at the prow i never saw such a fearsome ramming beak on a ship where you can barely see it because its mostly blocked by the buildings on that island whats the name of that island in the harbor master its called antirrhodus and it belongs to the king those buildings are his private estate with their own little harbor within the harbor it must be a fabulous place to visit can we go there master said mopsus i suspect one has to be rather more important than ourselves to receive an invitation to antirrhodus yet here we are with our own room in the palace noted androcles imagine that maybe caesar will take over antirrhodus and make it his headquarters and then mopsus hush youre not to say a word about caesar while were here in the palace dont even mention his name do you understand he frowned then saw the seriousness of my expression and nodded over the last few years back in rome the boys had learned a thing or two about secrecy and espionage he turned his attention back to the harbor some of them are cavalry transports he noted those ships nearest the lighthouse have horses on the decks imagine bringing horses all the way from greece said androcles do you think they might be the very horses that youknowwho used in the battle at pharsalus to trample whatshisname whatshishead you mean mopsus laughed but look more roman soldiers are disembarking from that larger ship onto the smaller one the one that keeps sailing out from the palace to bring them to that landing area over there more soldiers landing area i said how long has this been going on oh for a while said androcles the landing areaa sort of big square on the waterfrontis getting rather full what with all those roman soldiers and egyptian soldiers and that crowd of people in fancy clothes and all those banners and pennants do you think theres going to be some sort of official meeting between the king and well youknowwho that could be him now standing amid the soldiers on that roman galley he squinted hes wearing very fancylooking armor and a big red capelike youknowwho and hes bald like youknowwho the sunlight off his head is blinding me mopsus laughed what are you two going on about i got up from the bed to have a look but before i reached the window there was a loud rap at the door i nodded to rupa who sprang up and pulled the door open merianis stood in the hall rupa widened his eyes then pulled himself erect and squared his impressive shoulders the boys simply gaped merianis wore an extraordinary gown of some sheer green material embroidered with silver threads and cinched beneath her breasts with a silver cord the green matched her eyes as before she wore lapisencrusted sandals and a lapis necklace but the stones took on a very different hue when seen next to the green of her gown the effect together with her ebony skin was quite remarkable can you be ready in half an hour she said ready for what the lord chamberlain suggests that you wear your best i assume theres something suitable in that trunk of yours nothing remotely as fine as what youre wearing but master said mopsus dont you remember before we left the house in rome at the very last moment you decided to bring along your best toga so i did i said a toga would be splendid said merianis the sight of you will make our visitor feel right at home visitor surely youve been watching the assembly gather out on the royal landing the king desires that you should be in attendance when caesar arrives i see i dont suppose i have any choice in the matter none whatsoever ill be back in half an hour to escort you merianis smiled then was gone rupa gave me a look that echoed the question the boys spoke in unison who was that ill explain while i dress i said rupa would you fetch my toga from the trunk it must be in there somewhere lets hope its not too wrinkled androcles mopsus attend me you know the drill the boys had been helping me put on my toga ever since i acquired them except for their inevitable bickering over who should tuck and hold and who should drape and fold they had perfected the art valuable is the slave who has learned to dress a roman citizen in his toga so that he emerges looking like something other than a pile of rumpled wool i had forbidden the boys to speak the name of the man who was about to set foot in alexandria but there was another who was likely to make an appearance that morning and his name the boys already knew better than to utter in my presence at the prospect of greeting the presumptive master of the roman world i felt a curious absence of emotion but my heart sped up and my brow became clammy when i considered that i might within the hour come facetoface with the man i had once called my son how clever the architects of the ptolemies had been generation after generation from without the palace complex appeared grand intimidating and impenetrable yet inside that grandiose edifice one experienced not a sense of chilly containment but the simple pleasures of walking through sunlit passageways and quaint courtyards to the music of birdsong and splashing fountains we might have been strolling through the neatly landscaped gardens and splendidly appointed hallways of some idealized greek villa except that the villa went on and on and on thus ran my thoughts all the better to distract me from what was truly on my mind as i followed merianis the two slave boys and your mute friend seemed crestfallen when i told them they must stay behind she remarked i suspect they simply wanted more time to look at you especially rupa she smiled you look quite splendid yourself i laughed im a gray wrinkled face peering from a gray wrinkled toga i think youre rather distinguished and i think youre rather disingenuous merianis but as long as i stand next to you i dont suppose anyone will notice me anyway is it much farther no in fact we turned a corner and stepped into a patch of sunlight i blinked at the bright blue sky above and felt a fresh sea breeze on my face before us lay a vast stonepaved square thronged with courtiers in ceremonial wigs or colorful headdresses and elaborate robes where the square terminated in steps leading down to the water a long row of roman soldiers stood at attention companies of egyptian soldiers were stationed at each corner of the square and at the very center i saw a canopy with pinkandyellow tassels and knew that ptolemy must be beneath it seated on his throne i assumed we would stay at the edge of the crowd but merianis boldly strode forward when she saw that i hung back she smiled and took my hand and led me like a child toward the gaudy canopy courtiers yielded to her gatherings of eunuchs stepped back to let her pass and even the ring of spearmen who circled the king and his retinue broke ranks to let us through pothinus stood near the king he spotted us and strode over he spoke in a nervous rush at last what took you so long gordianuscalledfinder the king will be relieved he was quite insistent that you be here watch everything say nothing do you understand i nodded and why on earth are the two of you holding hands merianiss fingers disengaged from mine pothinus returned to the kings side there was a blare of trumpets a small boat had pulled up to the steps its occupants disembarked and through the crowd i caught a glimpse of a familiar balding head my heart sped up the roman soldiers formed a cordon leading up to the canopy in the pathway formed by their ranks a small group came striding toward the king foremost among them was caesar himself he was dressed not as imperator in military regalia with a scarlet cape but as a consul of the roman people in a toga with a broad purple border i had last seen him in massilia on the southern coast of gaul on the day his forces entered the city following a lengthy siege caesar himself had been off in spain defeating his enemies there and was on his way back to rome and thence to greece for a direct confrontation with pompey his stop in massilia had been little more than a courtesy call a chance to exhibit his famous penchant for mercy and at the same time to exert beyond question his subjugation of a proud city that had maintained its independence for hundreds of years pressed by circumstance the massilians had sided with pompey against caesar and had lost everything i myself had been trapped in the city during the final days of the siege looking for my son meto who i feared was dead but metos disappearance had merely been part of caesars scheme for taking the city and when caesar made his triumphant appearance meto was at his side beaming with joy in that moment the absurdity of the war and the cruelty of my sons deceit had overwhelmed me instead of embracing meto i had rejected him publicly disowning him before caesar and the world since that moment i had seen neither meto nor caesar though the shadows of both had continually fallen over my life now half a world away from massilia our paths had intersected again when i had seen him last caesar had been flush with victory a warriorgod doling out grim justice to the massilians before heading off to face the greatest challenge of his life he arrived in alexandria fresh from his triumph at pharsalus the undisputed master of the roman world his thin lips were set in a straight line and his jaw was rigid but his eyes sparkled and betrayed an intense enjoyment of the moment his long chin high cheekbones and balding pate gave him an austere appearance but the spring in his step showed the energy of a man half his age to arrive at such a moment must have been one of the supreme accomplishments of caesars long career the sort of grand occasion that painters and sculptors might celebrate for generations to come the master of the worlds new order was about to meet the ruler of the worlds oldest kingdom the new alexander was about to confront the heir of alexander the great in the city alexander himself had founded in caesars countenance i saw a man fully conscious of the moments import and radiant with confidence what of ptolemy the kings expression was more obscure from childhood he must have been taught to make his face a mask suitable to various formal occasionsdedicating temples meting out punishments granting favors conveying the blessings of the godsbut surely there had never been an occasion quite like this one his countenance seemed utterly almost unnaturally devoid of emotion except for an occasional glint in his eye that betrayed the excited boy beneath the crown seated upon his throne clutching the flail and crook crossed over his chest he remained absolutely motionless his stillness befitting a ruler who occupied the unmoving center of the worldexcept for the toes of his left foot while i watched they repeatedly clenched and relaxed against the sole of his jewelencrusted sandal pothinus stepped forward like most romans caesar probably had a distaste for eunuchs but his face betrayed no reaction the eunuch spoke in a voice too low for me to hear no doubt asking caesar how he wished to be introduced and explaining the protocol for approaching the king caesar answered in equally low tones but from the lilt of his voice i discerned that the exchange was in greek it appeared there would be an exchange of gifts caesar raised his hand and gestured for a member of his retinue to step forward i drew a sharp breath as i recognized meto wearing a gleaming breastplate and garbed in full military regalia how young he looks that was the only coherent thought that crossed my mind among many others that could not be put into words i felt a pain in my heart and must have uttered a low cry for merianis gave me a puzzled look and touched my hand meto appeared whole healthy and alert it seemed he had emerged unscathed from the battlegrounds of greece he carried a box made of hammered silver with a bronze clasp in the shape of a lions head he approached the throne with his arms outstretched when he reached the dais he dropped to one knee and bowed his head presenting the box to ptolemy pothinus accepted the box from him opened it briefly to peer inside then smiled meto withdrew i watched him step backward until he disappeared into the retinue behind caesar then turned my gaze again to pothinus who had turned toward the throne and was displaying the opened box so that the king could see the king nodded to show his acceptance of the gift whereupon pothinus removed the item from the box and held it aloft it was a spectacular belt made of thinly hammered pieces of gold in the form of intertwined ivy leaves the golden leaves shimmered and tinkled in the sea breeze there were appreciative murmurs from members of the kings retinue pothinus returned the golden belt to the box handed the box to an underling then approached caesar their voices carried to my ears a beautiful gift consul said pothinus worthy even of his majesty did it come i wonder from the captured possessions of the socalled great one caesars expression barely registered his displeasure at the eunuchs perspicacity actually yes it was among the treasures he abandoned in pharsalus im told that the belt is of royal parthian origin a rare item indeed and that it came into pompeys possession when he conquered mithridates it was one of his longestheld and most prized possessions how fitting pothinus smiled the kings gifts to you also came from pompey one of these items he owned all his life and i daresay he treasured it above all his other possessions caesar wrinkled his brow then the appearance of a small entourage claimed his attention one of those arriving was philip pompeys freedman i had not seen him since we parted company after burning the great ones funeral pyre he did not look like a man mistreated but his demeanor was wan and haggard the first gift consul said pothinus gesturing for philip to step forward caesar frowned while philip was once a slave i believe that pompey made him a free man one roman citizen cannot be given to another as a gift pothinus managed a stiff smile then the gift shall be the pleasure of philips company he is a man of many virtues may he be as loyal to caesar as he was to the roman whom he previously served philip kept his eyes downcast caesar regarded him gravely you were there with him at the end yes consul they say you gave him funeral rites i did what i could consul caesar touched the mans shoulder with a nod he indicated that philip should join the others in his retinue following philip two courtiers bearing gifts stepped forward the courtiers themselves were remarkable one was as black as merianis and shorter than a child with childsized limbs but an old mans face the other was a bonybrowed hollowcheeked albino towering at least a head above the nexttallest man present the tiny one carried a large wicker basket the giant carried an identical basket in miniature the grotesqueness of the presentation was unsettling at least to me others including merianis found the sight of the mismatched courtiers bearing mismatched burdens amusing she laughed aloud pothinus grinned even the king showed the faint indication of a smile the albino giant presented his gift first he held out a long bare bony arm extending the little wicker basket toward caesar it was meto who stepped forward to accept the gift he looked up at the albino as if searching the giants colorless face for signs of deviousness then gave a deferential look to caesar who nodded to indicate that meto should open the basket meto removed the lid gazed inside for a moment frowned then reached into the basket and pulled out a glittering object i remembered the finger missing from pompeys corpsethe bloody stump the swarm of fliesand knew what the object must be even before my eyes discerned the shape of the ring held between metos forefinger and thumb caesar drew a breath then reached out to take the ring from meto he cast a sharp glance at pothinus then at the king few objects are more sacred to a roman than his ring every citizen possesses one as a mark of his status i myself wear a simple band of iron like most romans but those of greater station affect rings of more precious metal with devices and engravings that proclaim their achievements pompeys ring which i had seen in glimpses was of gold and bore the single word magnvs the letters raised in reverse for use as a sealing ring the ring in caesars hand was too far away for me to see in detail but there could be no doubt from the expression that crossed his face that it was pompeys caesar had already learned of pompeys demise but the ring was positive proof of pompeys death under no other circumstance could it have been taken from the great ones finger to be presented as a gift to his rival waves of emotion washed over caesars countenance what did he feel triumph surely for here was tangible proof that the defeat of pompey was complete and irreversible but perhaps also a sense of having been cheated since the fate of pompey had been taken out of his hands and perhaps a bit of anger that a roman of such stature had been deviously done in by foreigners acting under the orders of a foreign king and his most treasured possessions treated with such contempt a ring of citizenship a symbol of the sacred bond between the roman state and its individual members had been reduced to a trophy plundered from a corpse was it being presented to caesar to show the kings esteem or to send another more sinister message caesar looked up from the ring in the palm of his hand and cast a searching gaze at king ptolemy on his throne caesars face was as inscrutable as that of the king who gazed back at him the kings gift is pleasing to caesar said pothinus caesar made no answer for a long moment then said caesar accepts the kings gift ah good but there is another which i daresay will please caesar even more a possession that was even more precious to pompey than his ring pothinus gestured to the black dwarf to step forward the man did so carrying his burden awkwardly the basket was nearly as big as its bearer he set the basket down at caesars feet and then with a flourish removed the lid and reached inside suddenly suspicious caesar stepped back meto stepped forward gripping the pommel of the sword in his scabbard pothinus laughed the dwarf removed the object in the basket and held it aloft one hand clutching it by the hair and the other cupping the stump of the severed neck in a state of excellent preservationfor the egyptians know all there is to know about embalming dead fleshthe head of pompey was exhibited for the perusal of caesar and his company caesar made no attempt to conceal his disgust his lip curled back to show his teeth he averted his eyes for a moment then gazed openly at the head clearly fascinated by it pothinus inclined his head caesar is pleased caesars brow furrowed a tremor of emotion crossed his face his eyes glittered as if suddenly filled with tears pothinus looked from caesar to the head of pompey and back caesar accepts the gift he said uncertainly caesar caesars voice was thick with emotion caesar certainly has no intention of returning this gift into the keeping of those who offer it meto see that the head is returned to the basket and take the basket to my ship so far as can be done have it purified the coin in the mouth and the rest honorably as he averted his eyes once again from the head and also from pothinus caesars gaze chanced to fall upon me perhaps it was the toga i was wearing that caught his attention the curiosity of a roman in formal dress amid the throng of egyptian courtiers piqued his interest he studied my face and for a moment gave no sign of acknowledgment then he exhibited that curious mixture of recognition and doubt that occurs when one sees a familiar face wildly out of contextfor surely gordianus the finder was the last person he expected to see standing among king ptolemys retinue meto was busy collecting the head of pompey but when he passed by caesar still looking at me touched his arm and spoke into his ear i caught the merest glimpse of motion as meto began to turn his head toward me on a sudden impulse i stepped back into the crowd obscuring the line of sight between caesars party and myself but i could still see merianis her posture was erect her expression rapt as she gazed steadily in the direction of caesars party her eyes locked with those of another i knew at once what had happened in my absence metos gaze had fallen on merianis instead for her at leastto judge by her expressionthe moment was significant chapter xii when alexander was fifteen by chance he passed the place where the wild horse bucephalus was caged he heard a terrifying neigh and asked the attendants what is that bloodcurdling noise the young general ptolemy replied master this is the horse bucephalus that your father the king caged because the beast is a vicious maneater no one can tame him let alone ride him no man can even approach him safely alexander walked to the cage and spoke the name of the horse bucephalus hearing alexanders voice neighed again not in a terrifying way as on every previous occasion but sweetly and clearly when alexander stepped closer straightaway the horse extended its forefeet to alexander and licked his hand recognizing the master that the gods had decreed for him whereupon alexander what happens next asked mopsus sitting on the windowsill and gazing out at the harbor both of the boys seemed endlessly fascinated by the doings on caesars ships the comings and goings of the merchant vessels and the everchanging play of shadows across the face of the lighthouse from the abstracted tone of his voice it was clear that mopsuss question was not about the narrative i had been reading aloud in his lap purring loudly sat a gray cat with green eyes around his neck the beast sported a collar of solid silver hung with tiny beads of lapis marking him as a sacred ward of the palace the cat came and went as he pleased mopsus and androcles had become quite attached to him and kept scraps of food at hand to lure him to their laps when he deigned to visit us several days had passed since caesars arrival during that time we had been allowed to move freely about the part of the palace that included our rooms our meals were served in a common area where a number of lesser courtiers ate they kept to themselves and said little to me merianis looked in on us every so often assuring me that the king had not forgotten me and letting me know subtly but surely that while i was officially a guest not a prisoner i was not to abandon my rooms at the palace nonetheless i was allowed to leave the palace and go about the city as long as i returned by nightfall but those excursions had grown increasingly problematic alexandria was a city in tumult every day since caesars arrival in some part of the city there had been rioting some of the riots were small and easily dispersed by the kings guards others were like whirlwinds that swept through entire quarters bringing arson looting and death in the bloodiest incident a company of roman soldiers on a friendly reconnaissance from the palace to the temple of serapis had been ambushed and stoned to death eradicated to the last man despite the fact that they wore armor and carried swords the fury of an alexandrian mob is a terrifying thing i myself while out and about in the city had not been caught in any dangerous situations but i had seen plumes of smoke and come close enough to some of the disturbances to hear the din of soldiers clashing with rioters my accent was distinctly roman and even the simplest request for directions from a stranger might elicit a hateful glare and a gob of spit at my feet rupa who had lived in alexandria for many years and still had friends in the city fared better but i found it awkward to depend on a mute in every encounter the boys knew hardly any greek and no egyptian and seemed likely to get themselvesand meinto trouble at any moment and so in recent days we had taken to staying mostly in our rooms exchanging words with hardly anyone except merianis and receiving no other visitorsexcept of course the gray cat that was now curled so contently on mopsuss lap what happens next mopsuss query echoed in my head i sat back against the cushions on my bed and put down the scroll from which i had been reading merianis who had access to the famous library adjacent to the palace complex with its volumes had kept me well supplied with reading material that morning she had brought me a copy of a book i had read as a boy but had never since been able to locate in rome the wondrous deeds of alexander by kleitarchos reading aloud helped to pass the time and i had hoped that the dashing tales of alexander would prove especially diverting to rupa and the boys who badly needed diversion for we were all growing restless but even the grand achievements of the conqueror seemed to pale in comparison with the events taking place around us i put down the scroll and took a deep breath we had discussed the uncertain situation in alexandria many times during the last several days but the boys seemed to find reassurance in repetition what happens next hard to say caesars ships effectively control the harbor and he probably has more ships on the way so is he going to sack alexandria asked androcles whose eyes lit up at the prospect of mass destruction he took a seat opposite his brother on the windowsill removed the cat from mopsuss lap and placed it on his own the beast emitted a halfhearted mew of complaint then resumed purring more loudly than before some of the alexandrians seem to think so i said but i dont believe thats his intention caesar is here to play peacemaker not warmonger this conflict between king ptolemy and queen cleopatra needs to be settled once and for all for romes sake as well as egypts the piper had other children as wellanother daughter called arsinoe whos younger than cleopatra but older than ptolemy and another son the youngest who likewise bears his fathers name but those two were left out of the late kings will and seem not to figure much in the conflict if the royal siblings are incapable of settling their familial dispute caesar will act as arbiter his reward will be stability in egypt which will eventually allow for repayment of the debts owed to rome by the previous king and the resumption of a reliable grain supply from egypt to feed the hungry citizens back in rome so king ptolemy wants him here said mopsus whether he wants caesar here or not ptolemy may not feel strong enough to expel him and if he can win caesar over to his side that could help to secure the victory over cleopatra that has so far eluded him so hes given caesar a royal welcome and handed over a whole precinct of the palace where caesars taken up residence and placed his own guards at key points all around the perimeter said androcles merianis says that the egyptians are calling that part of the palace little rome and that the women are afraid to go there because they think the roman soldiers will molest them why arent we staying in little rome master along with the other romans because almost certainly we would not be given a room with nearly as good a view of the harbor i said giving him a sardonic smile in fact since their arrival and installation in the palace neither caesar nor meto had contacted me nor had i attempted to contact them my turn to hold alexander mopsus announced alexander i said the cat thats his new name we couldnt pronounce his egyptian name so merianis said we could give him a new one and we decided to call him alexander and its my turn to hold him mopsus took the beast from his brothers lap and placed it in his own do you think caesar keeps pompeys head on a nightstand next to his bed i laughed out loud really mopsus i think that might give even caesar bad dreams but it does raise a question why did king ptolemy give him the head in the first place because he thought it would make caesar happy said mopsus isnt that why anyone gives anyone else a present not necessarily i said a gift can be a kind of warning fortune is fickle and caesar is no more immortal than pompey was i think caesar knows deep down that it could just as easily have been his head in a wicker basket down on the landing that day being lugged about and offered as a trophy i think the king and his advisers wanted to remind caesar of that fact even as they pretended to flatter him by handing over the sad remains of his rival caesar is liable to lose his head if he so much as dares to step foot outside the palace noted androcles yes the streets are unsafe even for armed men i noted unsafe perhaps even for a god which supposedly is why you forbid us to go wandering about the city on our own said androcles sulking you always allowed us to go out in rome even in the worst of times thats not entirely true i said besides you both know rome like the back of your hands if theres a riot in the forum you know all the places to duck and hide but this is your first visit to alexandria you know nothing about the city or the people you dont even know the language youre likely to get lost or kidnapped by some bedouin slaver or get into gods know what kind of trouble and if that were to happen i very nearly said if that were to happen bethesda would never forgive me mopsus saw the shadow that crossed my face and gave his brother a glare as if to say stop your childish sulking see how youve upset the master rupa meanwhile watched the whole exchange in silence and without expression but i was learning that he missed very little of an emotional nature that occurred around him and to bring us all out of the moment he gestured to the scroll in my lap and indicated that i should recommence reading aloud i cleared my throat fiddled with the scroll and searched for the place where i had left off ah here it is straightaway the horse extended its forefeet to alexander and licked his hand recognizing the master that the gods had decreed for him whereupon alexander there was a rap at the door merianis had visited us already that morning and i had no reason to expect her again and the knock sounded different from hers louder and more insistent alexander the cat sprang from mopsuss lap onto the floor rupa see who it is cautiously he opened the door then stepped back to admit an armed egyptian the guard was no common soldier but dressed in the regalia of the royal retinue the cat ran between the mans legs and out the door the guard gazed about the room casting suspicious glances at rupa and the boys then stepped through the curtain into their room a moment later he returned and uttered something in egyptian to another guard in the hallway outside that guard nodded then stepped aside to allow pothinus to enter the room the lord chamberlain studied each of us in turn then walked to the window mopsus instinctively ceded his place at the sill pothinus gazed at the view for a moment then turned to me i told them to give you a decent room but i had no idea youd been installed in chambers with such a spectacular view of the harbor i hope you appreciate that gordianuscalledfinder there are visiting diplomats here in the palace who have quarters with views not nearly as impressive im grateful for the kings largesse pothinus nodded and your meals have been adequate more than adequate lord chamberlain rupa and the boys shall grow fat if they continue to eat all the food made available to them especially if they do nothing but sit in this room all day but you must have taken some excursions theres so much for a visitor to see in alexandria the pharos lighthouse the library the museum with its worldfamous faculty of astronomers and mathematicians the temple of serapis the tomb of alexander on the day we went to see the lighthouse a disturbance closed the heptastadion when we went to see the temple of serapis a riot broke out on the canopic way when we went to see the tomb of alexander we were told it was closed to ordinary visitors on that day for security purposes yes yes i see your point these are unsettled days in the city he shrugged all part of the rich fabric of alexandrian life im sure you recall from the days when you yourself lived here that the alexandrians are a passionate and highly demonstrative people they appear to have very strong feelings indeed about caesars presence in the city there is a certain element of the population who act out of fear and misunderstanding they believe the rumors that caesar has come to declare egypt a roman province and that the king intends to allow such a thing they dont understand that caesar is a guest of the king i smiled a guest whose room has an even better view than mine perhaps youd like to see for yourself said pothinus as a matter of fact thats why ive called on you this morning caesar is aware of your presence in the palace hes requested me to invite you to dine with him in his chambers this evening i stared at the scroll in my hands i rolled it into a tight cylinder and made no response the invitation displeases you said pothinus who else will be present at this dinner its not a diplomatic function no egyptians will be present only romans beyond that i know nothing except that caesar stressed the informality of the affair i suppose it may be limited to his inner circle his inner circle i repeated dully pothinus studied me closely it was your son who presented the golden belt to the king wasnt it and later the same young officer collected the head of pompey on caesars behalf that young officer is named meto at one time he was my son but no longer of course shall i relay to caesar your desire that meto should not be present if youre to dine with him im hardly in a position to dictate his choice of dinner companions to gaius julius caesar besides i have no desire to dine with caesar under any circumstances that seems rather ungracious of you gordianuscalledfinder ungracious how so caesar is not my host ah yes your host is king ptolemyand i can assure you that it would be most pleasing to your host if you did accept this invitation i felt a prickling across the back of my neck from too many similar experiences in recent years i sensed the drift of pothinuss insinuation when he might have had me killed king ptolemy had spared my life he had done me the tremendous honor of allowing me to enter alexandria on his royal barge he had given me accommodations far above my station in return he had asked almost nothing of meuntil now caesar wished to dine with me the king would be pleased if i would accept that invitation and what would the king expect afterwards a report on caesars state of mind a precis of the conversation the names and ranks of those present at the dinner and any opinions they might have expressed and if i decline the invitation surely gordianuscalledfinder you wont do that here you are far from home arriving in egypt at a time of great uncertainly even peril with three young charges depending for their very survival upon your judgment and by the most amazing happenstance you find yourself under the protection of the king of egypt himself now caesar as another of the kings guests has asked a favor of his majestythat you should dine with caesarand the king eager to demonstrate his beneficent hospitality desires that you should do so short of some terrible accident or a sudden grave illness threatening you or one of your young charges i cannot imagine any reason why you should refuse can you gordianuscalledfinder the eunuchs bland expression defied me to detect any threat whatsoever in his words i shook my head no of course not i have no reason to deny caesar the pleasure of my company what time shall i be ready chapter xiii it was merianis who came for me that evening she stood in the doorway and looked me up and down a very handsome tunic she said dark blue suits you and the yellow border in that seahorse pattern is very fashionable but wouldnt your toga be more suitable i had to laugh for a private dinner in this climate i think not does this mean that youll be accompanying me only as far as the roman frontier she said jokingly referring to the romanoccupied quarters of the palace once i hand you over to the border guards my job is done too bad a man always feels more confident arriving with a beautiful woman on his arm but i dont suppose therell be any women present on this occasion no women have been invited she said she seemed to speak with some double meaning but i could not imagine what very well merianis if you approve my appearance then i suppose im ready rupa look after the boys stay out of trouble you two we traversed torchlit corridors jasminescented gardens and courtyards adorned with greek statues and egyptian obelisks merianis put her hand on my arm its sweet the way you fuss over them the boys and rupa as well as if he were your child technically he is my son by adoption i see you took him on as a sort of replacement she left the sentence unfinished no i took him into my care because that was the desire of his late sister a stipulation of her will it had nothing at all to do with she nodded will meto be there tonight i said i think not pothinus conveyed your sentiments to caesar nonetheless with or without meto caesar still wishes to dine with you i sighed heavily i suppose i shall get through the evening somehow one sits one eats one forces a modicum of polite conversation time passes and eventually the evening is over and one may leave do you dread this meeting with caesar as much as that i should love to meet him theres no man in the world more famous or ever likely to be they say he casts a shadow even over alexanders accomplishments to be allowed to say just a few words to him would be unable to find adequate words she exhibited an exaggerated shiver instead i looked at her sidelong and wondered how many men in the world given the choice would desire to spend an evening with caesar rather than with merianis my only hope is that the evening will be relatively uneventful and that caesar wont spring any surprises on me she raised an eyebrow i shouldnt worry about surprises coming from that direction what do you mean she smiled dont men usually enjoy surprises that depends upon the man upon the surprise merianis why do you keep flashing that coy smile i suppose im in a very good mood tonight and why is that ah but here we are at the gates of little rome we had entered a courtyard in what must have been one of the older sections of the palace for the stonework and statuary were noticeably more worn by time the doorway through which we had just stepped was flanked by egyptian guards with spears flanking the doorway on the opposite side of the courtyard stood their roman counterparts at our approach the roman guards exchanged a glance that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with merianis they liked what they saw this is gordianuscalledfinder she said your master is expecting him the senior of the guards snorted were romans we dont have a master your imperator then the guard glanced at me then looked merianis up and down but whos expecting you my sweet dont be impertinent i snapped this woman is a priestess in the royal temple of the goddess isis the guard looked at me warily i meant no disrespect then stop wasting our time were you not told to expect me we were then take me to caesar at once the guard ceded his place to another stationed inside the door and indicated that i should follow him i glanced over my shoulder at merianis who flashed a last mysterious smile as i stepped around a corner and lost sight of her this part of the palace was only a short walk away from the rooms i occupied and yet i seemed to have stepped into another world no longer were there whispering courtiers passing in hallways with the sound of sandaled footsteps and the rustle of long linen gowns leaving the scents of chrysanthemum oil and rosewater in their wake or the bustle of royal slaves going to and fro full of selfimportance or the mysterious sounds of music and laughter coming from inaccessible chambers across moonlit courtyards instead i found myself in the brusque entirely masculine atmosphere of a roman military camp i smelled fish stew heard peals of crude laughter and felt rough hands searching for concealed weapons in my tunic as i passed through one checkpoint after another in one of the larger courtyards tents had been set up to provide the soldiers with accommodations priceless statues of osiris and serapis loomed incongruously above legionnaires lounging in their undergarments sitting crosslegged and tossing sheepbone dice on the ancient mosaic floor eventually the guard passed me into the keeping of a senior officer who apologized profusely for any indignities i might have suffered and assured me that his imperator was eager to welcome me with all possible attention to my comfort we ascended a very long flight of steps then turned about and ascended more steps the officer saw that i was slightly winded and paused for a bit then we ascended yet more stairs at the end of a long colonnaded corridor tall bronze doors swung open the officer showed me inside then discreetly vanished the room was stunning the floor was of dark green marble striated with veins of deep purple and rust orange columns of the same extraordinary marblei had never seen anything like itsupported a ceiling of massive beams painted gold and inlaid with crisscrossing ebony and ivory tesserae here and there rugs with designs of dizzying complexity were thrown on the floor surrounded by massive pieces of furnituretripod tables that appeared to be made of solid silver and chairs and couches inlaid with precious stones and strewn with plump cushions of some shimmering iridescent fabric illumination came from a dozen or more silver lamps hung by chains from the ceiling each lamp was fashioned in the shape of four ibises flying in different directions with the tips of their spread wings touching and points of flame flickering from their open beaks the light was diffused softly and evenly throughout the room creating an atmosphere of ease and relaxation that muted the magnificence of the appointments starlight and moonlight entered through tall windows that opened to views on all four sides of the room the windows were framed by curtains of green linen hemmed with silver threads i walked to the nearest window which faced south and looked out on a panorama of tiled roofs hanging gardens and obelisks with lake mareotis in the background its still black face a mirror full of stars gordianus in spite of all my entreaties to that wretched eunuch i still wasnt sure youd come i turned about and saw that caesar sat in a corner of the room with a coverlet draped over his shoulders so that only his head was showing behind him stood a slave in a green tunic fussily wielding a comb and a pair of scissors i hope you dont mind gordianus but im not quite done having my hair cut ive been so busy lately that ive rather neglected my grooming samuel here is the best barber in the known world a jew from antioch i conquered gaul i bested pompey but theres one enemy against whom i find myself powerless this damned bald spot its invincible relentless merciless every month more hairs are lost the line of battle falls back and the bald spot claims a wider territory but if one cannot defeat an enemy sometimes one can rob him of the trappings of victory at least only samuel knows the secret of holding this enemy at bay he cuts and combs my hair just so and eureka no one would ever know that my bald spot has grown so large i raised an eyebrow tempted to disagree from where i stood the shiny spot was glaringly visible but if caesar believed that combing a few strands of hair over his naked pate created the illusion of a full head of hair who was i to disabuse him of the notion there all done announced samuel the barber was a tiny fellow and had to stand upon a block of wood to reach caesars head he stepped off the block put aside his instruments pulled the coverlet from caesars shoulders and gave it a shake i saw with some relief that caesar was dressed as informally as i was in a long saffroncolored tunic loosely belted at the waist he looked quite slender meto had once told me that caesar could boast that he still had the waistline he had possessed at thirty while pompeys waistline had doubled with age perhaps youd care to avail yourself of samuels services said caesar you are looking a bit ragged if you dont mind my saying so in addition to cutting hair samuel is also quite adept at tweezing unwanted hair from the nostrils or ears or from any other part of the body that requires depilation thank you for the offer imperator but ill pass as you wish off with you then samuel tell the servers that i shall take dinner presently on the terrace i think he turned his gaze to me no need to address me as a military commander gordianus my mission to egypt is peaceful i come as consul of the roman people i nodded very well consul he began to cross the room i followed then stopped in my tracks as my gaze fell upon a lifesized nude statue of venus that stood in one corner the statue was breathtaking so lifelike and full of sensuality that the marble appeared to breath the flesh of the venus looked warm not cold her lips seemed ready to speak or to kiss her eyes stared searchingly into my own her countenance seemed at once serene and brimming with passion in rome latterday copies of such masterpieces are strewn about the gardens of the rich and stuck here and there on public buildings like so many poppy seeds sprinkled on a custard but a copy is never the same as an original and this was clearly not a copy it could only have been fashioned by the hand of one the great greek masters of the golden age caesar saw my reaction and joined me in front of the venus impressive isnt she ive never seen her equal i admitted nor have i im told she was once the property of alexander himself and it was he who installed her in the very first royal palace built in alexandria can you imagine alexander looked upon her face and she looked upon the face of alexander i said gazing once more into the statues eyes and feeling irrationally flummoxed that i should be the first to blink and look away caesar nodded upon alexanders death egypt devolved upon his general ptolemy and this statue became an heirloom of the new royal family do you know i thought when i first stepped into this roomknowing that king ptolemy had chosen it for my personal quartersi thought that this statue had been brought here especially to impress me to make me feel at home since venus is my ancestor but if you look at the way the pedestal fits against the floor its obvious that shes occupied this room for a very long time perhaps for generations so it seems that the guest was fitted to the room and not the room to the guest he smiled and if you look very closelyhere gordianus step closer she wont biteyou can see that theres a very fine very slightly discolored line around her neck do you see i frowned yes the head must have been broken off at some point then reattached exactly and when i noticed that i had to wonder did that wretched eunuch give me this room because he knows that venus is my ancestor and he wished to flatter me or did he install me here so as to give me yet another notsosubtle reminder that anyoneeven a deitycan lose a head i took my eyes from the venus and stepped toward another of the windows this one faced east in the direction of the jewish quarter in the open region beyond the city walls i discerned the meandering course of the canal that led toward canopus and the nile beyond you have spectacular views you should see them in the daytime the harbor on one side the lake on the otherits hard to imagine a more ideal location for a city one can see why alexander thought that he might someday rule the whole world from this spot once he finished conquering it but he never had the chance i said before he could enjoy the fruits of his conquests he died a stillness filled the room even the venus seemed to hold her breath taken aback to hear words of evil omen the evening is warm caesar said shall we dine outside on the terrace overlooking the harbor i followed him onto the flagstone terrace which was lit by braziers set upon bronze tripods with lions feet he took one couch and i took the other the moonlight upon the lighthouse skewed my sense of perspective and created the illusion that the tower was a miniature replica and that if i were to reach out beyond the balustrade i might lay my hand upon it i looked to the west where a massive structure rose even higher than the room in which caesar was installed whats over there thats the theater which presents a steep wall toward the town and opens to the harbor to which it has access its directly adjacent to this building the space between is quite narrow and could easily be fortified fortified yes with stones piledup rubble that sort of thing ive been thinking that the theater could serve very nicely as a citadel easily defended from attack on the landward side open for reinforcements from the sea do you anticipate the need for such a stronghold officially no but assessing the lay of the land has become second nature to me wherever i go i look for strongholds points of weakness hiding places overlooks he smiled i arrived here in egypt with a relatively small force gordianus hardly more than an honor guard but a small number of welltrained men can hold their own against far greater numbers if their position is carefully chosen will there be warfare in the city then not if warfare can possibly be avoided but one must be prepared for all eventualities especially in a place as volatile as alexandria i see there appear to be only two couches here on the terrace is it only the two of us for dinner why not since my arrival in alexandria this will be the first night ive dined with anyone whos not a military man a diplomat a eunuch or a spy i stiffened at the last word caesar fixed me with a sardonic gaze i am right am i not gordianus youre not a eunuch are you he laughed i did my best to laugh with him he clapped his hands a moment later the first course arrived a platter of tilapia fish in a saffron brine the server was apparently caesars taster as well as he was displaying the dish for his masters approval he whispered absolutely delicious caesar smiled this meal is an indulgence for me gordianus pothinus has been quite stingy with apportioning rations to my men claiming shortages in the city though it seems to me that the kings courtiers are quite well fed but as long as the eunuch starves my men i eat what they eatexcept on a special occasion such as this caesar ate with relish i had little appetite i still dont understand why you wished to see me i said gordianus you act as if i summoned you here with the intention of interrogating you i merely asked pothinus to convey an invitation to dinner so that we could talk about what you gave me a bit of a start that day on the landing when i saw you among the kings retinue before i could point you out to meto you vanished later i asked pothinus and he confirmed that it was indeed gordianus the finder i had seen wearing a toga and standing by that extraordinary female im curious to know how you came to be in alexandria did you not ask pothinus i did but i have no reason to believe anything that eunuch tells me i should prefer to hear the truth from you i dropped any pretense of interest in the tilapia and gazed at the lighthouse i came to egypt with my wife bethesda she was ill she desired to bathe in the nile believing its waters would cure her instead she was lost in the river caesar gestured for the slave to remove the fish then its true pothinus told me as much you have my sympathy gordianus i know from meto how dearly you loved your wife he was silent for a moment you must understand that this puts me in a delicate position meto doesnt yet realize that youre here in alexandria no but that day on the landing i saw you speak to him just after you recognized me he turned to look in my direction and saw no one except of course that extraordinary female who was suddenly standing all alone because you had disappeared i never mentioned your name i merely asked meto to take a look at the man in the toga and tell me if my eyes deceived me when he looked and saw no man in a toga i let the matter dropyou may recall that i was rather busy with another small matter exchanging greetings with the king of egypt later meeting privately with pothinuswithout metoi inquired about you and pothinus gave me an account of your arrival in egypt i saw no point in passing the tale on thirdhand to meto at least not until i could speak to you in person as a result meto remains unaware that youre in alexandria and he knows nothing of the tragic news about your wifeand it hardly seems fitting that i should tell him when youre here surely the sad news should come from his father my heart jumped in my chest you didnt invite him to come here tonight did you no meto doesnt know with whom im dining tonight only that i asked to be given complete privacy he laughed perhaps he thinks im having a liaison with that extraordinary female her name is merianis i said caesar smiled as a rule i prefer to keep meto close to me at all times he maintains the official diary of all my comings and goingswithout his notes id find it impossible to write my memoirsbut i do occasionally draw a breath or eat a meal without him your son wont be joining us tonight i felt a pain in my chest please dont refer him as my son caesar shook his head gordianus the war has been very hard on you hasnt it youre rather like cicero in that way you thrived during the old days when everyone was dragging everyone else into the courts bending laws to punish their political enemies flinging reckless accusations and casting dust in the jurors eyes now all that has changed things shall never be the same i fear that the times we live in no longer suit you youve become discontented disgruntledbitter evenbut you shouldnt take it out on poor meto ah the second course has arrived hearts of palm in spiced olive oil perhaps youll like this dish more than you did the tilapia caesar ate i stared at the food he had touched on a point that had been troubling my sleep ever since i had seen meto on the landing bethesda had not been kin to meto by blood any more than i was but in every way that mattered she had been a mother to him meto would have to be told of her loss he would want to know exactly what happened he might have questions that only i could answer doubts that only i could assuage did he not deserve to be told the facts by me facetoface caesar took a sip of wine perhaps we should talk of something else i understand that you witnessed the end of pompey and that you even helped to build his funeral pyre did philip tell you that yes i suppose you had him thoroughly interrogated after pothinus delivered him to you as a gift that was an unfortunate moment as a member of pompeys householdas a renegade and an enemy of the roman peoplephilip should have been delivered to me in a more discreet fashion along with any other prisoners of war but ive treated him with great respect he was never interrogated in the sense that you suggest i myself talked to him at length in private as you and i are talking now surely he told you everything you might wish to know about pompeys final days philip was revealing about some things reticent about others since you were there i should very much like to hear the tale from your lips why so that you can gloat or to help you avoid the same fate at the hands of your egyptian hosts his expression darkened when i looked upon pompeys head i wept he should never have met such an ignominious end he should have been slaughtered by roman arms you mean rather than egyptian i would have preferred that he die in battle yes rather than by trickery so that you might claim the glory of killing him im sure that death in battle would have been his preference as well but pompey had his chance to die fighting at pharsalus instead he fled the end he met was gruesome but quick how many of the men you send into battle die as cleanly and as quickly consul and for how many of those men do you weep you cant possibly weep for them all or else youd never be done weeping he looked at me coolly betraying neither anger nor offense i think he was unused to being spoken to in such a way and was not sure what to make of it perhaps he thought i was a little mad there are other matters we might discuss gordianus for example during my absence from rome my wife has kept me abreast of events in the city calpurnia wrote me a particularly interesting letter about the scrape you got into when milo and caelius tried to rouse the people against me she also told me the details of your involvement with that remarkable young woman called cassandra i gathered from pothinus that another of your purposes in coming to egypt was to allow cassandras brother to scatter her ashes in the nile yes that was done on the same day that bethesda was lost what a dreadful day that must have been for you i can only imagine the grief you must have felt given the special bond that developed between you and cassandra but im glad that my wife was able to facilitate the disposal of cassandras belongings after her death i understand that calpurnia took special care to see that you accepted rupa into your household and that you received the full amount of the bequest cassandra intended for you this was the caesar i knew the consummate politician with an unerring ability to find an adversarys weakness with the aim to either disarm or destroy him caesar had no need to destroy me but if he could disarm my animosity by appealing to my emotions and win me over to his side he would his behavior toward me that evening had been above reproach yet he had managed to prick at the guilt i felt for avoiding meto and now in a single stroke he was reminding me of the link that cassandra formed between us and also of the special favor his wife calpurnia had shown me following cassandras death performing these subtle verbal manipulations came as second nature to him perhaps he was hardly aware of what he was doing yet i felt his words acutely cassandra was many things he said his voice wistful beautiful gifted amazingly intelligent i can well understand how you came to desire her admire her perhaps even love her i had rather not talk about her not here not with you he studied me for a long moment why not with whom else could you ever talk about cassandra except with me you and i have seen much of the world gordianus we two are survivors there are so many things we could talk about we should be friends not enemies i still dont know what i ever did to offend you i took your son into my confidence i elevated him to a status far above that to which most freedmen could ever dream to aspire your sons course in life has thus far been one glorious ascent thanks to my largesse and his own strong spirit you should be thankful to me and proud of him i dont know what to make of you meto is equally baffled every roman desires to please his father and meto is no different your estrangement causes him great pain enough of this caesar must you win every argument must every man in the world give you his love and devotion i wont do it i cant i see the mess the likes of you and pompey have made of the world and i feel not love but a deep loathing my son loves you caesar with all his heart and soul and with his body as well or so the gossips insist is that not enough for you i stared at caesar who stared back me speechless then both of us in the same instant felt the presence of another we turned our heads in unison meto stood in the doorway chapter xiv father whispered meto he was dressed for duty in gleaming armor with a short cape and a sword in a scabbard at his waist the rigors of war agreed with him he looked very lean and fit he was a man of thirtyone now but he still looked boyish to me and perhaps always would his broad handsome face was dark from the sun his deep tan highlighted the battle scars scattered here and there on his bare arms and legs whenever i met him after a long separation i counted those scars fearful of finding new ones i saw none he had emerged from the greek campaign and the battle of pharsalus without a scratch i made no reply caesar frowned meto what are you doing here i told you i was not to be disturbed metos eyes traveled back and forth between us i looked away unable to bear the confusion on his face at last caesars question seemed to penetrate his consciousness you said you were not to be disturbed imperator except under one condition caesars face lit up his eyes glittered as if reflecting the beacon of the pharos a message from the queen at last not just a message but a messenger bearing a gift where is he just outside this room a big strapping fellow named apollodorus he claims that the gift he bears comes from the queen herself a gift a rug rolled up and carried in his arms caesar sat back and pressed his palms together who is this apollodorus what do we know about him according to our intelligence hes sicilian by birth how he came to alexandria and entered the service of queen cleopatra we dont know but he seems to have become her constant companion a bodyguard the chatter among the palace coterie loyal to ptolemy is that apollodorus is more than a bodyguard to the queen he is an impressive specimen even so i think we must discount such innuendos as vicious gossip suggested caesar who himself had been the target of whispering campaigns throughout his political career meto nodded nevertheless apollodorus seems never to leave the queens side he goes with her everywhere meto nodded i see how did this fellow get into the palace he claims he rowed a small boat up to a secluded landing on the waterfront disembarked with his rug and made his way through the palace how he got past ptolemys guard i dont knowhe obviously knows his way around the palace and the place is said to be full of secret passages he appeared at the roman checkpoint handed over a nastylooking dagger and allowed himself to be searched then told the guards that the rug he carried was a gift from the queen who had instructed him to present it to no one but yourself in person i see it must be very fine rug indeed i wish to see it show him in when meto moved to obey caesar turned to me youd dont mind the interruption do you gordianus our dinner conversation wasnt going all that smoothly anyway perhaps i should leave its up to you but do you really want to miss the next few moments the presentation of a rug not just any rug gordianus but a gift from queen cleopatra herself king ptolemyor more accurately that eunuch pothinushas done everything possible in recent days to seal the palace and to prevent anyone who might represent the queen from approaching me courtiers loyal to cleopatra have been apprehended the messages they carried confiscated and destroyed and the courtiers themselves summarily executed ive protested to the kinghow dare he intercept messages addressed to the consul of the roman peoplebut to no avail the king wants me to hear only one side of this argument between himself and his sister but i should very much like to meet her one hears such fascinating things about cleopatra marc antony met her some years ago when he helped to restore her father to the throne and he said the most curious thing i nodded i think he must have said the same thing to me despite the fact that she was then only fourteen years oldabout the age her brother is nowthere was some quality about her that reminded antony of you caesar smiled can you imagine i looked at caesar a man of fiftytwo with wisps of hair combed over his bald spot a strong determined jaw and a hard calculating glint in his eyes slightly softened by that veil of worldweariness that falls over men who have seen too much of life not really i confessed nor can i but what man could resist meeting a younger incarnation of himself especially an incarnation of the opposite gender its my understanding that cleopatra is an incarnation of isis caesar looked at me archly some philosophers postulate that isis is actually the egyptian manifestation of the greek aphrodite who is also the roman venusmy ancestor the world is a small place if cleopatra is isis and isis is venus then there appears to be a family connection indeed a divine connection between queen cleopatra and myself i smiled uncertainly was he serious or merely indulging in a bit of fancy wordplay the look on his face was anything but whimsical imperator meto appeared in the doorway he studiously kept his eyes from meeting mine i present apollodorus a servant of cleopatra who bears a gift from her majesty meto moved aside to permit a tall imposing figure to step forward apollodorus was darkly handsome with a great mane of black hair swept back from his forehead and a neatly trimmed black beard he wore a very brief sleeveless tunic that left bare his long muscular legs and arms his biceps were bisected by veins that protruded above the straining muscles as he held aloft a rolledup rug i remembered all the steps i had ascended to reach the room the flesh of apollodorus was sleek with sweat from the exertion of carrying his burden but his breath was unlabored the rug was bound with slender rope in three places to keep it from unfurling apollodorus knelt and set it gently on the floor queen cleopatra welcomes gaius julius caesar to the city of alexandria he said speaking in latin with an ungainly accent that suggested he had memorized the phrase by rote in greek to meto he said if i may have back my knife so that i might cut the cords ill do that myself said caesar meto pulled his sword from its scabbard and handed it to caesar caesar poked the sharp point against a strand of rope apollodorus gasped please caesar be careful is the rug not mine said caesar he smiled at meto am i not a man who knows the value of things you are imperator agreed meto and am i ever careless with the things that are mine never imperator very well then caesar deftly cut the three strands of rope then stepped back to allow apollodorus to unfurl the rug as the rug was unrolled it became obvious that there was something inside itnot merely an object but something alive and moving i stepped back and let out a gasp then saw that caesar and meto smiled they were not entirely surprised at the sight of queen cleopatra as she rolled forth from the carpet and rose to her feet in a single fluid motion the rolled rug had given no evidence of the prize it concealed it seemed impossible that its folds could contain a personage who loomed as large in imagination as cleopatra but the immensity of the image conjured by her name was curiously out of scale with the actual physical embodiment of the woman herself indeed she seemed hardly a woman at all but very much a girl small and slender with petite hands and feet her hair was pulled back and tied in a bun at the nape of her neckno doubt the most efficient way of styling it for travel inside a rug it also allowed her to wear a simple diadem set far back on her head a uraeus crown that featured not a rearing cobra but a sacred vultures head her dark blue gown covered her from her neck to her ankles and was belted with golden sashes around her waist and below her bosom small she might be but her figure was not girlish the ampleness of her hips and breasts would have pleased the sculptor of the venus that had so impressed me earlier her face might have captivated a master sculptor as well she was not the most beautiful of young womenbethesda in her prime had been more beautiful and so had cassandrabut there was something intriguing about her large strong features queen cleopatra had one of those faces that becomes more fascinating the longer one looks at it for it seemed to change in some subtle way each time the light shifted or whenever she moved her head she stood erect squared her shoulders and gave a shudder as if to shake loose the last vestige of her confinement in the rug she reached behind her head and undid the knots in her hair shaking it loose and letting it fall past her shoulders but keeping the diadem in place she raised her arms and ran her fingers through the tangles i glanced at caesar and meto they appeared as captivated by her as i was especially caesar what manner of creature was this who had risked capture and death to smuggle herself into caesars presence and now stood before three strangers preening herself as unselfconsciously as a cat she looked at us one by one the sight of meto evidently pleased her for she spent a long moment appraising him from head to foot i was less interesting to her her gaze turned to caesar and remained upon him the look they exchanged was of such an intensity that all else in the room seemed to fade i sensed that i had become a shadow to them caesar smiled meto what do you think of queen cleopatras present beware of greeks bearing gifts meto quoted i assumed he was making a joke facetiously comparing the queens rug to the trojan horse but when i glanced at his face i saw that he did not smile the queen ignored these comments she assumed a formal stance one foot before the other with her head tilted slightly back and her arms spread in a gracious gesture her latin was flawless and without accent welcome to alexandria gaius julius caesar welcome to my palace her palace i heard meto mutter caesar shot him a sharp look then spoke to me my apologies gordianus i had intended that you and i should dine at our leisure tonight sharing our thoughts but one never knows when a matter of state will arise as it has however unconventionally this evening no need to apologize i said ive been a poor guest my conversation was as weak as my appetite ill leave you now i strode from the terrace into the grandly appointed room not looking back i slowed my pace for a moment as i passed the statue of venus there was something about the queen that reminded me of the goddess some intangible quality to which great artists attune their senses ordinary men call it divinity and know it when they encounter it even if their tongues cannot capture it with words or their hands give shape to it in sculpture queen cleopatra possessed that qualityor was i simply dazzled for the moment as any man can be dazzled by an object of desire surely cleopatra was no more a goddess than bethesda had been and caesar no more a god than i i pushed open the bronze doors and stepped out of the room and did not realize i was being followed until i heard a voice mutter behind me shes trouble i stopped and turned around meto almost collided with me then stepped back a respectful distance papa he whispered lowering his eyes i made no answer despite his armor despite his strong limbs and his battle scars and the thick stubble across his jaw he looked to me at that moment like a boy timorous and full of doubt i bit my lip i screwed up my courage i suppose its just as well weve met theres something i must tell you this wont be easy quickest done is best done meto said quoting the proverb i had taught him as a child suitable to pulling thorns or drinking foul medicine he kept his eyes lowered but his lips formed a faint ingratiating smile i tried to ignore it the reason i came to egypt he lifted his eyes to meet mine i looked away bethesda has been unwell for quite some time i said some malady the physicians could never put a name to she conceived a notion that if only she could bathe in the nile meto frowned is bethesda here in egypt with you my tongue turned to lead i tried to swallow but could not bethesda came to egypt she bathed in the nile as she wished but the river took her from me she vanished what are you saying papa did she drown the river took her perhaps it was best if her sickness was incurable perhaps it was what she intended all along bethesda is dead his lips quivered his brows drew together the son who was no longer my son the favorite of caesar who had seen men die by the thousands who had hacked his way through drifts of dead bodies and mountains of gore began to weep meto i whispered his name but kept my distance i never thought he shook his head tears streamed down his cheeks when youre far from home you cant help but imagine what might be happening there but you teach yourself to think of only good things in the field getting ready for battle fighting a battle tending to the aftermath theres so much terror all around so much confusion and bloodshed and suffering that when you think of home you think of everything thats the opposite a place thats safe and happy where the people you love are all together and nothing ever changes but of course thats a dream a fantasy every place is the same as every other place no one is safe anywhere but i never thought that bethesda he shot me an angry look i didnt even know she was ill you might have told me in a letterif you hadnt stopped writing me letters i drew back my shoulders and stiffened my spine there then ive told you bethesda is gone her body was lost or else i would have mummified her as was always her wish meto shook his head as if dazed and diana how is she and little aulus and your sister i corrected myself my daughter and her son were well when i left them in rome shes expecting another child or else she might have come herself and davus and eco and all are well i said wanting to end the conversation he sighed papa i know what a tribulation this must have been for you i can only say no more i said you needed to be told and ive told you go back to caesar now go back he laughed without mirth even as he wiped a tear from his cheek didnt you see the look on his face and the look on her face shes trouble its one thing dealing with that starstruck boyking and his eunuch but im afraid queen cleopatra may be another matter altogether ill give her credit for sheer nerve i see how long your tears for bethesda lasted now its back to caesar and the queen and whatever game the lot of you are up to papa thats unfair think what you wish but dont address me as your father he drew a sharp breath he winced as if i had turned a knife in his chest papa he whispered shaking his head i could have sworn he was a child again no older than ten or twelve an uncertain boy clad in the armor of a warrior it took the last measure of my resolve to resist embracing him at that moment instead i turned and strode resolutely down the hallway and then down the many flights of steps leaving meto to await the pleasure of his imperator and the queen chapter xv you knew i said to merianis as we walked side by side through courtyards and past bubbling fountains heading back to my room she had been waiting for me at the checkpoint marking the boundary of the roman enclave you knew i repeated turning to look at her thus your coy smile earlier thus your arch comment about surprises whatever are you talking about gordianuscalledfinder you knew that another visitor besides myself was going to call on caesar tonight whos being coy now she said are you saying that you were joined at dinner by an unexpected guest she could not suppress a broad smile her white teeth in contrast to the black luster of her flesh were dazzling a gift for caesar arrived from an unexpected quarter a gift a surprise with another surprise hidden inside it was compared to the trojan horse merianis laughed did caesar say that i frowned no it was one of his men and was this trojan horse successfully delivered it was did the contents emerge safe and sound yes and just as ready to wreak havoc as those greek invaders who jumped out of the real trojan horse when i last saw him caesar looked poised to surrender to an overwhelming force merianis clapped her hands with delight forgive me for laughing but the metaphor is so novel its always a woman whos described as a city under siege with gates flung open and walls tumbling down it makes me laugh to think of mighty caesar that way hes only human merianis for the time being merianis said then muttered something in egyptian that i took to be a brief ecstatic prayer of thanksgiving to isis a group of palace guards was waiting outside my room before i could step inside the officer in charge politely but firmly ushered me to a place in the midst of his men and i found myself heading off once again leaving merianis behind ill look in on rupa and the boys she called after me i was taken to a part of the palace i had not visited before the corridors grew wider the gardens more lush the draperies and other appointments increasingly more magnificent the guards escorted me into a large chamber where scores of courtiers were clustered here and there in small groups the room echoed with the low buzz of many conversations curious eyes peered in our direction the officer in charge disappeared leaving me to stand idly in the middle of the room with an armed escort surrounding me its that roman i overheard someone say the one the king allowed onto his barge isnt he a soothsayer no some sort of spy or maybe a famous assassin i think looks a bit old for that you never know with romans treacherous devious types the older the wilier the officer reappeared and gestured for me to follow we wended our way through the crowd until we came to a pair of gilded doors the doors opened the officer stayed behind but gestured that i should enter i stepped into a room in which every surface appeared to be covered with goldgolden urns atop golden tables golden chairs with cushions of gold thread walls of hammered gold and a goldpainted ceiling from which hung golden lamps even the floor of dazzling white marble had veins of some glittering golden stuff running through it sculptures in low relief adorned the walls depicting the exploits of the first ptolemy alexanders general these entablatures though surely carved of stone were heavily gilded either painted with gold or covered with gold foil so that the images shimmered with the reflected light of the golden lamps among them i saw the very scene i had read aloud to the boys earlier that day in which ptolemy witnessed the first encounter of alexander and the horse bucephalus it was a room without shadows for every surface reflected the light the air itself seemed golden suffused with a mellow glow of no apparent origin carried upon the golden air was the music of a piper playing a familiar tune at the far end of the room upon a gilded throne sat ptolemy dressed in a pleated gown of white linen with a golden mantle over his shoulders he must have previously attended some religious function in his role as the god osiris for he was wearing the atef crown his young face looking very stern beneath the tall white cone with its plumes of ostrich feathers bodyguards stood behind the throne scribes sat crosslegged on the floor nearby before the throne stood pothinus with his arms crossed and his head tilted back regarding my wonderment with amusement i had stepped into a room designed to overawe the likes of me and the room had done its job your dinner with caesar was brief he said the evening was interrupted ah said pothinus an unexpected visitor i looked at him sharply had everyone but me been expecting the queens arrival then i realized he was referring to meto whom he knew i had wished to avoid the man whom i once called my son did in fact make an appearance ptolemy spoke up i think its sad this estrangement between yourself and your son i should give much to have my father back among the living to look into his eyes again to hear him laugh to listen to him play the flute considering that the kings father had killed his oldest sister and that he himself was at war with his sisterwife i was not in a mood to have young ptolemy pass judgment on my familial relationships but i kept my mouth shut and found myself studying ptolemys face framed by the golden mantle and the atef crown having just met his sister i was struck by the strong resemblance between them neither of them was strikingly beautiful in a way that would turn heads yet both possessed a certain undeniable presence i felt it more strongly from cleopatra but was that only because of my erotic inclinations the image of her standing erect and shaking loose her hair to let it fall past her shoulders flashed in my mind pothinus loudly cleared his throat apparently he had said something that i missed if gordianuscalledfinder can return to the present moment he said giving me a condescending look that put me squarely in my place a befuddled roman mortal agog in the kings golden room i bristled pardon me i was lost in thought considering how the king does and does not resemble his sister cleopatra for a moment this comment went over their heads then simultaneously pothinus gave a start and the king lurched forward in his throne what are you saying cried ptolemy the family resemblance is obviousthe nose the eyesyet theres a difference and i cant quite put my finger on it youve seen her cleopatra pothinuss voice broke as the voice of even a mature eunuch sometimes does where when tonight in caesars chambers ptolemy slumped back in his throne and bit the end of one finger one knee jerked up and down in agitation i told you shed find a way in pothinus impossible your majesty every entrance is guarded every package is examined every obviously not we left a way open and she found it shes like a snake nosing its way along a wall until it finds the merest breach to slip through actually she came by sea i said was i acting rashly putting the queen and perhaps even caesar in danger by this revelation was i not doing exactly as pothinus had intended conveying intelligence back to the king perhaps but the aggravation i was causing them gave me a great deal of pleasure and i couldnt stop a fellow named apollodorus rowed her across the harbor the two of them found an unguarded landing somewhere along the waterfront and made their way to the roman sector of the palace as brazenly as that ptolemy slapped the crown on his head a gesture most unworthy of a god she and that studhorse sicilian went traipsing through the palace right up to caesars door pothinus lowered his voice there are ways as your majesty knows of traversing the palace and its grounds without being seen some of those secret passages are very old there may be some unknown even to me once your father remodeling his private chambers tore out a wall and came upon a network of tunnels that even he had never suspected even so pothinus you assured me that this would not happen actually i said unable to resist the two of them didnt traipse anywhere apollodorus carried her what pothinus looked at me confounded carried her in his arms over his shoulder mostly the king and his lord chamberlain looked at me as if i must be mad one of the bodyguards snickered the man next to him covered the noise by coughing she was rolled up in a rug i explained apollodorus carried the rug over his shoulder he told the romans he had a gift for caesar from the queen i was there when apollodorus was shown into caesars quarters the rug was unrolled for caesars inspection the queen appeared shortly thereafter i took my leave who else was in the room pothinus demanded i shrugged meto he left when i did im not sure where apollodorus went maybe into one of those secret passages you were talking about the king curled his upper lip shes alone with him even as we speak i said pothinus sighed shes like a wine stain on white linen well never get rid of her best to burn the linen then if the stain wont come out ptolemy glowered darkly then drew a shuddering breath and let out a bleating sound he sniffled holding back tears he seemed very much like a boy at that moment and like a boy who was not simply furious but also heartbroken learning that his sister was alone with caesar ptolemy wept bitter tears i gazed at him confounded cleopatra muttered pothinus relentless ruthless shes trouble meto had said the same thing chapter xvi the bodyguards who had shown me to the royal chamber escorted me back to my room the hour was growing late the passageways were empty the palace was quiet long before the open doorway of my room came into view i heard the highpitched voices of androcles and mopsus breathlessly assailing a visitor with questions did you kill anyone at pharsalus said androcles of course he did but how many said mopsus and did you kill anyone famous what i want to know said androcles is this were you there with caesar when he went crashing into pompeys tent and caught a glimpse of the great ones backside disappearing out the rear flap is it true they were all set up for a banquet with greek slave boys strumming lyres and pompeys best silver laid out i drew closer and at last heard their visitors voice even above the sudden pounding of my heart in my chest boys boys how ive missed you though i dont know how papa puts up with all your pestering i stopped in the hallway several steps from the door go i whispered to the officer escorting me youve delivered me to my room as you were ordered to do dont say a word take your men and leave the officer raised an eyebrow but did as i asked i stepped through the open doorway meto leaned against one wall the boys were gamboling about and gazing up at him until i entered the room whereupon they collided and almost knocked each other down rupa who had not met meto before stood off to himself near the window his shy but goodnatured smile vanished when i looked at him merianis stood nearby holding alexander the cat in her arms she saw my expression put down the cat and stepped toward the boys grabbing each by a shoulder to stop their constant motion the cat disappeared beneath my bed what are you doing here i demanded meto gazed at me for a long moment his expression at first beseeching and then when i showed no response exasperated papa this is madness id beg for your forgivenessif i even knew what id done to offend you had he forgotten the things i said to him at massilia i hadnt far from it how many nights had i lain awake while bethesda tossed and turned beside me remembering the words that had come tumbling out of me on that occasion words once spoken can never be recalled as the poet warns but in the heat of the moment i had lost all inhibition and the words had rushed forth delivering me to a decision i had not foreseen meto first you became a soldier and you thrived on it killing gauls for the glory of caesar burning villages enslaving children leaving widows to starveit always sickened me though i never spoke against it now youve found a new calling spying for caesar destroying others by deceit it sickens me even more what matters most to me uncovering the truth i do it even when theres no point to it even when it brings only pain i do it because i must but you meto what does truth mean to you you cant abide it any more than i can abide deceit were complete opposites no wonder youve found your place at the side of a man like caesar this is our last conversation meto from this moment you are not my son i disown you i renounce all concern for you i take back from you my name if you need a father let caesar adopt you until that day in alexandria those had been the very last words i had spoken to him theres nothing to discuss and no question of forgiveness its quite simple this is my room at least for the moment and you dont belong here you shouldnt have come i suppose you followed me or had me followed since thats your way of doing things no merianis spoke up i brought him here you but how earlier when i delivered you for your dinner with caesar i waited at the checkpoint a little later apollodorus appeared bearing the gift for caesar meto came he recognized me from the other day when the king officially received caesar on the landing we spoke very briefly but not so briefly that meto didnt learn all he needed to know about you hes become quite expert at extracting valuable information its one of his duties and one of yours as well i thought but did not say aloud for it was clear to me now that merianis was not merely a priestess of isis but a spy for the incarnation of isis queen cleopatra merianis persisted laterafter id brought you back to this room and the kings men whisked you awaymeto sent a courier requesting me to return to the checkpoint i met him there he asked me to show him here to your room was it wrong to do so meto is your son is he not ptolemy and pothinus had known of my estrangement from meto had merianis not also known of it perhaps she was more innocent than i thoughtor perhaps not i suddenly found myself full of suspicion and i loathed the feeling it was into just such a morass of doubt and doubledealing that i had found myself immersed in massilia and the result had been my breach with both meto and caesar the two of them had followed me to alexandria bringing their poisonous treachery to a city already riven by deceit i felt like a man struggling in quicksand unable to find a foothold i wanted only to be left alone go merianis gordianuscalledfinder if by bringing your son here i have offended you go she frowned and wrinkled her brow then turned and exited through the open doorway as for you meto papa dont speak rashly please i beg you silence he bit his lip and lowered his eyes but seemed compelled to speak papa if it means something to you ive begun to share your doubts about caesar he gazed at me for a moment before looking away as if taken aback at the enormity and the recklessness of the words he had just uttered i stared at him until he returned my gaze elaborate he looked sidelong at rupa i nodded i see your training as a spy has taught you to hold your tongue in front of a stranger but i wont ask rupa to leave the room or the boys either anything you have to say to me can be said to them as well this is difficult enough for me meto glared at rupa with an emotion that went beyond mere distrust i had disowned meto i had adopted rupa did meto feel he had been replaced i shook my head say what you have to say he drew a deep breath ever since pharsalus no even before that since the military operations at dyrrachium or was it when caesar was last in rome using his powers as dictator to settle the problems that had cropped up in his absence no even earlier i think it must have begun when i was reunited with him at massiliawhen you disowned me there in the town square even as caesar was basking in the triumph of the citys surrender the things you said to me the things you said about caesari thought youd gone mad papa quite literally i thought the strains of the siege had driven you to distraction afterwards caesar said as much dont worry he told me your father will come to his senses give him time but perhaps that was the moment i began to come to my senses he paused gathering strength to go on was i the one who changed or was it caesar dont misunderstand me hes still the greatest man ive ever encountered in this world his intellect his courage his insighthe towers above the rest of us like a colossus and yet he fell silent for a long moment then finally shrugged its me ive simply lost my stomach for it ive seen too much blood too much suffering theres a dream i have over and over about a little village in gaul a tiny place utterly insignificant compared to rome or alexandria but not so insignificant that it could be ignored when it raised a challenge to caesar we circled the village and took them by surprise there was a battle quite short and simple as battles go we slaughtered every man who dared to take up arms against us those who surrendered we put in chains then we rousted the women and children and the old people from their homes and we burned the whole village to the ground to set an example you see the survivors were sold as slaves probably to other gauls that was how it worked in gaul surrender and become a roman subject oppose us and become a slave one must always give them a clear simple choice caesar told me you are with rome or against rome there is no middle ground but when i dream about that village its the face of one particular child i see a little boy too young to fight almost too young to understand what was happening his father had been killed in the battle his mother was mad with grief the little boy didnt cry at all he simply watched the house hed grown up in as it was eaten by flames to judge from the workshop attached to the house the boys father had been a smith the boy would probably have grown up to be a smith too with a wife and children and a life in the village but instead he saw his father die and he was taken from his mother to become a slave for the rest of his life whatever money his new master paid for him went to fund more campaigns against more villages in gaul so that more boys like him could be enslaved in my dream i see his face blank and staring with the light of the flames in his eyes his village wasnt destroyed out of simple spite of course all that was done in gaul was done for a greater purpose so caesar always told me he has a grand vision the whole world shall be unified under rome and rome shall be unified under caesar but for that to happen certain things must happen first gaul had to be pacified and brought under romes sway and so it was done when the senate of rome turned against caesar the senators had to be run out of rome and so it was done when pompey roused the opposition against caesar the opposition had to be destroyed and so it was done now caesar must decide what is to be done with egypt and who should rule it and how best to bring it under his sway and the glory of caesar burns brighter than ever i should be pleased having done my part to bring all this about but i have that dream almost every night now the fire burns and the boy stares at the flames numb with shock in the great scheme of things it doesnt matter that he was enslaved rome shall rule the world and caesar shall rule rome and to make that happen that boys enslavement was one tiny necessity in a great chain of necessities but sometimes sometimes i wake with a mad thought in my head what if that boys life mattered as much as anyone elses even caesars what if i were offered a choice to doom that boy to the misery of his fate or to spare him and by doing so to wreck all caesars ambitions im haunted by that thoughtwhich is ridiculous its selfevident that caesar matters infinitely more than that gaulish boy one stands poised to rule the world and the other is a miserable slave if he even still lives some men are great others are insignificant and it behooves those of us who are inbetween to ally ourselves with the greatest and to despise the smallest to even begin to imagine that the gaulish boy matters as much as caesar is to presume that some mystical quality resides in every man and makes his life equal to that of any other and surely the lesson life teaches us is quite the opposite in strength and intellect men are anything but equal and the gods lavish their attention on some more than on others and yet meto bowed his head and the rush of words came to a stop i could see that his distress was genuine and i was astounded at the course of his thoughts does caesar ever harbor such doubts meto laughed bitterly caesar never questions his good fortune he loves the gods and the gods love him triumph is its own vindication so long as a man is triumphant he need never question his methods or his aims once upon a time that philosophy was enough for me but now he shook his head caesar forgets that old greek word hubris it was my turn to laugh if caesar hasnt provoked the gods wrath before now then surely but caesar never presumed to imagine himself a god before now i looked at him keenly what are you saying ever since we set sail for egypt hes kept bringing it up jokingly at first these ptolemies dont merely live like gods hed say they are gods i must see how they put their divinity into practice but its not a joke is it with pompey gone the senate made irrelevant and all the legions united under him caesar will need to think long and hard about what it means to rule like a king whether he calls himself one or not the example of alexander doesnt give much guidance he died too young its the ptolemies who provide the model for a long and successful dynasty even if their glory has lately dwindled to the two decadent specimens currently vying to run the country you dont think much of king ptolemy and his sister you saw that display by the queen tonight she and her brother both seem to have the same idea seduce the man to make an ally of the general i frowned are you suggesting that young ptolemy is completely smitten by caesar its rather pathetic actually you should see the fawning way he behaves when the two of them are togetherthe way he looks at caesar the hero worship in his eyes i nodded recalling ptolemys reaction when i told him that cleopatra was alone with caesar i suppose caesar must be immune to that sort of thing having received the adulation of so many young men over the years including a copious dose from you meto i thought meto scowled you might think so but with ptolemy its different somehow caesar seems equally fascinated by him his face lights up when ptolemy comes into the room they put their heads together share private jokes laugh and give each other knowing glances i cant understand it its certainly not because the boys beautiful he and his sister are both rather plain if you ask me he snorted now we shall have both of them buzzing around him like flies around a honey pot i considered this revelation if true it wouldnt be the first time that caesar had engaged in a royal romance his erotic exploits as a young man in the court of king nicomedes of bithynia had become the stuff of legend inspiring vicious gossip among his political rivals and ribald marching songs among caesars own men their insatiable imperator was every womans husband and every mans husband according to one refrain in the case of king nicomedes caesar had been the younger paramour and presumably the receptive partner hence the resulting scandal and the soldiers teasing since a roman male is never supposed to submit to another man only to play the dominant role with caesar and ptolemy the roles presumably would be reversed with caesar the older more worldly partner and ptolemy the wideeyed youth hungry for experience when poets sing of lovers they celebrate harmodias and aristogiton or theseus and ariadne but lovers need not always be so evenly matched in beauty and youth i thought of my own affair with cassandra a much younger woman and i comprehended the spark of mutual desire that caesar and the king might have ignited in one another despite all his worldly success caesar was at that age when even the most robust of men feel acutely the increasing frailty of their onceinvincible bodies and begin to look with envy and yes sometimes lust upon the firm vigorous bodies of men younger than themselves youth itself becomes an aphrodisiac to the man who no longer possesses it youth coupled with reciprocal desire becomes irresistible to an outsider such love affairs can appear absurd or demeaningthe doddering man of means hankering after some hapless slave boy but this was a meeting of two extraordinary men i thought of ptolemys combination of boyish enthusiasm and grave sense of purpose selfassurance and naivete i thought of caesars effortless sophistication and supreme confidence and of his slightly ridiculous vanity as betrayed by the way he combed his hair to cover his bald spot both were not merely men but rulers of men and yet not rulers only but men as well with appetites frailties uncertainties needs and not merely men and rulers butso they themselves appeared to believedescendents and incarnations of divinity added to this was the fact that ptolemy had lost his beloved father and caesar had never had a son i could well imagine that caesar and the king had something unique to offer one another in a private realm far removed from the public arena of riches arms and diplomacy that in a moment alone with each other they might share an understanding inaccessible to the rest of us why was meto so scornful in conveying his suspicions had he been as intimate with caesar as i had often been led to believe had that intimacy lessened or ended altogether were his feelings about caesars dalliances with the royal siblings tinged with jealousyand did that jealousy make his assumptions more reliable or less i gave a start as if waking from a dream meto and the way of life he had chosen to follow with caesar were no longer my concern even if what he had just told me was truethat he himself had begun to doubt that way of lifestill it was of no consequence to me so i told myself you speak as if a gulf has opened between you and caesar yet earlier tonight i saw with my own eyes how the two of you got alonglike the best of old friends completely at ease almost like an old married couple i daresay did it look that way appearances can be deceiving he lowered his eyes and suddenly i felt a stab of doubt had meto grown cagey and dissimulating with caesar using the skills of deception that had become second nature to him to put on a face to the man he had once admired but now doubted or was i the one being fooled for all i knew meto was still very much caesars trusted spy and i was simply another source of information to be cultivated i stiffened my spine and hardened my heart youve said what you had to say and so have i its been a long daytoo long and too eventful for an old man like me i need my rest now go meto looked crestfallen theres so much more i wanted to say perhaps next time i looked at him without blinking and gestured to the open door he gave each of the boys a hug nodded curtly to rupa then turned to leave metowait a moment he stopped in the doorway and turned back as long as youre hererupa would you pull the trunk closer to the bed open the lid please since we had settled in our rooms i no longer kept the trunk locked i sat on the bed and sorted through its contents what are you looking for papa said meto bethesdas things are here she would have wanted you to have something as a keepsake i removed various items from the trunk spreading them beside me on the bed to sort through them i came across bethesdas silverandebony comb my fingers trembled as i picked it up would it mean as much to meto as it meant to me perhaps but i could not bear to part with it i would have to find something else to give him whats that he asked what therethat alabaster vial was it bethesdas no are you sure it looks like the sort of thing in which she might have kept a perfume to be able to smell her scent againid like that that vial was not bethesdas you neednt speak so harshly i sighed the vial was given to me by cornelia he frowned pompeys wife yes the whole story is too complicated to recount but believe me that vial does not contain perfume poison i looked at him sharply caesar has indeed taught you to think like a spy he shook his head gravely some things i learned from you papa whether you like it or not and a penchant for deduction is one of them if not perfume what else would a woman like cornelia carry in a vial like that and if she gave it to you she didnt hire me to assassinate someone if thats what youre thinking i was thinking that she gave it to you out of mercy or perhaps simple convenienceto spare you a more violent death the poison was intended for you wasnt it papa i almost smiled his cleverness pleased me in spite of myself its something called nemesisinabottle quick and relatively painless or so cornelia told me she claimed it was her personal supply for her own use if the need should arise poor cornelia she must be missing it now perhaps but i doubt it cornelia survived publius crassus she survived pompey shell probably survive yet another illstarred husband if any man would be foolish enough to marry such an illstarred wife i pulled myself upright and stiffened my jaw engaging in banter was not my reason for calling meto back among the objects strewn across the bed i spotted a small jar made of carved malachite with a lid of the same stone secured by a brass clamp i picked it up gazed it at for a long moment then handed it to meto perhaps youd like this to remember her by the beeswax inside is suffused with the scent bethesda wore on special occasions i told her to leave it in rome but she insisted on packing it what if we attend a dinner with queen cleopatra she said she was being facetious of course he unclamped the lid and held the jar to his nose the perfume was subtle but unmistakable its ingredients a secret even to me i caught a faint whiff tears came to my eyes meto clamped the lid his voice was choked with emotion if youre sure you want to give it to me take it thank you papa he turned to go then turned back that vial of poison papayou should get rid of it and you should mind your own business i started to say but the lump in my throat was too thick the best i could manage was a curt gesture of dismissal meto stepped through the doorway and disappeared why did i not do as meto advised from my window i could have cast the alabaster vial into the harbor where it would have sunk like a stone instead i gathered it up with the other things on the bed and stuffed them back into the trunk then closed the lid and threw myself onto my bed rupa hovered over me i told him to go to his room mopsus approached clearing his throat to speak i told him to take androcles and follow rupa they left me alone i covered my face with my forearm and wept as faint as a whisper bethesdas perfume lingered on the air chapter xvii the boys stayed very quiet the next morning allowing me to sleep late i was still groggy my head full of uneasy dreams when merianis arrived bearing a scrap of papyrus that had been folded several times and sealed with wax the impression in the wax was that of caesars ring which bore an image of venus circled by the letters of his name whats this i said ive no idea said merianis a missive from little rome im merely the bearer shall i stay in case you wish to send a reply stay so that i can look upon your beaming face at least someone in this palace is happy i dont suppose the return of your mistress has anything to do with your mood this morning she grinned while queen cleopatra was gone the temple of isis was a place without magic and now the magic has returned i broke the seal and unfolded the papyrus the letter was in caesars own hand gordianus apologies for our interrupted dinner much was left unsaid but unexpected encounters bring happy results there will be a royal reception today that i should very much like you to attend call it a lesson in the fine art of reconciliation wear your toga and come to the grand reception hall at the eighth hour of the day i put down the letter merianis looked at me expectantly a reception of some sort later this afternoon i said she nodded to indicate she already knew about it will you be there i said no power in heaven or earth could keep me from attending then i shall go as well mopsus androcles stop playing with that cat and lay out my toga for me the reception hall was truly grand the result of hundreds of years of refinements additions and adornments by generations of ptolemies here the kings and queens of egypt received tributes from subjects announced treaties and trade agreements celebrated royal weddings and put on their most magnificent displays of wealth and power every surface shone with reflected light whether from the polished marble of floors and pedestals inlaid with semiprecious stone or from the burnished silver of brackets and lamps or from the gold of gilded alcoves filled with gilded statues the lofty ceiling was supported by a forest of slender columns decorated with lotus motifs and painted in vivid hues the room was already buzzing with excitement when merianis and i arrived the crowd was made up mostly of egyptians in ceremonial dress but there was a large contingent of romans as well a lesson in the fine art of reconciliation caesar had remarked in his note to me and the roman officers seemed to be following that theme taking pains to mingle with the locals and engage them in conversation among the egyptians however there seemed to be two unequal factions in the room standing apart from one another the greater faction i took to be adherents of the king the lesser group adherents of his sister while the romans moved among both the two groups of courtiers did not mix but instead exchanged suspicious furtive glances merianis took my hand and drew me toward the far end of the room where four thrones were set upon a low dais the gilded thrones were upholstered with crocodile flesh and the arms of the thrones were carved to resemble crocodiles whose open jaws revealed rows of ivory teeth on the wall behind the thrones a vast painting depicted the city of alexandria as it might appear to a bird soaring at a great height with the pharos lighthouse looming above all else beyond the cityscape and its teeming harbor an expansive blue sea was scattered with tiny but meticulously rendered ships and the great islands of rhodes and crete identified by their names in greek letters beneath them loomed in the far distance a wave of excitement as palpable as a warm breeze passed through the room with a loud hubbub following in its wake i saw that an entourage was making its way through the crowd toward the dais pothinus was in the forefront followed by the king who wore the uraeus crown with a rearing cobra caesar came next dressed as consul of the roman people in his toga with a purple border after him resplendent in a gown of purple adorned with jewelry and wearing a uraeus crown with a vultures head came cleopatra following the older siblings came the two members of the royal family i had not seen before arsinoe who was slightly older than the young king and the youngest of all a boy who also bore the name ptolemy who could not have been more than ten or eleven these two did not wear diadems but were dressed in dazzling raiment as the royal procession passed by i tried to read their expressions pothinus looked pinched and uneasy like a man who had swallowed something that disagreed with him king ptolemy kept his lips tightly compressed and his gaze straight ahead as if deliberately putting on an inscrutable face caesar looked eminently pleased with himself and cleopatra the previous night i had seen her with her hair in a bun wearing a practical garment suitable for traveling in rough circumstances and little other adornment even so she had seemed unmistakably a queen now wearing royal raiment with a necklace made of golden scarabs adorning her bosom and rings of gold and silver upon her fingers she seemed to fill the chamber with her presence i looked about and saw that some of the egyptians in the room gazed at her with loathing others with adoration and that the roman officers regarded her with expressions that ranged from wonderment to simple curiosity but every pair of eyes without exception looked on cleopatra as she passed by her expression was as inscrutable as her brothers but radiated a quality quite different ptolemy exuded the tension of a ratcheted catapult cleopatra seemed to flow effortlessly across the room as a cloud proceeds across the sky the king and queen mounted the dais and sat upon the two thrones in the center to either side of them sat arsinoe and the younger ptolemy in thrones only slightly lower and less magnificent seeing all the siblings sidebyside i was struck by how closely the four of them resembled each other i seemed to be looking at four manifestations of the same being incarnated in bodies of different age and gender which were nonetheless more alike than different had their striking similarity served merely to make the siblings all the more hostile to one another pothinus facing the king and queen struck his staff against the floor the egyptians in the room bowed their heads and knelt the romans hesitated looking to caesar for guidance by a wave of his hand he indicated that they should do as the egyptians did and with considerable grace he dropped to one knee i followed his example but kept my head up caesar i saw bowed his head first to ptolemy who stared back at him blankly and then to cleopatra who gazed at him with a look that left little doubt in my mind at least about what had occurred between the two of them after i left their presence history is made at night i muttered whats that you say whispered merianis i was merely quoting an old etruscan proverb pothinus stood and again struck his staff against the floor all rose caesar stepped forward from many years of experience as an orator in the forum and a commander in the field he was able easily to fill the vast chamber with his voice your majesties i stand before you today in two capacities as consul of the roman people and as a friend of your late father eleven years ago in the year of my first consulship your father driven out of alexandria by civil strife came to rome to seek our help he received it the senate declared him friend and ally of the roman people a very great honor in return he appointed the roman people to be guardians of his children thus rome and egypt became bound together by ties of law as well as of friendship the fortunes of private citizens were joined to those of the late king as well i myself opened my coffers and exerted all my influence to help sustain him in his exile and eventually to restore him to his throne his passing was a tragedy for all who knew and loved him but most especially for this kingdom which he loved so dearly and which has since been riven with such turmoil and strife the late king did not die intestate indeed a copy of his will was sent to rome to be deposited at the treasury and another copy was placed under seal here in alexandria alas the first copy fell into the hands of pompey and is lost to us but since i arrived in alexandria i have obtained the second copy of the will broken the seal and read it very carefully although i hardly needed to reacquaint myself with its terms the dictates of that will were made known upon the kings death and were much discussed in rome unfortunately preoccupied by their own civil strife in recent years the roman people were unable to oversee the proper disposition of the late kings will arriving here in egypt i was dismayed to find that what your father intended had not come to pass those who were to have an equal share in the inheritance were instead contesting with one another by clash of arms as to who should claim the entire estate to some extent the blame for this state of affairs lies with the people of rome for having failed to carry out their duties as executors of the will and guardians of the royal family but i now intend to redress that failing as the embodiment of the will of the roman people my authority extends to this matter of executing the late kings will and i intend to see that its provisions are properly carried outfairly amicably and for the mutual benefit of all concerned when i arrived in egypt i was warmly welcomed by your majesty king ptolemy and given generous accommodations i myself have endured some small turmoil and strife of late and to be admitted into this beautiful city and to be offered safe haven and a respite from my recent struggles were favors i shall not soon forget i thank you king ptolemy but even dearer to me are the hours that you and i have spent together since my arrival and the birth between us of what i hope will be an enduring and everdeepening friendship in us rome and egypt meet it is good not only for ourselves but for our peoples that we should forge strong bonds of mutual respect and affection caesar inclined his head to the king who stared back at him from his throne his expression more rigid than ever caesar paused apparently waiting for the king to make some gesture of acknowledgement the moment stretched uncomfortably ptolemys expression remained unchanged except for a slight tremor of his jaw at last caesar cleared his throat and continued my growing friendship with your majesty has brought me great joy but my visit has also been tinged with sorrow born of my dismay over the continuing discord within the royal family as the playwright says when gods turn one against another mortals turn brother on brother as discord in heaven reverberates upon the earth so discord in the palace of alexandria causes distress throughout all of egypt and even as far as rome not only are the affairs of men disrupted but the natural order is disarranged as well old men i am told have never seen such a low inundation of the nile as occurred this spring and summer wise men i am told attribute this troubling phenomenon to the rivers distress over the discord between egypts rightful rulers harmony and balance must be restoredas was the intention of your wise father who provided that egypt should be jointly ruled by a queen and a king the elder son and elder daughter of his royal blood to be sure the late king ptolemy did not leave affairs in egypt on an entirely sound footing the restoration of his throne came at no small price and incurred a considerable debt roman arms were called up roman blood was spilled those roman troops still reside here in egypt and now follow orders from an egyptian commander the very army that maintains order in egypt was essentially a gift to the kingdom from the senate and the people of rome along with this military assistance roman gold and silver were lent to your father in considerable amounts and many other resources were advanced to him upon account the vast bulk of his financial debt to rome including his personal debt to me remains unpaid given the strife and uncertainty that straddle the nile it seems impossible that this debt can be repaid until peace and order are restored to egypt the debt that egypt owes to rome casts a shadow upon our friendship it would be disingenuous of me to deny it because of this shadow there are those here in egypt who fear that i may have come with more than reconciliation in mind they fear following the defeat of pompey at pharsalus that the conqueror of gaul may have come to egypt with the intention of challenging the authority of its rightful rulers let me assure your majesties here before the members of your royal court and before my own trusted officers that i have no intention whatsoever of attempting to exert roman authority over egypt by force of arms to do so not only would violate your trust in me but would go against the express wishes of the senate and the people of rome who desire only peaceful intercourse and friendly commerce between our peoples i come not to bring war but to end war not to overthrow the heirs of king ptolemy but to unite them not to threaten egypt but to embrace her caesar turned toward cleopatra to that end i welcome back to the city of her ancestors queen cleopatra as he had done before to ptolemy caesar bowed his head unlike her brother the queen returned the gesture and flashed a faint selfsatisfied smile that reminded me of no one so much as caesar himself the queen has been absent from her capital for many days ceremonies and religious invocations that require her attendance have been neglected projects begun by her ministers have been set aside the life of the city and the welfare of its people have suffered she returned to the palace only last night guided so she tells me by the ingenuity and persistent urgings of the goddess isis herself today the queen once again sits upon her throne her people rejoice and so do i what of the other siblings princess arsinoe and the young prince ptolemy for them their fathers will made no specific provisions but i have found them to be of truly regal stature and i believe they should be granted a territory of their own therefore i decree that the island of cyprus which for the last ten years has been a roman province shall henceforth return to ptolemaic rule and that princess arsinoe and the young prince ptolemy shall rule there jointly as king and queen may theirs become a reflection of the harmonious reign of their siblings here in egypt let it be thus that the will of the late king is fulfilled and his children shall rule together and there shall be peace in egypt and the senate and the people of rome shall likewise rejoice and shall recognize the joint authority of the king and queen no king ptolemy shouted his voice cracking he jumped up from his throne his arms stiff at his sides and his fists clenched the inscrutable mask gave way to flashing eyes and twitching lips pothinus rushed toward him and spoke through gritted teeth your majesty distasteful as these proceedings may be we agreed beforehand you agreed i said nothing you nodded whenever i nodded because i was too angry to speak and too hurt to say what i was really thinking your majesty please if there are matters yet to be discussed that should be done in private return to your throne and let me send these people away no let them stay let them stand here and listen to this nonsense let them simper and blow kisses to my whore of a sister and her roman lover if thats what they want its i wholl leave so the rest of you can get on with this orgy of selfcongratulation ptolemy strode forward stumbling slightly as he stepped off the dais the speechless crowd parted and made way for him the egyptian guards at the doorway fell back genuflecting he was like the prow of a ship plowing through waves and wind deflecting all before him merianis grabbed my arm come she whispered where what are you thinking of merianis come dont you want to see whatever happens next i looked over my shoulder as we hurried after the disappearing king pothinus was pale and grim caesar looked utterly at a loss which was quite out of character cleopatra who had not stirred from her throne and seemed to have no intention of doing so wore a smile like that of the sphinx hurry said merianis tugging at my arm she was intent on following the king his robes billowed behind him as he rushed through the hallways of the palace never pausing until he came to the courtyard inside the gates he shouted at the guards to open the gates when they hesitated he threatened to have them beheaded the men rushed to the wheels and the gates slowly opened the king ran into the street merianis and i followed along with a great number of others from the palace ptolemy strode down the wide argeus by appearing suddenly dressed in his crown and robes of state but walking on foot and unattended by any formal retinue he created a sensation all who saw him stopped whatever they were doing some fell to their knees in awe some smiled and cheered some simply gawked all joined in the growing throng that followed at his heels at length he arrived at the great intersection of the argeus and the canopic way where the tombs of his ancestors occupied each of the four corners the building housing the body of alexander was his destination he strode past the sightseers standing in line to view the remains the guards were taken aback by his sudden appearance but quickly recovered themselves they admitted the king but expelled all others or else i think merianis would have followed right behind him dragging me with her instead we stepped into the great square which was already crowded with people arriving from all directions a few moments later the king appeared on a balcony that projected from the upper story of the building even at a considerable distance i could see the streaks of tears on his face people of egypt he shouted his voice rang through the square my beloved people the romans have robbed me of my throne egypt has been conquered in a single night we are all the slaves of rome now there was an uproar all around us cries of anger and despair rang in my ears along with scattered catcalls and peals of laughter most in the crowd appeared to love the king but there were some who despised him ptolemys voice pierced the cacophony here i stand in the building that houses our venerated alexander the greatest of all conquerors the most beloved of all heroes the demigod for whom our city is named from whose authority the ptolemies for centuries have traced the legitimacy of their divine rule but now a man has come along who fancies himself greater than even alexander he thinks so little of us that he doesnt arrive with a great navy supporting him or a great army marching at his back he intends to conquer us by trickery and deceit i confess to you my people for a while he dazzled even me and i gave to him a warmer welcome than he deserved i allowed him into the royal palace i shared food and drink with him i listened to his vain boasting but now my eyes are open if the roman has his way hell throw alexanders body upon a dung heap tear down this tomb and put up a monument to himself perhaps hell even rename the city for himself and you shall wake up to find yourselves living in caesaropolis the crowd responded with thunderous shouting ptolemy gazed grimly over the square projecting an authority far beyond his years people of alexandria as conniving as caesar may be he knows that you will never submit to a roman who dares to sit openly upon the throne of egyptso he seeks to cast me from my throne and put a pretender in my place who might that be what creature with a claim to the royal bloodline would be low enough to conspire with our enemy i think you know her name with shame i call her my sister for her previous attempts to seize the throne we drove her out of the city and into the wilderness alas that we didnt cut the serpent in two for now shes come wriggling back bloated with venom to take my throne from me shell stop at nothing yes cleopatra is back in the palace at this announcement there were scattered cheers among the crowd for cleopatra as well as ptolemy had her adherents among the populace others booed and fistfights and shouting matches broke out the serpent has returned ptolemy cried last night she made herself a prostitute to caesar today hes giving her the payment duethe crown that should be mine and mine alone then what is that cobra sprouting from your forehead shouted a wag in the crowd this ptolemy shouted back this meaningless toy this worthless piece of scrap he lifted the uraeus crown from his head and cast it down with all his might the metal rang against the stone balcony the crowd reacted with stunned silence followed by a sudden surge of movement that lifted me off my feet i looked around and saw merianis disappear amid a sea of gaping angry frightened faces soldiers coming from the palace someone shouted roman soldiers they mean to kill the king well kill them first kill every roman in alexandria long live cleopatra long live ptolemy death to cleopatra death to caesar death to all the romans swords flashed stones flew through the air blood was spattered across paving stones a women screamed in my ear i tripped over a child and someone helped me stagger back to my feet i heard the sound of splashing and realized i was next to the great fountain at the center of the square amid the cavorting dryads and gaping crocodiles a dead body floated facedown exuding a sickening pinkish murk a pebble whizzed over my headtoo fast to have been thrown by hand it must have been cast from a slingshotand struck the helmet of a roman soldier nearby with a noise that made my ears ring he furiously slashed his sword in the direction the shot had come from i ducked as i did so i happened to look over the soldiers head and saw that the balcony where ptolemy had stood was now empty what had become of the king and what would become of me for all i knew the riot would keep growing until the whole city was in chaos i stretched to my full height peering over the heads of those around me trying to catch a glimpse of the palace the whole length of the argeus from the fountain back to the gates was packed with an angry mob as i stood precariously balanced on tiptoes a group of young men came running by brandishing sticks get out of the way old man one of them shouted the romans have carried off the king and they mean to kill him well kill them first another shouted they jostled me and spun me about and almost knocked me down a hand grabbed my shoulder pulling me upright it was too strong to be that of merianisa mans grip i tried to shake free and step away but the grip tightened i braced myself and turned to confront him rupa i cried how in hades did you get here chapter xviii rupa grunted in reply and pointed toward the building that housed the tomb of alexander i wrinkled my brow i dont understand he pointed more insistently then grabbed my hand and pulled me in the direction in which he was pointing his sheer size caused a path to open in the crowd anyone foolish enough to stand in our way he brusquely pushed aside by nature rupa was the gentlest of men but when called upon he knew how to wield the strength the gods had given him but even rupa was no match for the gang of toughs who suddenly blocked our way they appeared to be dockworkers judging from the huge muscles that popped from their shoulders and arms not to mention the briny smell that came off their ragged tunics there were seven or eight of them and they carried the tools of their trade iron grappling hooks lengths of heavy chain nets made of rope and barge poles as thick as a mans forearmlethal weapons in the hands of men like these you there their leader shouted taking notice of rupa on account of his size then casting a disparaging glance at me where did those romans go the ones who dared to come and carry off the king right said another were on a roman hunt we mean to kill as many of those bastards as we can and keep killing them until they get out of egypt and head back to where they came from rupa looked at them blankly whats the matter too good to talk to the likes of us the leader wound a chain around one fist then pulled the remainder taut or maybe you two actually like these romans maybe you think its alright for julius blowhard caesar to screw the kings sister and start bossing us all around he swung the chain through the air making a whooshing sound hes mute i started to say then realized that my accent would give me away if these men were intent on killing romans i had no desire for them to begin with me even the smallest of them looked capable of tearing my head from my shoulders i grunted and poked rupa to get his attention then executed a series of signs speaking to him in the vocabulary rupa himself had developed using his hands and facial expressions in lieu of a voice careful i said these fellows are big im not afraid of them rupa insisted but i am i gestured whats this said the leader squinting at us suspiciously i think they must be a pair of deafmutes said his friend ive got a cousin like that married a woman just like him they talk with their hands the leader looked rupa up and down then sneered at me ah well then leave them to it now lets go kill some romans they ran on in the direction of the palace rupa gestured to me i wasnt afraid of them really i can still call them back if you like i muttered you big lumbering rupa grabbed my hand and resumed pulling me toward the building that housed the tomb of alexander the armed guards who usually flanked the entrance had vanished in the melee along with the line of sightseers waiting to get in the huge bronze doors stood wide open we stepped inside the lofty foyer opulently decorated with multicolored marble was eerily quiet our steps echoed around the deserted chamber the hubbub outside was reduced to a distant roar a doorway to the left opened into a stairwell presumably the means by which ptolemy had ascended to the balcony to address the crowd rupa pulled me through a different doorway and down a long hallway lined by pillars we descended a flight of stairs passed through a small antechamber hewn from solid alabaster and then stepped into a subterranean vault the air was cool as in an underground cellar and smelled of chrysanthemums the long narrow chamber was dimly lit by hanging lamps and dominated by a gilded statue at the far end the windswept mane of hair the serene countenance and the beautifully molded shoulders and limbs made the identity of the statue unmistakable alexander stood naked before us in all his youthful glory towering over an open sarcophagus in which lay the mummified corpse of the conqueror draped in glittering robes from head to foot and crowned with a golden laurel wreath brought by the many sightseers and strewn about the base of the sarcophagus were bouquets of fresh flowers and wreaths of dried flowersmandrakes and mallows irises and poppies larkspurs and lotus lilies but alexanders was not the only dead body in the room the light was so dim and the images at the far end of the room were so arresting that i failed to see the obstacle at my feet i stepped against it and tripped and only rupas strong hand and quick reflexes saved me from falling flat on my face i staggered back and looked down at the body of an egyptian soldier he lay on his back his open eyes staring at the ceiling and his fist still clutching his sword if he had put up a fight he had failed to wound his adversary for there was no sign of blood on his blade but of blood there was plenty it formed a pool around him flowing from a wound in his abdomen why have you brought me here rupa he made no answer but merely gestured for me to follow we crossed the room and approached the golden chain that bisected it beyond which sightseers were not permitted from its perimeter the sarcophagus was still several arms lengths away but one could clearly see the familiar profile of alexander and the play of the dim light upon the strands of golden hair tucked beneath the golden laurel wreath the sight gave me a shiver and i appreciated the patience of the multitudes who waited for hours to stand in that spot for a brief moment and gaze upon eternity without hesitating rupa ducked under the chain and strode directly to the sarcophagus i felt a pang of superstitious dread then did likewise there were no guards to stop us and the watchful stare of the conquerors statue showed no signs of displeasure at our invasion of his sanctum i stood beside rupa and the two of us looked down at the face of alexander the great i frowned at such close proximity the sight of that mummified countenance was not as edifying as it had been when viewed from a few steps farther back some semblance of the original flesh remained but the inner life that had given it beauty had long since fled the skin was like worn papyrus stretched thin over the bony protrusions of the cheeks and the chin those responsible for admitting visitors to the tomb seemed to have gauged exactly how far back to place the golden chain so as to take full advantage of the flattering effects of soft lighting and distance what do you think rupa a bit the worse for wear isnt he rupa nodded then a youthful voice piped up but hes not all that bad when you consider hes three hundred years old i gave a start what in hades from the dark space between the sarcophagus and the statue beyond a face popped into view followed by another mopsus androcles i might have known but how we came here through the tunnel of course said mopsus what tunnel the secret tunnel that begins under the rose garden in the palace runs past the turnoff to the great library and then takes you straight on to this place it comes out just behind that statue theres a little panel you slide back some steps to go upif youre as tall as rupa you have to bend a bit and duck your head when you climb outand then youre here in alexanders tomb its one of the first passages we discovered we said androcles i was the one who found this passage i said it was one of the first passages we discovered and wesometimes you sometimes mehave discovered quite a few such passages since we started exploring the palace mopsus insisted yes but im the one who found this passage i found it with no help from you or anybody else and then i was generous enough to share the knowledge with you so properly you should say its one of the first passages androcles discovered admit it ill admit no such thing youre just being stupid isnt he master i sighed so thats what youve been up to since we arrived at the palace snooping in every nook and corner looking for trapdoors and sliding panels youre lucky youre still alive but no one ever stopped us master said androcles everyone at the palace seems to like us some of the guards even give us bits of sweets when they see us oh yes said mopsus especially that guard whos stationed in the garden with the long reflecting pool sweet tooth we call him because he always has the best sweets little honey dabs thickened with flour and flavored with rosewater and rolled in crushed almonds delicious i imagined the two of them smiling and laughing the picture of innocence charming their way past every checkpoint in the palace in time the guards had no doubt grown so used to them that they allowed them to come and go as they pleased even allowing them to bring along their hulking but harmless friend rupa i shook my head so youve been here before oh yes said androcles we like to come after sunset when the tomb is closed to visitors they lock those doors to the foyer and this room is completely empty and dark added mopsus yes you have to bring your own lamp but its rather nice being able to wander about and study the murals on the walls and visit with alexander the great with no one else about they put the lid on the sarcophagus at night but rupa is strong enough to lift it off i think alexander is in wonderful shape i only hope that ill look like that when im three hundred years old you can almost imagine that he might sit up and start talking for better or worse i said the high art of egyptian embalming seems to have been lost in the centuries between alexanders day and ours theyre no longer able to perform this kind of magic just as well can you imagine future generations lining up to have a look at caesars perfectly preserved body but i still dont understand how you came to be here today and where has everyone gone the three of us were in the palace said androcles minding our own businessin the rose garden as it so happened watching alexander the cat chase a butterflywhen one of the courtiers ran by telling everyone that the king was on the balcony at the tomb of alexander rousing the people against the romans suddenly the rose garden was empty and there we were sitting on the very bench with the false bottom that lifts up to let you into the secret passage we had to come see what was happening for ourselves and this was the quickest way when we came out of the tunnel this room was empty except for a single egyptian guard everyone had gone outside to listen to the king we were hiding in the shadows behind one of those big pillars trying to think of a way to slip past the guard when suddenly there was a commotion from the foyer and then the king himself came rushing in we could tell it was the king even though he wasnt wearing his crown i think he was heading for the secret tunnel but there were roman soldiers after him the egyptian guard tried to stand in their way thats him over there lying in a pool of blood for a moment we thought the roman soldiers were going to kill the king as well and i think the king thought so too you should have seen the look on his face and heard the curses he was shouting against his sister and caesar added mopsus anyway the soldiers fell into a tortoise formation around the kingshields up all around and overhead and spear points poking outand went marching out taking the king with them heading back to the palace i suppose we stayed out of sight and followed them as far as the foyer and then who do you think we ran into merianis i said exactly and she told us that youd been with her but somehow you were separated and with everything going on in the square there was no telling what might happen to you so we sent rupa and merianis to look for you while mopsus and i decided to stay right here so as to be ready to take you straight back to the palace through the secret tunnel actually said mopsus we stayed here because androcles was afraid to go out into the square he said we might get trampled on being so small and it was better to send rupa out looking for you because rupa is big enough to take care of himself i was not afraid insisted androcles staying here was just part of my plan and now you can see how cleverly it all worked out indeed i said but what happened to merianis i looked at rupa who shrugged i suppose you lost her rather quickly in the crowd he frowned and nodded no need to look sheepish rupa if finding me was her priority merianis would have been doing that instead of ducking into the foyer to see what was happening with ptolemy and the roman soldiers sent to fetch him it was good of her to let you know that i might be in danger but im not surprised she slipped off on her own instead of helping rupa search for me no doubt shes eager to run ahead of that roman tortoise and report back to her mistress about everything that took place here curious merianis must not know about this tunnel leading back to the palace or else shed have gone that way i frowned merianis has been a good friend to us boyshelpful thoughtful full of good humorbut we mustnt forget that her true allegiance lies elsewhere you make her sound like a soldier master because i think she is one mopsus no less than a man who carries a sword and shield shed never hurt you master said androcles im sure she wontas long as i dont run afoul of her mistress what a joke the gods have played on me this time ive managed to survive one bloody civil war only to find myself dropped into the midst of another about which i care nothing but from my experience of these conflicts i know that even the most uncommitted bystander is seldom allowed to remain neutral the palace is a battleground cleopatra and ptolemy are rival generals marshaling their forces caesar is the strategic stronghold theyre both eager to claim all other battles will count for nothing if one or the other can win over caesar and the roman might behind him but master you should have heard the curses the king was screaming against caesar when the soldiers took him away said androcles the king must hate caesar with all his might i suspect the exact opposite is true the king may be a ptolemy to his fingertips with a regal bearing and a certainty of his own divine place in the world but hes still a boy not in control of his emotions when he railed against caesar he sounded less like a general rallying his troops and more like a spurned suitor as for caesar hed like very much for the siblings to patch up their differences and get on with the business of ruling egypt and repaying their debts to rome then he could congratulate himself on settling the egyptian question and go wrap up the loose ends left over from his own civil war but neither the king nor the queen may be willing to settle for half of egyptor half of caesar caesar may finally have to choose one over the other before that happens we may all be forced to takes sides whether we want to or all four of us abruptly turned toward the alabaster antechamber that led up to the foyer from whence came the sounds of footsteps a scuffle and loud shouting looters said mopsus soldiers said androcles or mere sightseers i suggested in any case i think its time for us to head back to the palace androcles show me the passageway certainly master step around to the back of the statue i gazed into a black void at the foot of the statue is there no light at all in the passage no air the first part is rather dark said androcles but farther on there are grates and vents that let in little patches of light and puffs of fresh air here ill go first and lead you by the hand mopsus can follow rupa can come last and close the panel behind us its rather heavy just be careful master not to hit ouch your head chapter xix people are still rioting all over the city said merianis days have passed since the king threw his tantrum and yet the people remain in a fury the rabblerousers claim that caesar is holding the king captive against his will a squadron of roman soldiers did march ptolemy back to the palace i observed but they never laid a finger on him the king returned of his own volition after one of his guards was slain in the tomb of alexander someone had to protect the kings person on the way back to the palace that crowd had turned into a rioting mob as you saw for yourself gordianus anyway once the king was back in the palace safe and sound caesar and pothinus together managed to calm him negotiations between the queen and the king continue under caesars supervision but the city is in chaos alexandrians are famous for this sort of thing i observed the alexandrian mob drove the previous king out of the city it took a roman army to get him back in which is why ptolemy should have known better than to incite the mobs fury most of their anger is directed against the romans of course but even the palace guards are afraid to venture out into the streets alexandria is utterly lawless the museum is shut up tightall those scholars afraid to even look out a windowand so is the library no new books for you gordianus you shall have to reread the ones i already brought yes do master said mopsus flinging himself on the bed beside me read the part about alexander and the gordian knot again is it true thats the origin of your family name in the land of phrygia there reigned king gordian who was born a peasant but became the king because of an oracle i see no need to read the tale again if youve memorized it i said as for the origin of the name gordianus but there was no stopping mopsus and many years later alexander passed through phrygia and the city of gordium named for king gordian and he was presented with the gordian knot for the oracles claimed that no man could conquer asia unless first he undid the gordian knot which was so deviously tied that even the cleverest man could not undo it and so tightly tied that even the strongest man could not undo it whereupon alexander androcles interrupted jumping into the middle of the room and pantomiming the action he described whereupon alexander took out his sword and with a great whack and a whoosh he chopped it right in two and the knot fell apart at his feet and everyone bowed down to the new king of asiahoorayalexander the only man strong enough and clever enough to undo the gordian knot thats not how it goes complained mopsus close enough but you left out the part about i didnt leave out anything important youre just jealous that you dont remember the words its the story that matters not the words androcles again mimed hacking at a knot with a sword with a great whack and a whoosh he chopped it right in two mopsus did likewise jumping about the room and slicing the air with an invisible sword with a whack and a whoosh rupa made a face and covered his ears merianis sighed the boys grow restless trapped inside all day restless indeed not only were they unable to go about the city but i had forbidden them to make any further explorations in the palaces secret passages if only i could send them out on some errand a very long errand merianis smiled perhaps you and i should go out for a bit i think not the last time i ventured out with you merianis i very nearly got my head staved in by bloodthirsty dockworkers for all i know theyre still out there hunting for romans but i have another idea come with me gordianus where trust me i looked at her askance with a whack and a whoosh shouted mopsus he chopped it in two cried androcles i winced very well merianis take me away from here quickly where are we going youll see it seemed at first that we were heading toward the roman sector but at some point merianis turned down an unfamiliar corridor and i found myself in a part of the palace unknown to me i was amazed anew at the extent and the opulence of the royal complex at last we stepped into the bright sunshine of a garden that fronted the harbor we crossed the garden breathing warm jasminescented air and descended several flights of steps the cloudless sky was dazzling the galleys of caesars small fleet were scattered here and there across the water their prows turned to face the harbor entrance which was barred by a massive chain beyond the great harbor impossibly big loomed the great lighthouse of pharos merianis led me to a pier made of stone that projected a considerable distance into the harbor we passed a series of small buildings their rooftops decorated with colorful pennants beside a squat statue of bes the egyptian god of pleasure a flight of steps led down to a little skiff i sucked in a breath for the boat was exactly like the one in which pompey had taken his final journey its prow carved in the shape of a standing ibis with wings outstretched and its rim decorated with ornate carvings of crocodiles cranes and nile riverhorses the images plated with hammered silver and inlaid with bits of lapis and turquoise for the eyes a man wearing only a brief loincloth sat in the boat leaning back against the prow with his arms behind his head and his eyes closed basking in the sun as we stepped closer i saw that it was apollodorus the sicilian who had delivered cleopatra to caesar merianis called his name he lazily opened one eye dozing in the middle of the day said merianis what would the queen think of that apollodorus smiled and placed a hand over his loincloth splaying his fingers perhaps its the queen who made me so tired blasphemer said merianis but her tone was playful apollodorus roused himself stood in the boat and shook his great mane of hair as if to untangle it he cast a heavylidded gaze at merianis and leaned forward with puckered lips she pretended to reciprocate the gesture then pulled back at the last moment so that apollodorus kissed empty space and almost lost his balance circling his arms wildly to steady himself merianis gave a deep throaty laugh summon the boatmen at once you big lout boatmen do you think i cant row you there myself he made a show of massing his biceps as you wish merianis stepped into the boat and reached back to take my hand i sat beside her at the prow where are you taking me merianis youll see apollodorus rowed us away from the pier seen from the harbor the long expanse of the palace complex presented a vista of balconies shaded alcoves hanging gardens and roof terraces i was able to discern the high room of the building in which i had dined with caesar and where cleopatra had been presented to him and adjacent to that building the great theater with its seats facing the harbor roman soldiers armed with spears patrolled the highest tier and i recalled that caesar had spoken of the theaters virtues as a possible stronghold in case of attack since the riots set off by ptolemys harangue caesar and his soldiers had begun to fortify the sector of the palace complex that they occupied closing off streets and barricading the open spaces between buildings with whatever materials were at hand the large buildings connected by porticos along the waterfront dominated the skyline for alexandria is mostly flat but there are a few hills and upon the tallest of these looming over the western half of the city stands the great temple of serapis the zeuslike god whom the first ptolemy elevated to a place in the egyptian pantheon to rival even osiris above the waterfront rooftops i could see the temple at a great distance a majestic building not unlike the parthenon in athens and considerably larger though the hill upon which it sits is not nearly as commanding as the acropolis i felt a catch in my throat this was the view of alexandria i would have seen upon our arrival by ship had the storm not blown us off course this had been my last view of the city when bethesda and i departed by ship many years ago and the view i had expected to share with her upon our return gordianuscalledfinder are you unhappy why do you ask merianis theres a tear upon your cheek its nothing just a drop of seaspray i said wiping it away and willing the flurry in my chest to subside we seem to be approaching antirrhodus i said referring to the largest of the small islands in the harbor which was reserved for the exclusive use of the royal family its name declared it rather fancifully to be a rival to the great island of rhodes the locals sometimes called it the floating palace for the island was so built up with towers promenades and balconies that it looked as if a part of the palace complex had detached itself from the mainland and floated into the harbor to set foot upon antirrhodus without royal permission carried a sentence of death and sailors coming and going in the harbor took pains to avoid it among ordinary alexandrians the island held a special mystique some said that the late king had held parties of unimaginable debauchery there while others thought it was the repository of mystical objects and magical talismans handed down from the days of the ancient pharaohs have you ever been there asked merianis i laughed no merianis during my last sojourn in alexandria many years ago i was hardly a part of the royal inner circle and yet here you are about to land on antirrhodus youve come up in the world since the days of your youth or else the world has come down i said apollodorus rowed us into a small walled harbor and up to the landing place the egyptian guards on patrol raised their spears then grinned when they saw merianis i bring a visitor to see the queen she said stepping off the boat and reaching for my hand another roman one of the guards a grizzled veteran with an ugly scar on his cheek eyed me suspiciously forgive his tone gordianus captain cratipus commands the queens protectors theyre an elite company of warriors whove guarded her person since the day she was born they shielded her when her sister berenice usurped the throne and also when king ptolemy returned and put berenice to death they protected her throughout the turmoil that followed her fathers death and stayed beside her during her exile in the desert over the years no small number of their company have died for her theyre fanatically loyal for their devotion the goddess isis will reward them in the afterlife by allowing them to attend the queen in the kingdom of the dead will the queen still need protection from assassins even after shes dead cratipus taking my comment for sarcasm growled at me merianis lowered her voice cratipus dislikes you because youre roman he thinks all romans must be very impious he cant understand why you allow yourselves to be ruled by mere mortals i must admit that also puzzles me i shrugged so far as i know no god has ever campaigned to get himself elected to a roman magistracy probably because election campaigns are so hideously expensive merianis looked at me quizzically then laughed i see youve made a joke anyway cratipus resents the queens reliance on roman arms and he distrusts caesars judgment it was caesars idea that the queen should retire here to antirrhodus for the time being for her own safety i think it was a splendid idea but cratipus thinks it was ptolemy who should have been removed from the palace if one or the other of them had to withdraw the location is certainly splendid enough i said as the guards escorted us away from the landing and we ascended a marble stairway lined by palm trees before us loomed the facade of the palace a curious mixture of greek columns and egyptian stonework or does the queen grow lonely staying here caesar visits her daily dailyor nightly i said a low throaty voice speaking greek with an elegant accent came from the shaded portico that led into the palace caesar may visit whenever he wishes and so may merianis for the queen is always pleased to look upon her face cleopatra stepped forth into the sunlight the guards fell forward onto their faces merianis dropped to her knees and bowed her head i followed her example the queen accepted these prostrations as her due i heard the swishing of her linen gown and watched the movement of her gilded jewelencrusted sandals as she strode back and forth before us only after a long moment did she utter the words you may rise cleopatra proffered her hand to merianis who kissed it ive brought a visitor your majesty this is gordianus of rome whom men call the finder cleopatra turned her gaze to me weve met before have we not i was present on the occasion when your majesty made herself known to the consul of the roman people she nodded ah yes my attention was given entirely to caesar on that occasion but i do remember seeing you there very briefly meto was also there but the two of you quickly excused yourselves and disappeared since then ive seen meto on numerous occasions caesar hardly goes anywhere without him it was only in recent days and from merianis not caesar that i learned of your relationship to meto when he was very young i adopted him but he is no longer my son how confusing i understand that adoption is quite common among the romans who put their faith in manmade laws and manmade relationships in rome it seems two men can be father and son one day and unrelated to one another the next such a concept is foreign to us in egypt the bloodline is everything the bloodline can never be broken except by death i said not even by death sister and brother in this world will be sister and brother in the next the blood of the ptolemies runs equally in my veins and in those of my brother we are joined to one another and to our ancestors for all eternity but in this realm we inhabit mortal flesh and at some point death may separate us if only for the brief span of this mortal lifetime i devoutly hope not your majesty she smiled if it becomes necessary for one of us to proceed to the next world prematurely i assure you that it wont be me cratipus would never allow that to happen your majesty will come to no harm not as long as theres a single breath left in the body of any man here declared cratipus your devotion pleases the queen said cleopatra now return to the harbor and keep a lookout for other visitors is your majesty expecting someone i said perhaps but we were speaking of the afterlife she strolled through the lush gardens surrounding the palace with merianis and i following a little behind having lived in both places i perceive that egyptian expectations of an afterlife considerably exceed those of a roman i said for us when this life is over the best has passed we become shadows who watch the living with envy as we fade into a long gray eternity ah but you have it exactly wrong for those who attain immortality this life is but a shadow of the next the point of this life is to prepare for the life to come i brought up this subject for a reason gordianus knowing of metos importance to caesar knowing of your importance to metoand because merianis has become so fond of youi have made it my business to know a little about you i find it hard to imagine that anything about myself might interest the queen of egypt even so i know of your reason for coming to egypt gordianus and i know of your bereavement was your wife very ill i sighed is this subject truly of interest to your majesty it causes me pain to speak of it even so indulge me very well my wifes illness was mysterious to me sometimes it seemed to me almost that she must be imagining it at other times i feared it would take her from me so suddenly i would have no chance to say farewell she wished to bathe in the nile thinking that would cure her so she said but you think she might have had another reason for coming to egypt i think perhaps she sensed that her death was near and it was her desire to die in egypt she often expressed to me her disdain for roman funerary rites she did not care for cremation where else but in egypt could she be properly mummified and given the ancient rites of passage to the afterlife while that may have been her intention it was not what happened in the end your wife was lost in the nile it happened near a little temple between the road and the river north of naucratis cleopatra nodded the ancient temple of osiris hidden among the vines i know it well the place is very ancient very holy i was told afterward that the temple is abandoned and that the woman who stays there pretending to be a priestess is mad the queen raised an eyebrow ive met the woman of whom you speak i found her very wise it was the old crone who told bethesda to enter the water i said bitterly but gordianus do you not understand the significance of a death in the nile the river is sacred to osiris whom the river claims the god claims to drown in the nile is to be blessed in osiris do you know the story of his death and resurrection let me tell it to you it was osiris who brought the gift of civilization to the world at the dawn of history before osiris men were cannibals osiris taught them to grow crops and to harvest the fish of the sea and he gave them much morethe first temples in which to worship the gods the first cities and laws even the first instruments with which to make music the type of flute that my father loved so much to play was invented by osiris himself osiris ruled the earth and all men loved him but by his very goodness osiris incurred the jealousy of his wicked brother set who devised a plot to destroy him set made a wonderful box and at a banquet of the gods he promised it to the one whose body best fit the box when osiris lay in the box set covered it and sealed it with molten lead then cast the box into the nile isis the sister and wife of osiris followed the box and retrieved it when she opened it osiris was dead but by her magic isis made his flesh incorruptible and restored him to life osiris might have retaken his throne but instead he chose to retire beyond this world to the kingdom of the dead where he welcomes the souls of the just i bowed my head what has this to do with bethesda i whispered we are all composed of four elements fire earth air and water to perish in the nile is to be absolved of the elements of earth and water which join with the mud of the river your wife is all fire and air now it doesnt matter that she wasnt mummified if she drowned in the nile in emulation of osiris she passed from this world directly into the gods embrace she received the gift of immortality you should rejoice for her i averted my gaze you speak of things about which i know very little as i said roman religion is not as conversant with the afterworld as is the religion of egypt you may be ignorant of these matters gordianus but clearly your wife was not she chose the time and the place and the manner of her going how many mortals can hope for as much unless they have access to nemesisinabottle i muttered under my breath thinking of the vial cornelia had given me the queen frowned what did you say nothing your majesty a passing thought of no importance cratipus came running your majesty other visitors are arriving the guests i invited for the midday meal yes your majesty tell apollodorus to escort them to the little terrace that faces the city caesar likes to dine outside caesar i said i should leave now if merianis or someone else can escort me leave nonsense youll stay gordianus and take the meal with us my cooks have prepared a poached octopus and caesar has promised to bring an amphora of falernian winea rare treat in recent years good italian wines have become as scarce as snowfalls in egypt im told that this amphora came from pompeys private store which caesar seized when he overran the great ones camp at pharsalus your majesty ive no desire to drink a dead mans wine then ill have an egyptian beer decanted for you come merianis show gordianus the way to the dining terrace chapter xx we ascended a flight of marble steps to a flagstone terrace a railing supported by squat columns overlooked a sheer drop to the water below on either side the terrace was flanked by tall palm trees and leafy plants behind us rose a windowless wall with a door that gave access to the interior dining couches had been set out in a semicircle facing the city so that each had a view of the sunlit waterfront of alexandria and its reflection in the harbor the queen sat back on the most opulent of the couches which was strewn with purple cushions she rested on one elbow and reclined so that one of her feet touched the ground the pose showed off the lines of her figure the linen gown clung to her heavy breasts and the sensuous curves of her hips thighs and calves the jewels that adorned her sandals glinted in the dappled sunlight merianis took up a position behind the couch to the queens left and indicated that i should stand beside her a few moments later apollodorus appeared he wore no more clothing than before but he had ornamented himself with a silver pectoral for the occasion the hammered metal accentuated the muscles of his bare chest he made obeisance to the queen your guest has arrived your majesty cleopatra nodded you may go apollodorus ill summon you if i need you as apollodorus turned and disappeared down the steps the bald pate of caesar came into view followed by caesars beaming face he was wearing his consular toga he mounted the final step and strode onto the terrace his smile faded but only a little at the sight of me the queen of egypt welcomes the consul of rome said cleopatra but where are the consuls lictors i left them down at the harbor caesar approached the queen making no pretense of bowing clearly in such a setting there was no need for formality between them they exchanged a lovers gaze relaxed intimate confident of reciprocity she offered her hand caesar took it and gave her a lingering kiss not upon the back of her hand but upon the palm caesar glanced at me do we have another guest it chanced that gordianus was here merianis brought him knowing i desired to meet him dont worry therell be enough octopus for us all but will there be enough falernian of that have no fear said caesar a moment later meto arrived on the terrace he was dressed in his finest military regalia bearing an amphora in his arms as one might carry an infant he grimaced when he saw me but said nothing i observed the amphora it was typical in shape with little handles near the widemouthed top and a rounded bottom it was designed not to stand upright but to be laid lengthwise alongside other amphorae for shipment and storage the top was stopped with a cork sealed with red wax along the side several words had been etched in the clay in letters large enough to be read at a glance falernian open only in the presence of gnaeus pompey magnus the wine comes from pompeys private store said caesar when we overran his camp at pharsalus i found his pavilion abandoned but laid out as if for a great banquetsilver plates great portions of roasted game and this very amphora of falernian wine sitting upright on a stand beside pompeys dining couch ready to be unsealed and opened and decanted into pitchers he escaped at the very last moment leaving his victory banquet untouched pompey must have brought this amphora from his own cellars in rome lugging it all over greece and waiting for the proper occasion to drink from it you can see his personal seal the letters magnvs impressed in the wax his ring fits the impression exactly caesar produced the ring king ptolemy had presented to him which he kept on a silver chain around his neck while meto held the amphora steady caesar holding the ring between his fingerssuperstitious about slipping pompeys signet ring onto his own fingerdemonstrated how the seal had been impressed in the red wax fitting the ring into the impression lets open it at once suggested cleopatra meto sat on a couch and set the amphora upright into a clay stand on the floor between his knees he produced a short knife with which he carefully sliced away the sealing wax he gently pulled out the cork stopper merianis brought a silver pitcher but before meto could fill the pitcher with wine the queen lifted her hand stop before the first pitcher is filled let caesar receive the first taste from the amphora itself caesar smiled a kind gesture your majesty but i think the first taste must go to my hostess the queen of egypt cleopatra shook her head and smiled every exchange between them became a flirtation the queen declines the queen insists that pompeys conqueror should enjoy the first taste of pompeys wine and i know just the cup from which you should drink it merianis fetch the cups of beaten gold i received on my nuptial day merianis disappeared into the palace for a moment then returned bearing two cups fashioned in the old greek stylewide shallow bowls with stout bases and handles made not of painted clay but of gold rising from her couch cleopatra took one of the cups from merianis and displayed it to caesar these cups were presented to me and my brother on the day of our royal marriagea gift from the king of parthia are they not beautiful quite said caesar but is it proper that i should drink from one it is proper if i say it is proper said the queen my brothers lips shall never touch this cup any more than his lips shall touch my own theres only one mans lips i want upon this cup only one mans lips i want to kiss my own she put her face close to his and for a moment i thought they would kiss but at the last moment she drew back and flashed a teasing smile merianis laughed and i recalled that she had done much the same thing to apollodorus earlier which of the women was emulating the other they both seemed impossibly young to me at that momentnot a goddessqueen and her priestess but two flirtatious girls whatever caesar saw he liked it the vaguely stupid look on his face was that of a man so smitten he doesnt care who knows it meto still sitting with the amphora between his knees saw what i saw and glowered cleopatra turned to meto bearing the golden cup aloft glum meto the very picture of the earnest romannever a smile for the queen of egypt meto sought to change his expression and managed an unconvincing lopsided smile stand up glum roman and pour a splash of wine for your consul meto stood and lifted the amphora pouring a small amount from the long heavy vessel into the wide cup presented a challenge but he managed to do so without spilling a drop when he was done he replaced the amphora in its stand and put the cork back into the opening cleopatra walking slowly and carefully carried the cup to caesar he took it in both hands and raised the rim to his lips smiling at cleopatra across the dark expanse of wine that reflected both their faces cleopatra smiled back at him then a shadow crossed her face wait the wine hasnt been tasted she pulled it from caesars lips a tiny portion spilled from the rim and splashed onto the paving stone at her feet tasted said caesar but surely theres no need for that the wine came from pompeys private store with the seal intact seals can be penetrated and so can cork said cleopatra what was i thinking the wine must be tasted first but surely said meto looking exasperated no it must be tasted that was one of the first lessons my father ever taught me all food and drink must be tasted without exception enjoyment of the moment blinded me merianis fetch zoe merianis anticipating the queens desire had already stepped inside she returned a moment later with a demure young slave girl who carried with her an ordinary clay drinking vessel cleopatra handed the winefilled cup to merianis merianis poured a tiny portion of the wine from the gold cup into the clay vessel held by zoe since protocol would not permit the lips of the taster to touch the golden cup intended for the queens consort meto stiffened his jaw i assumed he was impatient with the queens intensely suspicious egyptian ways caesar appeared mildly amused but at the same time slightly disturbed for the queen seemed to be acting as much upon a premonition as upon the training she had received as a child like caesar i too had seen the agitation on cleopatras face when she withdrew the cup from his lips and the sudden look of fear in her eyes without selfconsciousnessfor she was used to being watched when she atethe girl zoe put the clay vessel to her lips and drank she lowered the vessel and wiped a bit of red wine from her lips her features assumed a curious expression your majesty a wrinkle appeared across caesars forehead cleopatra peered at the slave girl apprehensively yes zoe what is it your majesty i held my breath your majesty i have tasted many wines for youbut never a wine as fine as this one the tension evaporated caesar laughed softly cleopatra sighed meto gave a snort as if to say what were you all so worried about zoe grinned your majesty i dont exaggerate ive never tasted anything like it falernian ive tasted beforethough not in a long timebut it was never this fine its hard to explain then i suppose we must find out for ourselves said the queen go now zoe come back when the first course is presented but the girl did not move as i said falernian ive tasted before but never never like this one her eyes staring straight ahead took on a glassy look i said that you may go said cleopatra sharply zoe ignored her her words began to slur together the flavor the flavor is like fire like something burning in my throat and all the way down into my belly a sweet fire not at all unpleasant but burning nonetheless oh your majesty oh i think there was something wrong with that wine zoe dropped the clay vessel everyone drew back startled by the hollow explosion of the clay shattering on the flagstones zoe fell to her knees trembling violently your majesty your majesty help me please cleopatra hurried to the girls side she knelt and took zoes convulsing body in her arms zoe gazed up at her glassy eyed but with a look of mingled reverence and trust she lifted her face as if in expectation of a kiss the queen closed her eyes and put her lips to those of zoe as the girl released her final exhalation the convulsions abruptly ceased the body of zoe went limp cleopatra held the dead slave girl in her arms closed her eyes and chanted softly the chant was egyptian perhaps a song for the dead for as long as the queen chanted and kept her eyes shut a spell seemed to be cast over everyone present no one moved i stared dumbfounded at what i was seeing cleopatra was not only the girls mistress and queen she was her goddess as well whose divine agency at the very moment of death might serve to convey a lowly slave to immortality in the lands beyond life when cleopatra opened her eyes i saw that she had been doing more than chanting some furious calculation appeared to have taken place reflected in the fiery blaze of her eyes she called to merianis who put aside the gold cup ran to the queen and knelt beside her they exchanged hushed urgent words merianis looked over her shoulder at meto her expression so wild that i felt a stab of dread meto too sensed something terrible in her gaze for i saw him blanch caesar caught the looks that shot between them and on his face i saw a mask of puzzlement merianis appeared to resist whatever cleopatra was suggesting until at last the queen raised her voice go then and do as i say bring apollodorus merianis rose to her feet and ran from the terrace caesar looked at the amphora of wine which had been replaced in the stand on the paving stones he looked at meto who stood over the amphora then at cleopatra and the dead slave what in hades just happened here meto looked down at the amphora poisoned he muttered it must be somehow he reached down as if to pull out the cork stopper again no caesar shouted dont touch it it was understandable that he should speak with alarm but the look he cast at meto was tinged with suspicion he strode toward cleopatra but she held up her hand to signal that he should stay back zoes kawhat you call the lemuris still not free from her body i sense it still clinging to her flesh her death was so unexpected that the ka remains confused trapped between this world and the next be silent dont move but i intend to call for my lictors silence said cleopatra gazing up at him with fire in her eyes i looked on amazed as a twentyoneyearold girl commanded the worlds most powerful man to be still and he obeyed and so we stood motionless like actors on a stage at the final tableau surrounded by stillness i became conscious of the many sounds of the harbor muted by distance and the gardens enclosing usshouts of men working on the waterfront the shriek of gulls the susurrant voice of the restless water itself dappled sunlight danced upon the flagstones the moment took on a hardedged clarity that seemed at once dreamlike and more real than real i felt lightheaded and despite the queens command that no one should move i sat on one of the couches and briefly shut my eyes at last merianis came running up the steps i could see she had been weeping no doubt shaken by the turn of events apollodorus followed behind her looking grim cleopatra stood the body of zoe slipped from her embrace and crumpled like a castoff garment on the paving stones presumably the restless ka had been dispatched for the queen paid no more attention to the corpse she raised her arm and pointed at meto i want his person searched metos face grew long caesar stiffened his jaw and nodded of course your majesty it shall be done i shall call my lictors and see to it at once no i summoned apollodorus for the purpose apollodorus shall search him caesar worked his jaw back and forth i think your majesty that in these circumstances it would be best this is my home said cleopatra its my slave who lies dead it was my cup that was poisoned a cup intended for my lips said caesar filled with wine poured by your manthe same glumlooking roman who carried the wine here no caesar i must insist that one of my men perform the task of searching metos person caesar considered this for a long moment he turned toward meto but did not quite look him in the eye then turned back to cleopatra very well your majesty let apollodorus search him step forward meto raise your arms and let the fellow do what he must meto looked indignant but obeyed his jaw twitched i knew he wanted badly to cast a scathing look at the queen but his discipline held firm and instead he kept his gaze straight ahead apollodorus ran his hands over metos shoulders limbs and torso poking his fingers among the leather straps and buckles meto grunted and ground his jaw cleopatra stepped closer and watched intently caesars gaze shifted apprehensively from meto to cleopatra and back again merianis who had withdrawn to another part of the terrace hid her face and began to weep apollodorus stiffened your majesty what is it apollodorus what have you found from between two straps of leather attached to metos breastplate apollodorus produced a small white object cylindrical in shape caesar leaned forward as did cleopatra i rose from the couch still lightheaded and moved toward meto feeling a sudden premonition of catastrophe apollodorus held the object aloft between his thumb and forefinger it was a tiny vial made of alabaster i could not stop myself i gasped as one all four turned their gazes on mecaesar cleopatra apollodorus and meto whose eyes finally made contact with mine for the first time that day the look on his face froze my blood papa he whispered hoarsely caesar snatched the vial from apollodorus he thrust it under my nose what is this gordianus i stared at it the stopper was gone though the vial was empty i caught a faint whiff of the not unpleasant odor i had smelled when i sniffed its contents aboard pompeys ship there could be no doubt this was the vial cornelia had given me caesars nose was almost touching mine speak finder i command you what do you know about this from behind him i heard the calm but demanding voice of cleopatra yes gordianus tell us what you know about this alabaster vial that apollodorus found upon the person of your son chapter xxi an hour later in a kind of stupor i was back in my room sifting through the contents of my traveling chest roman soldiers dispatched by caesar stood by watching my every movement rupa stood across the room and the boys sat on the windowsill i had not yet told them the details of what had transpired but they knew that something terrible must have occurred the boys were calming themselves by stroking alexander the cat who sat purring between them oblivious to the tension in the room its not here i muttered carefully methodically i had removed every item from the trunk and spread them across my bed now just as methodically i replaced each object into the trunk shaking tunics to make sure nothing was hidden in the folds opening bethesdas little trinket boxes to be certain that no alabaster vial was hidden inside the search was fruitless the vial cornelia had given me was no longer in my possession apollodorus had discovered it upon metos person nonetheless i had been praying for some miracle whereby i would find the vial in my chest after all with its stopper and contents intact now there could be no doubt the poison cornelia had given mequick to act relatively painlessmust have been the same poison that killed cleopatras taster my reaction when i first saw the vial in apollodoruss hand had been so spontaneous so damning that dissembling was futile no lie fabricated on the spot would have satisfied caesar nor was silence an option refusing to speak would have pitted my will against his and against the will of cleopatra as well both of them had long experience in obtaining information from unwilling subjects i might have withstood a degree of suffering but there were rupa and the boys to consider i would not allow harm to be done to them even for the sake of protecting meto and there lay the bitter irony after all my protestations that meto was no longer my son that our relationship was over and that he meant nothing to me my first instinct had been to protect him caesar had seen through me at once if meto truly means nothing to you finder then why do you not speak he had demanded a woman lies dead but for the queens action it would have been me what do you know about this alabaster vial speak if i have to force you to talk i will neither of us wishes for that to happen do we finder so i told him where the vial had come from and how it had come to be in my possession when had i last seen it i couldnt say for certain in fact my last memory of seeing it was the day that meto had noticed it when i gave him a keepsake from bethesda how had it come to be in the possession of meto i attempted to dissemble saying i had no idea but hearing the threat in caesars tone meto himself spoke up i saw it among papas things on the night i went to visit him in his room he kept it in his trunk i told him to get rid of it i was thinking he might be tempted to use it himself but from that moment to this i never saw it againnot until this sicilian produced it out of thin air like a magic trick are you saying apollodorus himself was carrying the vial said caesar we know already how talented he is at making things appear from nowhere meto glowered at the queen enough said caesar the one thing we know for certain is that father and son both knew of this poison and here you both are together with the vial that contained it and the slave who died from drinking it meto meto i never imagined consul wait i shook my head perhaps theres been a mistake what sort of mistake let me return to my room and look through my things an alabaster vial is a commonenough object perhaps the one in my room is still there after all i tried to speak with conviction but the chance seemed farfetched even to me caesar to his credit allowed me to pursue the possibility while his men took meto into custody another group of soldiers accompanied me back to the mainland escorted me to my room and watched as i conducted a futile search of the things in my trunk the only result had been to give further evidence that meto must have purloined the poison at some point after he first saw it in my trunk but how had the poison come to be in the wine and for what purpose i sat on the bed numbed by the enormity of what had happened was it really possible that my son had attempted to take the life of julius caesar my son the words came to my mind unbidden and remained there unchallenged as i had wept for bethesda now i wept for meto knowing he must surely be lost to me forever i realized in that moment why i had so steadfastly resisted a reconciliation with meto since seeing him again in alexandria it was not stubborn pride or an irreconcilable disgust for meto himself it was my fear of a moment just such as this having lost bethesda how could i open myself a second time to the chance of losing the person i loved most in the world meto who lived such a perilous existence who exposed himself again and again to the dangers of war and espionage who had bound his fate to the fiery comet of caesars careersince i had at last shut him out from my life surely it was better to keep him out for good or else i might face the intolerable prospect sooner or later of losing him altogether so it had come to pass despite all i had done to harden my heart against him what an illstarred voyage had brought me to alexandria the soldiers allowed me time to collect myself but did not withdraw caesar had ordered them not to leave my side rupa stood before the window his arms crossed fretting and frowning the boys fidgeted biting their lips and exchanging glances until at last mopsus spoke master whats going on whats happened its something to do with meto isnt it i shook my head boys boys its of no concern to you no master this isnt right little androcles stepped forward mopsus and i may be only slaves and rupa iswell hes just rupabut were not children any longer something terrible has happened we want to know what it is were clever master and fearless piped up mopsus and strong rupa tacitly added massing his bulllike shoulders the only occupant of the room who failed to step forward was alexander the cat who resettled himself on the windowsill with his back to the room and gazed out at the harbor perhaps we can help master i looked at androcles manifestly still a child notwithstanding his protestation to the contrary and i remembered meto when he was the same age between that time and this meto had become a man he had traveled across the world and back killed other men and very nearly been killed himself stood beside caesar and dipped his hands into the tides of history yet a part of me clung to the absurd notion that meto was as tender and vulnerable as androcles that he was still a boy who needed my protectionand my chiding in that moment i at last became reconciled to meto and the man he had chosen to become i relinquished the false assumption that i had some responsibility for his actions i acquiesced to his inevitable autonomy i admitted to myself that i loved him nonetheless if now he found himself in a dire strait i would not judge him and i would do all i could to help him meto stands accused of trying to kill his imperator with a poison he obtained from this trunk i said oh no said mopsus it isnt true is it master the truth androcles i dont know but if meto did such a thing master then i shall throw myself upon caesars mercy i shall tear my tunic pull out my hair beg him shamelessly surely all my years around advocates like cicero have taught me some tools of persuasion i shall use them now on metos behalf but surely meto is innocent master if he is mopsus then i intend to do everything in my power to absolve him this is a strange land here justice exists at the whim of those who possess a certain bloodline and laws are decrees handed down by squabbling rulers laws have nothing to do with truth or justice with proof soon it will be the same in rome i think caesar is taking lessons from these nile crocodiles and intends to reproduce their habitat along the tiber still even in egypt truth is truth and proof is proof and it may be that i can yet do something to save my son and we will help you insisted androcles if the gods allow it i said did you find it caesar stood at the eastern window in his high room gazing over the rooftops of the jewish quarter in the direction of the distant nile no consul he nodded even with his back turned i could tell that he took no pleasure in the gesture he stood with his hands clasped behind his back nervously turning the alabaster vial between two fingers he turned to face me ive just received disturbing news how are your eyes gordianus i beg your pardon consul stand here and look toward the east beyond the city at that blur of desert between here and the nile what do you see gordianus not much consul a blur as you say further obscured by a great cloud of dust exactly thats the dust raised by a marching army according to my intelligence the whole of ptolemys army has decamped from their fortress in the desert and is now marching this way under the command of a certain achillas youve met this fellow i understand not exactly consul but youve observed him at close quarters from a considerable distance i saw him murder pompey later practically under my nose i watched him strangle an egyptian spy with his bare hands a murderous brute i believe that both acts were committed at the behest of the king which would make the killing of pompey an assassination and the killing of the spy an executionif one believes that some killings are murder and other killings are not caesar looked at me askance ive killed men in battle men under my command have caused the death of many others would you call me a murderer gordianus i would never presume to offer such a judgment consul he snorted wriggled out of answering that one didnt you you remind me more and more of cicero the wordtwisting the handwringing the endless equivocationshis ways have rubbed off on you over the years whether you like it or not i kept my voice steady the times we live in have led us all down paths not of our choosing speak for yourself gordianus you spend too much time looking backward the future lies ahead a future that will soon bring ptolemys army to the gates of alexandria so it seems i never intended for alexandria to become a battleground i meant to come here settle affairs between the king and queen and be on my way instead i now face the prospect of a fullscale war and i dont like the odds ive sent for reinforcements but who knows when those will arrive as it stands their numbers are great and ours are small granted the forces under achillass command are highly irregular by roman standards the core is made up of the legionnaires who arrived here under gabinius to restore the late king to his throne and to keep the peace it seems theyve since forgotten their origins and become egyptianized marrying local women and adopting native customs that one of their number would consent to murder pompey in cold blood tells us just how far theyve descended from their honorable beginnings added to their ranks are mercenaries runaway slaves and foreign criminals theyve no discipline to speak of and little loyalty once when they wanted higher pay they blockaded the palace to demand it but they havent forgotten how to fight under a commander as murderous as they are they may constitute a formidable foe he began to pace turning the alabaster vial in his fingers it seemed that meto was far from his thoughts he spoke again a moment ago you said that the killing of pompey was done at the behest of the king do you believe that gordianus did king ptolemy himself order the assassination is he capable of issuing such a command without pothinus guiding him surely youve come to know the king better than i do consul you must be a better judge of his character and capabilities am i do you want the truth gordianus these ptolemies have me utterly confounded the two of them have put my head in a spin its absurd the master strategist the consummate politician the conqueror of gaul the author of pompeys downfallstumped by two children i could not restrain a smile cleopatra is hardly a child consul as young as she may seem to men of our years andsince you asked for my opinionptolemy is no longer a boy hes very nearly at that age when a roman youth puts on the toga of manhood and becomes a citizen were you not precocious at fifteen consul precocious perhaps but i was hardly ready to run a country like egypt when i was the kings age caesars face softened that was about the time i lost my father it happened one morning while he was putting on his shoes he was a strong vigorous man in the prime of life my mentor my hero one moment he was alive tying the straps of his shoes the next moment he gave a lurch and tumbled to the floor as dead as king numa his own father had died the same waysuddenly in middle age for no apparent reason some flaw passed from father to son perhaps in which case im already past the span of my allotted years and living on borrowed time i could die at any moment perhaps ill drop dead while we stand here talking he gazed at the distant cloud of dust and sighed i remember my father every dayevery time i put on my shoes its a sad thing for a boy on the verge of manhood to lose his father the same thing happened to ptolemy though he was even younger when the piper died i think that may be why he craves so strongly the affection and guidance of an older man i frowned you speak of pothinus caesar laughed ill spare you the predictable joke regarding pothinuss manhood no gordianus i refer to myself the other day in the reception hall when i spoke of the special friendship between the king and myself i wasnt just spinning pretty words in the manner of cicero i think i may understand the kings fascination with caesar but im not sure i understand caesars fascination with the king ptolemy is intelligent passionate willful convinced of his divine destiny like his sister very much like her though im afraid he lacks cleopatras sense of humor such a serious young manand what a temper that tantrum he threw the other day haranguing the crowd and casting off his diadem caesar shook his head i acted too quickly pressing him to make peace with his sister i should have anticipated his reaction it seemed to me that the king was behaving like a jealous lover i gazed steadily at caesar wondering if i had spoken too candidly he narrowed his eyes the intimate relationship between an older man and a youth has always been more warmly regarded in the greekspeaking world than in our own alexander himself had hephaestion and then the persian boy bagoas if the king of alexanders city has approached me in the same spirit of manly love should i not be honored young men are naturally susceptible to hero worship the more ambitious or highborn the young man the more exalted the older man upon whom the youth desires to model himself the kings attention flatters you yes and in a way that his sisters attentions do not they say that caesar set his sights on a king when he was young the steadiness of my voice was inversely proportionate to the recklessness of my words everyone knew the rumors about caesar and king nicomedes of bithynia his political enemies had used the tale to ridicule himbut most of those men were dead now caesars soldiers cracked jokes about itbut i was not one of caesars comrades in arms still it was caesar himself who had opened this avenue of conversation his response was surprisingly candid perhaps like me caesar had reached that point in life when ones own past begins to seem like ancient historymore quaint than quarrel provoking ah nico when i put on my shoes i think of my father when i take them off i think of nico i was nineteen serving on the staff of the praetor minucius thermus in the aegean thermus required the help of king nicomedess fleet an emissary was needed to go to the kings court in bithynia thermus chose me i think the two of you may hit it off he told me with a glint in his eye the old goat was right nico and i hit it off so well that i tarried in bithynia even after thermus sent a messenger to retrieve me what a remarkable man nico was born to power sure of himself with a voracious appetite for life a ruler not unlike the one that ptolemy may yet become what a lot he had to teach an eager ambitious young roman who was no longer a boy but not quite a man when i think of how naive i was how wideeyed and innocent its impossible to think of you as naive consul is it alas the youth whom nico instructed in the ways of the world has long since vanishedbut the man remembers those golden days as clearly as if they just happened i shut my eyes and im in bithynia again without a scar on my flesh and with all my life ahead of me do you think ptolemy will remember me that vividly when he grows old and ruling egypt has become a tired habit and that fellow called caesar has long since turned to dust i think the world will remember caesar long after the ptolemies have been forgotten i said this matteroffactly but caesar mistook my tone his gentle mood suddenly evaporated dont humor me gordianusyou of all people the last thing i need right now is another sycophant the whole time we talked he had been fiddling with the little vial turning it over in his hand now he gripped it in his fist so tightly that his knuckles blanched as white as the alabaster suddenly he threw it with all his might against the marble wall unbroken the vial ricocheted and struck my leg the blow was harmless but still i jumped the gesture expended caesars fury he drew a deep breath just when i thought i was on the verge of restoring peace between the king and queen achillas marches on alexandriaand someone attempts to poison me perhaps the queen was the intended victim perhaps but how and when was the wine poisoned and by whom we know where the poison came fromand that fact casts a ray of suspicion upon you gordianus consul i didnt even know the vial was missing so youve already explained but the possibility remains that you were in collusion with your sonthat you provided him with the poison knowing how he intended to use it did you conspire against me i shook my head no consul meto claims to know nothing the queen advises me to torture him she doesnt understand how strong willed he is i myself trained meto to endure interrogation but if i thought that torture would loosen his tongue no consul not that the truth must be discovered perhaps perhaps i can do so consul if youll allow me why meto means nothing to you in massilia you disowned him i witnessed that moment with my own eyes and ears consul please let me help my son caesar gazed at me for a long moment a shadow seemed to dim the light in his eyes as if some powerful dark emotion gripped him but his face remained devoid of expression at last he spoke over the years your son has demonstrated great loyalty to me ive rewarded his devotion with a degree of trust ive given to very few men and yet when that slave girl died today a part of me was not surprised the worm of deceit starts small but grows i think back and i perceive that a rift has been growing between myself and meto for quite some time the signs have been subtle he never defies me outright but on his face ive glimpsed a sour fleeting look in his voice ive heard a faint note of discord if meto has betrayed me he shall be punished accordingly i bit my lip caesar has a reputation for clemency yes gordianus ive shown great clemency to those whove fought against me even that rat domitius ahenobarbus i forgave only to see him take up arms against me at massilia and again at pharsalus but for a traitor who resorts to lies and poison there can be no pardon i tell you this outright gordianus so that if you harbor any notion of pleading for your sons life you can spare yourself the indignity dont bother to rip your tunic and weep like one of ciceros guilty clients playing for sympathy in the courts if meto did this thing my judgment will be harsh and irreversible do you understand yes consul but what if i can prove to you that hes innocent again the shadow dimmed his eyes if meto is innocent then someone else is guilty so i would assume consul in which case the truth is likely to pose a problem im not sure i understand the poisoner must have come from one of three campsmy own or that of the queen or that of the king whatever the truth the revelation is likely to cause yet more complications which is why you will report anything you discover directly to me and to me alone do you understand yes consul caesar strode across the room stooped and picked up the alabaster vial he held it to the light what an irony if the poison intended for pompeys widow had taken the life of pompeys rival do you think our poisoner has a sense of humor gordianus i shall take that possibility into account consul chapter xxii i had to stoop to enter through the low doorway the jailer one of caesars men shut the door behind me meto sitting on a low cot sprang to his feet he was being held in a small room underground the walls were dank and the only light came from a tiny grated window high above our heads from which i heard faint echoing sounds of the harborbells gulls men calling out the low murmur of the water papa what are you doing here caesar cant think that you had anything to do with im not here as a prisoner meto caesar agreed to let me visit you you looked in your trunk yes the vial wasnt there i dont know when it was taken caesar has it now he wants to know how it came to be on your person but i never possessed it the only time i ever saw it was that day in your room when i told you to get rid of it if only i had meto shook his head this is madness why is caesar holding me here he cant possibly believe i tried to poison him i remembered the darkness in caesars eyes im afraid he does believe it though it causes him great pain but if we can prove otherwise meto was staring at the dank stone wall not listening how the gods must despise me first you disowned me papa i thought that nothing could be worse than that but now caesar turns against me all that ive loved and trusted and given my life for has abandoned me why did i ever allow myself to expect anything more i began this life as an orphan and a slave i shall leave this world in an even lowlier state branded as a traitor and a criminal without a father without a friend without a name no meto whatever else may happen youre still my son he looked at me with tears in his eyes in massilia i repent of the error i made in massilia youre my son meto im your father forgive me papa i embraced my son for the first time since massilia a place in my heart that had grown numb and cold quickened and sprang to life i felt an almost palpable relief as if a jagged stone that had been lodged in my breast was now removed i had learned to ignore the pain in order to bear it but now that it was relieved i realized the grinding wearing burden of the suffering i had inflicted on myself i embraced the warm solidity of metos body and rejoiced that he was still in the world alive and whole but for how much longer in egypt i had lost bethesda only to find meto again had i now reclaimed meto only to face losing him forever he stepped back we both took deep breaths and for a moment lowered our eyes made shy by the emotion of the moment i cleared my throat i cant stay long we need to talk and quickly and remember say nothing that cant be safely overheard these walls appear to be solid stone but there may be someone watching and listening even now theres nothing i cant say aloud papa i have nothing to hide even so i thought of the sentiments he had expressed to me in my room the day he saw the alabaster vial his doubts about caesar and the suffering that followed in caesars wake if another of caesars men had overheard that conversation might metos words have been construed as sedition now that he stood accused of outright treason anything he said against caesar would be scrutinized in the worst possible light so i dared not question him further in such a vein for the first time i allowed myself to consider the possibility that meto might actually be guilty of making an attempt on caesars life it made no sense unless his resentment against caesar went far deeper than anything he had expressed to me but might it be that the poison had been intended for cleopatra so as to remove her influence upon caesar and that the attempt had somehow gone terribly wrong i gazed at metos face trying to read the truth in his eyes was my son a poisoner and a bungler as well in the corner of my heart that had once renounced him a seed of doubt was stirring apollodorus found the vial on your person meto how could such a thing have happened i have no idea papa it will take a better answer than that to satisfy caesar caesar should be satisfied that i speak the truth after all weve been through together its absurd that he shouldnt trust me perhaps but think meto did apollodorus simply hold up the vial and claim hed found it on you or was it actually on your person he wrinkled his brow i remember that he tugged at it and when i looked down i saw it with my own eyes held between two straps attached to my breastplate i couldnt believe it it cant have been there when i put on my armor this morning could someone besides apollodorus have planted it on you earlier in the day he shook his head i dont see how but if such a thing could be done without my knowledge then who knows when it was done or by whom i nodded that amphora of falernianwhere did it come from it was kept in storage on one of caesars ships in the harbor along with his other personal belongings this morning quite early he sent me to fetch it did anyone know in advance that he planned to drink from it today i dont think caesar himself knew he decided on a whim he wanted to impress the queen when you fetched this amphora did you have any reason to believe it had been tampered with i dont think it had been touched since it was loaded into the ship in fact i had a hard time finding it it was buried in a corner of the hold behind a number of other items that were seized from pompeys tent at pharsalusfolding chairs lamps rugs coverlets and such there was no sign that any of the cargo had been disturbed and when i did find it i dusted it off made sure it was the falernian caesar had requested and inspected the seal to see if it was intact i checked that quite carefully after that the amphora was in my possession and never out of my sight so if youre wondering if someone knew in advance that caesar would want to open that amphora today and if that person somehow put poison in it before it was opened you can dismiss such a notion no one could conceivably have done such a thing except perhaps myself meto these walls may have ears dont say such a thing even in jest why not if a case is to be made against me we might as well work out what my accusers will say and its true the person who had the best perhaps the only opportunity to poison the amphora beforehand was me but i didnt no one did the seal was intact seals can be tampered with he shook his head i understand that you want to consider all possibilities papa but the chain of logic leads directly to the alabaster vial the vial was there it was empty and we know it contained poison he frowned what we dont know is when and how it was poured into the wine and whether it was poured into the opened amphora poisoning all the falernian or only into the cup that cleopatra offered to caesar and then compelled zoe to taste either way i dont see how it was done without any of us noticing i broke the seal and opened the amphora myself i poured the wine into the cup i cant imagine how the poison could have been added to the amphora unless of course i did it myself meto sorry papa but i did have the opportunity and i dont see how anyone else could have done it without my knowledge then perhaps only the cup was poisoned but when think back lets see if we both remember the sequence of events in the same order the queen told merianis to fetch the golden cups merianis brought them the queen showed one of them to caesar then held it while you filled it from the amphora she then presented the cup to caesar but before he could drink she called for the taster zoe came the queen handed the golden cup to merianis merianis poured a bit of the wine from the golden cup into the clay vessel that zoe had brought with her zoe drank from the clay vessel and quickly succumbed to the poison is that how you remember it meto he nodded i frowned but what happened to the wine that remained in the golden cup meto thought merianis was still holding the cup when cleopatra went to zoe but then cleopatra called for merianis and merianis put the cup down and ran to her mistress they talked for a while too low for the rest of us to hear then merianis went to fetch apollodorus so merianis put down the cup but then what became of it meto shook his head it must have been gotten rid of at some point to be sure no one drank from it yes i remember now it was after you left the island papa with those men to escort you back to your room the rest of us remained on the terrace more men arrived shortly the ones who brought me to this cell but before that happened the queen told apollodorus to pour the wine from the cup back into the amphora numas balls now the whole amphora has been poisoned whether it was poisoned before or not the amphora should have been left untouched does it really matter papa think meto if only the wine in the golden cup was poisoned and not the wine in the amphora then we could prove that you didnt poison the amphora and that the poison must have been added to the cup at some later pointa cup that was never in your possession but now we have no way of knowing if the amphora was previously poisoned or not since its surely poisoned now this was done at the queens behest yes and caesar did nothing to stop it caesar was busy questioning me at that moment neither of us took much notice of what was being done with the cup but now that you ask me i remember hearing cleopatra say something about the cup being polluted and that no one could ever drink from it again and i remember seeing apollodorus empty the cup into the amphora out of the corner of my eye so to speak was the amphora saved he wrinkled his brow i suppose so yes i remember seeing apollodorus replace the cork stopper after he emptied the cup and at the same time i was led off i think one of caesars men must have carried off the amphora so i assume its in caesars keeping but as you say we know already that it contains poison if only because the wine in the cup was poured into it youre right i cant see how the amphora will be of any use to us i cant see how any of this helps us especially i thought since all the circumstantial evidence points directly to your guilt my son still its unthinkable that a man of caesars experience and judgment should have stood by and allowed a vital piece of evidence like the amphora to become hopelessly tainted perhaps you havent noticed papa but caesar doesnt do his best thinking when hes in the presence of the queen meto keep such thoughts to yourself does it really matter what i say papa or think or do this will be the end of me i didnt try to poison caesar but i shall nevertheless be punished for the crime perhaps its fitting i stood by and did nothing when that gaulish boy who haunts my dreams was orphaned and made a slave no thats not truei joined in the slaughter with my sword and with my stylus i celebrated that slaughter by helping caesar write his memoirs now i shall die for something i never did can you hear the gods laughing papa i think the deities who hold sway over egypt must be just as capricious and cunning as our own gods no meto you will not be punished for a crime you didnt commit if it amuses the gods if it pleases caesar and satisfies queen cleopatra no i shall find the truth meto and the truth shall save you he laughed without mirth and wiped a tear from his eye ah papa i have missed you and i have missed you meto chapter xxiii you understand that i allow this only because caesar requests it the queen sat upon her throne in the reception room on the island of antirrhodus looking down her nose at me when i had visited her earlier that day accompanied by merianis i had been admitted informally into her presence the atmosphere of this second visit was very different the marble floor was hard against my knees and i felt a distinct chill in the room even though the afternoon sun shone brightly outside apollodorus and merianis are my subjects you have no right to interrogate them the word interrogation implies hostile intent your majesty i ask only to speak to them i wish only to establish the truth the truth is selfevident gordianuscalledfinder for reasons known only to himself your son sought to poison someone earlier todayperhaps caesar perhaps me perhaps both of us if you want the truth interrogate him ive questioned meto already your majesty but only by questioning all who were present can i establish the exact sequence of events enough ive told you already that i shall allow this but only because caesar himself has asked me to indulge you whom would you speak to first merianis i think very well go to the terrace outside youll find her there merianis was leaning against the low railing gazing at the skyline of the city across the water she turned at my approach gone was the cheerful expression i had come to take for granted her face was troubled is it true what they say what do you mean merianis the army under achillas is on its way to the city it could arrive in a matter of hours so caesar tells me things are coming to a head then therell be no more of this dancing about caesar will have to choose between them then we shall see a great deal of dying caesars choice would be to see the king and queen reconciled without bloodshed he still seems to believe thats possible she looked at me for a long moment then lowered her eyes this isnt what youve come to talk about no i want to understand what happened this morning you were there you saw you heard you were there as well merianis what did you see what did you hear she turned her gaze back to the city im sorry about your son gordianus why be sorry for him if you believe he tried to poison the queen im sorry for your sake gordianus im sorry that egypt has brought you such tribulations i tried to look her in the eye but she kept her face turned from me when the queen decided that the wine should be tasted she sent you to fetch zoe where did you find her in her room adjacent to the queens private quarters not in the kitchens of course not a taster is never allowed anywhere near the kitchens a taster must never eat anything that cant be accounted for zoe was alone in her room like myself she was attached to the temple of isis not a priestess no a temple slave her life was consecrated to the goddess her duty to taste the queens food was a sacred duty the rest of her time was spent in contemplation of the goddess the clay vessel zoe brought with herwhere did that come from it was her private drinking cup to be touched by no one else any liquid zoe tasted for the queen would first be poured into that cup so the keeping of the cup was one of zoes duties yes and you never touched it merianis at last looked me in the eye why do you ask such a question why do you not answer you told the queen this was not an interrogation how do you know that were you there concealed behind a curtain when i was on my knees in the queens reception room she stared across the water and made no answer you were and then you hurried here so as to be waiting for me i shook my head at such a petty deceit is that a tear on your cheek merianis wiped it away is it zoe you cry for no her death was a holy death she earned the gratitude of isis and the gift of eternal life i envy her do you merianis i think perhaps youve done as much if not more for the queen what do you mean youre very loyal to her is there nothing you would refuse to do for her i would die for the queen but would you kill for her i thought or help to send an innocent manmy sonto his death when zoe was dying in the queens arms cleopatra called you to her side you spoke in whispers what was said you go too far gordianus you have no business to inquire about words spoken privately between the queen and myself she was telling you something or asking something of you i saw the way you looked at meto then you went to fetch apollodorus what did the queen say to you merianis to repeat words spoken in confidence by the queen would be to commit sacrilege even your great caesar cant compel me to do that caesar isnt asking you i am merianis shook her head if i could save your son gordianus then something was said something you cant revealsomething that might save meto merianis sighed then drew back her shoulders and turned to face me if some struggle had taken place within her it was over now her expression was serene and opaque as unreadable as that of the sphinx the ways of the gods are sometimes obscure to us mortals gordianus but the righteous submit to their will and learn not to question dont ask me again what the queen said to me in that moment please merianis i understand that you wish to speak to apollodorus as well follow me she led me across the terrace and down a series of steps to a shaded spot near the water apollodorus was sitting on a stone bench leaning against the trunk of a palm tree and whittling a small piece of driftwood he looked up at me sullenly and flicked his wrist the knife looked very sharp i turned to say farewell to merianis but she had already vanished i looked at the piece of driftwood it was small enough to fit comfortably in the palm of his hand the sea had worn it into a curious shape suggestive of a lions head with his knife apollodorus was enhancing the semblance youre a very clever fellow i said he grunted should we speak greek i speak latin perfectly well he said looking up at me darkly his accent was atrocious but i made no comment you come from sicily i understand born there egypt suits me better how did you come to join the queens household he shrugged long story weve been through a lot the queen and i she certainly puts great trust in you i have to say your relationship strikes me as rather ambiguous he bridled what does that mean youre not like zoe a slave nor are you like merianis you dont havehow to put itthe demeanor of a priest youre not a military man like cratipus and youre not a court eunuch i certainly am not to prove it he produced a discreet movement that drew my attention to his loincloth which was draped over his person in such a way as to demonstrate convincingly the difference between himself and a eunuch ill be candid apollodorus once when i was in his presence the king suggested that your relationship to his sister is not entirely proper did he i understand people say the same thing about your son and caesar he flashed a nasty grin and whittled another slice from the driftwood she certainly indulges you how so here you sit idling away the afternoon with no apparent duties you dont know what youre talking about when the queen needs me im always there have been since she was a girl good times or badand let me tell you the last year or so has been about as bad as it gets there were days out there in the desert with ptolemys army on our heels when even the most stouthearted were ready to give up hope but never me i set an example for the others and if any man needed a kick in the behind i gave it to him no im not a priest but i know what i believe in you believe in the queen why not a mans got to believe in something the queens twice as brave as any man ive ever met and three times as smart shes got the spark if you know what i mean so far ive come across nothing better in this world and that includes your precious caesar and king ptolemy apollodorus spat on the ground hes as useless as that eunuch who leads him around by the balls what about you isnt there something you believe in i believe my son never put poison in caesars cup apollodorus stiffened he looked at the driftwood in his hand then tossed it to me i made an awkward catch to the cackle of his laughter what do you think he said i turned it about in my hand he had given the lion a fierce demeanor with a roaring mouth and exaggerated fangs been making such things since i was a boy in syracuse used to scrape a living by selling them as souvenirs to wealthy romans who came to check on their sicilian estates and now i look after the queen of egypt imagine that youre a clever fellow nimble with your fingers did you also learn to do conjuring tricks when you were a boy in syracuse what do you mean those boys on the waterfront in syracuse who accost visitors to sell them trinketssometimes their nimble fingers go where they shouldnt a sicilian urchin stole my coin purse once and right after id been paid handsomely for a bit of work that purse was heavy bulkyyet he lifted it so skillfully i never felt a thing apollodorus shrugged theres a trick to it i nodded and a trick to doing the opposite as well what do you mean nimble fingers can snatch a purse without the owner feeling a thing nimble fingers can plant such a thing upon a man as welland the victim is never the wiser apollodorus stood and shook the mane of hair from his face he stepped closer looming over me until i felt his breath on my forehead the smell was sweet as if he had been chewing cloves i think ive had enough of your questions come now did the queen not tell you to be candid with me at caesars behest ill walk you up the steps find caesars men and tell them to row you back i thought you might do that ill see you drown first he bumped against me hard enough to make me trip on the first step as i ascended i felt his warm breath on the back of my neck he escorted me as far as the terrace then headed back apollodorus i said yes some paces from me he turned back scowling im not offended that you should display the fullness of your loincloth to me in such a brazen fashion but im not especially impressed either its a pity you feel compelled to augment that which nature gave you what are you babbling about he beetled his brow and looked down between his legs where his scanty loincloth sagged and bulged in an impossibly exaggerated fashion what in hades i never he reached into the pouch and drew out the carved lions head then glared at me darkly baring his teeth i flourished my fingers over the years ive picked up a few conjurers tricks myself if i could place that object in such an intimate location without your awareness then i think it entirely possible that the alabaster vial was planted upon metos person by someone who was here on this terrace in plain sight of everyone present and without metos knowledge the only question is was that conjurer you apollodorus or was it someone else and what was that person playing at apollodorus raised his arm i ducked and heard the lions head whistle past one ear the trajectory carried it well beyond the terrace it landed in the water with a splash from driftwood it came to driftwood it returns i said the line was from euripides as i recalled i watched the little lions head bob on the water and felt a sudden thrill of intuition as if i had arrived unexpectedly and without preparation on the cusp of a great revelation what association did that bobbing piece of driftwood recall to my mind and why was it significant like a willothewisp some insight hovered tantalizingly near but out of reach if only i could grasp it i felt certain i would understand everything to do with the poisoning of the cup that morning i almost had itand then the insight receded just as the bobbing driftwood was suddenly lost to sight amid the waves i looked over my shoulder and saw that apollodorus had disappeared chapter xxiv the army headed by achillas arrived at the city that night the people of alexandria opened their gates to the soldiers with mixed emotions many thought that the roman intruders now greatly outnumbered would surely be expelled but at what cost and with what result a city is the very worst arena in which to wage a battle close quarters thwart strategy every engagement is reduced to the level of a street fight fire and destruction would threaten the people and their city no one wanted to see alexandria in flames and if after much bloodshed and devastation caesar and his men could be annihilated or driven out what would the egyptians have gained they might simply find themselves back where they began with their country still split between the royal siblings and the siblings at one anothers throats having withdrawn into a defensible portion of the royal precinct with king ptolemy and his retinue essentially being held captive caesars forces now ceded the task of maintaining order in the city to achillas and his motley army from all indications rioting and looting continued in many parts of alexandria achillass attention was split between preparing to lay siege to caesars forces and establishing control of the populace as for the unruly alexandrian mob some eagerly welcomed achillass troops and even took up arms with them while others loyal to cleopatra viewed them as an occupying army hardly preferable to that of caesar and openly defied their authority at every opportunity violently wrenched between all these conflicting powers volatile even at the best of times alexandria seemed poised to fall into utter chaos what did the crisis mean for meto it seemed for the time being at least that caesar was distracted from exercising judgment on my sona good thing for as yet i had no idea of how to prove metos innocence with the new impetus of a threatening army events moved swiftly to the surprise and relief of many in the palace caesar announced that a fresh accord had been reached between the king and queen a banquet to celebrate the event would be held in the great reception hall i was called upon to attend the room resounded with the music of pipes horns drums and rattles no doubt it was one of the pipers tunes that the little orchestra was playing when the guards showed me to my place in a corner quite distant from the dining couches gathered upon the dais where caesar sat flanked by the queen on one side and the king on the other near to ptolemy sat pothinus next to cleopatra was merianis with apollodorus standing watchfully not far off there were guards posted all around the perimeter of the room all the guards were roman by mutual consent both the kings guards and the queens had been banished caesar alone would provide for their protection caesar in a sense held them both captive the queen and king had both placed their trust in him at least for the time being and the fate of all three hung together girls strolled from couch to couch pouring wine for the guests boys traversed the room with silver platters offering delicacies a singer joined the musicians and recited a long ballad in greek about a band of explorers who sailed up the nile in search of the rivers origin encountering many wonders along the way all around me people engaged in conversations leaning forward on couches pulled into circles or reclining with their couches pulled close together headtohead but no one spoke to me the egyptians saw my roman toga and regarded me with suspicion the roman officers knowing who i was shunned me for fear of picking up metos bad fortune sitting alone i pricked up my ears and listened to what others were saying to one another hes obviously scared half out of his wits said one egyptian courtier to another both appeared quite young though age is sometimes hard to judge with eunuchs do you recall how cocky he was when he first arrived all bloated with pride over his victory at pharsalus thinking he could remake egypt with a wave of his hand then he saw pompeys head in a basket and hes been struggling to keep his own head above water ever since now achillas has arrived and caesar knows the game is over he just hopes to get out of alexandria alive a roman officer overhearing them interrupted you know you couldnt be more mistaken hows that asked the courtier curling his lip about caesar this banquet is just another demonstration of his total mastery of the situation think of it as a wedding celebration egypt is romes new bride to be put in her place with a sound thrashing if shes naughty or if shes sweet and obedient with a sound you vile roman snapped the eunuch the unpleasantness of the encounter seemed about to escalate the officer scowled youre pretty when youre angry maybe youre the one in need of a good sound both of the eunuchs shrieked with laughter the roman threw back his head and joined them i realized they knew one another already and were on friendly terms at the very least thus had the confined uncertain life in the palace bred unexpected relationships among the romans and egyptians on the dais a serving girl had arrived with a fresh pitcher of wine a protocol had been established whereby the queen would be served first then the king then caesar but ahead of them all of course a cup was poured for a taster selected and approved i assumed by all three of them the taster was a pretty young girl not unlike the late zoe perhaps another consecrated temple slave of isis she was situated on a couch in front of the dais and to one side discreetly out of the way but close at hand and with nothing to impede the line of vision between the royal couple and herself so that any plate or pitcher from which she safely partook could be taken at once to the king and queen without leaving their sight the serving slave poured a splash of wine from the pitcher into the tasters clay vessel the taster raised the cup to her lips and swallowed a vision passed before my eyes my own cup trembled in my hands so thats how it was done i whispered i looked from the taster to merianis and felt a pain in my heart compounded of anger and remorse i would have to share my sudden revelation with caesar at once to do so would mean the end of merianis and perhaps the end of cleopatra what had they intended which of them was more culpable was it possible that merianis had acted without her queens knowledge it would be up to caesar to determine the answers to those questions but whatever he might discover by torture and interrogation and whatever excuses the guilty might offer surely even caesars muchcelebrated clemency could not extend to forgiving the deception that had been perpetrated that day on antirrhodus it would not be meto who fell to harsh roman justice i now knew a way to prove his innocence i stood unsteadily my legs trembling i braced myself and strode across the crowded room directly toward the dais cleopatra was the first to notice my approach she gave me a withering look that made it clear she thought i had no business being in the room at all merianis sensing her queens displeasure followed her gaze and drew a sharp breath when she saw me then lowered her eyes did she realize what was about to happen when ptolemy saw me he flashed a quizzical smile had he heard about the poisoning on antirrhodus and metos imprisonment or had caesar managed to keep that intelligence from him that question was answered when i looked at pothinus whose cool appraising glance told me that he was entirely aware of my situation at last caesar noticed my approach he had been smiling at some quip from ptolemy but his smile vanished at once in the mirror of his face i saw how terrible my countenance must appear i was the messenger in the play who arrives bearing news that will shatter all expectations guards abruptly converged from either side to check my approach caesar raised his hands to order them back i stopped at the foot of the dais and looked up at him a hush had fallen on the room as others noticed my approach and the reactions of those on the dais do you have something to say to me gordianus yes consul but not here if i could speak to you in private i cast a glance at the queen and merianis can this not wait gordianus if i can tell him who poisoned the wine on antirrhodus would the consul have me wait i lowered my voice as much as i could but it was impossible to keep those on either side from overhearing i felt the eyes of the king and queen upon us and caesar must have felt them as well step closer gordianus i stepped onto the dais if we could speak in private he shook his head the purpose for this festive occasion takes precedence over all else gordianus including any news you may have for me im on the verge of announcing a glorious peace in egypt i will not interrupt the banquet not even for this step closer and whisper into my ear if you wish i dropped to one knee before him he leaned forward and inclined his head meto is innocent consul i can prove it here and now if youll allow it how bring the amphora of falernian that meto brought to antirrhodus have it tasted and kill another pretty temple slave the taster will not die because the amphora was never poisoned ill drink from it myself if you wish he drew back just enough to look me in the eye what are you saying gordianus the wine in the amphora was never poisoned he thought for a moment but at the queens behest the wine from the golden cup was poured back into the amphora nor was there ever poison in the golden cup the queen presented to caesar caesar frowned and yet the temple slave zoe most certainly died because her cup was poisonedthe clay cup from which she and she alone ever drank and that later was broken when she fell that cup and only that cup was poisoned do you remember when merianis fetched her zoe brought her own cup with her and merianis proceeded to fill that cup with wine from the golden cup but the wine itself was untainted the poison was already in zoes cup put there without zoes knowledge put there by whom perhaps by the person who fetched her i said though it was hard to imagine that merianis was capable of such coldblooded treachery but the alabaster vial was later found upon meto the vial was planted upon meto by apollodorus and who went to fetch apollodorus i kept my eyes lowered but caesar looked past me toward merianis youre saying both were involvedmerianis and apollodorus at least those two i said thinking of a third but not daring to say her name but why what was their purpose of that im not sure consul but consider meto distrusted the queen meto despaired of the queens influence upon you the queenthose near the queen i meanmight wish to see meto discredited how better to do that than to make him appear guilty of a crime against the consul caesar looked at me gravely what you suggest is monstrous gordianus without naming her you implicate a certain person in a plot to deceive me if that should be true then the purpose of this banquet is negated i should have to reconsider who should inherit the late kings throne and whether that throne should be shared he looked toward ptolemy and sighed considering whose army has occupied alexandria it would certainly be easier to simply his voice trailed off i thought he was lost in thought until i followed his gaze and saw that someone else was approaching the dais so i must have appeared i thought as i looked upon the face of samuel caesars barber the little man threaded his way between the dining couches resolute but trembling slightly anxiously shifting his gaze from face to face looking as if he had swallowed something very bitter what now muttered caesar samuel hurried to the dais the guards looked to caesar for instruction and stepped back at his signal what do you want samuel master i must speak to you at once he glanced at pothinus who frowned in private caesar looked at me askance you appear to have a twin tonight gordianus like the gemini he looked at the barber come samuel gordianus has one of my ears you may have the other the little fellow scrambled onto the dais and rushed to his masters side he knelt and pressed a scrap of papyrus into caesars hand while caesar read samuel whispered in his ear the barber spoke in a frantic rush too low for me to hear and caesar held the papyrus so that i could not read it though i caught a glimpse of greek letters the news caused the color to drain from caesars cheeks caesar lowered the parchment he raised his hand to samuel signaling that he had heard enough pothinus he said looking straight ahead his voice was low and even but something in his tone chilled my blood consul pothinus furrowed his brow come here pothinus the eunuch cleared his throat there was a tremor in his voice the lord chamberlain of the king of egypt is not a servant to be summoned by anyone other than the king not even the consul of pothinus come here caesars voice was like thunder the eunuch stood ptolemy looked from pothinus to caesar and back for a brief moment i saw confusion on the kings face before he assumed the masklike countenance at which he was so adept pothinus stepped toward caesar slowly and carefully as one might approach a lion what does the consul require caesar thrust the papyrus toward him were these words written by your hand lord chamberlain pothinus flashed a supercilious grin the lord chamberlain is accustomed to dictating documents the actual writing is done by a scribe unless the words in a letter are too sensitive to be heard by even the most trusted scribeor overheard by all the spies who lurk in the walls of this palace pothinus glared at samuel and then at caesar i think the consul is no stranger at playing spymaster himself caesar cast a fond glance at samuel some of my men occasionally make a jest at samuels expense they call him timorous they say he jumps at the sight of his own shadow but that fearful quality makes samuel very observant some make fun of his small stature but that quality too has its virtues for it helps a man to come and go unobserved and sometimes even to walk through walls then you admit that this wretch has been spying on me samuel merely looks out for his masters safety he needs no instruction from me but yes samuel has been observing you pothinus he knows your movements he watched you write this letter which at samuels request some of my men seized from your messenger the messenger can be tortured to divulge the source of the letteror you can simply admit that you wrote it pothinus lies the creature has fabricated this elaborate deceit hes betrayed you consul he makes you look a fool i think not pothinus if a man cant trust his barber whom can he trust caesar again thrust the letter before pothinus take it read it aloud pothinus took the papyrus he stared at it and rocked slightly forward and back as if he were lightheaded he looked desperately at ptolemy your majesty the king glowered at him do as the consul says lord chamberlain read it commanded caesar pothinus gave a start and obeyed to achillas commander of the forces of our rightful king from pothinus lord chamberlain as you may ascertain from the seal on this letter greetings there you see the seal was broken the wax is missing theres nothing to prove read on pothinus growled caesar read on and do not stop until the letter is finished or ill have my men skewer you from all sides at a nod from caesar one of the guards gave pothinus a poke in the back with his spear the eunuch yelped please consul very well ill read though previously i have counseled the king to make a compromise satisfactory to the roman intruder if only as a matter of show i now see that any compromise can lead only to disaster we must take action and quickly i shall do what i can within the palace but our enemies are well guarded especially so following an unsuccessful attempt at poison by persons unknown do you see consul the letter proves i had nothing to do with the recent attempt on your life i have no idea read on pothinus gave another yelp and contorted his back i could see by a red stain on his robe that the spear had drawn blood he gasped and continued reading i will do what i can to solve the problem myself but meanwhile you must be prepared to wage battle against the enemies who now hold the king hostage on no account must the kings life be endangered there your majesty do you see the proof of my loyalty to you will you not command this roman to call off his mastiffs ptolemy regarded pothinus with an inscrutable gaze read on lord chamberlain pothinus trembled violently his voice quavered on no account must the kings life be endangered but no matter how regrettable casualties within the palace may be unavoidable in the event that the worst should come to pass i have taken steps to smuggle the kings sister arsinoe out of the palace she should arrive in your keeping just ahead of this letter keep her safe for to maintain our legitimacy with the populace at least one member of the royal bloodline must survive the coming battle do what you must to eliminate the false queen and to expel the foreign intruder your majesty i meant that caesar himself may kill you if pressed to desperation by achillas i have never been anything less than your most loyal silence caesar stood and snatched the letter from pothinuss trembling hands this document clearly spells out your intention to murder me and to assassinate the queen it also exhorts achillas to attack the palace with reckless disregard for the safety of king ptolemy and in contravention of the peaceful accord reached between the king and his sister that makes you a wouldbe assassin a conspirator and a traitor pothinus the eunuch threw himself at ptolemys feet your majesty do you not see whats happened caesar has made you his hostage and hes forced this accord upon you to further his own ambitions its cleopatra hes sided with from the moment he met her the reason is simple she can give him a child when that happens caesar will declare himself king of egypt with cleopatra as his queen and the child as their heir and it will be the end of you your majesty and the end of your dynasty egypt shall be ruled by romans and the images of your ancestors will be replaced by images of caesar ptolemy looked down his long nose at the eunuch caesar is my friend if you believe that your majesty then put his friendship to the test leave the palace join achillas and your army let me accompany you the eunuch wishes only to save his own neck growled caesar ptolemy abruptly stood with such force that he knocked pothinus aside the eunuch groveled at his feet youve forgotten your place lord chamberlainthough from this moment you no longer occupy that position so i shall address you simply as pothinus you think im still a child easily bent to your will you fancy yourself the secret ruler of egypt and myself a mere puppet upon the throne your majesty where do these notions come from the roman has poisoned your mind silence do you think my mind so feeble that caesar can shape it at will is your estimation of me that low yes i think it is regrettableisnt that the word you used in that letter to describe my death should achillas storm the palace and kill me in the process you shall regret your own death far more pothinus no your majesty please listen there is no more to be said pothinus i strip you of your title and your post i expel you from the privileges of the royal household now and for all eternity for your crimes against me you shall be executed and your body defiled your flesh shall be fodder for carrion birds you shall be cursed by the gods not only your body but your ka shall perish forever and it shall be as if pothinus never existed thus do traitors meet their end pothinus wailed and hid his face caesar stood and stepped to ptolemys side your majesty since youve cast off the eunuch and since he has offended against me as well conspiring to kill me i ask a favor of you let me pass judgment on him and see to his punishment no pothinus gazed up at the two of them with a woeful expression the roman seeks to take even this prerogative from you your majesty its caesar who treats you as a child silence pothinus the king glared down at him then turned to caesar because caesar requests it and because caesar is my dearest friend i make a gift of this criminal to caesar who may do as he wishes with the wretch the romans boast of their great love of justice do they not caesar perhaps you can teach me a lesson on this subject how will you dispose of pothinus caesar looked down at the cringing eunuch then turned briefly to regard the queen who had watched the entire episode in silence wearing an expression as bland as her brothers at his most inscrutable as he turned back for a long moment caesars eyes met mine and i saw that he had not forgotten what i had told him samuel go to my quarters youll find an amphora there clearly marked falernianopen only in the presence of gnaeus pompey magnus bring it to me at once the barber nodded jumped to his feet and rushed off caesar regarded me and seeing the expression on my face he stepped toward me and spoke in a low voice you look puzzled gordianus what game are you playing at consul not a game a test according to you the amphora of falernian was never poisoned nor was the golden cup merianis put poison in the tasters clay vessel and apollodorus planted the empty alabaster vial on your son if thats true the falernian was untainted and remains so for i had it resealed with wax before i let it out of my sight again are you certain of this allegation gordianus its the only explanation consul unless of course meto poisoned the amphorain which case the falernian will kill anyone who drinks it i shook my head thats not possible consul we shall see i had thought that tonight might be a joyous occasion a chance to celebrate reconciliation and peace instead it seems im fated to learn who are my friends and who are my foes he cast a glance at ptolemy then at cleopatra samuel breathing hard arrived with the amphora caesar inspected the new seal which bore the impression of his own ring satisfied he nodded to samuel who cut the seal away pour a cup samuel here use mine since im certain no ones tampered with it the barber poured a measure of wine into the cup stand up pothinus the eunuch rose to his feet a mingled look of dread and defiance on his face consul i whispered what are you thinking this isnt roman justice this is pure capriciousness the gods are capricious so must we sometimes be if we would emulate the gods it is also a way to determine the truth gordianus and are you not always in favor of that the queen sat forward frowning what do you intend to do caesar merianis looked at her lap and nervously pulled at her fingers apollodorus stood with his arms crossed and his jaw thrust forward yes caesar said ptolemy why do you not have the traitor strangled here and now because i intend to offer pothinus a choice which may yet allow him to live this is a cup of falernian wine pothinus it comes from the private stores of pompey falernian wine is legendary its the best of all the vintages of italy but this amphora mayor may notcontain a deadly poison which is it i should like to know rather than test it on a hapless slave i offer it to you pothinus you demean me roman no pothinus i offer you a chance to livewhich is far more than you deserve if the wine is wholesome and you drink it without ill effect i shall release you and allow you to join achillas outside the palace gordianus here shall enjoy the second cup and the rest of us will share a fine falernian tonight but if the wine is poisoned you lie whether its poisoned or not youll have me killed before i can leave this room im a man of my word eunuch make up your mind take the cup or not from the shiftiness of pothinuss eyes i sensed the debate that raged in his mind so long as he had his wits and a voice to beg he might yet contrive some way to win ptolemys mercy but once he drank from the cup there could be no turning back i myself felt a sudden tremor of doubt the logic of my argument to caesar was compelling of that i was certain and yet i recalled the inchoate flash of intuition i had felt when i questioned apollodorus somehow tied to the piece of driftwood he had carved into a lions head that moment of insight fleeting and inconclusive still had seemed to be absolutely authenticand yet it had no connection to what was happening now was i mistaken about the amphora i found myself almost wishing that pothinus would refuse to take it but at last the prospect of freedom held out by caesar won pothinus over he took the cup gazed for a moment at his reflection in the wine then drank it in a single draught i looked at those on the dais and saw them all watching with bated breath i glanced over my shoulder the guests upon their dining couches looked like silent spectators at a play intent upon the climax at the far corner of the room i glimpsed the two egyptian courtiers and the roman who had teased them the three now sat close together on a single couch interrupted in their merrymaking and struck dumb by the drama on the dais pothinus thrust the cup back into caesars hands and stood erect turning his head this way and that to glare defiantly at those around him he licked his lips ground his teeth and took a deep breath he shut his eyes tightly for a moment then opened them again smiled and turned to caesar there roman are you satisfied you feel nothing only the satisfaction that comes from drinking a truly fine wine a pity that the great one himself was never able to taste it well are you as good as your word caesar will you let me go now caesar tilted his head back and studied pothinus for a long moment then turned his gaze to me he did not look happy so gordianus it seems that you were right the amphora was not poisoned only the tasters cup the unpleasant occurrence on antirrhodus was due to the actions of someone i thought i could trust someone whos become very close to me his eyes moved in the direction of the queen but before his gaze fell upon her pothinus made a noise that drew his attention the sound came from deep in the eunuchs throat a grunt that emerged as a stifled gasp he gave a jerk as if someone had poked him in a delicate place and took a step back putting his hands on his belly no he whispered this isnt happening he grimaced and turned toward the king you ungrateful little viper you and your sister deserve one another and you both deserve the ruin that caesar has in store for you he dropped to his knees clutching himself and convulsing a curse on you caesar may you die as pompey died cut to shreds and covered in blood he fell onto his side and drew his knees to his chest even as he gave a final twitch the king stepped forward and gave him a hard kick that sent him rolling off the dais limp and lifeless the eunuchs body fell heavily to the floor i looked at caesar who stared at the dead body with eyes wide and unblinking his face was like wax the eunuchs curse had unnerved him at last he shuddered and shook off the spell he looked at me and flashed a rueful smile so gordianus it seems youre mistaken the queens companions are innocent the blame for what happened on antirrhodus falls on your son after all i shook my head no consul there must be another explanation silence the king has rid himself of a traitor who managed to climb very high in his esteem i shall follow the kings example i shall rid myself of the traitor in my midst meto will be executed tomorrow i staggered back as stunned as if caesar had struck me lightheaded i looked at cleopatra the queen was smiling chapter xxv it was good of caesar to allow us this final visit said meto he sat on his cot staring at the dank stones of the opposite wall from the high barred window came the sounds of a hot summer morning the creaking of anchored ships the cry of hungry gulls the shouts of caesars sailors making sure that nothing was amiss achillas had nominal control over most of the city including the island of pharos with its lighthouse as well as the smaller eunostos harbor south of the pharos causeway but caesars control of the great harbor remained unchallenged good of him i shook my head which was full of cobwebs i had spent a miserable sleepless night struggling in vain to think of some way to save my son it was good of caesar to allow us this final visit loyal meto faithful to caesar to the very last even as caesar prepares to put an end to you what else can he do papa someone tried to poison him on antirrhodus not me but every bit of evidence points to me he cant let such an act go unpunished but what point is there in punishing an innocent manand a man as unfailingly loyal as you when i think of the sacrifices youve made for that man the terrible risks youve taken all done of my own volition i chose to serve caesar he allowed me the privilege dont forget that i began life as a slave papa i never forget when i adopted you all that changed no papa the past never vanishes not entirely you made me your son and a citizen you changed the course of my life completely and for that im more grateful than you can know caesar took me into his confidence gave me a role to play in his grand scheme and even gave me a kind of loveand for that too im grateful my life has been richer than i could ever have dreamed when i was a boyall the richer because i had no right and no reason to expect that such wonders awaited me i never took them for granted but you disowned me meto forgive me it was the worst mistake i ever made if i could undo that moment i would he shrugged you did what you felt you had to do and now caesar will do what he must perhaps he truly believes i tried to poison him either that or the alternative is simply unacceptable to himthat the queen for her own reasons incriminated me he must act and if he must make a choice between cleopatra and me then he chooses cleopatra and who am i to object im merely a slave who had the good fortune to rise beyond his station she is the queen of egypt and the heir of the ptolemies and if one believes the egyptians a goddess as well her destiny is written in the stars in the great scheme of things my fate matters not at all no meto i dont accept such a notion your life matters as much as anyone elses ive spent my life stepping through the mess made by these socalled great men and women theyre no better than criminals and madmen but because they perpetrate their crimes on such a grand scale the rest of us are expected to bow before them in awe the gods love me they say to excuse their crimes and draw men to their cause but if the gods so love them then why do they die so horribly look at what happened to pompey gutted like a fish on the shores of egypt look at the horrible ends that awaited milo clodius marcus caelius catilina domitius ahenobarbus curiothe list goes on and on mark my words the same fate will befall cleopatra and yes even your beloved caesar are you a soothsayer now papa meto laughed without mirth this simply brings us back to the same old argument between us the breach that led you to disown me you think i give too much blind devotion to a man like caesar that i willfully contribute to the mess as you call it that he leaves behind in his wake and perhaps youre right i share your doubts i share your resentment that the world should be as it isso harsh and cruel and full of lies but in the end papa ive chosen to take part in that world to embrace the way of the warrior and the spy and for that ill now pay the price just as caesar will sooner or later pay a price if what you say is true he lifted his eyes and scanned the wall but should you be giving voice to such seditious thoughts papa it was you who warned me that we should speak discreetly considering the porousness of these palace walls what does it matter now caesars made up his mind hes the king of rome in fact if not in name and we are all at his mercy do you suppose hell allow me a choice of deaths i should like to fall upon my sword like an honorable roman or will he force me to drink from the amphora to pay for the crime of poisoning it the way he forced pothinus to drink and die in front of all those people i shuddered and fought back tears caesar didnt force him to drinkthat was what made his death so terrible if you could have seen caesar last night meto lounging up on that dais dispensing justice willynilly like the most decadent asian potentate he told me he learned lessons about being a ruler from king nicomedes and now he feels disposed to pass on those lessons to young ptolemy what sort of example did he set with his treatment of pothinus the eunuch was no better than the rest of them another ruthless schemer with a penchant for murder but he was no worse either he may or may not have deserved a traitors death but for caesar to taunt him in that fashion pressing him to gamble his own life on a whim to satisfy caesars curiositythe capriciousness of it sickened me and caesar knew there was something unseemly about pothinuss death you should have seen his face when the eunuch cursed him caesar doesnt believe in curses not even a curse spoken by a dying man with his final breath meto shook his head curse or no curse once a mans dead theres nothing left to fear from him what was it pothinus himself said to the king when he was justifying their plot to murder pompey dead men dont bite i nodded then stiffened and let out a gasp as i felt a thrill run through meexactly such a thrill of intuition as i had felt that day when i gazed at apollodoruss carved piece of driftwood bobbing on the waves but now instead of fleeing before i could grasp it the insight erupted in my consciousness fullblown inescapable undeniable i turned and banged my fist on the locked door jailer come at once meto rose from the cot papa you cant leave now surely we have more to say and say it we shall meto at some later date because this is not our final meeting jailer let me out i must be allowed to see caesar at once i found caesar dressed not as consul in his toga but in the military garb of imperator with his famous red cape billowing slightly in the sea breeze that swept through the high room from the terrace that faced the lighthouse the room had the tense hurried atmosphere of a commanders tent on a field of battle thus i remembered encountering caesar in his camp outside brundisium just before he drove pompey from italy surrounded by his coterie of young lieutenants all buzzing with questions and reports and running this way and that at the sight of me caesar held up his hand to silence the officer who happened to have caught his attention a moment before excuse me officers but i require a moment alone with this citizen every man in the room knew who i wasthe father of the condemned metoand from some i received reproving stares from others looks of sympathy as a body they collected themselves rolling up documents and maps and withdrew to the antechamber even after the doors were shut i could still hear the low roar of their urgent conversations i looked at caesar is there a crisis consul or should i say imperator a crisis of sorts achillas has moved certain of his forces forward and withdrawn others to various parts of the city in apparent preparation for an attack on our position it may be that news of pothinuss death has reached him and this is his reaction or perhaps an attack was planned all along at any rate we must be prepared for the worst will achillas attack without a direct order from king ptolemy that remains to be seen even as you arrived we were debating various ways to make the kings will known to achillas without endangering either the king or our own messengers achillas murdered a pair of envoys i dispatched to him earlier the mans no better than a brigand he reminds me of the pirates who kidnapped me when i was young and we all know what happened to them the crucifixion of the pirates was a seminal chapter in the legend of caesars career achillas murdered pompey with his own sword i should like nothing better than to see him meet the same fate as his accomplice the late pothinus pompey was killed with the kings consent i said if not at his instigation will the king be punished as well dont be absurd gordianus once certain baleful influences are removed the king will truly be able to come into his own i have no doubt that he and his sister will be among romes strongest allies even as he said this i saw that some other contrary thought was at work in his mind but we had strayed from the purpose of my visit caesar abruptly became impatient with our conversation you can see that im very busy gordianus ive permitted you an audience only because of the urgency of your request and because of your assurance that this meeting will bear fruit ive sent for those you asked me to summon they should be here at any moment you say you know conclusively what occurred on antirrhodus and that meto is completely innocent youd better be able to prove it those you summoned know the truth in bits and pieces if theyll only admit to what they know then caesar shall see the truth in full the officer who was manning the door hurried to caesars side and spoke in his ear the first of those you asked me to summon is here said caesar then to the officer show him in a moment later the doors opened to admit a small wiry fellow his hair and his beard were not as neatly trimmed as when i had first seen him on pompeys ship captivityfirst as the kings prisoner now as caesarsdid not agree with pompeys freedman philip he had become haggard and disheveled and had a fretful look in his eye that made me worry that his mind might have become a bit unbalanced when he saw me he frowned the look in his eyes became even wilder do you remember me philip i said we gathered driftwood together to build a funeral pyre for your old master of course i remember you i remember everything about that accursed day if only i could forget he lowered his eyes i see youve fallen into caesars clutches too i recalled that he had assumed i was one of pompeys veterans so griefstricken at seeing the great one struck down that i had leaped overboard and swum ashore and for that reason he had trusted me i saw no need to disabuse him of the notion we are all in caesars hands now i said looking sidelong at caesar philip i desperately need your assistance as i helped you that day on the beach to give the great one proper rites will you now help me in return what do you need from me i drew a deep breath on the previous night i had felt certain of the scenario i put forth to caesar to discount metos role in the poisoning and i had been proven utterly woefully wrong what if i were mistaken again perhaps intuition and judgment alike had deserted me i saw the apprehensive expression on caesars face and knew that i suddenly looked as wildeyed as philip i fought back the sudden fear and uncertainty that swept over me philip you were there with the great one at pharsalus were you not yes he looked shiftily at caesar and i could sense the hatred and revulsion he felt for the man who had destroyed his beloved master caesar interrupted ive already questioned this man about everything to do with pharsalus and with pompeys murder and with all that occurred between yes caesar but i think there may be a matter that escaped your questioning what was it you said about your interrogation of philip the night we dined together that he was forthcoming about some things reticent about others i think i know one of the things he was reluctant to talk about caesar looked at me sharply then at philip go on gordianus philip when pompeys forces were defeated at pharsalus it came as a great shock to him did it not yes but not a complete surprise i think he knew that caesar was a formidable foe caesar had already driven him from italy and crushed pompeys allies in spain pompey must have had in his mind some idea that he might eventually face defeat yes philip looked at me warily but finally nodded at pharsalus i said the battle began early in the day with caesars javelins attacking pompeys front line the struggle was bloody and closefought but as the day wore on and the sun reached its zenith pompeys men panicked and broke the line pompeys infantry were encircled his cavalry gave way and fled caesars cavalry hunted them down and slaughtered a great many scattering the rest while the main body of caesars infantry converged on pompeys camp the rumor goes that the great one confident of victory had retired at midday to his pavilion to eat a meala very sumptuous meal with silver plates and the very finest wine worthy of a victory banquet that was the scene caesar encountered when he entered the camp and strode into pompeys pavilion only to find that the great one had fled moments before so goes the tale as i heard it in rome but this is what i think when pompey retired to his pavilion he had no illusions that he had won the battle quite the opposite he stayed long enough to see the tide turn against him then rode back to his camp knowing that all was lost he retired to his pavilion to await the inevitable end he gathered his closest associatesincluding you philipand demanded that a lavish banquet be served at once he ordered a very trusted subordinatewas it not you philipto fetch a very special amphora of falernian wine that he had been saving for just that occasion and that occasion alone do you remember what you said to me philip as you wept for pompey on the beach i remember though at the time i didnt fully understand he should have died at pharsalus you said not like this but at a time and in the manner of his own choosing when he knew that all was lost he made up his mind to do so what were his exact words to you philip philip gazed vacantly looking beyond me into his memory of that terrible day at pharsalus the great one said to me help me philip help me keep up my courage ive lost the game i have no stomach for the aftermath let this place be the end of me let the history books say the great one died at pharsalus i nodded but at the last moment he lost his nerve isnt that what you told me philip pompey the great quailed and fled so quickly that you had to run after him to keep up i shook my head i heard but i misunderstood i thought you meant he was in the midst of his premature victory banquet when he realized that all was lost and he looked in vain for the courage to pick up his sword and die fighting only to lose his nerve and ride off on a horse instead but even before the banquet began he knew that he was finished indeed it was when the banquet was served that he asked you to help him find the courage to die as he had previously decided to die should everything go against him it wasnt a victory banquet it was a farewell feast that carefully sealed amphora of falernian wine he had been carrying around with him from battlefield to battlefield to be opened only in the presence of pompey himselfwhat was so very special about that wine philip philip shook his head not wanting to answer but caesar was beginning to understand pompey meant to die by his own choice caesar said not by falling on a swordbut by poison i nodded with his closet friends around him surrounded by the trappings of wealth and luxury and with a fine meal in his stomach but then the ramparts were overrun and you yourself came riding through the camp consul pompey faced a choice he could no longer postpone capture and humiliation or a quick sure death by poisonthe same poison his wife kept close at hand in case she too should face such a choice he had only to unseal the falernian drink a cup and make his exit to oblivion that had been his plan but when the crisis came he couldnt do it was it fear of death perhaps but i think his will to live another day even in misery and defeat was simply too strong he ran from the tent mounted the first horse he found and rode off escaping in the very nick of time and you rode after him philip leaving the sealed amphora of falernian behind caesar looked at philip is this true philip lowered his eyes and gritted his teeth his silence was answer enough caesar shook his head and to think had i been of pompeys ilk craving luxury and selfindulgence at every turn instead of overseeing the last stages of the battle i might have sat down to help myself to a plate of pompeys venison and a flagon of his falerniana victory feastand i would have died then and there of poison or indeed i might have died any day since on any occasion i chose to drink pompeys falernian i nodded as the great one himself was well aware he said as much to me when he summoned me to his ship caesar may yet get his just deserts he told me and when he least expects it one moment hell be alive and the nextdead as king numa i thought that he meant he had an assassin in your midst or that he was simply ravingbut he was talking about the falernian which he knew had fallen into your hands and which as he hoped you might any day decide to open and drink which must have been the hope of this scheming freedman here as well eh philip you knew about the falernian yet you never warned me about it did you hope that i might yet drink it and die the death pompey was too craven to claim for himself yes cried philip to his shame the great one discovered he was incapable of suicide so he came to egypt insteadwhich amounted to the same thing i often wonder if he didnt come here knowing these monsters would do away with him and thus relieve him of the burden of doing away with himself but the acts of men live after them and there was one hope left to methat sooner or later messengers would come running through the palace shouting the good news caesar is dead no one knows how no one knows whyhe was simply drinking a cup of wine and suddenly dropped dead could it be poison oh dear the little man seethed with sarcasm and fury and so it would have been caesar said coldly had i drunk the wine that day on antirrhodus i would have died struck down by a dead man dead men dont bite i said that was what pothinus said of pompey but he was wrong even dead pompey might have exacted a final revenge upon you caesar as it happened the falernian killed the queens taster instead and the confusion spawned by that event very nearly drove you to do away with metowho as you now must realize was innocent all along caesar looked at me sidelong but what of the alabaster vial discovered on metos persona vial that we know contained poison and that was empty when we found it with timing as perfect as that of a messenger in a play the soldier guarding the door stepped forward to tell caesar that the others he had summoned had arrived take this creature away ordered caesar referring to philip and show the others in chapter xxvi apollodorus entered first followed by merianis both looking grim i glanced at caesar and saw that grimness mirrored on his face then another expression hard to discernconsternation resignation apprehensioncrossed his countenance as cleopatra entered the room i had asked caesar to summon her minions without the queen and without her knowledge if possible yet here she was she swept into the room fully outfitted in royal dress draped in goldandscarlet robes with the vultureheaded uraeus crown upon her head her presence now was very different from that which she projected at ease in her own quarters on antirrhodus and more different still from that of the seductress who had emerged from the rug in this very room even when i had seen her in her robes of state in the reception room on formal occasions she had not possessed the air of majesty that radiated from her now she cast a singeing glance at me then turned a softer gaze to caesar the consul desires to question my subjects yet again caesar cleared his throat gordianus has been able after all to cast some light upon the events that occurred on antirrhodus she raised an eyebrow something to do with the freedman philip whom i passed in the hall outside perhaps suffice to say that the amphora of falernian had been poisoned even before it was opened we may discuss the details at another time but for now that fact has been demonstrated to my satisfaction the queen slowly nodded which presents a very awkward question yes how did it come to pass that the empty alabaster vial was discovered on metos person when the vial as it turns out had nothing to do with the poisoning a curious situation curious indeed your majesty and most distressing yet im convinced that someone here among us can explain it a silence settled over the room at last the queen spoke is the simplest explanation not the most likely you say the amphora was already poisoned but could it not have been doubly poisoned the vial was found on meto the vial was empty i suggest that meto acquired the vial from gordianuswith or without his fathers knowledgeand conspired to use it perhaps against you caesar or perhaps to do away with us both he fetched the amphora for you and brought it to antirrhodus doing so he saw his opportunity to use the poison so he brought that with him as well when he opened the amphora he opened the vial at the same time and emptied it into the amphora none of us noticed simply because none of us were watching you say the amphora was already poisoned it appears that meto acted in ignorance of that fact but with no less malice his crime was no less heinous for being redundant the queen in making this assertion stood erect and kept her voice low and steady with a gaze that never wavered cicero himself standing in the forum before a skeptical jury could not have delivered the argument with greater authority but caesar was not convinced what your majesty says makes perfect sense yet the explanation does not satisfy me he turned his gaze to merianis who lowered her eyes and bit her lip the exuberant smiling beautiful young woman who had greeted me when i first arrived at the palace seemed very far away at that moment replaced by a haggard figure whose shifty eyes and furtive manner reminded me more of philip since the death of zoe on antirrhodus i had not seen a smile on merianiss face each time i saw her she looked more haunted perhaps merianis you can offer an explanation that gives more satisfaction said caesar she shivered though the room was warm she lifted her eyes just enough to cast a questioning look at the queen who responded with an almost imperceptible nod i confess said merianis her voice trembled explain said caesar i did what i did to hurt meto it was a shameful act unworthy of a priestess of isis go on said caesar yes merianis go on said the queen her voice stern i shook my head consul when i asked you to summon the queens subjects this was not what i had in mind this is quiet gordianus i shall conduct the questioning go on merianis explain to me what you did that day i had nothing to do with the poisoning but when zoe died and the queen called me to her side yes i remember said caesar you conversed in whispers she merely told me to fetch apollodorus you conversed at some length and with noticeable emotion ii was jarred by what had happened i was confused and upset the queen had to repeat herself she became impatient with me caesar nodded and then i saw you look at meto your expression was strange i looked at him strangely because that was the moment i conceived of the plot against him i see go on the queen told me to bring apollodorus i ran to find him but first first i went to my room to fetch the vial of poison then it was you who took the vial from gordianuss trunk said caesar yes but how did you even know about the vials existence and what it contained on the day i brought meto to his room gordianus asked me to leavebut i lingered in the hallway outside i listened to their conversation i heard what gordianus said about the vial and the poison insideand i also heard what meto told him to get rid of it later when i had a chance i took the vial from the trunkbut only because i feared that gordianus might be tempted to use it against himself and i could not bear the thought her eyes met mine at last thats the truth i swear to you by isis i stole the vial only because i wanted to protect you from yourself gordianus please believe me i drew a breath to speak but caesar raised a hand to silence me go on merianis he said the queen sent me to fetch apollodorus but first i ran to my room and found the vial i emptied it you hadnt emptied it before caesar asked sharply why did you not empty it when you stole it if your purpose was to keep the poison from being used merianis became flustered youre right it was empty alreadyi forgot im becoming confused again go on caesars tone made even cleopatra wince merianis began to weep when i found apollodorus i quickly explained what had happened and i told him of my desire that he should place the empty vial upon the person of meto so that meto would be blamed for the poisoning but why merianis what was your grudge against meto not a grudge a broken heart from the moment i saw him i desired him he should have desired me in return i made my feelings plain to him and he spurned me i wanted him to suffer she shuddered and hid her face in her hands and you apollodorus caesar cast a burning gaze at the tall sicilian you went along with this deception before in every circumstance apollodoruss attitude had been utterly selfassured even brazenly defiant but now he lowered his eyes and spoke in a hoarse whisper i did what merianis asked me to do but why apollodorus because he spoke through gritted teeth because i love her i see caesar nodded gravely you must love her very much indeed i do i could no longer remain quiet caesar i saidbut again he silenced me with his hand and an angry glare he turned to cleopatra what does your majesty have to say about this her demeanor was more haughty than ever cleopatra seemed as cool and unassailable as a pillar of marble such a deception impugns the dignity of the consul to be sure no less than it impugns the majesty of the queen if she too was deceived by her servants yes but their crime is less heinous than that of poisoning hardly less heinous if the result had been the execution of one of my closest lieutenants an innocent man caesar took a deep breath your majesty there must be a reckoning a ripple of dismay marred the bland perfection of the queens composure like a windflaw on flat water there was a very slight catch in her voice when she spoke the consul speaks justly there must be a reckoning for this deceit and so there shall be she turned her gaze first to merianis and then to apollodorus something profound was communicated in the look the queen exchanged with these two the closest of all her subjects the queen gave them a silent order in silence they accepted it the three of them seemed transported to a plane of existence where neither caesar nor i could follow thus i excuse my inaction during the events that immediately followed they became like actors on the stage and caesar and i became mute spectators able only to watch in horror and awe apollodorus produced a dagger later i would wonder why caesars guards had not disarmed him but as we knew already he was skilled at sleight of hand and somehow he had slipped the weapon past them apollodorus turned to merianis who stood trembling with her eyes shut as if she knew what would happen next her lips moved soundlessly reciting a prayer apollodorus plunged the knife into her heart i think she died very quickly for she made only a small sibilant utterancesweet isisas she collapsed to the floor her body convulsed for a moment and then became utterly still without hesitation apollodorus knelt planted the long bloody dagger upright before him and fell upon it with his full weight his death was more unseemly than that of merianis he grunted coughed blood on the floor and expelled a rattling breath my queen he cried struggling to lift his eyes to gain a final glimpse of cleopatra his eyes rolled back in his head his jaw gaped blood ran from his mouth he fell onto his side drawing his knees to his chest his feet twitched and kicked and then he lay as still as merianis the guard at the door gave a shout and came running quickly followed by others caesar raised his arm stay back but consul protested the guard leave us now looking askance at the queen and mumbling among themselves caesars men withdrew cleopatra gazed down at the lifeless bodies at her feet she drew a sharp breath and let out a cry tears ran down her cheeks for a moment i thought she might lose her composure entirely and fall to the floor weeping but she stiffened her neck fought back tears and turned her glittering eyes to caesar is caesar satisfied she asked once more i felt compelled to speak but caesar cocked his head thrust out his jaw and silenced me with a look caesar is satisfied she lowered her eyes and this matter is closed the matter is closed the queens subjects have been punished meto is absolved and shall be released we shall never speak again of what happened on antirrhodus very well said the queen she removed a long linen mantle that was gathered and pinned at one shoulder shook the garment loose and laid it over the bodies of merianis and apollodorus if you will see that no one touches these remains embalmers from the temple of isis will come very soon to collect them so that the proper rituals may be observed at each stage of the journey upon which they have embarked i could not help myself my voice trembled how terrible if anything should go amiss and disappoint the queen even in the life hereafter her loyal servants must be ready and waiting for her when the day comes that the queen herself crosses over she gave me a chilly look you understand completely gordianus apollodorus and merianis worship isis and i embody isis their loyalty knows no bounds and neither does their reward so it is in this world so it shall be in the next and through all eternity the impious will fall aside and turn to dust but the righteous shall have life everlasting with you as their queen dont worry gordianus i doubt very much that you will be among my subjects in the life hereafter with that she collected herself and strode from the room her head held high chapter xxvii the embalmers came quickly so quickly in fact that it seemed they must have gathered somewhere nearby beforehand to await the queens call the bodies of merianis and apollodorus were laid upon biers and carried off caesar is satisfied i said unable to contain my sarcasm are you consul how can you be he looked at me for a long moment before speaking i am satisfied that i responded as i should have responded to what just took place in this room but you cannot be satisfied that the queen and her subjects told you the truth that gordianus is another matter those tears she cried she used them like a witch to cast a spell over you perhaps nonetheless i think her tears were genuine do you not believe that she loved apollodorus and merianis as a queen loves those closest to her do you not think that she was profoundly moved by the sacrifice they made for her sacrifice indeed that nonsense about merianis being madly in love with meto and deciding on a whim to destroy him because he spurned herand the further nonsense that apollodorus would go along with such a plot on a moments notice without question behind the queens back apollodorus was a slave to only one woman and we both know it wasnt merianis caesar sighed in fact gordianus i do happen to know because meto told me so at the time that merianis did indeed make her affections available to him as she did to me and that meto declined as did i but i dont believe for an instant that merianis decided on her own initiative to plant that vial on meto he looked at me gravely nor do i yet youre satisfied to let the matter rest meto will be released gordianus is that not the result you wished for im a roman consul wisely or not i take justice for granted but truth also matters to me while the queen was here you refused to let me speak will you listen to me now he heaved a sigh very well because youre metos father because youve suffered much here in egypt and also because whether you realize it or not i rather like you gordianus i am going to indulge you and allow you to tell me exactly what you believe to be the truth explain to me what occurred on antirrhodus and then let us never speak of it again do you understand yes consul then proceed will you grant that the amphora of wine was already poisoned because it was the wine with which pompey intended to poison himself caesar nodded i grant as much but what of the alabaster vial i believe it was taken from my trunk by merianis just as she said and for the reason she gave she wished to deny me any chance to use the poison on myself she stole the poison with my best interests at heart i think that was about the only thing she told us that was true because there was something merianis left out she was a spy for the queen her eyes and ears belonged to cleopatra she told the queen everything and i believe she told cleopatra about the alabaster vial as well when you asked merianis about disposing of the poison she became flustered i think that was her original intention but someone ordered her not tothe queen of course for a woman like cleopatra such a poison might eventually serve a purpose and so she ordered merianis to keep the vial and its contents intact neither of them had any immediate use for the vial for the moment they both forgot about it just as i did then came that terrible day on antirrhodus when zoe died from the poisoned wine the queen was as puzzled and alarmed as the rest of us but her mind worked very quickly searching for a way to turn events to her advantage because meto had opened the amphora he was an obvious suspect and it may be that cleopatra actually believed that meto had poisoned the wine meto was her enemy the queen knew that he disliked her whether he had poisoned the wine or not it would benefit the queen to be rid of him and she saw an opportunity to deal him a bloweven as she diverted suspicion from herself a plot formed quickly in her mind and she put it into action at once while she held the body of zoe she called merianis to her side what did she say to merianis none of us could hear for they kept their voices low but did it not seem to you that merianis balked at the queens commands this was what cleopatra told her to do first to fetch the alabaster vial from her room and to empty the poison from it then to find apollodorus and to convey the queens desire that he come at once and when the occasion allowed that he should plant the empty vial upon meto merianis was appalled she had no wish to harm meto but she had no will to resist the queens command thus the strange look she shot at meto thus the shame she exhibited afterward as for apollodorus he obeyed the queens command without question and for the very reason he gave today because i love her he saidbut he didnt mean merianis he meant cleopatra caesar rubbed his chin thoughtfully andsupposing this version of events is truethis was why you wished the two servants to be called here without their mistress you hoped they might reveal the truthand incriminate the queen yes but cleopatra foresaw that possibility she might simply have refused to cooperatebut she sensed that you must at some level be given an explanation and that someone would have to be punished before they came here the queen told merianis and apollodorus exactly what to say if called upon and to save her they lied knowing it would mean their own deaths i remembered the look of acquiescence on merianiss face when apollodorus delivered the deathblow and my voice quavered if merianis hadnt stolen the poison from my trunk desiring only to save me from myself she might yet be alive caesar nodded strange how cornelias alabaster vial and pompeys amphora of falernian wine both seemed to take on a malevolent life of their own even after their owners abandoned them dead men do bite and so do their widows you accept my version of events consul it satisfies my curiosity gordianus but it does not satisfy my needs your needs i came to egypt to settle affairs here to my own advantage and to the advantage of rome which amounts to the same thing debts must be repaid for that to happen the harvests must be gathered and taxes collected for that to happen egypt must have peace either the king and queen must be reconciled or one must be eliminated and the other put upon the throneand whoever occupies the throne must be a steadfast ally of rome through all thats happened ive remained committed to carrying out the will of the piper namely that both siblings should rule jointly what occurred on antirrhodus was unfortunate but as you yourself assert the poisoning was accidental and the queens response though regrettable was not premeditated to press the queen for answers to badger her with questions as if she had plotted in some criminal fashion against my person does not serve the greater purpose but she did plot against you consul not once but twice first when she sought to falsely incriminate metoall the more terrible if you ask me precisely because it was spontaneousand again only moments ago when she contrived with complete premeditation to have her subjects lie to you even to die in order to conceal the first deceit would you have me call the queen a liar to her face i would have you call things what they are ah but there we see where you fail to grasp the situation gordianus you possess knowledge but you lack understanding through these deceits the queen sought to advance herself not to endanger me that is a crucial point gordianus and one that you fail to apprehend this is a political matter it has to do with the appearance of things when the queen was pressed to supply a response that would satisfy appearances she did precisely that at the expense of two lives the queen is a monster to force those two to lie to protect her and then to stand by and watch as they killed themselves so that she might save face so that i might save face as well gordianus do you really believe she forced them to do anything quite the contrary i should think what they did they did willingly even eagerly what extraordinary devotion if only i could cultivate such depths of love and loyalty men have died for me yes but not in the way those two died for their queen they truly believed her to be a goddess with the power to grant them everlasting life amazing there was a note of envy in his wonderment would a roman king ever be able to evoke such total devotion and blind selfsacrifice i found the notion repellent but caesar seemed fascinated by the possibility he strode to the window and gazed at the vista that stretched to the distant nile and yet i heard a note of resignation in his voice i saw his shoulders sag you say that shes bewitched me gordianus and i fear you may be right i almost believe myself that shes a goddess if only because she makes me feel like a god im a man of fiftytwo gordianus cleopatra makes me feel like a boy ive conquered the world and i feel weary she offers me a fresh world to conquer and makes me young again she offers more than the world she offers everlasting life im fiftytwo and ive never produced an heir cleopatra has promised to give me a son can you imagine a son to rule over not only egypt but rome as well together we might found a dynasty to rule the whole world forever i shook my head caesar looking out the window did not see my reaction but must have sensed it i suppose he said this is precisely the sort of talk that turned meto so adamantly against the queen and her influence on me do i sound like some deluded eastern despot have i crossed the world eluding every trap and besting every enemy only to lose my bearings here in egypt to a twentyoneyearold girl you say she promises you the world consul yet she lies as easily as she breathes you say she promises you a son yet even if she were to announce that she was carrying your child how could you be certain he raised a hand enough some thoughts are better left unspoken he clasped his hands behind his back and silently gazed out the window for such a long time that he seemed to have forgotten my presence until finally he spoke again the tenor of his voice had changed in some subtle way in the silent interim he had come to some decision regarding the queen but first he would deal with another matter he cleared his throat i want you to know gordianus that i would never have executed meto but you told me i told you what i deemed necessary to tell you in order to gain the desired result he turned to face me did the immediate threat to meto not spur you to find the truth about the poisoned amphora perhaps but still i know men gordianus if any skill has brought me to the place i occupy today its my ability to judge the character and capacity of the men around me some men respond to encouragement some to threats some to questions about their honor the trick lies in perceiving the best way to inspire each man to do his utmost i think i know you gordianus better than you realize the proof as always lies in the result i shook my head then you never believed meto was guilty did i say that gordianus i believe i said something slightly different but the important thing is that meto shall be freed at once and restored to my side as if nothing had happened ive learned to forgive my foes gordianus some of them have even learned to forgive me should it not be easier for two friends to forgive one another i gritted my teeth you posit a false syllogism consul how so you need to be forgiven meto has done nothing for which he needs forgiveness oh really how good finally to hear you say that gordianus your son is blameless after all i meant i know what you meant but the choice of how to proceed beyond this unfortunate breach of trust lies with meto i think and not with you is your son free to make his own decisions or will you continue to look over his shoulder and judge him at every turn holding him hostage to your disapproval have my actions toward meto been any more destructive than your own when you disowned him if that breach could be healed then can this one not be healed as well how deftly caesar had turned the tables on me elevating his own decisions above argument while challenging my paternal authority and moral judgment i chafed at his insinuation but i could not summon a rebuttal either meto was his own man or he was not and if he was then i had to acknowledge once and for all that he had moved beyond my power to shape his opinions and desires would he rush back to caesars side his imperators unfortunate breach of trust forgiven and forgotten or had the worm of doubt insinuated itself permanently into metos thoughts and would he never again be able to render to caesar the loving allegiance the man once had commanded of him caesar was right the choice belonged to meto not to me but it seemed there was another more immediate choice at hand to be made by caesar he turned from me and summoned the guard at the door to whom he issued an instruction in a voice too low for me to hear he began to pace the room staring at his reflection in the highly polished marble floor apparently oblivious of me like many of the powerful men i had known he possessed the ability to move from one preoccupation to another without transition focusing his entire energies on the problem immediately before him he had dealt with and was done with me and though i might linger in his physical presence for all practical purposes i had already vanished i cleared my throat if the consul is done with me caesar looked up like a sleeper pulled from a dream gordianus no stay im about to make a decision too long deferred someone should be here to witness the moment why not you yes i think gordianus the finder is precisely the man to be with me at this moment we waited for what i wasnt sure at last the guard stationed at the door announced that caesars visitor had arrived a moment later leaving his courtiers in the antechamber outside the king stepped into the room chapter xxviii i dropped to one knee caesar remained standing giving a vague wave of his hand to signal that i might rise but otherwise showing no acknowledgment of my presence ptolemy strode directly to caesar and stopped a few paces from him he wore the uraeus crown with a rearing cobra his bearing was erect he seemed somehow differentno longer a boy with the attributes of a man but a man who had left boyhood behind the gaze he exchanged with caesar was that of equals despite the difference in their ages your majesty said caesar inclining his head slightly consul said ptolemy his eyes flashing and a faint smile softening his lips the resemblance to his sister was more striking than ever caesar sighed weve talked before at great length about whats to be done you remain adamant in your position i shall never share the throne with my sister pothinus whatever his true motives eventually convinced me to compromise but pothinus is no longer here i realized the source of the change i saw in ptolemy it was due not to something added but something subtracted except for his exhortations from the balcony of the tomb of alexander i had never before seen the king outside the presence of pothinus perhaps those who believed the lord chamberlain had cast an undue influence over the king were right with pothinus gone ptolemy seemed to have grown to full manhood overnight your majesty realizes the difficulties of the decision i face said caesar i do but ultimately as events have unfolded and as the character of each of the pipers children has become clearer to me ptolemy regarded him quizzically the consul has made a choice between us i have and you know how fervently i desired to reconcile you with your sister even now were it possible it seems to me the judicious course and yet it manifestly is not possible and so another choice must be made ptolemy tilted his head back and narrowed his eyes go on consul i have decided your majesty to support your claim to be the sole ruler of egypt i saw the flash of a boyish grin breaking through the constrained smile of the king and my sister cleopatra may not readily accept my judgment but she will be made to see she has no choice her position in alexandria relies entirely upon my protection after all the kings smile faded what if she should slip out of alexandria to rejoin her rebels just as she slipped into the city that wont happen how can the consul be sure for one thing some of her closest confederatesthose who assisted her entry to the cityare no longer with her caesar glanced at me with a tacit command to say nothing about apollodorus and merianis for the time being shell be returned to the palace on antirrhodus and confined there my soldiers will keep a close watch upon her as caesars soldiers have kept close watch on me in recent days said ptolemy during the uncertain interim that has just ended i found it necessary to prepare for all eventualities said caesar now that my decision is made your majesty shall of course be free to come and go as he pleases cleopatra will not she must be handed over to me for judgment no your majesty that i cannot do no harm must come to her if my sister is allowed to live sooner or later she will escape and raise a revolt even in custody shell find some way to make mischief as long as she breathes shell never stop plotting my death caesar nodded clearly cleopatra cannot be allowed to remain in egypt i think it may be best for her to take up residence in romeunder my watchful protection of course in rome where she can continue to plot against me a watch will be kept upon her house her movements will be restricted as will the list of those allowed to visit her will caesar be among the visitors who call upon her in rome perhaps from time to time ptolemy shook his head alexandria is far from rome caesar will forget his ties to the king of egypt the viper will pour poison in your ears and turn you against me in the suddenly strident tone of his voice the boy within the man made a fitful reappearance caesar was adamant your majesty must trust me on this matter i will not allow cleopatra to be harmed is it not enough that i recognize your sole claim to the throne of egypt ptolemy drew a deep breath he squared his shoulders the boy was suppressed the man reasserted his primacy and his decision was reached caesar judges wisely the people of egypt and their king are lucky to have found such a friend in the consul of the roman people but now there is much work to be done if im truly free to come and go you are your majesty then i shall leave the palace now to join with achillas and take charge of my army in the city i shall inform achillas of your decision in my favor and order him to call back my troops so that no more blood will be shed roman or egyptian once order is established in the city as well as in the palace and once my sister and those who wish to stay in her service have departed from egypt under caesars protection there shall be a ceremony to mark the cessation of hostilities and the affirmation of my rule his voice softened if the consul has time i should like him to accompany me on a journey up the nile so that he may observe the life of the river and witness the many splendors along her shore caesar stepped forward and took the kings hand i should like nothing better your majesty sooner or later i must leave egypt there must be a reckoning with the scattered remnants of pompeys forces who are said to be regrouping in libya under the command of cato but i have little to fear from that quarter and a full and final settlement of affairs in egypt takes precedence over all other matters of state to accompany the king on a tour of the nileto cement our friendship with such a journeywould please me greatly the two exchanged a look of such intimate affection that i felt like an intruder i cleared my throat in the meantime said caesar resuming a more formal tone i shall watch for the cessation of hostilities from achillass men and i shall eagerly await your majestys return the king stepped back pulling his hand from caesars grasp as he turned to go the look of manly determination on his face wavered when he turned back spinning on his heel it was the boyking i saw timorous and uncertain with tears in his eyes he rushed back to caesar and gripped his arm come with me caesar i dont want to leave your side caesar smiled indulgently at this sudden outburst of emotion his gently laid his hand over the hand that gripped his arm and he squeezed it affectionately the king has no need of me when it comes to dealing with achillas the order to cease hostilities must come from you alone i would only get in the way ptolemy nodded but his eyes brimmed with tears youre right of course what i do now i must do alone its a lonely business my father used to say being a king but never forget one thing caesar the whole of my kingdom is no dearer to me at this moment than the mere sight of you with astonishment i saw that caesar too had tears in his eyes and when he spoke his voice was husky if thats true your majesty then go quickly that you may return all the more quickly to my side without another word his eyes locked with caesars until the last possible moment ptolemy stepped back turned away and withdrew from the room his linen robes of state rustling in the faint breeze stirred by his passing caesar stood motionless gazing after him will you tell her now i said caesar gave me such a blank look that i repeated the question will you tell her now the queen or should i say simply cleopatra if she no longer possesses that title im sure shell retain some sort of title caesar said absently as if my question had distracted him from moreimportant thoughts princess i suppose as she was called when her father was alive shes still the pipers daughter and the sister of the king though no longer his wife im sure theres a royal law to deal with the dissolution of their marriage said caesar if not well invent one and will she still be an incarnation of the goddess isis even without her crown to lose ones throne must be terrible to lose ones divinity if youre making a jest at the expense of the local religion gordianus its not amusing will you tell her now i said again he drew a deep breath there are some tasks that make a coward even of caesar but if i put off telling her shell find out some other way and that could lead to trouble best to be brave and face the situation headon it may be that the queenthe princess i meanhas left already for antirrhodus but perhaps we can catch her before her boat departs we consul of course i include you gordianus when you witness the beginning of a thing do you not wish to see it to the end perhaps but does the consul wish me to see it ive always found it useful to have another pair of eyes and ears to witness important events my memory is not what it used to be a second account comes in very handy when i sit down to write my memoirs meto has long served that purpose for me ill make a poor substitute for my son perhaps you should summon him to resume his rightful role an excellent suggestion the cell where hes been confined is close to the pier ill send men ahead to release him so that he can meet us having played antagonist to the queenthe princessmeto deserves to be on hand when i announce my decision to her come gordianus i walked alongside caesar as he traversed the palace complex accompanied by his retinue stopping every so often to issue orders to subordinates along the way we came to the gardens along the waterfront beyond the palm trees and flowering jasmine out on the stone pier cleopatra stood in the company of a few servants as well as the roman messenger who had been sent to detain her from boarding the boat that would return her to antirrhodus closer at hand i heard a familiar voice caesar the consul seeing meto beside the path stopped and opened his arms wide meto you look well thank venus meto hung back but the smile on caesars face overcame his hesitation they embraced the messenger said caesar nodded youve been cleared of all suspicion thanks to the insights of your father papa meto hugged me it was to caesar he had first spoken and to caesar he gave his first embrace but i tried to think only of the joy i felt at seeing him unharmed and free and out of danger this must mean you found an answer to the question of what happened on antirrhodus said meto looking quizzically at me and then at caesar indeed your father did exactly that said caesar but the explanation will have to wait cleopatra stands on the pier and there is something i must tell her caesar led the way taking long quick strides papa whats happening whispered meto i was about to speak but caesar looked over his shoulder and silenced me with a glance the afternoon sunlight reflected off the stones of the pier and the water of the harbor was dazzling gulls swooped and cried overhead waves lapped against the steps leading down to the royal skiff cleopatra seeing caesar smiled at his approach but as we drew closer i saw a twist of anxiety at the corner of her mouth when she saw meto the smile remained but grew stiff she raised her hands to take caesars but he stopped short of stepping close enough and she was left with an awkward unfinished gesture of welcome she drew back her hands and frowned caesar whats happening he looked at her gravely theres been a development good or bad bad to judge from the look on your face caesar averted his eyes caesar whats happening tell me now in her suddenly strident tone i heard the voice of her younger brother when he still did not answer she shifted to a more formal tone consul she said and i knew she suspected the truth for she was testing to see whether caesar in response would formally address her as the queen he drew a deep breath and was about to speak when a cry came from one of the roman watchmen who patrolled the rooftops of the palace behind us warships warships egyptian warships entering from the eunostos harbor all eyes turned toward the heptastadion near the center of the causeway a tunnel allowed ships to sail from one harbor to the other with their oars working at a furious pace one egyptian warship after another was entering the great harbor their decks were crowded with soldiers and catapults and bristled with spears another watchman cried out from the rooftops smoke flames fire at the barricades next to the royal theater as one those of us on the pier swung around to witness the cloud of black smoke that rose from the area where caesars defenses were most strongly concentrated at the same time a heavy percussive vibration traveled through the air rattling my teeththe boom boom boom of a distant battering ram achillass forces had launched a coordinated attack by land and by sea on caesars position i looked at caesar and saw a series of emotions sweep across his faceconsternation outrage and bitter disappointment he saw that i stared at him and he seized my arm in a painful grip he drew me aside and hissed in my ear gordianus you were there you saw you heard did the king not pledge to call off achillas and his troops he did then what can be happening from the direction of the approaching warships i heard a loud crack followed by a recoil one of the egyptian warships slipping past caesars galleys had advanced to a point within firing distance of the pier had some eagleeyed scout spotted caesar and cleopatra or had those in charge of the catapult simply let off a shot at the first available target whatever the case the flaming ball of pitch hurtled towards us one of cleopatras serving girls let out a shriek and some of those around me scrambled back but the missile fell short with a splash and a hiss it landed in the water some distance from the pier but close enough to send a spray of hot vapor across my face my arm was still captured in caesars painful grip its because of her he whispered its because i wouldnt let him have her he hates his sister more than he loves me he must have issued an order to attack the moment he reached achillas he knows where ive deployed my men and fortified my defenses hes told achillas exactly where to mount the assault the wretched little viper cleopatra stood a short distance away her eyes were not on the approaching warship but on us in all the commotion she had not moved at all her expression if anything was more composed than before there was even unless i imagined it a slight intimation of a smile on her face had she grasped in an instant exactly what had transpired i think so for the smile on her face was a smile of a queen who has snatched triumph from the jaws of defeat it would appear consul that we are under attack her use of the word we was not an accident im surprised that achillas would mount such an assault considering that my brother is in your custody she did know what had happened she was baiting caesar to tell her the truth he did not answer the warship drew closer i could now make out the faces of the egyptian soldiers on the deck and i could see that the catapult was being ratcheted back to launch another fireball at us or could it be said cleopatra that this assault is being launched at the instigation of my brother caesar drew a breath your majesty perceives the situation not an hour ago i released your brother and allowed him to join achillas but why consul imperator cried meto we must withdraw at once the danger caesar looked away from the queen long enough to bark an order withdraw to safety all of you now meto moved to take his arm imperator you must come as well caesar shook him off but curiously with his other hand he held me as fast as ever go meto lead the others to safety ill follow in a moment go i order you reluctantly meto turned and gestured for the others to follow him off the pier i could not have done so had i wanted to caesar held me fast in his grip he spoke to cleopatra your brother begged me to let him go to achillas he vowed to me that he would order achillas to withdraw his troops he promised to return to the palace as soon as that was done and you believed him i accepted a vow made by the king of egypt my father was the king of egypt my brother is nothing more than a foolish boy i see that now and if he ever was the king then as of this moment ptolemy is king no longer and never will be a fire leaped behind cleopatras eyes what are saying caesar i abandon all attempts to reconcile you with your brother as consul of the roman people and executor of your fathers will i recognize you as queen of egypt and sole claimant to the throne and ptolemy ptolemy has betrayed me in doing so hes betrayed his people as well and his own destiny once weve defeated him and his army i shall take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that he can never again lay claim to the throne or do harm to you in any other way i heard a loud crack much closer than before followed by a recoil the catapult had launched a second fireball at us it arced through the air its trajectory hard to determine from my foreshortened point of view go your majesty said caesar follow the others to a place of safety cleopatra smiled calmly she did as caesar asked and proceeded to leave the pier her stride was quick but she did not run consul i said nervously gazing up at the approaching fireball should we not also stand fast i have a good eye for these things gordianus this missile is poorly aimed were perfectly safe sure enough the descending fireball landed harmlessly in the water at a point more distant than the first meanwhile a roman galley was swiftly approaching to head off the egyptian warship which abruptly turned about caesar drew me close did you hear what i told the queen every word consul i raised an eyebrow you omitted certain details regarding your conversation with her brother perhaps but you must never ever contradict or stray from the exact version of events that i recounted to the queen do you understand i understand consul cleopatra must never be told that she was your second choice he looked toward the head of the pier where the queen was just joining the little crowd gathered there he nodded thoughtfully i chose between the two of them and i chose wrongly but the gods gave me a chance to rectify my mistake before i compounded it further cleopatra deceived me and i lost faith in her now ive deceived her in return and so were even and may start afresh it seems to me consul that neither of you deceived the other a whit you each perceived exactly the game played by the other but we shall pretend otherwise and there you have the essence of statecraft gordianusand of marriage as well cleopatra is a woman and i am a man but we are also heads of state when one of us sets a foot wrong the other will pretend not to notice when there is friction we shall maintain a fiction of harmony and thereby we shall respect one anothers dignity would it not be wiser and a great deal less troublesome in marriage as well as statecraft to simply be forthright and honest to admit ones mistakes and ask forgiveness caesar looked at me and shook his head i dont know what sort of husband you made gordianus but you could never have succeeded as a politician or a king i never desired to be either consul a good thing now lets get off this damned pier where are my officers where are my messengers theres a queen to be defended and a battle to be won chapter xxix as it turned out there were many battles to be waged over the course of the coming months in alexandria achillass assault on caesars position was only the beginning of what developed into a fullscale war and a most unusual one fought almost entirely within the arena of the city and its harbor the fight on land took place in the close quarters of narrow streets and across adjoining rooftops rather than on sweeping plains or across mountainous terrain and therefore it required a strategy very different from the usual tactical deployment of cavalry and infantry the naval engagements took place within the confines of the harbor and at times took on the appearance of some vast aquatic spectacle mounted for the dubious amusement of the populace caesar taken by surprise by ptolemys duplicity and outnumbered was at first hardpressed to maintain his position to flee by ship at that time was virtually impossible due partly to unfavorable winds that made it difficult to leave the harbor and partly to the extreme hazards attendant upon a withdrawal of all the troops toward the docks and thence by ship through the narrow harbor entrance all the while under egyptian attack on land and sea pompey harassed by caesar had managed such a naval withdrawal from brundisium but just barely caesar was effectively trapped in alexandria and faced certain destruction should the egyptians manage to penetrate his defenses there was considerable grumbling among his officers that he had landed them in a very tight spot thanks to an uncharacteristic miscalculation of the forces against him and to his love for a treacherous queen but caesar himself never betrayed any sign of doubt or gave vent to recrimination perhaps cleopatra had convinced him that together they possessed a divine destiny and that together they would overcome all obstacles on their path to immortality i shall leave it to others to recount all the many incidents of the alexandrian war no doubt caesar himself with the help of meto and others will write a more or less accurate if entirely selfserving account how candid will he be about his relationships with the royal siblings it will be interesting to read the delicate phrases he uses to justify his decision to allow ptolemy to leave the palace and join achillas but when it comes to recounting events in the military arena caesars memoirs can usually be trusted certain incidents stand out in my memory early on the egyptians attempted to contaminate the water supply to the palace in all alexandria not a single public fountain is supplied by a well or a spring and the water of lake mareotis is too brackish to drink all fresh water for the city arrives via the canal from the nile and where the canal approaches the city the water is split into numerous channels to supply various precincts the egyptians having control of the canal began pumping seawater into the supply that flowed into the areas under caesars control as their water inexplicably grew saltier caesars men came near to panicking but he assured them that along every coast underground veins of fresh water could be found the men devoted themselves to digging at numerous spots working continuously night and day and in fact enough veins of fresh water were struck to produce an adequate supply and a crisis that might have given the egyptians an early victory was averted also early on occurred the burning of the warehouses along the harbor which has since grown into the legend that caesar burned the whole of the great library in fact when caesars men set fire to a number of egyptian ships anchored in the great harbor so that the vessels could not later be seized and used against them the fire spread to some buildings on the waterfront among these was a warehouse used by the library in which great quantities of papyrus were stored along with an uncertain number of recently acquired or copied scrolls that had not yet been filed in the library as many as forty thousand volumes may have been destroyed but the library itself was unscathed still cleopatra gave caesar much grief about the destruction and caesar himself bitterly regretted it if only because it gave the egyptians further cause to label him a destroyer and a barbarian but the low point of the war for caesar was the day he lost his new purple cape caesar had always worn a blood red cape proud of the fact that friends and foes alike could easily spot him in the thick of battle it was cleopatra who gave caesar a new cape of a different hue an equally conspicuous very regal shade of purple a few romans grumbled at this innovationwere they fighting for a consul or a kingbut many appeared to welcome it caesar wore the cape on the day he sailed across the harbor with several hundred troops and laid siege to the causeway leading out to the pharos lighthouse his object was to gain control of the arch in the causeway that allowed egyptian ships to attack from the eunostos harbor the battle went well at first the island of pharos itself was seized as was the causeway and caesars men set about filling the mouth of the tunnel with stones but the alexandrians received reinforcements and the tide of the battle turned caesars men panicked and fled caesar himself was forced to retreat to his ship which was drawn alongside the causeway so many soldiers streamed onto the ship that it began to founder wearing his purple cape caesar jumped from the deck and swam toward another ship farther out in the harbor the heavy folds of the sodden cape threatened to drag him under struggling in the choppy waves barely keeping his head above water he managed to extricate himself from the garment and for a while he swam with it held between his teeth for he hated to lose the queens gift but in the end the cape slipped from his teeth and he abandoned it the day was a disaster for caesar the alexandrians reclaimed the archway and removed the stones that blocked it more than eight hundred of caesars men were killed by the enemy or drowned including all those aboard his lost ship and the triumphant alexandrians managed to fish his new purple cape out of the water on the causeway they danced and shouted and waved the cape like a flag of triumph as caesar dragged himself sputtering and halfdrowned aboard the ship and made an ignominious retreat later the alexandrians attached the tattered filthy cape to a pole like a captured banner and for the rest of the war they flaunted it on every possible occasion as an insult to caesars dignity the war continued for months as in all wars there were lulls in the fighting as each side regrouped caesar used such occasions to consult the many scholars and philosophers who found themselves confined to the precincts of the city under his control which included the famous library and the adjacent museum the repository of so much of the worlds mathematical and astronomical learning it was during one such lull that caesar set about devising a new more reliable calendar for the venerable roman calendar had in recent years grown out of step with the actual seasons so that harvest festivals were taking place long before the actual harvests and spring holidays occurred while romans shivered the worlds most esteemed scholars were consulted when caesar devised the new calendar and if they did their job well it may be that the calendar like the movements of the stars and planets will outlast rome itself at last the balance between the warring sides was altered by the approach of caesars ally king mithridates of pergamum who arrived at the egyptian frontier at the head of an army composed of jewish arabian and syrian levies mithridates took pelusium then marched south toward the apex of the nile delta hearing of mithridatess advance king ptolemy dispatched a force to intercept him when this egyptian force was annihilated ptolemy set out himself to do battle with the new invaders meanwhile caesar in regular communication with mithridates assembled his best troops left a contingent to hold his position in the city and sailed out of the harbor he landed at a point west of alexandria and circled around ptolemys army marching at such a quick pace that he passed the king and joined mithridates at the nile before ptolemy arrived thus the stage was set for the decisive battle of the alexandrian war which would not take place in alexandria but in the very heart of egypt on the banks of the great river i was not there but meto was through his eyes i witnessed the end of king ptolemy ptolemys army occupied a small village near the river situated on a hill with a canal on one side to act as a moat the egyptians also built earthen ramparts and dug trenches lined with sharp pickets the position appeared unassailable but caesars men forded the canal by cutting down trees and filling the channel until a makeshift bridge was created while others of his men swam downstream and emerged on the far side of the village so that ptolemys stronghold was encircled still the fortifications appeared impenetrable until caesars scouts noticed a poorly guarded area where the hill upon which the village stood was steepest apparently the egyptians assumed the sheerness of the cliff was itself adequate defense against that point caesar launched a sudden and powerful assault and when the high point was taken his men went streaming down through the village driving the egyptians before them in a panic the egyptians were trapped by their own fortifications falling from the walls piling atop one another in the trenches and impaling themselves on the pickets those who managed to escape the village faced the roman soldiers who encircled them and the army of ptolemy was slaughtered from within and without king ptolemy apprised of the disaster as it unfolded managed to flee by a small boat to take refuge on a royal barge in the nile the captain lifted anchor dipped oars and began to flee the scene of battle meanwhile hundreds of desperate egyptian soldiers threw down their weapons stripped off their armor and dove into the river in a great churning mass they converged on the royal barge and attempted to clamber aboard those already on the boat welcomed the first newcomers then saw that they would quickly be overwhelmed and began to try to fight off their comrades slashing at them with swords jabbing them with spears and firing arrows at those farther off the scene was horrific the banks of the nile echoed with the screams of the dying and the pleas of the living the water around the barge grew thick with corpses but those in the water greatly outnumbered those on the barge and despite the slaughter more and more of them managed to climb aboard until at last the vessel was overloaded the starboard side was submerged the opposite side rose into the air as if tipped by the hand of a titan the great barge capsized emptying its occupants into the water and falling upside down onto the horde of swimmers who had attempted to board her for a brief moment the underside of the barge remained visible above the water and a few dazed desperate egyptians managed to climb aboard then the vessel vanished completely swallowed by the river the army of ptolemy was annihilated caesars victory was complete or almost complete for the body of the king was never found caesars troops examined every corpse along the shore waded through every patch of reeds pulled nets through the shallows and dragged poles across every accessible bit of river bottom for miles downstream caesars best swimmersamong them meto who led the searchdove repeatedly at the spot where the barge sank retrieving every corpse mired in the mud or trapped in the debris it was exhausting filthy dangerous work and it yielded nothing or rather almost nothing one diver located the flute that had been played by the kings piper another retrieved ptolemys cobraheaded uraeus crown and delivered it into caesars hands meto himself found an even more curious souvenir a tattered cape so mud stained that at first it was difficult to discern its purple hue it was the cape that caesar had lost at the battle of the pharos causeway when he himself might have perished on a foundering ship apparently king ptolemy had kept it close at hand intending to use it to rally his troops at some critical juncture or to celebrate his ultimate triumph over the roman invader when meto returned the cape to caesar the imperator smiled ruefully but said nothing he spread the cape on a rock on the riverbank and when it was sufficiently dry he laid it upon one of the many pyres that had been lit to dispose of the roman dead the purple cape was consumed and caesar never spoke of it again hearing the tale of ptolemys end i remembered what cleopatra had told me regarding those who died in the nile and the special blessing they received from osiris but it was not the kings existence in the life hereafter that worried caesar but the continuation of his existence real or rumored in this world so long as ptolemys body was not found the enemies of the queen might persist in believing that their champion survived and the peace of egypt might yet be disturbed by pretenders there was even the slightest possibility that ptolemy had indeed survived and had gone into hiding disguising himself as a commoner or fleeing to some place beyond the reach of rome perhaps to the court of the parthian king caesar would have preferred to return to alexandria with the lifeless body of the king so that it could be displayed to cleopatra as the head of pompey had been displayed to himirrefutable proof of the enemys demise but in this regard despite all his efforts caesar was to be thwarted i shed no tears for young ptolemy i had seen him murder men in cold blood he was anything but innocent but a victim he was of those even more ruthless than himself and the horror of his end filled me with a kind of awe as had the death of pompey history and legend conspire to convince us that there are men who rise above the common lot of humankind who are set apart from the rest of us by birth or achievement or the favor of the gods but no man regardless of his pretensions to greatness is immune from death and the death of the socalled great is often more squalid and terrifying than the deaths of their most humble subjects i thought of the young king and the strange short life he had led so full of violence and betrayal and thwarted dreams and i felt a twinge of pity when caesar returned to alexandria news of the kings demise preceded him abandoning all resistance the alexandrians threw down their weapons and opened the canopic gate to caesar and his retinue the people put on the tattered clothing of suppliants their priests made sacrifices in the temples to appease the wrath of the gods but caesar was not wrathful he forbade his men to make any show of hostility and turned his march through the city into a joyous procession when he arrived at the royal precinct the men he had left to garrison the palace received him with ecstatic cheering cleopatra strode out to greet him she had not been seen in public for quite some time and it appeared to me despite the loose gown she wore that she had grown considerably larger around the middle in lieu of her brothers head caesar presented her wibroke the seal unrolled theth the captured crown leaving her own diadem in place she also fitted the crown of her brother on her brow so that the vultures head and the rearing cobra were sidebyside the alexandrians even those who previously had cursed and spat at the mention of her name erupted in a thunderous cheer and hailed her as their goddessqueen the battle at the nile took place late in the month of martius five days before the kalends of aprilis by the old calendar it was on that very day that i finally received a letter from my daughter diana in rome throughout the war i had been trapped along with the roman forces inside the palace precinct i had rupa and the boys for company and meto when he could take time from attending caesar but i had grown increasingly homesick for rome to assuage that homesickness i had regularly written long letters to diana apprising her of all that had happened since her mother and i left rome except for the one detail that i could not bear to commit to a letter the loss of bethesda i told her of my reconciliation with meto of my meetings with the king and queen of egypt and of rupa and the boys and our curious visit to the tomb of alexander trade in the harbor had come to a standstill but caesar did occasionally dispatch a ship to carry messages and meto inserted my letters in the consuls official packets whether they ever reached diana i had no way of knowing since no letters had yet arrived from heruntil the day of the battle on the nile when a ship from rome sailed into the harbor and a little later a messenger knocked upon my door and pressed a sealed roll of parchment into my hand i broke the seal unrolled the scrap of parchment and read dearest father and mother ive written many letters to you but your own letters give no sign that youve received them so i never know quite what to say at the risk of repeating myself know that all is well here in rome eco and his family seem to be thriving i think eco is working in some capacity for marc antony who is in charge of the city in caesars absence but eco is so secretive about his work taking after his father that i cannot really tell what he does though it must be lucrative davus and i are looking after the house in your absence little aulus is happy but misses having his grandpapa to tell him stories and his grandmama to tuck him in at night but now the real news the new baby has come she was delivered on the nones of marchan easy birthand we have decided to call her little bethesda perhaps simply beth for short which i hope will please her grandmother she is happy healthy and very loud she looks like you papa i can hear you muttering poor child but dont for she is very pretty we long for you to return home your letters say nothing of mothers search for a cure in the nile so we are very anxious to learn about that write soon and let me know that you received this letter all love to you both and to meto and to rupa and androcles and mopsus all good fortune to caesar that the fighting may soon be over and you can all return to rome neptune bless the ship that brings you this letter and the ship that brings you back to us when i finished reading the letter mopsus asked me if i wept for joy or sadness i could not tell him which dianas new motherhood was very much on my mind when a few days after caesars triumphant return an official announcement went forth that queen cleopatra was expecting a baby according to meto caesar had no doubt that the child was his in midaprilis having settled affairs in alexandria the prospective parents set out on a leisurely tour up the nile aglow with the triumph of their union and attended by every luxury i recalled that ptolemy had proposed just such a journey to caesar instead ptolemy had died in the nile and it was ptolemys sister who showed caesar the splendid temples and shrines along the river and the source of egypts greatness chapter xxx with the end of the war came peace alexandria opened its gates and its harbors rupa and the boys and i were free to move about as we wished for a few days i wandered about the city thinking i should see the sights and revisit familiar places before i left for at my time of life it seemed very unlikely that i would ever return but the sights and sounds of alexandria gave me no joy i asked meto to arrange a place for me and my charges at the first opportunity on one of caesars transport ships sailing to rome meto did as i asked on the day before we were set to leave alexandria i took rupa with me and strolled down the canopic way determined at least to have a look inside the temple of serapis before i left as we passed by market stalls and public squares and splashing fountains i fell to musing on the compromises forced upon us by the struggle for survival in the end caesar had chosen cleopatra but more because of her brothers default than because of her own virtues cleopatra had deceived caesar and would have seen meto executed without experiencing the least qualm of guilt caesar had been less than honest with the queen and what of his relationship with meto whom he had imprisoned and threatened with death i pictured the three of them locked in a circle of deceit each confronted by the others betrayals yet determined for the sake of expediency to look the other way something about their hardheaded pragmatism left me thoroughly dissatisfied but who was i to judge them my rejection of meto when i felt betrayed and deceived by him had brought me only misery and in the end i recanted as if i had been the one at fault as long as things went relatively smoothly was it wiser to overlook petty treacheries and deceits and disappointments and simply get on with the business of living what good ever came of issuing ultimatums and passing judgment on others thus do we learn to compromise with each other and with our own expectations in an imperfect world such were the thoughts spinning in my head when i saw across a marketplace the old priestess who had counseled bethesda at the temple of osiris on the nile the market was vast and crowded with people goods were beginning to flow back into alexandria and the populace in the giddy mood that follows a war were eager to spend their money amid the teeming throng at a considerable distance i caught only a fleeting glimpse of the woman it was only after she moved out of sight that i realized who she was i gripped rupas arm did you see her he signed with his hands who the old priestess i began to saythen remembered that rupa had had been off scattering cassandras ashes in the river when bethesda sought the counsel of the wisewoman rupa had never seen her i frowned and squinted trying to catch another glimpse of her face amid all the others only someone i thought i recognized but perhaps i was onlyno wait there she is do you see her i stood on tiptoes and pointed it must be her she looks exactly the same the white hair pulled into a knot the skin like weathered wood that ragged woolen mantle rupa shook his head then drew a sharp breath you see her then he signed look at the younger woman with her look younger woman where i dont see anyoneunless you mean the woman wearing the cloth headdress and like rupa i drew a sharp breath the two of us stood stockstill staring in disbelief it cant be i whispered and yet rupa nodded vigorously even as he furrowed his brow as if to say it is her and yet it cant be her its a trick of the light i said squinting at the apparitionfor surely the woman in the yellow linen gown her hair concealed in the folds of a nemes headcloth was only a phantom and yet the old crone could see her for the two of them exchanged a few words apparently about the relative merits of two combs offered by a vendor they were too far away i told myself the egyptian sun was too bright making a dazzlement of their distant faces i was seeing what i wanted to see not something that was actually there yet rupa seemed to see the same thing or did he dissatisfied with both combs the woman and the crone were moving away other nearer faces intervened i rose on tiptoes and pitched from side to side trying to keep her in sight it is her isnt it i said its i pressed my lips together summoning the strength to speak her name aloud rupa interrupted he hooked his forefingers together to make the sign that signified his sister and made the word an exclamation by the look on his face cassandra my jaw froze the sound died in my throat i had been about to say a different name i was suddenly uncertain perhaps the woman did look a bit like cassandra and yet where was she i had lost sight of the woman and of the old crone as well both of them had vanished into the crowd she was too old to be cassandra wasnt she i said my voice hollow and cassandra was blond we couldnt see her hair because of the headdress but this woman had darker features didnt she rupa shook his head looking troubled and confused i saw tears in his eyes no i thought it wasnt cassandra we had seen that was impossible cassandra was ashes now not even ashes any longer but ashes dissolved in the nileher ephemeral remains merged with the everlasting river so that osiris might give her everlasting life had cassandra believed in such things i wasnt sure but bethesda had most certainly bethesda had believed in a world beyond this world and in the supernatural power of the great river nile for an hour or more we lingered in the vicinity of that market i pretended to shop looking for trinkets and toys to take home as souvenirs to diana and aulus and my new granddaughter but in reality i was hoping for another glimpse of the crone and the woman who accompanied her but i did not see them again that day that night i asked meto to cancel my passage on the ship bound for rome why papa i thought you couldnt wait to leave i shrugged you went sightseeing with rupa today didnt you yes meto smiled perhaps you enjoyed yourself after all perhaps good alexandria is an amazing city take a few more days to relax and see the sights shall i arrange passage for you on the next available ship or the one after that im not sure when ill be ready to leave i have a sense of unfinished business here in alexandria just let me know when the time is right but dont wait too long once caesar returns from his cruise up the nile it will be time to press on with the war elsewhere and ill almost certainly be leaving alexandria myself day after day i returned to that market sometimes with rupa sometimes with the boys sometimes alone i gave every possible reason for doing so except the real reason the vendors at the market soon came to recognize me for i questioned every one of them about the two women i had seen that day a few seemed to have some vague notion of whom i was taking about but none could offer any insight into the identity of the women their whereabouts or whether they might return over and over meto arranged for me to board ships sailing for rome and over and over at the last moment i told him to cancel those plans one more day at the marketplace i told myself if i can visit the place just one more day even with all the wonders of alexandria open to them androcles and mopsus began to grow restless caesar and cleopatra returned from their journey up the nile caesars inner circle including meto made ready to depart from alexandria meto began to press me about my own arrangements surely the time has come papa once i leave it wont be as easy for you to arrange passage shall we set the date i suppose we should i said reluctantly unless you have some compelling reason to stay longer he frowned i was keeping something from him and he knew it no lets set a date and stick to it good theres a ship leaving for rome the day after tomorrow i bit my lip and felt a dull pain in my chest very well ill be on it the next day which was to be my last full day in alexandria i went to the market alone i arrived very early and stayed there all day the vendors shook their heads they were beginning to think i was mad the old priestess and the other woman never appeared the next morning rupa and the boys were up early ready to board the ship for rome my trunk was packed all was ready meto had promised to escort us to the pier he arrived beaming with excitement can you believe it papa im going with you caesars sending me back to rome he needs someone to deliver a dossier to marc antony and he says theres no one better for the job but the fact is i think hes rewarding me with a trip home in return for well for a certain amount of unpleasantness that you and i had to endure its a good thing you postponed your trip so long after all because now i can go with you yes wonderful news i said trying to muster some enthusiasm i could see that meto was disappointed by my reaction we proceeded to the harbor the sky was cloudless a favorable wind blew from the south carrying the dry sandy smell of the desert the boys ran onto the deck despite metos caution that they would have to behave themselves aboard a military vessel rupa assisted by one of the sailors carried my trunk aboard i lingered on the pier its time papa said meto the captains called for everyone to step aboard i shook my head im not going what papa theres no reason for you to stay i dont understand think of diana you must be eager to see the baby rupa rupa sat on the trunk he had just carried aboard catching his breath he sprang up and came to me rupa you have the key to the trunk dont you he nodded and reached into his tunic to show me the key which hung from a chain around his neck good open the trunk on the very top youll see a leather bag with coins in it bring it to me ill need some money meto shook his head youre actually going to stay arent you yes but why papa if theres something you must do let me stay and help you or at least keep one of the boys with you or rupa no the thing i do i must do alone rupa opened the lid of the trunk mopsus and androcles with a look of alarm came running and a moment later i saw the reason peering over the edge of the trunk his green eyes open wide and his silver collar gleaming in the sunlight was alexander the cat i raised an eyebrow kidnapping a sacred feline from the royal palace if queen cleopatra finds out shes liable to throw a couple of slave boys into the harbor then i suppose the queen must never know said meto smiling crookedly im sure the captain wont mind a cat will kill any rats on the ship rupa returned with the bag of coins and handed it to me mopsus and androcles carefully shut the lid of the trunk and looked around the deck to make sure no one else had seen the stowaway i embraced meto then stepped back look after the others on the journey home meto and when you see diana and eco yes papa what shall i tell them they dont yet know about bethesda what shall i say about her what shall i say about you tell them the truth as far as you can sometimes meto the truth must suffice diana will be distraught when she finds out about her mother and am i simply to say that you refused to leave egypt tell them i love them they know that already tell them i shall come home as soon as i can if the gods wish it to be so the captain of the ship gave a final call for all to board sailors hurried about the deck preparing to cast off never taking his eyes from me meto stepped aboard rupa and the boys stood beside him as the ship moved away from the dock they stared at me in puzzlement the ship drew away their faces grew smaller and smaller until i could no longer read their expressions i lifted my eyes to the great lighthouse that towered above the harbor and thought of the first glimpse i had seen of its flame that night aboard the andromeda with bethesda before the storm struck and swept away all our expectations chapter xxxi i paid a call on queen cleopatra to my surprise i was admitted to her presence almost at once she reclined upon a purple couch strewn with gold cushions slaves fanned her with ostrich feathers the gown she wore was loose and flowing but did not conceal the fact that she was great with child gordianuscalledfinder i thought you were leaving alexandria for rome today along with that irksome son of yours i was supposed to go your majesty i changed my mind she raised an eyebrow youve come to visit me instead your majesty once spoke to me of the special circumstances attendant upon a death in the nile she peered at me and nodded slowly those who perish in the nile are blessed by osiris he embraces the ka even as the currents and eddies of the river embrace the hollow reed of the body i shook my head all this talk of the sacred nile ive seen the nile i wandered up to my neck in its muddy waters searching for bethesdas body i felt the ooze of the bottom suck at my feet i smelled the stench of rotting plants along the steaming bank theres nothing beautiful about the nile its fetid smelly dark and dank the nile brings death yet it also brings life cleopatra placed her hand upon her swollen belly some mensqueamish ignorant foolsmake the same complaints about the sacred delta between a womans legs and yet from that place comes new life silly men turning up your noses at the slippery fluids and strong odors of fertility youd rather play with your hard shiny swords and spears and watch the blood spurt from each others wounds yes the nile is all you say it isa vast endless expanse of sluggish water and oozing mud it spills across egypt bringing life and death wherever it goes thats what gods do they give life they give deathand life after death so you say those who perish in the nile are reborn but are they ever resurrected what do you mean do they ever walk again in this world she looked at me darkly are you thinking of my brother its true his body was never located but there was another whose body was never found she knitted her brow then nodded your wife yes why do you ask such a question gordianus let me ask another you told me you know the old priestess at the temple outside naucratis ive visited the temple ive met her is it possible that i might have seen her here in alexandria in one of the markets shes very old but theres no reason she shouldnt travel to the city if she wishes even a priestess must gather provisions but if youd merely seen the priestess you wouldnt be asking me these questions would you you saw someone else i saw a woman with the priestess so did rupa but we didnt see the same woman he saw his sister cassandra whose ashes he scattered in the nile i saw bethesda that makes me think that neither of you saw a woman you truly recognized exactly unless unless you both saw what you thought you saw cassandra and bethesda somehow joined by the river and risen from the dead i shuddered do such things happen in egypt perhaps but i think you would prefer a more rational less mystical explanation wouldnt you gordianus perhaps the two women shared a stronger resemblance than you realized perhaps the woman you and rupa saw in the market was indeed your wifewho never died after all but the woman i saw looked younger than bethesda she was ill when you last saw her was she not and had been ill for quite some time if shes better now refreshed by the mild egyptian winter and tanned by the warm egyptian sun might she not look younger than before bethesdaalive but how is it possible we searched and searched perhaps she didnt want to be found had you done something to offend her i thought of cassandra bethesda had given no indication of knowing what had passed between us and yet or perhaps something happened to her in the river said the queen perhaps she forgot herself and became lost but when she came to her senses she would have looked for me surely looked where you were carried away by ptolemys army how could she know where you had gone even if she did somehow follow you to alexandria for many months no one from outside could reach any of us inside the palace perhaps all this time your wife has been residing at the temple of osiris beside the nile expiating whatever impurity caused her illness rejuvenating herself and restoring her vitality by serving the priestess i drew a ragged breath thats what i would like to believe but you fear false hope yes the only solution is to do what youve done all your life find the truth for yourself gordianus go to the temple outside naucratis see what you find what if bethesda isnt there youll find her if not in the temple then in the river you must find her and you must join her one way or another is that not what you want is it not your hearts desire it is then overcome your fear go to the temple by the nile do whatever you must to be reunited with your wife i left the queens presence shaken and trembling with doubt but resolved to do as she counseled she smiled as i left was it because she had shared the sacred wisdom of isis with me or was it because if i did as she told me she would have seen the last of me forever i made the journey by canal boat and thence on horseback down the river road traveling alone without the comfort or distraction of companions i realized that i had not done so in many years i was reminded of my younger days when i had set out on journeys without knowing how long they would take or where they would lead following the road as a man follows his fate sometimes anxious sometimes exhausted by the rigors of travel but more often buoyed by a sense of freedom and the possibility that something surprising and wonderful might lie around the next bend it was good to be alone with my thoughts watching the sights along the canal pass by and then the sights along the road as i approached the vicinity of the temple i felt at once calm and filled with anticipation the weather was mild palm trees swayed in a gentle breeze from the south farmers were at work in the fields tending to irrigation ditches and repairing waterwheels to prepare for the annual inundation alexandria seemed far away rome even farther this was the egypt i remembered from my youth the egypt i had longed to revisit i felt the sun on my face breathed in the smells of the lifegiving nile and felt transported back in time as if all the intervening years had never happened i was the youth i had been when i first arrived in egypt owning little obliged to no one but confident of the future as only the young can be confident i came to a place where the foliage grew thick and tall between the road and the river though i could not see it i knew the temple must lie somewhere within that dense greenery i tethered my horse and stretched the stiff sore legs of an old man not used to riding on horseback even that reminder of my bodys frailty did not shake the illusion of having stepped back in time i passed through a curtain of hanging vines and found a pathway into the foliage the play of sunlight and shadow confounded my sense of distance the seclusion of the place cast a spell upon me the pathway turned this way and that and i began to think i was hopelessly lost then i stepped into a sunlit glade and saw the temple before me dragonflies flitted across shafts of sunlight water splashed and gurgled in the springfed pool beside the temple i walked to the steps i ascended to the porch and entered the sanctum of osiris the smell of burning myrrh enveloped me the chamber was dimly lit a figure appeared in the gloom and moved closer until i saw the sere weathered face of the priestess i heard the sound of mewing and looked down to see the black cat stroking itself against her bony ankles was it the same woman i had seen in the market in alexandria or had memory played a trick on me priestess i said i came here many months agolast summerwith my wife she was unwell she sought your counsel you told her to bathe in the nile do you remember the wisewoman hunched her shoulder against her ear and peered up at my face oh yes i remember and thennot long ago i thought i saw you in a marketplace in alexandria was it you i saw were you in the city she looked at me for a long moment then shook her head thats not the question you really want to ask thats not what you came here to find out no youre right i came for bethesda is she here your wife was very ill when you came here more ill than you could know her body was weak but it was her spirit that had grown sick she was very close to death there was little i could do except commend her to the care of the river and did the river heal her go to the river find the place where you last saw her discover the truth for yourself her words echoed those of cleopatra i shuddered as i had shuddered in the queens presence i stepped onto the porch of the temple needing to catch my breath when i stepped back inside the priestess had disappeared and so had the cat the little room was empty except for a sputtering lamp and a censer of myrrh that released a final wisp of smoke i descended the steps hopped over the springfed pool and took the path that led to the river i came to a fork in the path and hesitated trying to remember which way to go one way had led me to a tangled dead end i recalled where i had glimpsed the ashes of cassandra clouding the flowing water the other way had led me to the place where bethesda disappeared but which was which memory failed me and i stood for a long moment puzzled the problem was simple but my mind was so befuddled that i had to work it out like a child stepbystep bethesda had entered the river downstream from cassandras ashes with the river before me running from right to left the path to the left must lead downstream so that was the way i must take the path led steadily downhill through the leaves i began to catch glimpses of sparkling sunlight on green water at last i came to the rivers edge the place was secluded and silent with a leafy canopy overhead and rushes all around bethesda was nowhere to be seen i called her name the shout rousted a covey of birds who flapped and cawed and streamed skyward from the undergrowth i stripped off my tunic and loincloth the angle of the sun was such that the whole of the river seemed to sparkle with dancing light so many points of light were reflected from the river onto my nakedness that i felt as if i were clothed in a spangled gown of sunlight the sparkles dazzled my eyes and warmed my flesh i strode into the river the solid sandy bottom quickly gave way to an oozing muck that sucked at my feet the water rose to my chest and with another step to my chin oh bethesda i whispered rushes swayed in the warm breeze sunlight glinted on the water the placid face of the nile gave no indication of concern for my fate or the fate of any mortal yet at the same time the river seemed to welcome me its warm darkness offered solace its vastness offered an end to mortal vanity its agelessness offered a doorway to eternity another step and the water rose above my head i opened my eyes the water was murky and green but the surface above me was like a vast sheet of hammered silver i opened my mouth to draw the nile deep into my lungs a burning fullness flowed into my chest the silver canopy above me was extinguished the murky water turned black i felt hands upon me out of the black murk a face appeared cassandras face nothe face of bethesda her features as soft and smooth as when i first met her in alexandria she put her mouth upon mine her kiss drew the nile from my lungs and took my breath away i opened my eyes blinking to expel drops of water from my lashes i lay upon my back on a sandy riverbank a canopy of leaves shivered overhead they appeared to be made of silver the sky beyond was an unearthly shade of purple shot with streaks of aquamarine and vermilion i felt the warmth of a body next to mine someone lay beside me on the sand she stirred and rose on one elbow to look down at me bethesda i whispered and coughed a little the taste of the nile was on my tongue husband she whispered in a voice full of love and tenderness she kissed me bethesda where are we she frowned are you so confused husband that you dont remember walking into the nile yes but are we aliveor dead does it matter were together yes but are we immortal yet she laughed i had not heard her laugh that way so carefree and relaxed in a long time dont be silly husband isnt the answer obvious not entirely the sky above me did not look like any sky i could remember or was that strange palette of colors simply a phenomenon caused by a meeting of sunlight sea mist and a nearby sandstorm where have you been all this time bethesda she smiled for now let me ask the questions has my granddaughter been born yet yes diana wrote me a letterbut how did you know it was a girl she shrugged a lucky guess i want to see her we must get back to rome as soon as possible i smiled then we are alive she raised an eyebrow cant the spirits of the dead go on journeys i suppose i cocked my head ive heard of haunted ships but i never expected to haunt one myself ah well when we were young and poor we found a way to get to rome and we shall find a way to get there now we shall go together i took her hand in mine let us go home bethesda yes husband let us go home authors note long after her lifetime cleopatra continued and continues to attract acolytes admirers enemies and victims especially among dramatists and other writers in antony and cleopatra shakespeare famously presented the roman general and the queen as starcrossed lovers using the bards text as adapted by franco zeffirelli samuel barber composed an opera to inaugurate the metropolitan opera house at lincoln center in for his efforts on behalf of the queen the composer of the immortal adagio for strings received a devastating critical reception george bernard shaw gave us his caesar and cleopatra with a kittenish queen later embodied on screen by vivien leigh in the s elizabeth taylor eclipsed all previous and subsequent portrayals in the muchmaligned film written and directed by joseph mankiewicz whose involvement with the perilous queen caused him even more suffering than that endured by samuel barber no matter how irresistible her allure one is wise to approach cleopatra with caution was cleopatra beautiful the historian dio is unequivocal this is the translation by herbert baldwin foster she was a woman of surpassing beauty especially conspicuous at that time because in the prime of youth with a most delicious voice and a knowledge of how to make herself agreeable to everyone being brilliant to look upon and to listen to with a power to subjugate even a coldnatured or elderly person she thought that she might prove exactly to caesars tastes and reposed in her beauty all her claims to advancement plutarch in his life of antony equivocates only slightly this is the dryden translation her beauty in itself was not so remarkable that none could be compared with her or that no one could see her without being struck by it but the contact of her presence was irresistible the attraction of her person joining with the charm of her conversation and the character that attended all she said or did was something bewitching unfortunately we have few images of cleopatra by which to judge her beauty with our own eyes crude coin portraits offer something close to caricature and the only bust of cleopatra accepted as genuine that in the vatican is missing its nose andre malraux said nefertiti is a face without a queen cleopatra is a queen without a face when i came to study cleopatra in earnest my childhood images of her inspired by the glamorous elizabeth taylor portrayal eventually faded and i found myself confronted by a profoundly problematic personality by twentyfirstcentury supermodel standards cleopatra may or may not have been beautiful but her psyche by modern standards was decidedly not pretty having been raised to become an absolute ruler in ruthless competition with her siblings for the affections of their father the patriarch of an incestuous clan cleopatra one may safely say came from a dysfunctional family just as her father murdered his rebellious eldest daughter berenice so cleopatra having eliminated with caesars help her brotherhusband ptolemy would eventually murder her other siblings arsinoe and the younger ptolemy we can only wonder at the distorted psychology that created and was created by such violence there is the added complication that cleopatra may quite seriously have considered herself to be at least semidivine if she were to appear among the glitterati of today i think we might conservatively classify her as mad bad and dangerous to know indeed the more i study all the dominant individuals of this periodincluding pompey and caesarthe more i am reminded of a comment by the writer l sprague de camp who in a different context reviewing the fantasy novels of e r eddison wrote in short eddisons great men even the best of them are cruel arrogant bullies one may admire in the abstract the indomitable courage energy and ability of such rampant egotists in the concrete however they are like the larger carnivora best admired with a set of stout bars between them and the viewer we have only a vague idea of what cleopatra looked like we have no image whatsoever of her brother king ptolemy we are not even certain of his age at the time of caesars arrival i have made him fifteen the oldest age postulated by historians when writers or filmmakers have bothered to deal with ptolemy at all the portrait is not flattering mankiewicz cast the boyking as a petulant brat dominated by the eunuch pothinus whom he cast as a simpering queen but why should we assume that ptolemy was any less beautiful or charismatic than his elder sister or that the spell he cast upon caesar was any less profound as one of historys losers cleopatra was vilified and marginalized by those who triumphed over her we may assume that the same was done to ptolemy between the lines of caesars the civil war is the story of a curious triangular relationship that must have developed between the roman conqueror and the siblingspouses amid the hothouse intrigues of their confinement in the palace compound at alexandria in this novel ptolemys parting words of love and devotion to caesar are lifted word for word from caesars own account what did the siblings feel for each other what did they feel for caesar and what did caesar feel for them in return it seems to me that historians blinded by their fascination with cleopatra and by the mores of their own times have ignored the untold story of the decisions political and personal that faced caesar in his struggle to settle affairs of stateand affairs of the heartin egypt for the tale of pompeys demise and caesars doings in alexandria our sources are rich though not always in agreement dio and appian in their histories of rome plutarch in his lives of caesar and pompey suetonius in his life of caesar lucan in his epic poem pharsalia and caesar in his memoir of the civil war all recount various aspects of the tale pliny gives us exact measurements regarding the inundation of the nile this is the translation of h rackham the largest rise up to date was one of feet and the smallest feet in the year of the war of pharsalus as if the river were trying to avert the murder of pompey by a sort of portent from strabo writing in bc we learn what little we know of the layout of ancient alexandria which remains unexcavated by modern archaeologists the exact location of the library and numerous other landmarks is unknown the adventures of leucippe and cleitophon by achilles tatius who wrote in the second century ad provides a small clue about the uncertain location of the tomb of alexander lucan tells us that caesar visited alexanders remains so did several later roman emperors dio tells us augustus wishing to adorn the mummy with a gold crown inadvertently broke off its nose among modern historians i found these books to be of particular

the british museum press london an exhibition catalogue edited by susan walker and peter higgs contains a great wealth of images my thanks to penni kimmel rick solomon and rick lovin for reading the manuscript to my tireless agent alan nevins and to my editor at st martins press keith kahla i will close with this observation which comes from dio writing about the volatile situation in alexandria at the time of caesars visit the egyptians he says again in fosters translation are the most excessively religious people on earth and wage wars even against one another on account of their beliefs since their worship is not a unified system but different branches of it are diametrically opposed one to another the hardheaded endlessly pragmatic romans with their affinity for realpolitik did not know quite what to make of the otherworldly fanaticisms of the egyptians it may give us pause that dios observation is as true about the inhabitants of the region today as it was in the time of cleopatra
