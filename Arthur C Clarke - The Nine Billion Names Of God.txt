the nine billion names of god arthur c clarke the title story was written for want of anything better to do during a rainy weekend at the roosevelt hotel its basic arithmetic was later challenged by j b s haldane but i managed to save the situation by alphanumeric evasions whose precise nature now escapes me j b s also remarked of this story and the star you are one of the very few living persons who has written anything original about god you have in fact written several mutually incompatible things if you had stuck to one theological hypothesis you might have been a serious public danger i am glad of my selfcontradiction preferring to remain a prophet with a small p nevertheless i appear to have created a durable myth not long ago a radio talk on the bbc referred to the opening situation of this story as actual fact and now that ibm computers have entered the field of biblical scholarship perhaps this theme is coming a little closer to reality this is a slightly unusual request said dr wagner with what he hoped was commendable restraint as far as i know its the first time anyones been asked to supply a tibetan monastery with an automatic sequence computer i dont wish to be inquisitive but i should hardly have thought that your ahestablishment had much use for such a machine could you explain just what you intend to do with it gladly replied the lama readjusting his silk robes and carefully putting away the slide rule he had been using for currency conversions your mark v computer can carry out any routine mathematical operation involving up to ten digits however for our work we are interested in letters not numbers as we wish you to modify the output circuits the machine will be printing words not columns of figures i dont quite understand this is a project on which we have been working for the last three centuriessince the lamasery was founded in fact it is somewhat alien to your way of thought so i hope you will listen with an open mind while i explain it naturally it is really quite simple we have been compiling a list which shall contain all the possible names of god i beg your pardon we have reason to believe continued the lama imperturbably that all such names can be written with not more than nine letters in an alphabet we have devised and you have been doing this for three centuries yes we expected it would take us about fifteen thousand years to complete the task oh dr wagner looked a little dazed now i see why you wanted to hire one of our machines but exactly what is the purpose of this project the lama hesitated for a fraction of a second and wagner wondered if he had offended him if so there was no trace of annoyance in the reply call it ritual if you like but its a fundamental part of our belief all the many names of the supreme beinggod jehovah allah and so onthey are only manmade labels there is a philosophical problem of some difficulty here which i do not propose to discuss but somewhere among all the possible combinations of letters that can occur are what one may call the real names of god by systematic permutation of letters we have been trying to list them all i see youve been starting at aaaaaaa and working up to zzzzzzzz exactlythough we use a special alphabet of our own modifying the electromatic typewriters to deal with this is of course trivial a rather more interesting problem is that of devising suitable circuits to eliminate ridiculous combinations for example no letter must occur more than three times in succession three surely you mean two three is correct i am afraid it would take too long to explain why even if you understood our language im sure it would said wagner hastily go on luckily it will be a simple matter to adapt your automatic sequence computer for this work since once it has been programed properly it will permute each letter in turn and print the result what would have taken us fifteen thousand years it will be able to do in a hundred days dr wagner was scarcely conscious of the faint sounds from the manhattan streets far below he was in a different world a world of natural not manmade mountains high up in their remote aeries these monks had been patiently at work generation after generation compiling their lists of meaningless words was there any limit to the follies of mankind still he must give no hint of his inner thoughts the customer was always right theres no doubt replied the doctor that we can modify the mark v to print lists of this nature im much more worried about the problem of installation and maintenance getting out to tibet in these days is not going to be easy we can arrange that the components are small enough to travel by airthat is one reason why we chose your machine if you can get them to india we will provide transport from there and you want to hire two of our engineers yes for the three months that the project should occupy ive no doubt that personnel can manage that dr wagner scribbled a note on his desk pad there are just two other points before he could finish the sentence the lama had produced a small slip of paper this is my certified credit balance at the asiatic bank thank you it appears to beahadequate the second matter is so trivial that i hesitate to mention itbut its surprising how often the obvious gets overlooked what source of electrical energy have you a diesel generator providing fifty kilowatts at a hundred and ten volts it was installed about five years ago and is quite reliable its made life at the lamasery much more comfortable but of course it was really installed to provide power for the motors driving the prayer wheels of course echoed dr wagner i should have thought of that the view from the parapet was vertiginous but in time one gets used to anything after three months george hanley was not impressed by the twothousandfoot swoop into the abyss or the remote checkerboard of fields in the valley below he was leaning against the windsmoothed stones and staring morosely at the distant mountains whose names he had never bothered to discover this thought george was the craziest thing that had ever happened to him project shangrila some wit back at the labs had christened it for weeks now the mark v had been churning out acres of sheets covered with gibberish patiently inexorably the computer had been rearranging letters in all their possible combinations exhausting each class before going on to the next as the sheets had emerged from the electromatic typewriters the monks had carefully cut them up and pasted them into enormous books in another week heaven be praised they would have finished just what obscure calculations had convinced the monks that they neednt bother to go on to words of ten twenty or a hundred letters george didnt know one of his recurring nightmares was that there would be some change of plan and that the high lama would suddenly announce that the project would be extended to approximately ad they were quite capable of it george heard the heavy wooden door slam in the wind as chuck came out onto the parapet beside him as usual chuck was smoking one of the cigars that made him so popular with the monkswho it seemed were quite willing to embrace all the minor and most of the major pleasures of life that was one thing in their favor they might be crazy but they werent bluenoses those frequent trips they took down to the village for instance listen george said chuck urgently ive learned something that means trouble whats wrong isnt the machine behaving that was the worst contingency george could imagine it might delay his return and nothing could be more horrible the way he felt now even the sight of a tv commercial would seem like manna from heaven at least it would be some link with home noits nothing like that chuck settled himself on the parapet which was unusual because normally he was scared of the drop ive just found what all this is about what dya mean i thought we knew surewe know what the monks are trying to do but we didnt know why its the craziest thing tell me something new growled george but old sams just come clean with me you know the way he drops in every afternoon to watch the sheets roll out well this time he seemed rather excited or at least as near as hell ever get to it when i told him that we were on the last cycle he asked me in that cute english accent of his if id ever wondered what they were trying to do i said sure and he told me go on ill buy it well they believe that when they have listed all his namesand they reckon that there are about nine billion of themgods purpose will be achieved the human race will have finished what it was created to do and there wont be any point in carrying on indeed the very idea is something like blasphemy then what do they expect us to do commit suicide theres no need for that when the lists completed god steps in and simply winds things up bingo oh i get it when we finish our job it will be the end of the world chuck gave a nervous little laugh thats just what i said to sam and do you know what happened he looked at me in a very queer way like id been stupid in class and said its nothing as trivial as that george thought this over for a moment thats what i call taking the wide view he said presently but what dyou suppose we should do about it i dont see that it makes the slightest difference to us after all we already knew that they were crazy yesbut dont you see what may happen when the lists complete and the last trump doesnt blowor whatever it is they expectwe may get the blame its our machine theyve been using i dont like the situation one little bit i see said george slowly youve got a point there but this sort of things happened before you know when i was a kid down in louisiana we had a crackpot preacher who once said the world was going to end next sunday hundreds of people believed himeven sold their homes yet when nothing happened they didnt turn nasty as youd expect they just decided that hed made a mistake in his calculations and went right on believing i guess some of them still do well this isnt louisiana in case you hadnt noticed there are just two of us and hundreds of these monks i like them and ill be sorry for old sam when his lifework backfires on him but all the same i wish i was somewhere else ive been wishing that for weeks but theres nothing we can do until the contracts finished and the transport arrives to fly us out of course said chuck thoughtfully we could always try a bit of sabotage like hell we could that would make things worse not the way i meant look at it like this the machine will finish its run four days from now on the present twentyhoursaday basis the transport calls in a week okthen all we need to do is to find something that needs replacing during one of the overhaul periodssomething that will hold up the works for a couple of days well fix it of course but not too quickly if we time matters properly we can be down at the airfield when the last name pops out of the register they wont be able to catch us then i dont like it said george it will be the first time i ever walked out on a job besides it would make them suspicious no ill sit tight and take what comes i still dont like it he said seven days later as the tough little mountain ponies carried them down the winding road and dont you think im running away because im afraid im just sorry for those poor old guys up there and i dont want to be around when they find what suckers theyve been wonder how sam will take it its funny replied chuck but when i said goodby i got the idea he knew we were walking out on himand that he didnt care because he knew the machine was running smoothly and that the job would soon be finished after that well of course for him there just isnt any after that george turned in his saddle and stared back up the mountain road this was the last place from which one could get a clear view of the lamasery the squat angular buildings were silhouetted against the afterglow of the sunset here and there lights gleamed like portholes in the side of an ocean liner electric lights of course sharing the same circuit as the mark v how much longer would they share it wondered george would the monks smash up the computer in their rage and disappointment or would they just sit down quietly and begin their calculations all over again he knew exactly what was happening up on the mountain at this very moment the high lama and his assistants would be sitting in their silk robes inspecting the sheets as the junior monks carried them away from the typewriters and pasted them into the great volumes no one would be saying anything the only sound would be the incessant patter the neverending rainstorm of the keys hitting the paper for the mark v itself was utterly silent as it flashed through its thousands of calculations a second three months of this thought george was enough to start anyone climbing up the wall there she is called chuck pointing down into the valley aint she beautiful she certainly was thought george the battered old dc lay at the end of the runway like a tiny silver cross in two hours she would be bearing them away to freedom and sanity it was a thought worth savoring like a fine liqueur george let it roll round his mind as the pony trudged patiently down the slope the swift night of the high himalayas was now almost upon them fortunately the road was very good as roads went in that region and they were both carrying torches there was not the slightest danger only a certain discomfort from the bitter cold the sky overhead was perfectly clear and ablaze with the familiar friendly stars at least there would be no risk thought george of the pilot being unable to take off because of weather conditions that had been his only remaining worry he began to sing but gave it up after a while this vast arena of mountains gleaming like whitely hooded ghosts on every side did not encourage such ebullience presently george glanced at his watch should be there in an hour he called back over his shoulder to chuck then he added in an afterthought wonder if the computers finished its run it was due about now chuck didnt reply so george swung round in his saddle he could just see chucks face a white oval turned toward the sky look whispered chuck and george lifted his eyes to heaven overhead without any fuss the stars were going out new york may
