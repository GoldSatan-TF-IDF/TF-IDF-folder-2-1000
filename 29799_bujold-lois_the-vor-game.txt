lois mcmaster bujold the vor game ship duty chortled the ensign four ahead of miles in line glee lit his face as his eyes sped down his orders the plastic flimsy rattling slightly in his hands im to be junior weaponry officer on the imperial cruiser commodore vorhalas reporting at once to tanery base shuttleport for orbital transfer at a pointed prod he removed himself with an unmilitary skip from the way of the next man in line still hissing delight under his breath ensign plause the aging sergeant manning the desk managed to look bored and superior at the same time holding the next packet up with deliberation between thumb and forefinger how long had he been holding down this post at the imperial military academy miles wondered how many hundredsthousandsof young officers had passed under his bland eye at this first supreme moment of their careers did they all start to look alike after a few years the same fresh green uniforms the same shiny blue plastic rectangles of shiny newwon rank armoring the high collars the same hungry eyes the gotohell graduates of the imperial services most elite school with visions of military destiny dancing in their heads we dont just march on the future we charge it plause stepped aside touched his thumbprint to the lockpad and unzipped his envelope in turn well said ivan vorpatril just ahead of miles inline dont keep us in suspense language school said plause still reading plause spoke all four of barrayars native languages perfectly already as student or instructor miles inquired student ah ha itll be galactic languages then intelligence will be wanting you after youre bound offplanet for sure said miles not necessarily said plause they could just sit me in a concrete box somewhere programming translating computers till i go blind but hope gleamed in his eyes miles charitably did not point out the major drawback of intelligence the fact that you ended up working for chief of imperial security simon illyan the man who remembered everything but perhaps on plauses level he would not encounter the acerb illyan ensign lobachik lobachik was the second most painfully earnest man miles had ever met miles was therefore unsurprised when lobachik zipped open his envelope and choked impsec the advanced course in security and counterassassination ah palace guard school said ivan with interest kibbitzing over lobachiks shoulder thats quite an honor miles observed illyan usually pulls his students from the twentyyear men with rows of medals maybe emperor gregor asked illyan for someone nearer his own age suggested ivan to brighten the landscape those prunefaced fossils illyan usually surrounds him with would give me depressive fits dont let on you have a sense of humor lubachik i think its an automatic disqualification lubachik was in no danger of losing the posting if that were so miles reflected will i really meet the emperor lubachik asked he turned nervous eyes on miles and ivan youll probably get to watch him eat breakfast every day said ivan poor sod did he mean lubachik or gregor gregor definitely you vorish types know himwhats he like miles cut in before the glint in ivans eye could materialize into some practical joke hes very straightforward youll get along fine lubachik moved off looking faintly reassured rereading his flimsy ensign vorpatril intoned the sergeant ensign vorkosigan tall ivan collected his packet and miles his and they moved out of the way with their two comrades ivan unzipped his envelope ha imperial hq in vorbarr sultana for me i am to be ill have you know aidedecamp to commodore jollif operations he bowed and turned the flimsy over starting tomorrow in fact ooh said the ensign whod drawn ship duty still bouncing slightly ivan gets to be a secretary just watch out if general lamitz asks you to sit on his lap i hear he ivan flipped him an amiable rude gesture envy sheer envy ill get to live like a civilian work seven to five have my own apartment in townno girls on that ship of yours up there i might point out ivans voice was even and cheerful only his eyes failing to totally conceal his disappointment ivan had wanted ship duty too they all did miles did ship duty eventually command like my father his father his his a wish a prayer a dream he hesitated for selfdiscipline for fear for a last lingering moment of high hope he thumbed the lock pad and unzipped the envelope with deliberate precision a single plastic flimsy a handful of travel passes his deliberation lasted only for the brief moment it took him to absorb the short paragraph before his eyes he stood frozen in disbelief began reading again from the top so whats up coz ivan glanced down over miless shoulder ivan said miles in a choked voice have i got a touch of amnesia or did we indeed never have a meteorology course on our sciences track fivespace math yes xenobotany yes ivan absently scratched a remembered itch geology and terrain evaluation yes well there was aviation weather back in our first year yes but so what have they done to you this time asked plause clearly prepared to offer congratulations or sympathy as indicated im assigned as chief meteorology officer lazkowski base where the hell is lazkowski base ive never even heard of it the sergeant at the desk looked up with a sudden evil grin i have sir he offered its on a place called kyril island up near the arctic circle winter training base for infantry the grubs call it camp permafrost infantry said miles ivans brows rose and he frowned down at miles infantry you that doesnt seem right no it doesnt said miles faintly cold consciousness of his physical handicaps washed over him years of arcane medical tortures had almost managed to correct the severe deformities from which miles had nearly died at birth almost curled like a frog in infancy he now stood almost straight chalkstick bones friable as talc now were almost strong wizened as an infant homunculus he now stood almost fourfootnine it had been a tradeoff toward the end between the length of his bones and their strength and his doctor still opined that the last six inches of height had been a mistake miles had finally broken his legs enough times to agree with him but by then it was too late but not a mutant not it scarcely mattered any more if only they would let him place his strengths in the emperors service he would make them forget his weaknesses the deal was understood there had to be a thousand jobs in the service to which his strange appearance and hidden fragility would make not one whit of difference like aidedecamp or intelligence translator or even a ships weaponry officer monitoring his computers it had been understood surely it had been understood but infantry someone was not playing fair or a mistake had been made that wouldnt be a first he hesitated a long moment his fist tightening on the flimsy then headed toward the door where are you going asked ivan to see major cecil ivan exhaled through pursed lips oh good luck did the desk sergeant hide a small smile bending his head to sort through the next stack of packets ensign draut he called the line moved up one more major cecil was leaning with one hip on his clerks desk consulting about something on the vid as miles entered his office and saluted major cecil glanced up at miles and then at his chrono ah less than ten minutes i win the bet the major returned miless salute as the clerk smiling sourly pulled a small wad of currency from his pocket peeled off a onemark note and handed it across wordlessly to his superior the majors face was only amused on the surface he nodded toward the door and the clerk tore off the plastic flimsy his machine had just produced and exited the room major cecil was a man of about fifty lean eventempered watchful very watchful though he was not the titular head of personnel that administrative job belonging to a higherranking officer miles had spotted cecil long ago as the finaldecision man through cecils hands passed at the last every assignment for every academy graduate miles had always found him an accessible man the teacher and scholar in him ascendant over the officer his wit was dry and rare his dedication to his duty intense miles had always trusted him till now sir he began he held out his orders in a frustrated gesture what is this cecils eyes were still bright with his private amusement as he pocketed the marknote are you asking me to read them to you vorkosigan sir i question miles stopped bit his tongue began again i have a few questions about my assignment meteorology officer lazkowski base major cecil recited its not a mistake then i got the right packet if thats what that says you did are you aware the only meteorology course i had was aviation weather i am the major wasnt giving away a thing miles paused cecils sending his clerk out was a clear signal that this discussion was to be frank is this some kind of punishment what have i ever done to you why ensign cecils voice was smooth its a perfectly normal assignment were you expecting an extraordinary one my job is to match personnel requests with available candidates every request must be filled by someone any tech school grad could have filled this one with an effort miles kept the snarl out of his voice uncurled his fingers better it doesnt require an academy cadet thats right agreed the major why then miles burst out his voice came out louder than hed meant it to cecil sighed straightened because i have noticed vorkosigan watching youand you know very well you were the most closelywatched cadet ever to pass through these halls barring emperor gregor himself miles nodded shortly that despite your demonstrated brilliance in some areas you have also demonstrated some chronic weaknesses and im not referring to your physical problems which everybody but me thought were going to take you out before your first year was upyouve been surprisingly sensible about those miles shrugged pain hurts sir i dont court it very good but your most insidious chronic problem is in the area of how shall i put this precisely subordination you argue too much no i dont miles began indignantly then shut his mouth cecil flashed a grin quite plus your rather irritating habit of treating your superior officers as your ah cecil paused apparently groping again for just the right word equals miles hazarded cattle cecil corrected judiciously to be driven to your will youre a manipulator par excellence vorkosigan ive been studying you for three years now and your group dynamics are fascinating whether you were in charge or not somehow it was always your idea that ended up getting carried out have i been that disrespectful sir miless stomach felt cold on the contrary given your background the marvel is that you conceal that ah little arrogant streak so well but vorkosigan cecil dropped at last into perfect seriousness the imperial academy is not the whole of the imperial service youve made your comrades here appreciate you because here brains are held at a premium you were picked first for any strategic team for the same reason you were picked last for any purely physical contestthese young hotshots wanted to win all the time whatever it took i cant be ordinary and survive sir cecil tilted his head i agree and yet sometime you must also learn how to command ordinary men and be commanded by them this isnt a punishment vorkosigan and it isnt my idea of a joke upon my choices may depend not only our fledgling officers lives but also those of the innocents i inflict em on if i seriously miscalculate overmatch or mismatch a man with a job i not only risk him but also those around him now in six months plus unscheduled overruns the imperial orbital shipyard is going to finish commissioning the prince serg miless breath caught youve got it cecil nodded the newest fastest deadliest thing his imperial majesty has ever put into space and with the longest range it will go out and stay out for longer periods than anything weve ever had before it follows that everyone on board will be in each others hair for longer unbroken periods than ever before high command is actually paying some attention to the psych profiles on this one for a change listen now cecil leaned forward so did miles reflexively if you can keep your nose clean for just six months on an isolated downside postbluntly if you prove you can handle camp permafrost ill allow as how you can handle anything the service might throw at you and ill support your request for a transfer to the prince but if you screw up there will be nothing i or anybody else can do for you sink or swim ensign fly thought miles want to fly sir just how much of a pit is this place i wouldnt want to prejudice you ensign vorkosigan said cecil piously and i love you too sir but infantry my physical limits wont prevent my serving if theyre taken into account but i cant pretend theyre not there or i might as well jump off a wall destroy myself immediately and save everybody time dammit why did they let me occupy some of barrayars most expensive classroom space for three years if they meant to kill me outright id always assumed they were going to be taken into account meteorology officer is a technical speciality ensign the major reassured him nobodys going to try and drop a full field pack on you and smash you flat i doubt theres an officer in the service who would choose to explain your dead body to the admiral his voice cooled slightly your saving grace mutant cecil was without prejudice merely testing always testing miles ducked his head as i may be for the mutants who come after me youve figured that out have you cecils eye was suddenly speculative faintly approving years ago sir hm cecil smiled slightly pushed himself off the desk came forward and extended his hand good luck then lord vorkosigan miles shook it thank you sir he shuffled through the stack of travel passes ordering them whats your first stop asked cecil testing again must be a bloody reflex miles answered unexpectedly the academy archives ah for a downloading of the service meteorology manual and supplementary material very good by the way your predecessor in the post will be staying on a few weeks to complete your orientation im extremely glad to hear that sir said miles sincerely were not trying to make it impossible ensign merely very difficult im glad to know that too sir miless parting salute was almost subordinate miles rode the last leg to kyril island in a big automated airfreight shuttle with a bored backup pilot and eighty tons of supplies he spent most of the solitary journey frantically swotting up on weather since the flight schedule went rapidly awry due to hourslong delays at the last two loading stops he found himself reassuringly further along in his studies than hed expected by the time the airshuttle rumbled to a halt at lazkowski base the cargo bay doors opened to let in watery light from a sun skulking along near the horizon the highsummer breeze was about five degrees above freezing the first soldiers miles saw were a crew of blackcoveralled men with loaders under the direction of a tiredlooking corporal who met the shuttle no one appeared to be specially detailed to meet a new weather officer miles shrugged on his parka and approached them a couple of the blackclad men watching him as he hopped down from the ramp made remarks to each other in barrayaran greek a minority dialect of earth origin thoroughly debased in the centuries of the time of isolation miles weary from his journey and cued by the alltoofamiliar expressions on their faces made a snap decision to ignore whatever they had to say by simply pretending not to understand their language plause had told him often enough that his accent in greek was execrable anyway look at that will you is it a kid i knew they were sending us baby officers but this is a new low hey thats no kid its a damn dwarf of some sort the midwife sure missed her stroke on that one look at it its a mutant with an effort miles kept his eyes from turning toward the commentators increasingly confident of their privacy their voices rose from whispers to ordinary tones so whats it doing in uniform ha maybe its our new mascot the old genetic fears were so subtly ingrained so pervasive even now you could get beaten to death by people who didnt even know quite why they hated you but simply got carried away in the excitement of a group feedback loop miles knew very well he had always been protected by his fathers rank but ugly things could happen to less socially fortunate odd ones there had been a ghastly incident in the old town section of vorbarr sultana just two years ago a destitute crippled man found castrated with a broken wine bottle by a gang of drunks it was considered progress that it was a scandal and not simply taken for granted a recent infanticide in the vorkosigans own district had cut even closer to the bone yes rank social or military had its uses miles meant to acquire all he could before he was done miles twitched his parka back so that his officers collar tabs showed clearly hello corporal i have orders to report in to a lieutenant ahn the base meteorology officer where can i find him miles waited a beat for his proper salute it was slow in coming the corporal was still goggling down at him it dawned on him at last that miles might really be an officer belatedly he saluted excuse me uh what did you say sir miles returned the salute blandly and repeated himself in level tones uh lieutenant ahn right he usually hides outthat is hes usually in his office in the main administration building the corporal swung his arm around to point toward a twostory prefab sticking up beyond a rank of halfburied warehouses at the edge of the tarmac maybe a kilometer off you cant miss it its the tallest building on the base also miles noted wellmarked by the assortment of comm equipment sticking out of the roof very good now should he turn his pack over to these goons and pray that it would follow him to his eventual destination whatever it was or interrupt their work and commandeer a loader for transport he had a brief vision of himself stuck up on the prow of the thing like a sailing ships figurehead being trundled toward his meeting with destiny along with half a ton of underwear thermal long doz per unit crate style he decided to shoulder his dufhe and walk thank you corporal he marched off in the indicated direction tooconscious of his limp and the legbraces concealed beneath his trouser legs taking up their share of the extra weight the distance turned out to be farther than it looked but he was careful not to pause or falter till hed turned out of sight beyond the first warehouseunit the base seemed nearly deserted of course the bulk of its population was the infantry trainees who came and went in two batches per winter only the permanent crew was here now and miles bet most of them took their long leaves during this brief summer breathing space miles wheezed to a halt inside the admin building without having passed another man the directory and map display according to a handlettered sign taped across its vid plate was down miles wandered up the first and only hallway to his right searching for an occupied office any occupied office most doors were closed but not locked lights out an office labeled gen accounting held a man in black fatigues with red lieutenants tabs on the collar totally absorbed in his holovid which was displaying long columns of data he was swearing under his breath meteorology office where miles called in the door two the lieutenant pointed upward without turning around crouched more tightly and resumed swearing miles tiptoed away without disturbing him further he found it at last on the second floor a closed door labeled in faded letters he paused outside set down his duffle and folded his parka atop it he checked himself over fourteen hours travel had rumpled his initial crispness still hed managed to keep his green undress uniform and halfboots free of foodstains mud and other unbecoming accretions he flattened his cap and positioned it precisely in his belt hed crossed half a planet half a lifetime to achieve this moment three years training to a fever pitch of readiness lay behind him yet the academy years had always had a faint air of pretense weareonlypracticing now at last he was face to face with the real thing his first real commanding officer first impressions could be vital especially in his case he took a breath and knocked a gravelly muffled voice came through the door words unrecognizable invitation miles opened it and strode in he had a glimpse of computer interfaces and vid displays gleaming and glowing along one wall he rocked back at the heat that hit his face the air within was bloodtemperature except for the vid displays the room was dim at a movement to his left miles turned and saluted ensign miles vorkosigan reporting for duty as ordered sir he snapped out looked up and saw no one the movement had come from lower down an unshaven man of about forty dressed only in his skivvies sat on the floor his back against the comconsole desk he smiled up at miles raised a bottle halffull of amber liquid mumbled salu boy love ya and fell slowly over miles gazed down on him for a long long thoughtful moment the man began to snore after turning down the heat shedding his tunic and tossing a blanket over lieutenant ahn for such he was miles took a contemplative halfhour and thoroughly examined his new domain there was no doubt he was going to require instruction in the offices operations besides the satellite realtime images automated data seemed to be coming in from a dozen microclimate survey rigs spotted around the island if procedural manuals had ever existed they werent around now not even on the computers after an honorable hesitation bemusedly studying the snoring twitching form on the floor miles also took the opportunity to go through ahns desk and comconsole files discovery of a few pertinent facts helped put the human spectacle before miles into a more understandable perspective lieutenant ahn it seemed was a twentyyear man within weeks of retirement it had been a very very long time since his last promotion it had been an even longer time since his last transfer hed been kyril islands only weather officer for the last fifteen years this poor sod has been stuck on this iceberg since i was six years old miles calculated and shuddered inwardly hard to tell at this late date if ahns drinking problem were cause or effect well if he sobered up enough within the next day to show miles how to go on well and good if he didnt miles could think of half a dozen ways ranging from the cruel to the unusual to bring him around whether he wanted to be conscious or not if ahn could just be made to disgorge a technical orientation he could return to his coma till they came to roll him onto outgoing transport for all miles cared ahns fate decided miles donned his tunic stowed his gear behind the desk and went exploring somewhere in the chain of command there must be a conscious sober and sane human being who was actually doing his job or the place couldnt even function on this level or maybe it was run by corporals who knew in that case miles supposed his next task must be to find and take control of the most effective corporal available in the downstairs foyer a human form approached miles silhouetted at first against the light from the front doors jogging in precise double time the shape resolved into a tall hardbodied man in sweat pants tshirt and running shoes he had clearly just come in off some conditionmaintaining fivekilometer run with maybe a few hundred pushups thrown in for dessert irongrey hair ironhard e yes he might have been a particularly dyspeptic drill sergeant he stopped short to stare down at miles startlement compressing to a thinlipped frown miles stood with his legs slightly apart threw back his head and stared up with equal force the man seemed totally oblivious to miless collar tabs exasperated miles snapped are all the keepers on vacation or is anybody actually running this bloody zoo the mans eyes sparked as if their iron had struck flint they ignited a little warning light in miless brain one mouthy moment too late hi there sir cried the hysterical commenter in the back of miless mind with a skip bow and flourish im your newest exhibit miles suppressed the voice ruthlessly there wasnt a trace of humor in any line of that seamed countenance looming over him with a cold flare of his carved nostril the base commander glared down at miles and growled i run it ensign dense fog was rolling in off the distant muttering sea by the time miles finally found his way to his new quarters the officers barracks and all around it were plunged into a grey frostscummed obscurity miles decided it was an omen oh god it was going to be a long winter rather to miless surprise when he arrived at ahns office next morning at an hour he guessed might represent beginningofshift he found the lieutenant awake sober and in uniform not that the man looked precisely well pastyfaced breathing stertoriously he sat huddled staring sliteyed at a computercolorized weather vid the holo zoomed and shifted dizzyingly at signals from the remote controller he clutched in one damp and trembling palm good morning sir miles softened his voice out of mercy and closed the door behind himself without slamming it ha ahn looked up and returned his salute automatically what the devil are you ah ensign im your replacement sir didnt anyone tell you i was coming oh yes ahn brightened right up very good come in miles already in smiled briefly instead i meant to meet you on the shuttlepad ahn went on youre early but you seem to have found your way all right i came in yesterday sir oh you should have reported in i did sir oh ahn squinted at miles in worry you did you promised youd give me a complete technical orientation to the office this morning sir miles added seizing the opportunity oh ahn blinked good the worried look faded slightly well ah ahn rubbed his face looking around he confined his reaction to miless physical appearance to one covert glance and perhaps deciding they must have gotten the social duties of introduction out of the way yesterday plunged at once into a description of the equipment lining the wall in order from left to right literally an introduction all the computers had womens names except for a tendency to talk about his machines as though they were human ahn seemed coherent enough as he detailed his job only drifting into randomness then hungover silence when he accidently strayed from the topic miles steered him gently back to weather with pertinent questions and took notes after a bewildered brownian trip around the room ahn rediscovered his office procedural disks at last stuck to the undersides of their respective pieces of equipment he made fresh coffee on a nonregulation brewer named georgetteparked discreetly in a corner cupboard then took miles up to the roof of the building to show him the datacollection center there ahn went over the assorted meters collectors and samplers rather perfunctorily his headache seemed to be growing worse with the mornings exertions he leaned heavily on the corrosionproof railing surrounding the automated station and squinted out at the distant horizon miles followed him around dutifully as he appeared to meditate deeply for a few minutes on each of the cardinal compass points or maybe that introspective look just meant he was getting ready to throw up it was pale and clear this morning the sun upthe sun had been up since two hours after midnight miles reminded himself they were just past the shortest nights of the year for this latitude from this rare high vantage point miles gazed out with interest at lazkowski base and the flat landscape beyond kyril island was an eggshaped lump about seventy kilometers wide and kilometers long and over five hundred kilometers from the next land of any description lumpy and brown described most of it both base and island the majority of the nearby buildings including miless officers barracks were dug in topped with native turf nobody had bothered with agricultural terraforming here the island retained its original barrayaran ecology scarred by use and abuse long fat rolls of turf covered the barracks for the winter infantry trainees now empty and silent muddy waterfilled ruts fanned out to deserted marksmanship ranges obstacle courses and pocked liveammo practice areas to the nearsouth the leaden sea heaved muting the suns best efforts at sparkle to the far north a grey line marked the border of the tundra at a chain of dead volcanic mountains miles had taken his own officers short course in winter maneuvers in the black escarpment mountain country deep in barrayars second continent plenty of snow to be sure and murderous terrain but the air had been dry and crisp and stimulating even today at high summer the sea dampness seemed to creep up under his loose parka and gnaw his bones at every old break miles shrugged against it without effect ahn still draped over the railing glanced sideways at miles at this movement so tell me ah ensign are you any relation to the vorkosigan i wondered when i saw the name on the orders the other day my father said miles shortly good god ahn blinked and straightened then sagged selfconsciously back onto his elbows as before good god he repeated he chewed his lip in fascination dulled eyes briefly alight with honest curiosity whats he really like what an impossible question miles thought in exasperation admiral count aral vorkosigan the colossus of barrayaran history in this halfcentury conqueror of komarr hero of the ghastly retreat from escobar for sixteen years lord regent of barrayar during emperor gregors troubled minority the emperors trusted prime minister in the four years since destroyer of vordarians pretendership engineer of the peculiar victory of the third cetagandan war unshaken tigerrider of barrayars murderous internecine politics for the past two decades the vorkosigan ihave seen him laugh in pure delight standing on the dock at vorkosigan surleau and yelling instructions over the water the morning i first sailed dumped and righted the skimmer by myself i have seen him weep till his nose ran more dead drunk than you were yesterday ahn the night we got the word major duvallier was executed for espionage i have seen him rage so brickred we feared for his heart when reports came in fully detailing the stupidities that led to the last riots in solstice i have seen him wandering around vorkosigan house at dawn in his underwear yawning and prodding my sleepy mother into helping him find two matching socks hes not likeanything ahn hes the original he cares about barrayar miles said aloud at last as the silence grew awkward hes a hard act to follow and oh yes his only child is a deformed mutant that too i should think so ahn blew out his breath in sympathy or maybe it was nausea miles decided he could tolerate ahns sympathy there seemed no hint in it of the damned patronizing pity nor interestingly of the more common repugnance its because im his replacement here miles decided i could have two heads and hed still be overjoyed to meet me that what youre doing following in the old mans footsteps said ahn equably and more dubiously looking around here im vor said miles impatiently i serve or at any rate i try to wherever im put that was the deal ahn shrugged bafflement whether at miles or at the vagaries of the service that had sent him to kyril island miles could not tell well he pushed himself up off the rail with a grunt no wahwah warnings today no what warnings ahn yawned and tapped an array of figurespulled out of thin air as far as miles could tellinto his report panel representing hourbyhour predictions for todays weather wahwah didnt anybody tell you about the wahwah no they should have first thing bloody dangerous the wahwah miles began to wonder if ahn was trying to diddle his head practical jokes could be a subtle enough form of victimization to penetrate even the defenses of rank miles had found the honest hatred of a beating inflicted only physical pain ahn leaned across the railing again to point you notice all those ropes strung from door to door between buildings thats for when the wahwah comes up you hang onto em to keep from being blown away if you lose your grip dont fling out your arms to try and stop yourself ive seen more guys break their wrists that way go into a ball and roll what the hells a wahwah sir big wind sudden ive seen it go from dead calm to kilometers with a temperature drop from ten degrees cee above freezing to twenty below in seven minutes it can last from ten minutes to two days they almost always blow up from the northwest here when conditions are right the remote station on the coast gives us about a twentyminute warning we blow a siren that means you must never let yourself get caught without your cold gear or less than fifteen minutes away from a bunker theres bunkers all around the grubs practice fields out there ahn waved his arm in that direction he seemed quite serious even earnest you hear that siren you run like hell for cover the size you are if you ever got picked up and blown into the sea theyd never find you again all right said miles silently resolving to check out these alleged facts in the bases weather records at the first opportunity he craned his neck for a look at ahns report panel where did you read off those numbers from that you just entered on there ahn stared at his report panel in surprise welltheyre the right figures i wasnt questioning their accuracy said miles patiently i want to know how you came up with them so i can do it tomorrow while youre still here to correct me ahn waved his free hand in an abortive frustrated gesture well youre not just making them up are you said miles in suspicion no said ahn i hadnt thought about it but its the way the day smells i guess he inhaled deeply by way of demonstration miles wrinkled his nose and sniffed experimentally cold sea salt shore slime damp and mildew hot circuits in some of the blinking twirling array of instruments beside him the mean temperature barometric pressure and humidity of the present moment let alone that of eighteen hours into the future was not to be found in the olfactory information pressing on his nostrils he jerked his thumb at the meteorological array does this thing have any sort of a smellometer to duplicate whatever it is youre doing ahn looked genuinely nonplussed as if his internal system whatever it was had been dislocated by his sudden selfconsciousness of it sorry ensign vorkosigan we have the standard computerized projections of course but to tell you the truth i havent used em in years theyre not accurate enough miles stared at ahn and came to a horrid realization ahn wasnt lying joking or making this up it was the fifteen years experience gone subliminal that was carrying out these subtle functions a backlog of experience miles could not duplicate nor would i wish to he admitted to himself later in the day while explaining with perfect truth that he was orienting himself to the systems miles covertly checked out all of ahns startling assertions in the base meteorological archives ahn hadnt been kidding about the wahwah worse he hadnt been kidding about the computerized projections the automated system produced local predictions of accuracy dropping to at a weeks longrange forecast ahn and his magical nose ran an accuracy of dropping to at a weeks range when ahn leaves this island is going to experience an to drop in forecast accuracy theyre going to notice weather officer camp permafrost was clearly a more responsible position than miles had at first realized the weather here could be deadly and this guy is going to leave me alone on this island with six thousand armed men and tell me to go sniff for wahwahs on the fifth day when miles had just about decided that his first impression had been too harsh ahn relapsed miles waited an hour for ahn and his nose to show up at the weather office to begin the days duties at last he pulled the routine readings from the substandard computerized system entered them anyway and went hunting he ran ahn down at last still in his bunk in his quarters in the officers barracks sodden and snoring stinking of stale fruit brandy miles shuddered shaking prodding and yelling in ahns ear failed to rouse him he only burrowed deeper into his bedclothes and noxious miasma moaning miles regretfully set aside visions of violence and prepared to carry on by himself hed be on his own soon enough anyway he limpmarched off to the motor pool yesterday ahn had taken him on a scheduled maintenance patrol of the five remotesensor weather stations nearest the base the outlying six had been planned for today routine travel around kyril island was accomplished in an allterrain vehicle called a scatcat which had turned out to be almost as much fun to drive as an antigrav sled scatcats were groundhugging iridescent teardrops that tore up the tundra but were guaranteed not to blow away in the wahwah winds base personnel miles had been given to understand had grown extremely tired of picking lost antigrav sleds out of the frigid sea the motor pool was another halfburied bunker like most of the rest of lazkowski base only bigger miles routed out the corporal whats his name olney whod signed ahn and himself out the previous day the tech who assisted him driving the scatcat up from the underground storage to the entrance also looked faintly familiar tall black fatigues dark hairthat described eighty percent of the men on the baseit wasnt until he spoke that his heavy accent cued miles he was one of the sotto voce commenters miles had overheard on the shuttlepad miles schooled himself not to react miles went over the vehicles supply checklist carefully before signing for it as ahn had taught him all scatcats were required to carry a complete coldsurvival kit at all times corporal olney watched with faint contempt as miles fumbled around finding everything all right so im slow miles thought irritably new and green this is the only way im gonna get less new and green step by step he controlled his selfconsciousness with an effort previous painful experience had taught him it was a most dangerous frame of mind concentrate on the task not the bloody audience youve always had an audience probably always will miles spread out the map flimsy across the scatcats shell and pointed out his projected itinerary to the corporal such a briefing was also safety sop according to ahn olney grunted acknowledgment with a finelytuned look of longsuffering boredom palpable but just short of something miles would be forced to notice the blackclad tech pattas watching over miless uneven shoulder pursed his lips and spoke oh ensign sir again the emphasis fell just short of irony you going up to station nine yes you might want to be sure and park your scatcat uh out of the wind in that hollow just below the station a thick finger touched the map flimsy on an area marked in blue youll see it that way your scatcatll be sure of restarting the power pack in these engines is rated for space said miles how could it not restart olneys eye lit then went suddenly very neutral yes but in case of a sudden wahwah you wouldnt want it to blow away id blow away before it would i thought these scatcats were heavy enough not to well not away but they have been known to blow over murmured pattas oh well thank you corporal olney coughed pattas waved cheerfully as miles drove out miless chin jerked up in the old nervous tic he took a deep breath and let his hackles settle as he turned the scatcat away from the base and headed crosscountry he powered up to a more satisfying speed lashing through the brown brackenlike growth he had been what a year and a half two years at the imperial academy proving and reproving his competence to every bloody man he crossed every time he did anything the third year had perhaps spoiled him he was out of practice was it going to be like this every time he took up a new post probably he reflected bitterly and powered up a bit more but hed known that would be part of the game when hed demanded to play the weather was almost warm today the pale sun almost bright and miles almost cheerful by the time he reached station six on the eastern shore of the island it was a pleasure to be alone for a change just him and his job no audience time to take his time and get it right he worked carefully checking power packs emptying samplers looking for signs of corrosion damage or loose connections in the equipment and if he dropped a tool there was no one about to make comments about spastic mutants with the fading tension he made fewer fumbles and the tic vanished he finished stretched and inhaled the damp air benignly reveling in the unaccustomed luxury of solitude he even took a few minutes to walk along the shoreline and notice the intricacies of the small sealife washed up there one of the samplers in station eight was damaged a humiditymeter shattered by the time hed replaced it he realized his itinerary timetable had been overly optimistic the sun was slanting down toward green twilight as he left station eight by the time he reached station nine in an area of mixed tundra and rocky outcrops near the northern shore it was almost dark station ten miles reconfirmed by checking his map flimsy by penlight was up in the volcanic mountains among the glaciers best not try to go hunting it in the dark he would wait out the brief four hours till dawn he reported his changeofplan via commlink to the base kilometers to the south the man on duty did not sound terribly interested good with no watchers miles happily seized the opportunity to try out all that fascinating gear packed in the back of the scatcat far better to practice now when conditions were good than in the middle of some later blizzard the little twoman bubble shelter when set up seemed almost palatial for miless short and lonely splendor in winter it was meant to be insulated with packed snow he positioned it downwind of the scatcat parked in the recommended low spot a few hundred meters from the weather station which was perched on a rocky outcrop miles reflected on the relative weight of the shelter versus the scatcat a vid that ahn had shown him of a typical wahwah remained vivid in his mind the portable latrine traveling sideways in the air at a hundred kilometers an hour had been particularly impressive ahn hadnt been able to tell him if thered been anyone in it at the time the vid was shot miles took the added precaution of attaching the shelter to the scatcat with a short chain satisfied he crawled inside the equipment was firstrate he hung a heattube from the roof and touched it on and basked in its glow sitting crosslegged rations were of the better grade a pull tab heated a compartmentalized tray of stew with vegetables and rice he mixed an acceptable fruit drink from the powder supplied after eating and stowing the remains he settled on a comfortable pad shoved a bookdisk into his viewer and prepared to read away the short night he had been rather tense these last few weeks these last few years the bookdisk a betan novel of manners which the countess had recommended to him had nothing whatsoever to do with barrayar military maneuvers mutation politics or the weather he didnt even notice what time he dozed off he woke with a start blinking in the thick darkness gilded only with the faint copper light from the heattube he felt he had slept long yet the transparent sectors of the bubbleshelter were pitchy black an unreasoning panic clogged his throat dammit it didnt matter if he overslept it wasnt like he would be late for an exam here he glanced at the glowing readout on his wrist chrono it ought to be broad daylight the flexible walls of the shelter were pressing inward not onethird of the original volume remained and the floor was wrinkled miles shoved one finger against the thin cold plastic it yielded slowly like soft butter and retained the dented impression what the hell his head was pounding his throat constricted the air was stuffy and wet it felt just like like oxygen depletion and co excess in a space emergency here the vertigo of his disorientation seemed to tilt the floor the floor was tilted he realized indignantly pulled deeply downward on one side pinching one of his legs he convulsed from its grip fighting the co induced panic he lay back trying to breathe slower and think faster im underground sunk in some kind of quicksand quickmud had those two bloody bastards at the motorpool set him up for this hed fallen for it fallen right in it slowmud maybe the scatcat hadnt settled noticeably in the time it had taken him to set up this shelter or he would have twigged to the trap of course it had been dark but if hed been settling for hours asleep relax he told himself frantically the tundra surface the free air might be a mere ten centimeters overhead or ten meters relaxhe felt about the shelter for something to use as a probe thered been a long telescoping knifebitted tube for sampling glacier ice packed in the scatcat along with the comm link now located miles gauged by the angle of the floor about twoandahalf meters down and to the west of his present location it was the scatcat that was dragging him down the bubbleshelter alone might well have floated in the tundracamouflaged mudpond if he could detach the chain might it rise not fast enough his chest felt stuffed with cotton he had to break through to air soon or asphyxiate womb tomb would his parents be there to watch when he was found at last when this grave was opened scatcat and shelter winched out of the bog by heavy hovercab his body frozen rictusmouthed in this hideous parody of an amniotic sac relax he stood and shoved upward against the heavy roof his feet sank in the pulpy floor but he was able to jerk loose one of the bubbles interior ribs now bent in an overstrained curve he almost passed out from the effort in the thick air he found the top edge of the shelters opening and slid his finger down the burrcatch just a few centimeters just enough for the pole to pass through hed feared the black mud would pour in drowning him at once but it only crept in extrusive blobs to fall with oozing plops the comparison was obvious and repulsive god and i thought id been in deep shit before he shoved the rib upward it resisted slipping in his sweating palms not ten centimeters not twenty a meter a meter and a third and he was running short on probe he paused took a new grip shoved again was the resistance lessening had he broken through to the surface he heaved it back and forth but the sucking slime sealed it still maybe maybe a little less than his own height between the top of the shelter and breath breath death how long to claw through it how fast did a hole in this stuff close his vision was darkening and it wasnt because the light was going dim he turned the heat tube off and stuck it in the front pocket of his jacket the uncanny dark shook him with horror or perhaps it was the co now or never on an impulse he bent and loosened his bootcatches and belt buckle then zipped open the burr by feel he began to dig like a dog heaving big globs of mud down into the little space left in the bubble he squeezed through the opening braced himself took his last breath and pressed upward his chest was pulsing his vision a red blur when his head broke the surface air he spat black muck and bracken bits and blinked trying with little success to clear his eyes and nose he fought one hand up then the other and tried to pull himself up horizontal flat like a frog the cold confounded him he could feel the muck closing around his legs numbing like a witchs embrace his toes pressed at full extension on the shelters roof it sank and he rose a centimeter the last of the leverage he could get by pushing now he must pull his hands closed over bracken it gave more more he was making a little progress the cold air raking his grateful throat the witchs grip tightened he wriggled his legs futilely one last time all right now heave his legs slid out of his boots and pants his hips sucked free and he rolled away he lay spreadeagled for maximum support on the treacherous surface face up to the grey swirling sky his uniform jacket and long underwear were soaked with slime and hed lost one thermal sock as well as both boots and his trousers it was sleeting they found him hours later curled around the dimming heattube crammed into an eviscerated equipment bay in the automated weather station his eyesockets were hollow in his blackstreaked face his toes and ears white his numb purple fingers jerked two wires across each other in a steady hypnotic tattoo the service emergency code to be read out in bursts of static in the barometric pressure meter in bases weather room if and when anybody bothered to look at the suddenlydefective reading from this station or noticed the pattern in the white noise his fingers kept twitching in this rhythm for minutes after they pulled him free of his little box ice cracked off the back of his uniform jacket as they tried to straighten his body for a long time they could get no words from him at all only a shivering hiss only his eyes burned floating in the heat tank in the base infirmary miles considered crucifixion for the two saboteurs from the motor pool from several angles such as upsidedown dangling over the sea at low altitude from an antigrav sled better still staked out faceup in a bog in a blizzard but by the time his body had warmed up and the corpsman had pulled him out of the tank to dry be reexamined and eat a supervised meal his head had cooled it hadnt been an assassination attempt and therefore not a matter he was compelled to turn over to simon illyan dread chief of imperial security and miless fathers lefthand man the vision of the sinister officers from impsec coming to take those two jokers away far away was lovely but impractical like shooting mice with a maser cannon anyway where could impsec possibly send them that was worse than here theyd meant his scatcat to bog to be sure while he serviced the weather station and for miles to have the embarrassment of calling the base for heavy equipment to pull it out embarrassing not lethal they could not haveno one could haveforseen miless inspired safetyconscious precaution with the chain which was in the final analysis what had almost killed him at most it was a matter for service security bad enough or for normal discipline he dangled his toes over the side of his bed one of a row in the empty infirmary and pushed the last of his food around on his tray the corpsman wandered in and glanced at the remains you feeling all right now sir fine said miles morosely you uh didnt finish your tray i often dont they always give me too much yeah i guess you are pretty um the corpsman made a note on his report panel leaned over to examine miless ears and bent to inspect his toes rolling them between practiced fingers it doesnt look like youre going to lose any pieces here lucky do you treat a lot of frostbite or am i the only idiot present evidence would suggest it oh once the grubs arrive this placell be crammed frostbite pneumonia broken bones contusions concussions gets real lively come winter walltowall morounlucky trainees and a few unlucky instructors that they take down with em the corpsman stood and tapped a few more entries on his panel im afraid i have to mark you as recovered now sir afraid miles raised his brows inquiringly the corpsman straightened in the unconscious posture of a man transmitting official bad news that old theytoldmetosaythisitsnotmyfault look you are ordered to report to the base commanders office as soon as i release you sir miles considered an immediate relapse no better to get the messy parts over with tell me corpsman has anyone else ever sunk a scatcat oh sure the grubs lose about five or six a season plus minor bogdowns the engineers get real pissed about it the commandant promised them next time hed ahem the corpsman lost his voice wonderful thought miles just great he could see it coming it wasnt like he couldnt see it coming miles dashed back to his quarters for a quick change of clothing guessing a hospital robe might be inappropriate for the coming interview he immediately found he had a minor quandry his black fatigues seemed too relaxed his dress greens too formal for office wear anywhere outside imperial hq at vorbarr sultana his undress greens trousers and halfboots were still at the bottom of the bog he had only brought one of each uniform style with him his spares supposedly in transit had not yet arrived he was hardly in a position to borrow from a neighbor his uniforms were privately made to his own fit at approximately four times the cost of imperial issue part of that cost was for the effort of making them indistinguishable on the surface from the machine cut while at the same time partially masking the oddities of his body through subtleties of handtailoring he cursed under his breath and shucked on his dress greens complete with mirrorpolished boots to the knees at least the boots obviated the leg braces general stanis metzov read the sign on the door base commander miles had been assiduously avoiding the base commander ever since their first unfortunate encounter this had not been hard to do in ahns company despite the pared population of kyril island this month ahn avoided everybody miles now wished hed tried harder to strike up conversations with brother officers in mess permitting himself to stay isolated even to concentrate on his new tasks had been a mistake in five days of even the most random conversation someone must surely have mentioned kyril islands voracious killer mud a corporal manning the comconsole in an antechamber ushered miles through to the inner office he must now try to work himself back round to metzovs good side assuming the general had one miles needed allies general metzov looked across his desk unsmiling as miles saluted and stood waiting today the general was aggressively dressed in black fatigues at metzovs altitude in the hierarchy this stylistic choice usually indicated a deliberate identification with the fighting man the only concession to his rank was their pressed neatness his decorations were stripped down to a mere modest three all high combat commendations pseudomodest pruned of the surrounding foliage they leapt to the eye mentally miles applauded even envied the effect metzov looked his part the combat commander absolutely unconsciously natural a fiftyfifty chance with the uniform and i had to guess wrong miles fumed as metzovs eye traveled sarcastically down and back up the subdued glitter of his dress greens all right so metzovs eyebrows signaled miles now looked like some kind of vorish headquarters twit not that that wasnt another familiar type miles decided to decline the roasting and cut metzovs inspection short by forcing the opening yes sir metzov leaned back in his chair lips twisting i see you found some pants ensign vorkosigan and ah riding boots too you know there are no horses on this island none at imperial headquarters either miles thought irritably i didn t design the damn boots his father had once suggested his staff officers must need them for riding hobbyhorses high horses and nightmares unable to think of a useful reply to the generals sally miles stood in dignified silence chin lifted parade rest sir metzov leaned forward clasping his hands abandoning his heavy humor eyes gone hard again you lost a valuable fullyequipped scatcat as a result of leaving it parked in an area clearly marked as a permafrost inversion zone dont they teach mapreading at the imperial academy any more or is it to be all diplomacy in the new servicehow to drink tea with the ladies miles called up the map in his mind he could see it clearly the blue areas were labelled piz those initials were not defined not in the key or anywhere then i take it you also failed to read your manual hed been buried in manuals ever since hed arrived weather office procedurals equipment techspecs which one sir lazkowski base regulations miles tried frantically to remember if hed ever seen such a disk i think lieutenant ahn may have given me a copy night before last ahn had in fact dumped an entire carton of disks out on miless bed in officers quarters he was doing some preliminary packing hed said and was willing miles his library miles had read two weather disks before going to sleep that night ahn clearly had returned to his own cubicle to do a little preliminary celebrating the next morning miles had taken the scatcat out and you havent read it yet no sir why not i was set up miless thought wailed he could feel the highlyinterested presence of metzovs clerk undismissed standing witness by the door behind him making this a public not a private dressingdown and if only hed read the damn manual would those two bastards from the motor pool even have been able to set him up will or nill he was going to get downchecked for this one no excuse sir well ensign in chapter three of lazkowski base regulations you will find a complete description of all the permafrost zones together with the rules for avoiding them you might look into it when you can spare a little leisure from drinking tea yes sir miless face was set like glass the general had a right to skin him with a vibraknife if he chosein private the authority lent miles by his uniform barely balanced the deformities that made him a target of barrayars historicallygrounded intense genetic prejudices a public humiliation that sapped that authority before men he must also command came very close to an act of sabotage deliberate or unconscious the general was only warming up the service may still provide warehousing for excess vor lordlings at imperial headquarters but out here in the real world where theres fighting to be done we have no use for drones now i fought my way up through the ranks i saw casualties in vordarians pretendership before you were born i was a casualty in vordarians pretendership before i was born thought miles his irritation growing wilder the soltoxin gas that had almost killed his pregnant mother and made miles what he was had been a purely military poison and i fought the komarr revolt you infants whove come up in the past decade and more have no concept of combat these long periods of unbroken peace weaken the service if they go on much longer when a crisis comes therell be no one left whos had any real practice in a crunch miless eyes crossed slightly from internal pressure then should his imperial majesty provide a war every five years as a convenience for the advancement of his officers careers his mind boggled slightly over the concept of real practice had miles maybe acquired his first clue why this superblooking officer had washed up on kyril island metzov was still expanding selfstimulated in a real combat situation a soldiers equipment is vital it can be the difference between victory and defeat a man who loses his equipment loses his effectiveness as a soldier a man disarmed in a technological war might as well be a woman useless and you disarmed yourself miles wondered sourly if the general would then agree that a woman armed in a technological war might as well be a man no probably not not a barrayaran of his generation metzovs voice descended again dropping from military philosophy to the immediately practical miles was relieved the usual punishment for a man bogging a scatcat is to dig it out himself by hand i understand that wont be feasible since the depth to which you sank yours is a new camp record nevertheless you will report at to lieutenant bonn of engineering to assist him as he sees fit well that was certainly fair and would probably be educational too miles prayed this interview was winding down dismissed now but the general fell silent squintyeyed and thoughtful for the damage you did to the weather station metzov began slowly then sat up more decisivelyhis eyes miles could almost swear lighting with a faint red glow the corner of that seamed mouth twitching upward you will supervise basiclabor detail for one week four hours a day thats in addition to your other duties report to sergeant neuve in maintenance at daily a slight choked inhalation sounded from the corporal still standing behind miles which miles could not interpret laughter horror but unjust and he would lose a significant fraction of the precious time remaining to decant technical expertise from ahn the damage i did to the weather station was not a stupid accident like the scatcat sir it was necessary to my survival general metzov fixed him with a very cold eye make that six hours a day ensign vorkosigan miles spoke through his teeth words jerked out as though by pliers would you have preferred the interview youd be having right now if id permitted myself to freeze sir silence fell very dead swelling like a roadkilled animal in the summer sun you are dismissed ensign general metzov hissed at last his eyes were glittering slits miles saluted aboutfaced and marched stiff as any ancient ramrod or board or corpse his blood beat in his ears his chin jerked upward past the corporal who was standing at attention doing a fair imitation of a waxwork out the door out the outer door alone at last in the administration buildings lower corridor miles cursed himself silently then out loud he really had to try to cultivate a more normal attitude toward senior officers it was his bloody upbringing that lay at the root of the problem he was sure too many years of tripping over herds of generals admirals and senior staff at vorkosigan house at lunch dinner all hours too much time sitting quiet as a mouse cultivating invisibility permitted to listen to their extremely blunt argument and debate on a hundred topics he saw them as they saw each other maybe when a normal ensign looked at his commander he ought to see a godlike being not a a future subordinate new ensigns were supposed to be a subhuman species anyway and yet what is it about this guy metzov hed met others of the type before of assorted political stripes many of them were cheerful and effective soldiers as long as they stayed out of politics as a party the military conservatives had been eclipsed ever since the bloody fall of the cabal of officers responsible for the disastrous escobar invasion over two decades ago but the danger of revolution from the far right some wouldbe junta assembling to save the emperor from his own government remained quite real in miless fathers mind he knew so was it some subtle political odor emanating from metzov that had raised the hairs on the back of miless neck surely not a man of real political subtlety would seek to use miles not abuse him or are you just pissed because he stuck you on some humiliating garbage detail a man didnt have to be politically extreme to take a certain sadistic joy in sticking it to a representative of the vor class could be metzov had been diddled in the past himself by some arrogant vor lord political social genetic the possibilities were endless miles shook the static from his head and limped off to change to his black fatigues and locate base engineering no help for it now he was sunk deeper than his scatcat hed simply have to avoid metzov as much as possible for the next six months anything ahn could do so well miles could surely do too lieutenant bonn prepared to probe for the scatcat the engineering lieutenant was a slight man maybe twentyeight or thirty years old with a craggy face surfaced with pocked sallow skin reddened by the climate calculating brown eyes competentlooking hands and a sardonic air which miles sensed might be permanent and not merely directed at himself bonn and miles squished about atop the bog while two engineering techs in black insulated coveralls sat perched on their heavy hovercab safely parked on a nearby rocky outcrop the sun was pale the endless wind cold and damp try about there sir miles suggested pointing trying to estimate angles and distances in a place he had only seen at dusk i think youll have to go down at least two meters lieutenant bonn gave him a joyless look raised his long metal probe to the vertical and shoved it into the bog it jammed almost immediately miles frowned puzzlement surely the scatcat couldnt have floated upward j bonn looking unexcited leaned his weight into the rod and twisted it began to grind downward what did you run into miles asked ice bonn grunted bout three centimeters thick right now were standing on a layer of ice underneath this surface crud just like a frozen lake except its frozen mud miles stamped experimentally wet but solid much as it had when he had camped on it bonn watching him added the ice thickness varies with the weather from a few centimeters to solidtothebottom midwinter you could park a freight shuttle on this bog come summer it thins out it can thaw from seemingsolid to liquid in a few hours when the temperature is just right and back again i think i found that out lean ordered bonn laconically and miles wrapped his hands around the rod and helped shove he could feel the scrunch as it scraped past the ice layer and if the temperature had dropped a little more the night hed sunk himself and the mud refrozen would he have been able to punch up through the icy seal he shuddered inwardly and zipped his parka halfup over his black fatigues cold said bonn thinking good make it a habit bonn touched a control and the rods sonic probe beeped at a teethaching frequency the readout displayed a bright teardrop shape a few meters over there it is bonn eyed the numbers on the readout its really down in there isnt it id let you dig it out with a teaspoon ensign but i suppose winter would set in before you were done he sighed and stared down at miles as though picturing the scene miles could picture it too yes sir he said carefully they pulled the probe back out cold mud slicked the surface under their gloved hands bonn marked the spot and waved to his techs here boys they waved back hopped down off the hovercab and swung within bonn and miles scrambled well out of the way onto the rocks toward the weather station the hovercab whined into the air and positioned itself over the bog its heavyduty spacerated tractor beam punched downward mud plant matter and ice geysered out in all directions with a roar in a couple of minutes the beam had created an oozing crater with a glimmering pearl at the bottom the craters sides began to slump inward at once but the hovercab operator narrowed and reversed his beam and the scatcat rose noisily sucking free from its matrix the limp bubble shelter dangled repellently from its chain the hovercab set its load down delicately in the rocky area and landed beside it bonn and miles trooped over to view the sodden remains you werent in that bubbleshelter were you ensign said bonn prodding it with his toe yes sir i was waiting for daylight i fell asleep but you got out before it sank well no when i woke up it was all the way under bonns crooked eyebrows rose how far miless flat hand found the level of his chin bonn looked startled howd you get out of the suction with difficulty and adrenalin i think i slipped out of my boots and pants which reminds me may i take a minute and look for my boots sir bonn waved a hand and miles trudged back out onto the bog circling the ring of muck spewed from the tractor beam keeping a safe distance from the now waterfilling crater he found one mudcoated boot but not the other should he save it on the offchance he might have one leg amputated someday it would probably be the wrong leg he sighed and climbed back up to bonn bonn frowned down at the ruined boot dangling from miless hand you could have been killed he said in a tone of realization three times over smothered in the bubble shelter trapped in the bog or frozen waiting for rescue bonn gave him a penetrating stare really he walked away from the deflated shelter idly as if seeking a wider view miles followed when they were out of earshot of the techs bonn stopped and scanned the bog conversationally he remarked i heard unofficiallythat a certain motorpool tech named pattas was bragging to one of his mates that hed set you up for this and you were too stupid to even realize youd been had that bragging could have been not too bright if youd been killed if id been killed it wouldnt have mattered if hed bragged or not miles shrugged what a service investigation missed i flat guarantee the imperial security investigation would have found you knew youd been set up bonn studied the horizon yes im surprised you didnt call imperial security in then oh think about it sir bonns gaze returned to miles as if taking inventory of his distasteful deformities you dont add up for me vorkosigan why did they let you in the service why dyou think vor privilege got it in one then why are you here vor privilege gets sent to hq vorbarr sultana is lovely this time of year said miles agreeably and how was his cousin ivan enjoying it right now but i want ship duty and you couldnt arrange it said bonn sceptically i was told to earn it thats why im here to prove i can handle the service or not calling in a wolf pack from impsec within a week of my arrival to turn the base and everyone on it insideout looking for assassination conspiracieswhere i judge none exist would not advance me toward my goal no matter how entertaining it might be messy charges his word against their two wordseven if miles had pushed it to a formal investigation with fastpenta to prove him right the ruckus could hurt him far more in the long run than his two tormentors no no revenge was worth the prince serg the motor pool is in engineerings chain of command if imperial security fell on it theyd also fall on me bonns brown eyes glinted youre welcome to fall on anyone you please sir but if you have unofficial ways of receiving information it follows you must have unofficial ways of sending it too and after all youve only my word for what happened miles hefted his useless single boot and heaved it back into the bog thoughtfully bonn watched it arc and splash down in a pool of brown meltwater a vor lords word means nothing in these degenerate days miles bared his teeth in a smile of sorts ask anyone huh bonn shook his head and started back toward the hovercab next morning miles reported to the maintenance shed for the second half of the scatcat retrieval job cleaning all the mudcaked equipment the sun was bright today and had been up for hours but miless body knew it was only an hour into his task hed begun to warm up feel better and get into the rhythm of the thing at the deadpan lieutenant bonn arrived and delivered two helpers unto miles why corporal olney tech pattas we meet again miles smiled with acid cheer the pair exchanged an uneasy look miles kept his demeanor absolutely even he then kept everyone starting with himself moving briskly the conversation seemed to automatically limit itself to brief wary technicalities by the time miles had to knock off and go report to lieutenant ahn the scatcat and most of the gear had been restored to better condition that miles had received it he wished his two helpers now driven to neartwitchiness by uncertainty an earnest goodday well if they hadnt figured it out by now they were hopeless miles wondered bitterly why he seemed to have so much better luck establishing rapport with bright men like bonn cecil had been right if miles couldnt figure out how to command the dull as well hed never make it as a service officer not at camp permafrost anyway the following morning the third of his official punishment seven miles presented himself to sergeant neuve the sergeant in turn presented miles with a scatcat full of equipment a disk of the related equipment manuals and the schedule for drain and culvert maintenance for lazkowski base clearly it was to be another learning experience miles wondered if general metzov had selected this task personally he rather thought so on the bright side he had his two helpers back again this particular civil engineering task had apparently never fallen on olney or pattas before either so they had no edge of superior knowledge with which to trip miles they had to stop and read the manuals first too miles swotted procedures and directed operations with a good cheer that edged toward manic as his helpers became glummer there was after all a certain fascination to the clever draincleaning devices and excitement flushing pipes with high pressure could produce some surprising effects there were chemical compounds that had some quite military properties such as the ability to dissolve anything instantly including human flesh in the following three days miles learned more about the infrastructure of lazkowski base than hed ever imagined wanting to know hed even calculated the point where one wellplaced charge could bring the entire system down if he ever decided he wanted to destroy the place on the sixth day miles and his team were sent to clear a blocked culvert out by the grubs practice fields it was easy to spot a silver sheet of water lapped the raised roadway on one side on the other only a feeble trickle emerged to creep away down the bottom of a deep ditch miles took a long telescoping pole from the back of their scatcat and probed down into the waters opaque surface nothing seemed to be blocking the flooded end of the culvert whatever it was must be jammed farther in joy he handed the pole back to pattas and wandered over to the other side of the road and stared down into the ditch the culvert he noted was something over half a meter in diameter give me a light he said to olney he shucked his parka and tossed it into the scatcat and scrambled down into the ditch he aimed his light into the aperture the culvert evidently curved slightly he couldnt see a damned thing he sighed considering the relative width of olneys shoulders pattass and his own could there be anything further from ship duty than this the closest hed come to anything of a sort was spelunking in the dendarii mountains earth and water versus fire and air he seemed to be building up a helluva supply of yin the balancing yang to come had better be stupendous he gripped the light tighter dropped to hands and knees and shinnied into the drain the icy water soaked the trouser knees of his black fatigues the effect was numbing water leaked around the top of one of his gloves it felt like a knife blade on his wrist miles meditated briefly on olney and pattas they had developed a cool reasonably efficient working relationship over the last few days based miles had no illusions on a fear of god instilled in the two men by miless good angel lieutenant bonn how did bonn accomplish that quiet authority anyway he had to figure that one out bonn was good at his job for starters but what else miles scraped round the curve shone his light on the clot and recoiled swearing he paused a moment to regain control of his breath examined the blockage more closely and backed out he stood up in the bottom of the ditch straightening his spine vertebra by creaking vertebra corporal olney stuck his head over the roads railing above whats in there ensign miles grinned up at him still catching his breath pair of boots thats all said olney their owner is still wearing em miles called the base surgeon on the scatcats comm link urgently requesting his presence with forensic kit body bag and medical transport miles and his crew then blocked the upper end of the drain with a plastic signboard forcibly borrowed from the empty practice field beyond now so thoroughly wet and cold that it made no difference miles crawled back into the culvert to attach a rope to the anonymous booted ankles when he emerged the surgeon and his corpsman had arrived the surgeon a big balding man peered dubiously into the drainpipe what could you see in there ensign what happened i cant see anything from this end but legs sir miles reported hes got himself wedged in there but good drain crud up above him id guess well have to see what spills out with him what the hell was he doing in there the surgeon scratched his freckled scalp miles spread his hands seems a peculiar way to commit suicide slow and chancy as far as drowning yourself goes the surgeon raised his eyebrows in agreement miles and the surgeon had to lend their weight on the rope to olney pattas and the corpsman before the stiff form wedged in the culvert began to scrape free hes stuck observed the corpsman grunting the body jerked out at last with a gush of dirty water pattas and olney stared from a distance miles glued himself to the surgeons shoulder the corpse dressed in sodden black fatigues was waxy and blue his collar tabs and the contents of his pockets identified him as a private from supply his body bore no obvious wounds but for bruised shoulders and scraped hands the surgeon spoke clipped negative preliminaries into his recorder no broken bones no nerve disrupter blisters preliminary hypothesis death from drowning or hypothermia or both within the last twelve hours he flipped off his recorder and added over his shoulder ill be able to tell for sure when we get him laid out back at the infirmary does this sort of thing happen often around here miles inquired mildly the surgeon shot him a sour look i slab a few idiots every year what dyou expect when you put five thousand kids between the ages of eighteen and twenty together on an island and tell em to go play war i admit this one seems to have discovered a completely new method of slabbing himself i guess you never see it all you think he did it to himself then true it would be real tricky to kill a man and then stuff him in there the surgeon wandered over to the culvert and squatted and stared into it so it would seem ah would you take one more look in there ensign just in case very well sir miles hoped it was the last trip hed never have guessed drain cleaning would turn out to be so thrilling he slithered all the way under the road to the leaky board checking every centimeter but found only the dead mans dropped hand light so the private had evidently entered the pipe on purpose with intent what intent why go culvertcrawling in the middle of the night in the middle of a heavy rainstorm miles skinned back out and turned the light over to the surgeon miles helped the corpsman and surgeon bag and load the body then had olney and pattas raise the blocking board and return it to its original location brown water gushed roaring from the bottom end of the culvert and roiled away down the ditch the surgeon paused with miles leaning on the road railing and watching the water level drop in the little lake think there might be another one at the bottom miles inquired morbidly this guy was the only one listed as missing on the morning report the surgeon replied so probably not he didnt look like he was willing to bet on it though the only thing that did turn up as the water level fell was the privates soggy parka hed clearly tossed it over the railing before entering the culvert from which it had fallen or blown into the water the surgeon took it away with him youre pretty cool about that pattas noted as miles turned away from the back of the medical transport and the surgeon and corpsman drove off pattas was not that much older than miles himself havent you ever had to handle a corpse no you yes where miles hesitated events of three years ago flickered through his memory the brief months hed been caught in desperate combat far from home having accidently fallen in with a space mercenary force was not a secret to be mentioned or even hinted at here regular imperial troops despised mercenaries anyway alive or dead but the tau verde campaign had surely taught him the difference between practice and real between war and war games and that death had subtler vectors than direct touch before said miles dampingly couple of times pattas shrugged veering off well he allowed grudgingly over his shoulder at least youre not afraid to get your hands dirty sir miless brows crooked bemused no thats not what im afraid of miles marked the drain cleared on his report panel turned the scatcat their equipment and a very subdued olney and pattas back in to sergeant neuve in maintenance and headed for the officers barracks hed never wanted a hot shower more in his entire life he was squelching down the corridor toward his quarters when another officer stuck his head out a door ah ensign vorkosigan i yes you got a vid call a while ago i encoded the return for you call miles stopped where from vorbarr sultana miles felt a chill in his belly some emergency at home thanks he reversed direction and beelined for the end of the corridor and the vidconsole booth that the officers on this level shared he slid damply into the seat and punched up the message number was not one he recognized he entered it and his chancode and waited it chimed several times then the vidplate hissed to life his cousin ivans handsome face materialized over it and grinned at him ah miles there you are ivan where the devil are you what is this oh im at home and that doesnt mean my mothers i thought you might like to see my new flat miles had the vague disoriented sensation that hed somehow tapped a line into some parallel universe or alternate astral plane vorbarr sultana yes hed lived in the capital himself in a previous incarnation eons ago ivan lifted his vid pickup and aimed it around dizzyingly its fully furnished i took over the lease from an ops captain who was being transferred to komarr a real bargain i just got moved in yesterday can you see the balcony miles could see the balcony drenched in late afternoon sunlight the color of warm honey the vorbarr sultana skyline rose like a fairytale city swimming in the summer haze beyond scarlet flowers swarmed over the railing so red in the level light they almost hurt his eyes miles felt like drooling into his shirtpocket or bursting into tears nice flowers he choked yeah mgirlfriend brought em girlfriend ah yes human beings had come in two sexes once upon a time one smelled much better than the other much which one tatya have i met her miles struggled to remember naw shes new ivan stopped waving the vid pickup around and reappeared over the vidplate miless exacerbated senses settled slightly so hows the weather up there ivan peered at him more closely are you wet what have you been doing forensic plumbing miles offered after a pause what ivans brow wrinkled never mind miles sneezed look im glad to see a familiar face and all that he was actuallya painful strange gladness but im in the middle of my duty day here i got offshift a couple of hours ago ivan remarked im taking tatya out for dinner in a bit you just caught me so just tell me quick hows life in the infantry oh great lazkowski base is the real thing yknow miles did not define what real thing not a warehouse for excess vor lordlings like imperial headquarters i do my job said ivan sounding slightly stung actually youd like my job we process information its amazing all the stuff ops accesses in a days time its like being on top of the world it would be just your speed funny ive thought that lazkowski base would be just yours ivan suppose they could have got our orders reversed ivan tapped the side of his nose and sniggered i wouldnt tell his humor sobered in a glint of real concern you ah take care of yourself up there eh you really dont look so good ive had an unusual morning if youd sod off i could go get a shower oh right well take care enjoy your dinner rightoh bye voices from another universe at that vorbarr sultana was only a couple of hours away by suborbital flight in theory miles was obscurely comforted to be reminded that the whole planet hadnt shrunk to the leadgrey horizons of kyril island even if his part of it seemed to have miles found it difficult to concentrate on the weather the rest of that day fortunately his superior didnt much notice since the scatcat sinking ahn had tended to maintain a guilty nervous silence around miles except when directly prodded for specific information when his dutyday ended miles headed straight for the infirmary the surgeon was still working or at least sitting at his desk console when miles poked his head around the doorframe good evening sir the surgeon glanced up yes ensign what is it miles took this as sufficient invitation despite the unencouraging tone of voice and slipped within i was wondering what youd found out about that fellow we pulled from the culvert this morning the surgeon shrugged not that much to find out his id checked he died of drowning all the physical and metabolic evidence stress hypothermia the hematomasare consistent with his being stuck in there for a bit less than half an hour before death ive ruled it death by misadventure yes but why why the surgeons eyebrows rose he slabbed himself youll have to ask him eh dont you want to find out to what purpose well to know i guess to be sure youre right the surgeon gave him a dry stare im not questioning your medical findings sir miles added hastily but it was just so damn weird arent you curious not any more said the surgeon im satisfied it wasnt suicide or foul play so whatever the details it comes down to death from stupidity in the end doesnt it miles wondered if that would have been the surgeons final epitaph on him if hed sunk himself with the scatcat i suppose so sir standing outside the infirmary afterward in the damp wind miles hesitated the corpse after all was not miless personal property not a case of finderskeepers hed turned the situation over to the proper authority it was out of his hands now and yet there were still several hours of daylight left miles was having trouble sleeping anyway in these almostendless days he returned to his quarters pulled on sweat pants and shirt and running shoes and went jogging the road was lonely out by the empty practice fields the sun crawled crabwise toward the horizon miles broke from a jog back to a walk then to a slower walk his legbraces chafed beneath his pants one of these days very soon he would take the time to get the brittle long bones in his legs replaced with synthetics at that elective surgery might be a quasilegitimate way to lever himself off kyril island if things got too desperate before his six months were up it seemed like cheating though he looked around trying to imagine his present surroundings in the dark and heavy rain if he had been the private slogging along this road about midnight what would he have seen what could possibly have attracted the mans attention to the ditch why the hell had he come out here in the middle of the night in the first place this road wasnt on the way to anything but an obstacle course and a firing range there was the ditch no his ditch was the next one a little farther on four culverts pierced the raised roadway along this halfkilometer straight stretch miles found the correct ditch and leaned on the railing staring down at the nowsluggish trickle of drain water there was nothing attractive about it now that was certain why why why miles sloped along up the high side of the road examining the road surface the railing the sodden brown bracken beyond he came to the curve and turned back studying the opposite side he arrived back at the first ditch on the baseward end of the straight stretch without discovering any view of charm or interest miles perched on the railing and meditated all right time to try a little logic what overwhelming emotion had led the private to wedge himself in the drain despite the obvious danger rage what had he been pursuing fear what could have been pursuing him error miles knew all about error what if the man had picked the wrong culvert impulsively miles slithered down into the first ditch either the man had been methodically working his way through all the culverts if so had he been working from the base out or from the practice fields backor else he had missed his intended target in the dark and rain and got into the wrong one miles would give them all a crawlthrough if he had to but he preferred to be right the first time even if there wasnt anybody watching this culvert was slightly wider in diameter than the second lethal one miles pulled his hand light from his belt ducked within and began examining it centimeter by centimeter ah he breathed in satisfaction midway beneath the road there was his prize stuck to the upper side of the culverts arc with sagging tape a package wrapped in waterproof plastic how interesting he slithered out and sat in the mouth of the culvert careless of the damp but carefully out of view from the road above he placed the packet on his lap and studied it with pleasurable anticipation as if it had been a birthday present could it be drugs contraband classified documents criminal cash personally miles hoped for classified documents though it was hard to imagine anyone classifying anything on kyril island except maybe the efficiency reports drugs would be all right but a spy ring would be just wonderful hed be a security herohis mind raced ahead already plotting the next move in his covert investigation following the dead mans trail through subtle clues to some ringleader who knew how high up the dramatic arrests maybe a commendation from simon illyan himself the package was lumpy but crackled slightlyplastic flimsies heart hammering he eased it openand slumped in stunned i disappointment a pained breath halflaugh halfmoan puffed from his lips pastries a couple of dozen lisettes a kind of miniature popovers glazed and stuffed with candied fruit made traditionally for the midsummer day celebration month and a half old stale pastries what a cause to die for miless imagination fueled by knowledge of barracks life sketched in the rest readily enough the private had received this package from some sweetheartmothersister and sought to protect it from his ravenous mates who would have wolfed it all down in seconds perhaps the man starved for home had been rationing them out to himself morsel by morsel in a lingering masochistic ritual pleasure and pain mixed with each bite or maybe hed just been saving them for some special occasion then came the two days of unusual heavy rain and the man had begun to fear for his secret treasures ah liquidity margin hed come out to rescue his cache missed the first ditch in the dark gone at the second in desperate determination as the waters rose realized his mistake too late sad a little sickening but not useful miles sighed and bundled the lisettes back up and trotted off with the package under his arm back to the base to turn it over to the surgeon the surgeons only comment when miles caught up with him and explained his findings was yep death from stupidity all right absently he bit into a lisette and sniffed miless time on maintenance detail ended the next day without his finding anything in the sewers of greater interest than the drowned man it was probably just as well the following day ahns office corporal arrived back from his long leave miles discovered that the corporal whod been working the weather office for some two years was a ready reservoir of the greater part of the information miles had spent the last two weeks busting his brains to learn he didnt have ahns nose though ahn actually left camp permafrost sober walking up the transports ramp under his own power miles went to the shuttle pad to see him off not certain if he was glad or sorry to see the weatherman go ahn looked happy though his lugubrious face almost illuminated so where are you headed once you turn in your uniforms miles asked him the equator ah where on the equator anywhere on the equator ahn replied with fervor miles trusted hed at least pick a spot with a suitable land mass under it ahn hesitated on the ramp looking down at miles watch out for metzov he advised at last this warning seemed remarkably late not to mention maddeningly vague miles gave ahn an exasperated look up from under his raised eyebrows i doubt ill be much featured on his social calendar ahn shifted uncomfortably thats not what i meant what do you mean well i dont know i once saw what ahn shook his head nothing it was a long time ago a lot of crazy things were happening at the height of the komarr revolt but its better that you should stay out of his way ive had to deal with old martinets before oh hes not exactly a martinet but hes got a streak of he can be a funny kind of dangerous dont ever really threaten him huh me threaten metzov miless face screwed up in bafflement maybe ahn wasnt as sober as he smelled after all come on he cant be that bad or theyd never put him in charge of trainees he doesnt command the grubs they have their own hierarchy comes in with emthe instructors report to their own commander metzovs just in charge of the bases permanent physical plant youre a pushy little sod vorkosigan just dont ever push him to the edge or youll be sorry and thats all im going to say ahn shut his mouth determinedly and headed up the ramp im already sorry miles thought of calling after him well his punishment week was over now perhaps metzov had meant the labor detail to humiliate miles but actually it had been quite interesting sinking his scatcat now that had been humiliating that he had done to himself miles waved one last time to ahn as he disappeared into the transport shuttle shrugged and headed back across the tarmac toward the nowfamiliar admin building it took a full couple of minutes after miless corporal had left the weather office for lunch for miles to yield to the temptation to scratch the itch ahn had planted in his mind and punch up metzovs public record on the comconsole the mere listing of the base commanders dates assignments and promotions was not terribly informative though a little knowledge of history filled in between the lines metzov had entered the service some thirtyfive years ago his most rapid promotions had occurred not surprisingly during the conquest of the planet komarr about twentyfive years ago the wormholerich komarr system was barrayars sole gate to the greater galactic wormhole route nexus komarr had proved its immense strategic importance to barrayar earlier in the century when its ruling oligarchy had accepted a bribe to let a cetagandan invasion fleet pass through its wormholes and descend on barrayar throwing the cetagandans back out again had consumed a barrayaran generation barrayar had turned its bloody lesson around in miless fathers day as an unavoidable side effect of securing komarrs gates barrayar had been transformed from backwater culdesac to a minor but significant galactic power and was still wrestling with the consequences metzov had somehow managed to end up on the correct side during vordarians pretendership a purely barrayaran attempt to wrest power from thenfiveyearold emperor gregor and his regent two decades pastpicking the wrong side in that civil affray would have been miless first guess why such an apparently competent officer had ended up marking out his later years on ice on kyril island but the dead halt to metzovs career seemed to come during the komarr revolt some sixteen years ago now no hint in this file as to why but for a crossreference to another file an imperial security code miles recognized dead end there or maybe not lips compressed thoughtfully miles punched through another code on his comconsole operations commodore jollifs office ivan began formally as his face materialized over the comconsole vid plate then oh hello miles whats up im doing a little research thought you might help me out i should have known you wouldnt call me at hq just to be sociable so what dyou want ah do you have the office to yourself just at present yeah the old mans stuck in committee nice little flapa barrayaranregistered freighter got itself impounded in the hegen hub at vervain stationfor suspicion of espionage can we get at it threaten rescue not past pol no barrayaran military vessels may jump through their wormholes period i thought we were sort of friends with pol sort of but the vervani have been threatening to break off diplomatic relations with pol so the polians are being extracautious funny thing about it the freighter in question isnt even one of our real agents seems to be a completely manufactured accusation wormhole route politics jumpship tactics just the sort of challenge his imperial academy courses had trained miles to meet furthermore it was probably warm on those spaceships and space stations miles sighed envy ivans eyes narrowed in belated suspicion why do you ask if im alone i want you to pull a file for me ancient history not current events miles reassured him and reeled off the codestring ah ivans hand started to tap it out then stopped are you crazy thats an imperial security file no can do of course you can youre right there arent you ivan shook his head smugly not any more the whole impsec file systems been made supersecure you cant transfer data out of it except through a coded filtercable which you must physically attach which i would have to sign for which i would have to explain why i wanted it and produce authorization you got an authorization for this ha i thought not miles frowned in frustration surely you can call it up on the internal system on the internal system yes what i cant do is connect the internal system to any external system for a data dump so youre out of luck you got an internal system comconsole in that office sure so said miles impatiently call up the file turn your desk around and let the two vids talk to each other you can do that cant you ivan scratched his head would that work try it miles drummed his fingers while ivan dragged his desk around and fiddled with focus the signal was degraded but readable there i thought so scroll it up for me would you fascinating utterly fascinating the file was a collection of secret reports from an impsec investigation into the mysterious death of a prisoner in metzovs charge a komarran rebel who had killed his guard and himself been killed while attempting to escape when impsec had demanded the komarrans body for an autopsy metzov had turned over cremated ashes and an apology if only he had been told a few hours earlier the body was wanted etc the investigating officer hinted at charges of illegal tortureperhaps in revenge for the death of the guardbut was unable to amass enough evidence to obtain authorization to fastpenta the barrayaran witnesses including a certain techensign ahn the investigating officer had lodged a formal protest of his superior officers decision to close the case and there it ended apparently if there was any more to the story it existed only in simon illyans remarkable head a secret file miles was not about to attempt to access and yet metzovs career had stopped literally cold miles ivan interrupted for the fourth time i really dont think we should be doing this this is slityourthroatbeforereading stuff here if we shouldnt do it we shouldnt be able to do it youd still have to have the cable for flashdownloading no real spy would be dumb enough to sit there inside imperial hq by the hour and scroll stuff through by hand waiting to be caught and shot that does it ivan killed the security file with a swat of his hand the vid image wavered wildly as ivan dragged his desk back around followed by scrubbing noises as he frantically rubbed out the tracks in his carpet with his boot i didnt do this you hear i didnt mean you were not spies miles subsided glumly still i suppose somebody ought to tell illyan about the little hole they overlooked in his security arrangements not me why not you put it in as a brilliant theoretical suggestion maybe youll earn a commendation dont tell em we actually did it of course or maybe we were just testing your theory eh you said ivan severely are careerpoison never darken my vidplate again except at home of course miles grinned and permitted his cousin to escape he sat awhile in the office watching the colorful weather holos flicker and change and thinking about his base commander and the kinds of accidents that could happen to defiant prisoners well it had all been very long ago metzov himself would probably be retiring in another five years with his status as a doubletwentyyearsman and a pension to merge into the population of unpleasant old men not so much a problem to be solved as to be outlived at least by miles his ultimate purpose at lazkowski base miles reminded himself was to escape lazkowski base silently as smoke metzov would be left behind in time in the next weeks miles settled into a tolerable routine for one thing the grubs arrived all five thousand of them miless status rose on their shoulders to that of almosthuman lazkowski base suffered its first real snow of the season as the days shortened plus a mild wahwah lasting half a day both of which miles managed to predict accurately in advance even more happily miles was completely displaced as the most famous idiot on the island an unwelcome notoriety earned by the scatcat sinking by a group of grubs who managed one night to set their barracks on fire while lighting fartflares miless strategic suggestion at the officers firesafety meeting next day that they tackle the problem with a logistical assault on the enemys fuel supply ie eliminate redbean stew from the menu was shot down with one icy glower from general metzov though in the hallway later an earnest captain from ordnance stopped miles to thank him for trying so much for the glamour of the imperial service miles took to spending long hours alone in the weather office studying chaos theory his readouts and the walls three months down three to go it was getting darker miles was out of bed and half dressed before it penetrated his sleepstunned brain that the galvanizing klaxon was not the wahwah warning he paused with a boot in his hand not fire or enemy attack either not his department then whatever it was the rhythmic blatting stopped they were right silence was golden he checked the glowing digital clock it claimed midevening hed only been asleep about two hours having fallen into bed exhausted after a long trip upisland in a snow storm to repair wind damage to weather station eleven the comm link by his bed was not blinking its red call light to inform him of any surprise duties he must carry out he could go back to bed silence was baffling he pulled on the second boot and stuck his head out his door a couple of other officers had done the same and were speculating to each other on the cause of the alarm lieutenant bonn emerged from his quarters and strode down the hall jerking on his parka his face looked strained halfworry halfannoyance miles grabbed his own parka and galloped after him you need a hand lieutenant bonn glanced down at him and pursed his lips i might he flowed miles fell in beside him secretly pleased by bonns implicit judgment that he might in fact be useful so whats up some sort of accident in a toxic stores bunker if its the one i think we could have a real problem they exited the doubledoored heatretaining vestibule from the officers quarters into a night gone crystal cold fine snow squeaked under miless boots and swept along the ground in a faint east wind the brightest stars overhead held their own against the bases lights the two men slid into bonns scatcat their breath smoking until the canopydefrost cut in bonn headed west out of the base at high acceleration a few kilometers past the last practice fields a row of turftopped barrows hunched in the snow a cluster of vehicles was parked at the end of one bunkera couple of scatcats including the one belonging to the base fire marshall and medical transport handlights moved among them bonn slewed in and pulled up and popped his door miles followed him crunching rapidly across the packed ice the surgeon was directing a pair of corpsmen who were loading a foilblanketed shape and a second coverallclad soldier who shivered and coughed onto the med transport all of you put everything youre wearing into the destruct bin when you hit the door he called after them blankets bedding splints everything full decontamination showers for you all before you even start to worry about that broken leg of his the painkiller will hold him through it and if it doesnt ignore him and keep scrubbing ill be right behind you the surgeon shuddered turning away whistling dismay through his teeth bonn headed for the bunker door dont open that the surgeon and the fire marshall called together theres nobody left inside the surgeon added all evacuated now what exactly happened bonn scrubbed with a gloved hand at the frosted window set in the door in an effort to see inside couple of guys were moving stores to make room for a new shipment coming in tomorrow the fire marshall a lieutenant named yaski filled him in rapidly they dumped their loader over one got pinned underneath with a broken leg that took ingenuity said bonn obviously picturing the mechanics of the loader in his mind they had to have been horsing around said the surgeon impatiently but thats not the worst of it they took several barrels of fetaine over with them and at least two broke open the stuffs all over the place in there weve sealed the bunker as best we could cleanup the surgeon exhaled is your problem im gone he looked like he wanted to crawl out of his own skin as well as his clothes he waved making quickly for his scatcat to follow his corpsmen and their patients through medical decontamination fetaine miles exclaimed in startlement bonn had retreated hastily from the door fetaine was a mutagenic poison invented as a terror weapon but never so far as miles knew used in combat i thought that stuff was obsolete off the menu his academy course in chemicals and biologicals had barely mentioned it it is obsolete said bonn grimly they havent made any in twenty years for all i know this is the last stockpile on barrayar dammit those storage barrels shouldnt have broken open even if youd dropped em out a shuttle those storage barrels are at least twenty years old then the marshall pointed out corrosion in that case bonn craned his neck what about the rest of them exactly nodded yaski isnt fetaine destroyed by heat miles asked nervously checking to make sure they were standing around discussing this upwind of the bunker chemically dissociated into harmless components i heard well not exactly harmless said lieutenant yaski but at least they dont unravel all the dna in your balls are there any explosives stored in there lieutenant bonn miles asked no only the fetaine if you tossed a couple of plasma mines through the door would the fetaine all be chemically cracked before the roof melted in you wouldnt want the roof to melt in or the floor if that stuff ever got loose in the permafrost but if you set the mines on slow heat release and threw a few kilos of neutral plasseal in with em the bunker might be selfsealing bonns lips moved in silent calculation yeah thatd work in fact that could be the safest way to deal with that crap particularly if the rest of the barrels are starting to lose integrity too depending on which way the wind is blowing put in lieutenant yaski looking back toward the base and then at miles were expecting a light east wind with dropping temperatures till about tomorrow morning miles answered his look then itll shift around to the north and blow harder potential wahwah conditions starting around tomorrow night if were going to do it that way wed better do it tonight then said yaski all right said bonn decisively ill round up my crew you round up yours ill pull the plans for the bunker calculate the charges releaserate and meet you and the ordnance chief in admin in an hour bonn posted the fire marshalls sergeant as guard to keep everyone well away from the bunker an unenviable duty but not unbearable in present conditions and the guard could retreat inside his scatcat when the temperature dropped toward midnight miles rode back with bonn to the base administration building to doublecheck his promises about wind direction at the weather office miles ran the latest data through the weather computers that he might present bonn with the most refined possible update on predicted wind vectors over the next hour barrayaran day but before he had the printout in his hand he saw bonn and yaski out the window down below hurrying away from the admin building into the dark perhaps they were meeting with the ordnance chief elsewhere miles considered chasing after them but the new prediction was not significantly different from the older one did he really need to go watch them cauterize the poison dump it could be interesting educationalon the other hand he had no real function there now as his parents only childas the father perhaps of some future count vorkosiganit was arguable if he even had the right to expose himself to such a vile mutagenic hazard for mere curiosity there seemed no immediate danger to the base till the wind shifted anyway or was cowardice masquerading as logic prudence was a virtue he had heard now thoroughly awake and too rattled to even imagine recapturing sleep he pottered around the weather office and caught up on all the routine files he had set aside that morning in favor of the repairs junket an hour of steady plugging finished off everything that even remotely looked like work when he found himself compulsively dusting equipment and shelves he decided it was time to go back to bed sleep or no sleep but a shifting light from the window caught his eye a scatcat pulling up out front ah bonn and yaski back already that had been fast or hadnt they started yet miles tore off the plastic flimsy with the new wind readout and headed downstairs to the base engineering office at the end of the corridor bonns office was dark but light spilled into the corridor from the base commanders office light and angry voices rising and falling clutching the flimsy miles approached the door was open to the inner office metzov sat at his desk console one clenched fist resting on the flickering colored surface bonn and yaski stood tensely before him miles rattled the flimsy cautiously to announce his presence yaskis head swivelled around and his gaze caught miles send vorkosigan hes a mutant already isnt he miles gave a vaguelydirected salute and said immediately pardon me sir but no im not my last encounter with a military poison did teratogenic damage not genetic my future children should be as healthy as the next mans ah send me where sir metzov glowered across at miles but did not pursue yaskis unsettling suggestion miles handed the flimsy wordlessly to bonn who glanced at it grimaced and stuffed it savagely into his trouser pocket of course i intended them to wear protective gear continued metzov to bonn in irritation im not mad i understood that sir but the men refuse to enter the bunker even with contamination gear bonn reported in a flat steady voice i cant blame them the standard precautions are inadequate for fetaine in my estimation the stuff has an incredibly high penetration value for its molecular weight goes right through permeables you cant blame them repeated metzov in astonishment lieutenant you gave an order or you were supposed to i did sir but butyou let them sense your own indecision your weakness dammit when you give an order you have to give it not dance around it why do we have to save this stuff said yaski plaintively weve been over that its our charge metzov grunted at him our orders you cant ask a man to give an obedience you dont give yourself what blind surely research still has the recipe miles put in feeling he was at last getting the alarming drift of this argument they can mix up more if they really want it fresh shut up vorkosigan bonn growled desperately out of the corner of his mouth as general metzov snapped open your lip tonight with one more sample of your humor ensign and ill put you on charges miless lips closed over his teeth in a tight glassy smile subordination the prince serg he reminded himself metzov could go drink the fetaine for all miles cared and it would be no skin off his nose his clean nose remember have you never heard of the fine old battlefield practice of shooting the man who disobeys your order lieutenant metzov went on to bonn i dont think i can make that threat sir said bonn stiffly and besides thought miles were not on a battlefield are we techs said metzov in a tone of disgust i didnt say threaten i said shoot make one example the rest will fall in line miles decided he didnt much care for metzovs brand of humor either or was the general speaking literally sir fetaine is a violent mutagen said bonn doggedly im not at all sure the rest would fall into line no matter what the threat its a pretty unreasonable topic im a little unreasonable about it myself so i see metzov stared at him coldly his glare passed on to yaski who swallowed and stood straighter his spine offering no concession miles tried to cultivate invisibility if youre going to go on pretending to be military officers you techs need a lesson in how to extract obedience from your men metzov decided both of you go and assemble your crew in front of admin in twenty minutes were going to have a little oldfashioned discipline parade youre notseriously thinking of shooting anyone are you said lieutenant yaski in alarm metzov smiled sourly i doubt ill have to he regarded miles whats the outside temperature right now weather officer five degrees of frost sir replied miles careful now to speak only when spoken to and the wind winds from the east at nine kilometers per hour sir very good metzovs eye gleamed wolfishly dismissed gentlemen see if you can carry out your orders this time general metzov stood heavily gloved and parkabundled beside the empty metal bannerpole in front of admin and stared down the halflit road looking for what miles wondered it was pushing midnight now yaski and bonn were lining up their tech crews in parade for array some fifteen thermalcoveralled and parkaclad men miles shivered and not just from the cold metzovs seamed face looked angry and tired and old and scary he reminded miles a bit of his grandfather on a bad day though metzov was in fact younger than miless father miles had been a child of his fathers middle age some generational skew there his grandfather the old general count piotr himself had sometimes seemed a refugee from another century now the really oldfashioned discipline parades had involved leadlined rubber hoses how far back in barrayaran history was metzovs mind rooted metzov smiled a gloss over rage and turned his head at a movement down the road in a horribly cordial voice he confided to miles you know ensign there was a secret behind that carefullycultivated interservice rivalry they had back on old earth in the event of a mutiny you could always persuade the army to shoot the navy or vice versa when they could no longer discipline themselves a hidden disadvantage to a combined service like ours mutiny said miles startled out of his resolve to speak only when spoken to i thought the issue was poison exposure it was unfortunately due to bonns mishandling its now a matter of principle a muscle jumped in metzovs jaw it had to happen sometime in the new service the soft service typical old service talk that old men bullshitting each other about how tough theyd had it in the old days principle sir what principle its waste disposal miles choked its a mass refusal to obey a direct order ensign mutiny by any barrackslawyers definition fortunately this sort of thing is easy to dislocate if you move quickly while its still small and confused the motion down the road resolved itself into a platoon of grubs in their winterwhite camouflage gear marching under the direction of a base sergeant miles recognized the sergeant as part of metzovs personal powernet an old veteran whod served under metzov as far back as the komarr revolt and who had moved on with his master the grubs miles saw had been armed with lethal nervedisruptors which were purely antipersonnel hand weapons for all the time they spent learning about such things the opportunity for even advanced trainees such as these to lay hands on fully powered deadly weapons was rare and miles could sense their nervous excitement from here the sergeant lined the grubs up in a crossfire array around the stiffstanding techs and barked an order they presented their weapons and aimed them the silver bellmuzzles gleaming in the scattered light from the admin building a twitchy ripple ran through bonns men bonns face was ghastly white his eyes glittering like jet strip metzov ordered through set teeth disbelief confusion only one or two of the techs grasped what was being demanded and began to undress the others with many uncertain glances around belatedly followed suit when you are again ready to obey your orders metzov continued in a paradepitched voice that carried to every man you may dress and go to work its up to you he stepped back nodded to his sergeant and took up a pose of parade rest thatll cool em off he muttered to himself barely loud enough for miles to catch metzov looked like he fully expected to be out there no more than five minutes he looked like he was already thinking of warm quarters and a hot drink olney and pattas were among the techs miles noted along with most of the rest of the greekspeaking cadre who had plagued miles early on others miles had seen around or talked to during his private investigation into the background of the drowned man or barely knew fifteen naked men starting to shiver violently as the dry snow whispered around their ankles fifteen bewildered faces beginning to look terrified eyes shifted toward the nervedisruptors trained on them give in miles urged silently its not worth it but more than one pair of eyes flickered at him and squeezed shut in resolution miles silently cursed the anonymous clever boffin whod invented fetaine as a terror weapon not for his chemistry but for his insight into the barrayaran psyche fetaine could surely never have been used could never be used any faction trying to do so must rise up against itself and tear apart in moral convulsions yaski standing back from his men looked thoroughly horrified bonn his expression black and brittle as obsidian began to strip off his gloves and parka no no no miles screamed inside his head if you join them theyll never back down theyll know theyre right bad mistake bad bonn dropped the rest of his clothes in a pile marched forward joined the line wheeled and locked eyes with metzov metzovs eyes narrowed with new fury so he hissed you convict yourself freeze then how had things gone so bad so fast now would be a good time to remember a duty in the weather office and get the hell out of here if only those shivering bastards would back down miles could get through this night without a ripple in his record he had no duty no function here metzovs eye fell on miles vorkosigan you can either take up a weapon and be useful or consider yourself dismissed he could leave could he leave when he made no move the sergeant walked over and thrust a nerve disrupter into miless hand miles took it up still struggling to think with brains gone suddenly porridge he did retain the wit to make sure the safety was on before pointing the disrupter vaguely in the direction of the freezing men this isnt going to be a mutiny its going to be a massacre one of the armed grubs giggled nervously what had they been told they were doing what did they believe they were doing eighteen nineteenyearoldscould they even recognize a criminal order or know what to do about it if they did could miles the situation was ambiguous that was the problem it didnt quite fit miles knew about criminal orders every academy man did his father came down personally and gave a oneday seminar on the topic to the seniors at midyear hed made it a requirement to graduate by imperial fiat back when hed been regent what exactly constituted a criminal order when and how to disobey it with vid evidence from various historical test cases and bad examples including the politically disastrous solstice massacre that had taken place under the admirals own command invariably one or more cadets had to leave the room to throw up during that part the other instructors hated vorkosigans day their classes were subtly disrupted for weeks afterward one reason admiral vorkosigan didnt wait till any later in the year he almost always had to make a return trip a few weeks after to talk some disturbed cadet out of dropping out at almost the finale of his schooling only the academy cadets got this live lecture as far as miles knew though his father talked of canning it on holovid and making it a part of basic training servicewide parts of the seminar had been a revelation even to miles but this if the techs had been civilians metzov would clearly be in the wrong if this had been in wartime while being harried by some enemy metzov might be within his rights even duty this was somewhere between soldiers disobeying but passively not an enemy in sight not even a physical situation threatening necessarily lives on the base except theirs though when the wind shifted that could change im not ready for this not yet not so soon what was right my career claustrophobic panic rose in miless chest like a man with his head caught in a drain the nerve disruptor wavered just slightly in his hand over the parabolic reflector he could see bonn standing dumbly too congealed now even to argue any more ears were turning white out there and fingers and feet one man crumpled into a shuddering ball but made no move to surrender was there any softening of doubt yet in metzovs rigid neck for a lunatic moment miles envisioned thumbing off the safety and shooting metzov and then what shoot the grubs he couldnt possibly get them all before they got him i could be the only soldier here under thirty whos ever killed an enemy before in battle or out of it the grubs might fire out of ignorance or sheer curiosity they didnt know enough not to what we do in the next half hour will replay in our heads as long as we breathe he could try doing nothing only follow orders how much trouble could he get into only following orders every commander hed ever had agreed he needed to follow orders better think youll enjoy your ship duty then ensign vorkosigan you and your pack of frozen ghosts at least youd never be lonely miles still holding up the nerve disruptor faded backward out of the grubs lineofsight out of the corner of metzovs eye tears stung and blurred his vision from the cold no doubt he sat on the ground pulled off his gloves and boots let his parka fall and his shirts trousers and thermal underwear atop the pile and the nervedisruptor nested carefully on them he stepped forward his leg braces felt like icicles against his calves i hate passive resistance i really really hate it what the hell do you think youre doing ensign metzov snarled as miles limped past him breaking this up sir miles replied steadily even now some of the shivering techs flinched away from him as if his deformities might be contagious pattas didnt draw away though nor bonn bonn tried that bluff hes now regretting it it wont work for you either vorkosigan metzovs voice shook too though not from the cold you should have said ensign whats in a name miles could see the ripple of dismay run through the grubs that time no this hadnt worked for bonn miles might be the only man here for whom this sort of individual intervention could work depending on how far gone mad metzov was by now miles spoke now for both metzovs benefit and the grubs its possiblebarelythat service security wouldnt investigate the deaths of lieutenant bonn and his men if you diddled the record claimed some accident i guarantee imperial security will investigate mine metzov grinned strangely suppose no witnesses survive to complain metzovs sergeant looked as rigid as his master miles thought of ahn drunken ahn silent ahn what had ahn seen once long ago when crazy things were happening on komarr what kind of surviving witness had he been a guilty one perhaps sssorry sir but i see at least ten witnesses behind those nerve disrupters silver parabolasthey looked enormous like serving dishes from this new angle the change in point of view was amazingly clarifying no ambiguities now miles continued or do you propose to execute your firing squad and then shoot yourself imperial security will fastpenta everyone in sight you cant silence me living or dead through my mouth or yoursor theirsi will testify shivers racked miless body astonishing the effect of just that little bit of east wind at this temperature he fought to keep the shakes out of his voice lest cold be mistaken for fear small consolation if youahpermit yourself to freeze id say ensign metzovs heavy sarcasm grated on miless nerves the man still thought he was winning insane miless bare feet felt strangely warm now his eyelashes were crunchy with ice he was catching up fast to the others in terms of freezing to death no doubt because of his smaller mass his body was turning a blotchy purpleblue the snowblanketed base was so silent he could almost hear the individual snow grains skitter across the sheet ice he could hear the vibrating bones of each man around him pick out the hollow frightened breathing of the grubs time stretched he could threaten metzov break up his complacency with dark hints about komarr the truth will out he could call on his fathers rank and position he could dammit metzov must realize he was overextended no matter how mad he was his discipline parade bluff hadnt worked and now he was stuck with it stonily defending his authority unto death he can be a funny kind of dangerous if you really threaten him it was hard to see through the sadism to the underlying fear but it had to be there underneath pushing wasnt working metzov was practically petrified with resistance what about pulling but consider sir miless words stuttered out persuasively the advantages to yourself of stopping now you now have clear evidence of a mutinous er conspiracy you can arrest us all throw us in the stockade its a better revenge cause you get it all and lose nothing i lose my career get a dishonorable discharge or maybe prisondo you think i wouldnt rather die service security punishes the rest of us for you you get it all miless words had hooked him miles could see it in the red glow fading from the narrowed eyes in the slight bending of that stiff stiff neck miles had only to let the line out refrain from jerking on it and renewing metzovs fighting frenzy wait metzov stepped nearer bulking in the halflight haloed by his freezing breath his voice dropped pitched to miless ear alone a typical soft vorkosigan answer your father was soft on komarran scum cost us lives a courtmartial for the admirals little boythat might bring down that holierthanthou buggerer eh miles swallowed icy spit those who do not know their history his thought careened are doomed to keep stepping in it alas so were those who did it seemed thermo the damned fetaine spill he whispered hoarsely and see youre all under arrest metzov bellowed out suddenly his shoulders hunching get dressed the others looked stunned with relief then after a last uncertain glance at the nerve disrupters they dove for their clothes donning them with frantic coldclumsy hands but miles had seen it complete in metzovs eyes sixty seconds earlier it reminded him of that definition of his fathers a weapon is a device for making your enemy change his mind the mind was the first and final battleground the stuff in between was just noise lieutenant yaski had taken the opportunity afforded by miless attentionarresting nude arrival on center stage to quietly disappear into the admin building and make several frantic calls as a result the trainees commander the base surgeon and metzovs secondincommand arrived primed to persuade or perhaps sedate and confine metzov but by that time miles bonn and the techs were already dressed and being marched stumbling toward the stockade bunker under the arguseyes of the nerve disrupters am i ssupposed to ththank you for this bonn asked miles through chattering teeth their hands and feet swung like paralyzed lumps he leaned on miles miles hung on him hobbling down the road together we got what we wanted eh hes going to plasma the fetaine onsite before the wind shifts in the morning nobody dies nobody gets their nuts curdled we win i think miles emitted a deathly cackle through numb lips i never thought wheezed bonn that id ever meet anybody crazier than metzov i didnt do anything you didnt protested miles except i made it work sort of itll all look different in the morning anyway yeah worse bonn predicted glumly miles jerked up out of an uneasy doze on his cell cot when the door hissed open they were bringing bonn back miles rubbed his unshaven face what time is it out there lieutenant dawn bonn looked as pale stubbled and criminally low as miles felt he eased himself down on his cot with a pained grunt whats happening service securitys all over the place they flew in a captain from the mainland just arrived who seems to be in charge metzovs been filling his ear i think theyre just taking depositions so far they get the fetaine taken care of yep bonn vented a grim snicker they just had me out to check it and sign the job off the bunker made a neat little oven all right ensign vorkosigan youre wanted said the security guard whod delivered bonn come with me now miles creaked to his feet and limped toward the cell door see you later lieutenant right if you spot anybody out there with breakfast why dont you use your political influence to send em my way eh miles grinned bleakly ill try miles followed the guard up the stockades short corridor lazkowski bases stockade was not exactly what one would call a highsecurity facility being scarcely more than a living quarters bunker with doors that only locked from the outside and no windows the weather usually made a better guard than any force screen not to mention the kilometerwide icewater moat surrounding the island the base security office was busy this morning two grim strangers stood waiting by the door a lieutenant and a big sergeant with the horuseye insignia of imperial security on their sleek uniforms imperial security not service security miless very own security who had guarded his family all his fathers political life miles regarded them with possessive delight the base security clerk looked harried his desk console lit up and blinking ensign vorkosigan sir i need your palm print on this all right what am i signing just the travel orders sir what ah miles paused holding up his plasticmitted hands which one the right i guess would do sir with difficulty miles peeled off the right mitten with his awkward left his hand glistened with the medical gel that was supposed to be healing the frostbite his hand was swollen redblotched and mangledlooking but the stuff must be working all his fingers now wriggled it took three tries pressing down on the id pad before the computer recognized him now yours sir the clerk nodded to the imperial security lieutenant the impsec man laid his hand on the pad and the computer bleeped approval he lifted it and glanced dubiously at the sticky sheen looked around futilely for some towel and wiped it surreptitiously on his trouser seam just behind his stunner holster the clerk dabbed nervously at the pad with his uniform sleeve and touched his intercom am i glad to see you fellows miles told the impsec officer wish youd been here last night the lieutenant did not smile in return im just a courier ensign im not supposed to discuss your case general metzov ducked through the door from the inner office a sheaf of plastic flimsies in one hand and a service security captain at his elbow who nodded warily to his counterpart on the imperial side the general was almost smiling good morning ensign vorkosigan his glance took in imperial security without dismay dammit impsec should be making that nearmurderer shake in his combat boots it seems theres a wrinkle in this case even i hadnt realized when a vor lord involves himself in a military mutiny a charge of high treason follows automatically what miles swallowed to bring his voice back down lieutenant im not under arrest by imperial security am i the lieutenant produced a set of handcuffs and proceeded to attach miles to the big sergeant overholt read the name on the mans badge which miles mentally redubbed overkill he had only to lift his arm to dangle miles like a kitten you are being detained pending further investigation said lieutenant formally how long indefinitely the lieutenant headed for the door the sergeant and perforce miles following where miles asked frantically imperial security headquarters vorbarr sultana i need to get my things your quarters have already been cleared will i be coming back here i dont know ensign late dawn was streaking camp permafrost with grey and yellow when the scatcat deposited them at the shuttlepad the imperial security suborbital courier shuttle sat on the icy concrete like a bird of prey accidently placed in a pigeon cote slick and black and deadly it seemed to break the sound barrier just resting there its pilot was at the ready engines primed for takeoff miles shuffled awkwardly up the ramp after sergeant overkill the handcuff jerking coldly on his wrist tiny ice crystals danced in the northeasterly wind the temperature would be stabilizing this morning he could tell by the particular dry bite of the relative humidity in his sinuses dear god it was past time to get off this island miles took one last sharp breath then the shuttle door sealed behind them with a snaky hiss within was a thick upholstered silence that even the howl of the engines scarcely penetrated at least it was warm autumn in the city of vorbarr sultana was a beautiful time of year and today was exemplary the air was high and blue the temperature cool and perfect and even the tang of industrial haze smelled good the autumn flowers were not yet frosted off but the earthimport trees had turned their colors as he was hustled out of the security lift van and into a back entrance to the big blocky building that was imperial security headquarters miles glimpsed one such tree an earth maple with carnelian leaves and a silvergrey trunk across the street then the door closed miles held that tree before his minds eye trying to memorize it just in case he never saw it again the security lieutenant produced passes that sped miles and overholt through the door guards and led them into a maze off corridors to a pair of lift tubes they entered the up tube not t down one so miles was not being taken directly to the ultrasec cell block beneath the building he woke to what this meant wished wistfully for the down tube they were ushered into an office on an upper level past a security captain then into an inner office a man slight bland civilian clothed with brown hair greying at the temples sat at his very large comconsole desk studying a vid he glanced up at miless escort thank you lieutenant sergeant you may go overholt detached miles from his wrist as the lieutenant asked uh will you be safe sir i expect so said the man dryly yeah but what about me miles wailed inwardly the two soldiers exited and left miles alone standing literally on the carpet unwashed unshaven still wearing the faintly reeking black fatigues hed flung ononly last night face weatherraked with his swollen hands and feet still encased in their plastic medical mittenshis toes now wriggled in their squishy matrix no boots he had dozed in a jerky intermittent exhaustion on the twohour shuttle flight without being noticeably refreshed his throat was raw his sinuses felt stuffed with packing fiber and his chest hurt when he breathed simon illyan chief of barrayaran imperial security crossed his arms and looked miles over slowly from head to toe and back again it gave miles a skewed sense of deja vu practically everyone on barraryar feared this mans name though few knew his face this effect was carefully cultivated by illyan building in partbut only in parton the legacy of his formidable predecessor the legendary security chief negri illyan and his department in turn had provided security for miless father for the twenty years of his political career and had slipped up only once during the night of the infamous soltoxin attack offhand miles knew of no one illyan feared except miless mother hed once asked his father if this was guilt about the soltoxin but count vorkosigan had replied no it was only the lasting effect of vivid first impressions miles had called illyan uncle simon all his life until hed entered the service sir after that looking at illyans face now miles thought he finally grasped the distinction between exasperation and utter exasperation illyan finished his inspection shook his head and groaned wonderful just wonderful miles cleared his throat am i really under arrest sir that is what this interview will determine illyan sighed leaning back in his chair i have been up since two hours after midnight over this escapade rumors are flying all over the service as fast as the vid net can carry them the facts appear to be mutating every forty minutes like bacteria i dont suppose you could have picked some more public way to selfdestruct attempted to assassinate the emperor with your pocketknife during the birthday review say or raped a sheep in the great square during rush hour the sarcasm melted to genuine pain he had so much hope of you how could betray him so no need to ask who he was the vorkosigan i dont think i did sir i dont know a light blinked on illyans comconsole he exhaled with a sharp glance at miles and touched a control the second door to his office camouflaged in the wall to the right of his desk slid open and two men in dress greens ducked through prime minister admiral count aral vorkosigan wore the uniform as naturally as an animal wears its fur he was a man of no more than middle height stocky greyhaired heavyjawed scarred almost a thugs body and yet with the most penetrating grey eyes miles had ever encountered he was flanked by his aide a tall blond lieutenant named jole miles had met jole on his last home leave now there was a perfect officer brave and brillianthed served in space been decorated for some courage and quick thinking during a horrendous onboard accident been rotated through hq while recovering from his injuries and promptly been snabbled up as his military secretary by the prime minister who had a sharp eye for hot new talent jawdropping gorgeous to boot he ought to be making recruiting vids miles sighed in hopeless jealousy every time he ran across him jole was even worse than ivan who while darkly handsome had never been accused of brilliance thanks jole count vorkosigan murmured to his aide as his eye found miles ill see you back at the office yes sir so dismissed jole ducked back out glancing back at miles and his superior with worried eyes and the door hissed closed again illyan still had his hand pressed to a control on his desk are you officially here he asked count vorkosigan no illyan keyed something offrecording equipment miles realized very well he said editorial doubt injected into his tone miles saluted his father his father ignored the salute and embraced him gravely wordlessly sat in the rooms only other chair crossed his arms and booted ankles and said continue simon illyan who had been cut off in the middle of what had been shaping up in miless estimation to a really classic reaming chewed his lip in frustration rumors aside illyan said to miles what really happened last night out on that damned island in the most neutral and succinct terms he could muster miles described the previous nights events starting with the fetaine spill and ending with his arrestdetainmenttobedetermined by imperial security his father said nothing during the whole recitation but he had a light pen in his hand which he kept turning absently around and over tap against his knee around and over silence fell when miles finished the light pen was driving miles to distraction he wished his father would put the damned thing away or drop it or anything his father slipped the light pen back into his breast pocket thank god leaned back and steepled his fingers frowning let me get this straight you say metzov hopscotched the command chain and dragooned trainees for his firing squad ten of them i dont know if they were volunteers or not i wasnt there for that part trainees count vorkosigans face was dark boys he was babbling something about it being like the army versus the navy back on old earth huh said illyan i dont think metzov was any too stable when he was exiled to kyril island after his troubles in the komarr revolt and fifteen years of brooding about it didnt improve his grip miles hesitated will general metzov be questioned about his actions at all sir general metzov by your account said admiral vorkosigan dragged a platoon of eighteenyearolds into what came within a hair of being a mass torturemurder miles nodded in memory his body still twinged with assorted agonies for that sin there is no hole deep enough to hide him from my wrath metzov will be taken care of all right count vorkosigan was terrifyingly grim what about miles and the mutineers asked illyan necessarily i fear we will have to treat that as a separate matter or two separate matters said illyan suggestively mm so miles tell me about the men on the other end of the guns techs sir mostly a lot of greekies illyan winced good god had the man no political sense at all none that i ever saw i thought it would be a problem well later hed thought of it lying awake on his cell cot after the med squad left the other political ramifications had spun through his mind over half the slowly freezing techs had been of the greekspeaking minority the language separatists would have been rioting in the streets had it become a massacre sure to claim the general had ordered the greekies into the cleanup as racial sabotage more deaths chaos reverberating down the timeline like the consequences of the solstice massacre it occurred to me that if i died with them at least it would be crystal clear that it hadnt been some plot of your government or the vor oligarchy so that if i lived i won and if i died i won too or at least served strategy of sorts barrayars greatest strategist of this century rubbed his temples as if they ached well of sorts yes so miles swallowed what happens now sirs will i be charged with high treason for the second time in four years said illyan hell no im not going through that again i will simply disappear you until this blows over where to i havent quite figured yet kyril island is out glad to hear it miles eyes narrowed what about the others the trainees said illyan the techs my fellow mutineers illyan twitched at the term it would be seriously unjust if i were to slither up some vorprivileged line and leave them standing charges alone miles added the public scandal of your trial would damage your fathers centrist coalition your moral scruples may be admirable miles but im not sure i can afford them miles stared steadily at prime minister count vorkosigan sir count vorkosigan sucked thoughtfully on his lower lip yes i could have the charges against them quashed by imperial fiat that would involve another price though he leaned forward intently eyes peeling miles you could never serve again rumors will travel even without a trial no commander would have you after none could trust you trust you to be a real officer not an artifact protected by special privilege i cant ask anyone to command you with his head cranked over his shoulder all the time miles exhaled a long breath in a weird sense they were my men do it kill the charges will you resign your commission then demanded illyan miles felt sick nauseous and cold i will his voice was thin illyan looked up suddenly from a blank brooding stare at his com console miles how did you know about general metzovs questionable actions during the komarr revolt that case was securityclassified ah didnt ivan tell you about the little leak in the impsec files sir what damn ivan may i sit down sir said miles faintly the room wavering his head thumping without waiting for permission he sat crosslegged on the carpet blinking his father made a worried movement toward him then restrained himself id been checking upon metzovs background because of something lieutenant ahn said by the way when you go after metzov i strongly suggest you fastpenta ahn first he knows more than hes told youll find him somewhere on the equator i expect my files miles uh yes well it turns out that if you face a secured console to an outgoing console you can read off security files from anywhere in the vid net of course you have to have somebody inside hq who can and will aim the consoles and call up the files for you and you cant flashdownload but i uh thought you should know sir perfect security said count vorkosigan in a choked voice chortling miles realized in startlement illyan looked like a man sucking on a lemon how did you illyan began stopped to glare at the count started again how did you figure this out it was obvious airtight security you said murmured count vorkosigan unsuccessfully suppressing a wheezing laugh the most expensive yet devised proof against the cleverest viruses the most sophisticated eavesdropping equipment and two ensigns waft right through it goaded illyan snapped i didnt promise it was idiotproof count vorkosigan wiped his eyes and sighed ah the human factor we will correct the defect miles thank you youre a bloody loose cannon boy firing in all directions illyan growled to miles craning his neck to see over his desk to where miles sat in a slumping heap this on top of your earlier escapade with those damned mercenaries on top of it allhouse arrest isnt enough i wont sleep through the night till i have you locked in a cell with your hands tied behind your back miles who thought he might kill for a decent hours sleep right now could only shrug maybe illyan could be persuaded to let him go to that nice quiet cell soon count vorkosigan had fallen silent a strange thoughtful glow starting in his eye illyan noticed the expression too and paused simon said count vorkosigan theres no doubt impsec will have to go on watching miles for his sake as well as mine and the emperors put in illyan dourly and barrayars and the innocent bystanders but what better more direct and efficient way for security to watch him than if he is assigned to imperial security what said illyan and miles together in the same sharp horrified tone youre not serious illyan went on as miles added security was never on my topten list of assignment choices not choice aptitude major cecil discussed it with me at one time as i recall but as miles says he didnt put it on his list he hadnt put arctic weatherman on his list either miles recalled you had it right the first time said illyan no commander in the service will want him now not excepting myself not that i could in honor lean on to take him excepting yourself i have always count vorkosigan flashed a peculiar grin leaned on you simon illyan looked faintly stunned as a top tactician beginning to see himself outmaneuvered it works on several levels count vorkosigan went on in that same mild persuasive voice we can put it about that its an unofficial internal exile demotion in disgrace it will buy off my political enemies who would otherwise try to stir profit from this mess it will tone down the appearance of our condoning a mutiny which no military service can afford true exile said miles even if unofficial and internal oh yes count vorkosigan agreed softly but ahnot true disgrace can he be trusted said illyan doubtfully apparently the counts smile was like the gleam off a knife blade security can use his talents security more than any other department needs his talents to see the obvious and the less obvious many officers may be trusted with the emperors life rather fewer with his honor illyan reluctantly made a vague acquiescent gesture count vorkosigan perhaps prudently did not troll for greater enthusiasm from his security chief at this time but turned to miles and said you look like you need an infirmary i need a bed how about a bed in an infirmary miles coughed and blinked blearily yeah thatd do come on well find one he stood and staggered out on his fathers arm his feet squishing in their plastic bags other than that how was kyril island ensign vorkosigan inquired the count you didnt vid home much your mother noticed i was busy lessee the climate was ferocious the terrain was lethal a third of the population including my immediate superior was dead drunk most of the time the average iq equalled the mean temperature in degrees cee there wasnt a woman for five hundred kilometers in any direction and the base commander was a homicidal psychotic other than that it was lovely doesnt sound like its changed in the smallest detail in twentyfive years youve been there miles squinted and yet you let me get sent there i commanded lazkowski base for five months once while waiting for my captaincy of the cruiser general vorkraft during the period my career was so to speak in political eclipse so to speak howd you like it i cant remember much i was drunk most of the time everybody finds their own way of dealing with camp permafrost i might say you did rather better than i i find your subsequent survival encouraging sir i thought you might thats why i mentioned it its not otherwise an experience id hold up as an example miles looked up at his father did i do the right thing sir last night yes said the count simply a right thing perhaps not the best of all possible right things three days from now you may think of a cleverer tactic but you were the man on the ground at the time i try not to secondguess my field commanders miless heart rose in his aching chest for the first time since hed left kyril island miles thought his father might take him to the great and familiar imperial military hospital complex a few kilometers away across town but they found an infirmary closer than that three floors down in impsec hq the facility was small but complete with a couple of examining rooms private rooms cells for treating prisoners and guarded witnesses a surgery and a closed door labeled chillingly interrogation chemistry laboratory illyan must have called down in advance for a corpsman was hovering in attendance waiting to receive them a security surgeon arrived shortly a little out of breath he straighted his uniform and saluted count vorkosigan punctiliously before turning to miles miles fancied the surgeon was more used to making people nervous than being made nervous by them and was awkward about the role reversal was it some aura of old violence clinging to his father still after all these years the power the history some personal charisma that made erstwhile forceful men flatten out like cowed dogs miles could sense that radiating heat perfectly clearly and yet it didnt seem to affect him the same way acclimatization perhaps the former lord regent was the man who used to take a twohour lunch every day regardless of any crisis short of war and disappear into his residence only miles knew the interior view of those hours how the big man in the green uniform would bolt a sandwich in five minutes and then spend the next hour and a half down on the floor with his son who could not walk playing talking reading aloud sometimes when miles was locked in hysterical resistance to some painful new physical therapy daunting his mother and even sergeant bothari his father had been the only one with the firmness to insist on those ten extra agonizing leg stretches the polite submission to the hypospray to another round of surgery to the icy chemicals searing his veins you are vor you must not frighten your liege people with this show of uncontrol lord miles the pungent smell of this infirmary the tense doctor brought back a flood of memories no wonder miles reflected he had failed to be afraid enough of metzov when count vorkosigan left the infirmary seemed altogether empty there did not appear to be much going on in impsec hq this week the infirmary was numbingly quiet except for a trickle of headquarters staff coming down to cadge headache or cold remedies or hangoverkillers from the pliant corpsman a couple of techs spent three hours rattling around the lab one evening on a rush job and rushed off the doctor arrested miless incipient pneumonia just before it turned into galloping pneumonia miles brooded and wait for the sixday antibiotic therapy to run its course and plotted details of a home leave in vorbarr sultana that must surely be forthcoming when the medics released him why cant i go home miles complained to his mother on next visit nobodys telling me anything if im not under arrest why cant i take home leave if i am under arrest why arent doors locked i feel like im in limbo countess cordelia vorkosigan vented an unladylike snort you are in limbo kiddo her flat betan accent fell warmly on miles ears despite her sardonic tone she tossed her headshe wore redroan hair pinned back from her face and waving loose down the back today gleaming against a rich autumn brown jacket picked out with silver embroidery and the swinging skirts of a vorclass woman greyeyed striking her pale face seemed so alive with flickering thought one scarcely noticed she was not beautiful for twentyone years shed passed as a vor matron in the wake of her great man yet still seemed as unimpressed by barrayaran hierarchies as ever though not miles thought unmoved by barrayaran wounds so why do i never think of my ambition as ship command like my motherbefore me captain cordelia naismith betan astronomical survey had been in the risky business of expanding the wormhole nexus jump by blind jump for humanity for pure knowledge for beta colonys economic advancement forwhat had driven her shed commanded a sixtyperson survey vessel far from home and helpthere were certain enviable aspects to her former career to be sure chainofcommand for example would have been a legal fiction out in the farbeyond the wishes of betan hq a matter for speculation and side bets she moved now so wavelessly through barrayaran society only her most intimate observers realized how detached she was from it fearing no one not even the dread illyan controlled by no one not even the admiral himself it was the casual fearlessness miles decided that made his mother so unsettling the admirals captain following in her footsteps would be like firewalking whats going on out there miles asked this place is almost as much fun as solitary confinement yknow have they decided im a mutineer after all i dont think so said the countess theyre discharging the othersyour lieutenant bonn and the restnot precisely dishonorably but without benefits or pensions or that imperial liegeman status that seems to mean so much to barrayaran men think of it as a funny sort of reservist miles advised what about metzov and the grubs hes being discharged the same way he lost the most i think theyre just turning him loose miles frowned countess vorkosigan shrugged because there were no deaths aral was persuaded he couldnt make a court martial with any harsher punishment stick they decided not to involve the trainees with any charges hm im glad i think and ah me you remain officially listed as detained by imperial security indefinitely limbo is supposed to be an indefinite sort of place his hand picked at his sheet his knuckles were still swollen how long however long it takes to have its calculated psychological effect what to drive me crazy another three days ought to do it her lip quirked long enough to convince the barrayaran militarists that you are being properly punished for your uh crime as long as you are confined in this rather sinister building they can be encouraged to imagine you undergoingwhatever they imagine goes on in here if youre allowed to run around town partying it will be much harder to maintain the illusion that youve been hung upside down on the basement wall it all seems so unreal he hunched back into his pillow i only wanted to serve a brief smile flicked her wide mouth up and vanished ready to reconsider another line of work love being vor is more than just a job yes its a pathology obsessional delusion its a big galaxy out there miles there are other ways to serve larger constituencies so why do you stay here he shot back ah she smiled bleakly at the touche some peoples needs are more compelling than guns speaking of dad is he coming back hm no im to tell you hes going to distance himself for a time so as not to give the appearance of endorsing your mutiny while in fact shuffling you out from under the avalanche hes decided to be publicly angry with you and is he of course not yet he was beginning to have some longrange plans for you in his sociopolitical reform schemes based your completing a solid military career he saw ways of making even your congenital injuries serve barrayar yeah i know well dont worry hell doubtless think of some way to use this too miles sighed glumly i want something to do i want my clothes back his mother pursed her lips and shook her head he tried calling ivan that evening where are you ivan demanded suspiciously stuck in limbo well i dont want any of it stuck to me said ivan roughly and punched offline the next morning miles was moved to new quarters his guide led him just one floor down dashing miless hopes of seeing the sky again the officer keyed open a door to one of the secured apartments usually used by protected witnesses and miles reflected certain political nonpersons was it possible life in limbo was having a chameleon effect rendering him translucent how long will i be staying here miles asked the officer i dont know ensign the man replied and left him his duffle jammed with his clothes and a hastilypacked box sat in the middle of the apartments floor all his worldly goods from kyril island smelling moldy a cold breath of arctic damp miles poked through themeverything seemed to be there including his weather libraryand prowled his new quarters it was a oneroom it efficiency shabbily furnished in the style of twenty years back with a few comfortable chairs a bed a simple kitchenette empty cupboards and shelves and closets no abandoned garments or objects or leftovers to hint at the identity of any previous occupant there had to be bugs any shiny surface could conceal a vid pickup and the ears were probably not even within the room but were they switched on or almost more of an insult maybe illyan wasnt even bothering to run them there was a guard in the outer corridor and remote monitors but miles did not appear to have neighbors at present he discovered he could leave the corridor and walk about the few nontopsecured areas of the building but the guards at the outside doors briefed as to who he was turned him back politely but firmly he pictured himself attempting escape by rappelling down from the roofhed probably get himself shot and ruin some poor guards career a security officer found him wandering aimlessly conducted him back to his apartment gave him a handful of chits for the buildings cafeteria and hinted strongly that it would be appreciated if he would stay in his quarters between meals after he left miles morbidly counted the chits trying to guess the expected duration of his stay there were an even hundred miles shuddered he unpacked his box and bag ran everything that would go through the sonic laundry to eliminate the last lingering odor of camp permafrost hung up his uniforms cleaned his boots arranged his possessions neatly on a few shelves showered and changed to fresh undress greens one hour down how many to go he attempted to read but could not concentrate and ended sitting in the most comfortable chair with his eyes closed pretending this windowless hermeticallysealed chamber was a cabin aboard a spaceship outbound he was sitting in the same chair two nights later digesting a leaden cafeteria dinner when the door chimed startled miles clambered up and limped to answer it personally it was probably not a firing squad though you never knew he almost changed his assumptions about the firing squad at the sight of the hardfaced imperial security officers in dress greens who stood waiting excuse me ensign vorkosigan one muttered perfunctorily and brushed past him to start running a scan over miless quarters miles blinked then saw who stood behind them in the corridor and breathed an ah of understanding at a mere look from the scanner man miles obediently held out his arms and turned to be scanned clear sir the scanner man reported and miles was sure it was these fellows never ever cut corners not even in the heart of impsec itself thank you leave us please you may wait out here said the third man the impsec men nodded and took up parade rest flanking miless door since they were both wearing officers undress greens miles exchanged salutes with the third man although the visitors uniform bore neither rank nor department insignia he was thin of middle height with dark hair and intense hazel eyes a crooked smile winked in a serious young face that lacked laugh lines sire miles said formally emperor gregor vorbarra jerked his head and miles keyed his door closed on the security duo the thin young man relaxed slightly hi miles hello yourself uh miles motioned toward the armchairs welcome to my humble abode are the bugs running i asked not but i wouldnt be surprised if illyan disobeys me for my own good gregor grimaced and followed miles he swung a plastic bag from his left hand from which came a muted clank he flung himself into the larger chair the one miles had just vacated leaned back hooked a leg over one chair arm and sighed wearily as if all the air were being let out of him he held out the bag here elegant anesthesia miles took it and peered in two bottles of wine by god already chilled bless you my son ive been wishing i could get drunk for days now how did you guess for that matter how did you get in here i thought i was in solitary confinement miles put the second bottle into the refrigerator found two glasses and blew the dust out of them gregor shrugged they could scarcely keep me out im getting better at insisting you know though illyan made sure my private visit was really private you can wager and i can only stay till gregors shoulders slumped compressed by the minutebyminute box of his schedule besides your mothers religion grants some kind of good karma for visiting the sick and prisoners and i hear youve been the two in one ah so mother had put gregor up to this he should have guessed by the vorkosigan private label on the wineheavens shed sent the good stuff he stopped swinging the bottle by its neck and carried it with greater respect miles was lonely enough by now to be more grateful for than embarrassed by this maternal intervention he opened the wine and poured and by barrayaran etiquette took the first sip ambrosia he slung himself into another chair in a posture similar to gregors glad to see you anyway miles contemplated his old playmate if theyd been even a little closer in age he and gregor they might have fallen more into the role of fosterbrothers count and countess vorkosigan had been gregors official guardians ever since the chaos and bloodshed of vordarians pretendership the childcohort had been thrown together anyway as safe companions miles and ivan and elena nearagemates gregor solemn even then tolerating games a little younger than he might have preferred gregor picked up his wine and sipped sorry things didnt work out for you he said gruffly miles tilted his head a short soldier a short career he took a bigger gulp id hoped to get offplanet ship duty gregor had graduated from the imperial academy two years before miles entered it his brows rose in agreement dont we all you had a year on active space duty miles pointed out mostly in orbit pretend patrols surrounded by security shuttles it got to be painful after a while all the pretending pretending i was an officer pretending i was doing a job instead of making everyone elses job harder just by being there you at least were permitted real risk most of it was unplanned i assure you im increasingly convinced thats the trick of it gregor went on your father mine both our grandfathersall survived real military situations thats how they became real officers not this study his free hand made a downward chopping motion flung into situations miles disagreed my fathers military career officially began the day mad yuris death squad broke in and blew up most of his familyi think he was eleven or something id just as soon pass on that sort of initiation thanks its not something anybody in their right mind would choose mm gregor subsided glumly as oppressed tonight miles guessed by his legendary father prince serg as miles was by his live one count vorkosigan miles reflected briefly on what he had come to think of as the two sergs onemaybe the only version gregor knewwas the dead hero bravely sacrificed on the field of battle or at least cleanly disintegrated in orbit the other the suppressed serg the hysteriac commander and sadistic sodomite whose early death in the illfated escobar invasion might have been the greatest stroke of political good fortune ever to befall barrayar had even a hint of this multifaceted personality ever been permitted to filter back to gregor nobody who knew serg talked about him count vorkosigan least of all miles had once met one of sergs victims miles hoped gregor never would miles decided to change the subject so we all know what happened to me what have you been up to for the last three months i was sorry to miss your last birthday party up at kyril island they celebrated it by getting drunk which made it virtually indistinguishable from any other day gregor grinned then sighed too many ceremonies too much time standing upi think i could be replaced at half my functions by a lifesized plastic model and no one would notice a lot of time spent ducking the broad marital hints of my assorted counsellors actually they have a point miles had to allow if you got run over by a teacart tomorrow the succession question goes up for grabs in a big way i can think offhand of at least six candidates with arguable stakes in the imperium and more would come out of the woodwork some without personal ambition would nevertheless kill to see that some of the others didnt get it which is precisely why you still dont have a named heir gregor cocked his head youre in that crowd yourself you know with this body miles snorted theyd have to really hate somebody to tag me at that point it really would be time to run away from home far and fast do me a favor get married settle down and have six little vorbarras real quick gregor looked even more depressed now theres an idea running away from home i wonder how far id get before illyan caught up with me they both glanced involuntarily upward though in fact miles was still not certain where the rooms bugs were located better hope illyan caught up with you before anybody else did god this conversation was getting morbid i dont know wasnt there an emperor of china who ended up pushing a broom somewhere and a thousand lesser emigreescountesses running restaurantsescape is possible from being vor more like trying to run away from your own shadow there would be moments in the dark when success would seem achieved but thenmiles shook his head and checked out the stilllumpy bag ah you brought a tactigo set he didnt foil the least want to play tactigo it had bored him by age fourteen but anything was better than this he pulled it out and set it up between them with determined good cheer brings back old times hideous thought gregor bestirred himself and made an opening move pretending to be interested to amuse miles who was simulating interest to cheer gregor who was feigning miles distracted beat gregor too fast on the first round and began to pay more attention on the next round he kept it closer and was rewarded by a spark of genuine interestblessed selfforgetfulnesson gregors part they opened the second bottle of wine at that point miles began to feel the effects going tonguethick and sleepy and stupid it took hardly any effort to let gregor almost win the next round i dont think ive beaten you at this since you were fourteen sighed gregor concealing secret satisfaction at the low pointspread of that last round you should be an officer dammit this isnt a good war game dad says commented miles not enough random factors and uncontrolled surprises to simulate reality i like it that way it was almost soothing a mindless routine of logic check and counter multiple chained moves with always perfectly objective options you should know gregor glanced up i still dont understand why they sent you to kyril island youve already commanded a real space fleet even if they were only a pack of grubby mercenaries shh that episode is officially nonexistent in my military files fortunately it wouldnt charm my superiors id commanded i hadnt obeyed anyway i didnt so much command the dendarii mercenaries as hypnotize em without captain tung who decided to prop up my pretensions for his own purposes it would have all ended very unpleasantly and much sooner i always thought illyan would do more with them after said gregor however inadvertently you brought a whole military organization secretly into the service of barrayar yes without them even knowing it themselves now thats secret come on assigning them to illyans section was a legal fiction everybody knew it and would his own assignment to illyans section turn out to be a legal fiction too illyans too careful to get drawn into intergalactic military adventuring as a hobby im afraid his main interest in the dendarii mercenaries is to keep them as far away from barrayar as possible mercenaries thrive on other peoples chaos plus theyre a funny sizeless than a dozen ships three or four thousand personnelnot your basic invisible sixman covert ops team though they can field such and yet theyre too little to take on planetary situations spacebased not ground troops wormhole blockades were their specialty safe easy on the equipment mostly bullying unarmed civilianswhich is how i first ran into them when our freighter was stopped by their blockade and the bullying went too far i cringe to think of the risks i ran though ive often wondered if knowing what i know now i could have miles stopped shook his head or maybe its like heights better not to look down you freeze and then you fall miles was not fond of heights as a military experience how did it compare with lazkowski base asked gregor bemusedly oh there were certain parallels miles admitted both were jobs i wasnt trained for both were potentially lethal i got out of both by my skinlost some skin the dendarii episode was worse i lost sergeant bothari in a sense i lost elena at least at camp permafrost i managed not to lose anyone maybe youre getting better gregor suggested miles shook his head and drank he should have put on some music the thick silence of this room was oppressive when the conversation faltered the ceiling was probably not hydraulically arranged to descend and crush him in his sleep security had far less messy ways of dealing with recalcitrant prisoners it only seemed to lower at him well im short maybe itd miss me i suppose it would be improper miles began hesitantly to ask you to try and get me out of here its always seemed rather embarrassing to ask for imperial favors like cheating or something what are you asking one prisoner of impsec to rescue another gregors hazel eyes were ironic under black brows its a little embarrassing to me to come up against the limits of my absolute imperial rule your father and illyan like two parentheses around me his cupped hands closed in a squeezing motion it was a subliminal effect of this room miles decided gregor was feeling it too i would if i could gregor added more apologetically but illyans made it crystal clear he wants you kept out of sight for a time anyway time miles swallowed the last of his wine and decided he better not pour himself any more alcohol was a depressant it was said how much time dammit if i dont get something to do im going to be the first case of human spontaneous combustion recorded on vid he jerked a rude finger at the ceiling i dont need todont even have to leave the building but at least they could give me some work clerical janitoriali do terrific drainsanything dad talked with illyan about assigning me to securityas the only section left that would take mehe must have had something more in mind than a m m mascot he poured and drank again to drown the spate of words hed said too much damn the wine damn the whine gregor who had built a little tower of tactigo chips toppled it with one finger oh being a mascot isnt bad work if you can get it he stirred the pile slowly ill see what i can do no promises miles didnt know if it was the emperor the bugs or wheels already in motion grinding slowly but two days afterwards he found himself assigned to the job of administrative assistant to the guard commander for the building it was comconsole work scheduling payroll updating computer files the job was interesting for a week while he was learning it mindnumbing after that by the end of a month the boredom and banality were beginning to prey on his nerves was he loyal or merely stupid guards miles now realized had to stay in prison all day long too indeed as a guard one of his jobs was now to keep himself in damn clever of illyan nobody else could have held him if hed been determined on escape he did find a window once and looked out it was sleeting was he going to get out of this bloody box before winterfair how long did it take the world to forget him anyway if he committed suicide could he be officially listed as shot by a guard while escaping was illyan trying to drive him out of his mind or just out of his section another month slipped by as a spiritual exercise he decided to fill his offduty hours by watching every training vid in the military library in strict alphabetical order the assortment was truly astonishing he was particularly bemused by the thirtyminute vid under h hygiene explaining how to take a showerwell yes there probably were backcountry recruits who really needed the instruction after some weeks he had worked his way down to l laserrifle model d powerpack circuitry maintenance and repair when he was interrupted by a call ordering him to report to illyans office illyans office was almost unchanged from miless last excruciating visitsame spartan windowless inner chamber occupied mainly by a comconsole desk that looked like it could be used to pilot a jump shipbut now there were two chairs one was promisingly empty maybe miles wouldnt end up so literally on the carpet this round the other was occupied by a man in undress greens with captains tabs and the horuseye insignia of imperial security on the collar interesting fellow that captain miles summed him out of the corner of his eye as he exchanged formal salutes with illyan maybe thirtyfive years old he had something of illyans unmemorable bland look about the face but was more heavily built pale he might easily pass for some minor bureaucrat a sedentary indoorsman but that particular look could also be acquired by spending a great deal of time cooped up on spaceships ensign vorkosigan this is captain ungari captain ungari is one of my galactic operatives he has ten years experience gathering information for this department his specialty is military evaluation ungari favored miles with a polite nod by way of acknowledging the introduction his level gaze summed miles right back miles wondered what the spys evaluation of the dwarfish soldier standing before him might be and tried to stand straighter there was nothing obvious about ungaris reaction to miles illyan leaned back in his swivel chair so tell me ensign what have you heard lately from the dendarii mercenaries sir miles rocked back not the curve he was expecting i lately nothing i had a message about a year ago from elena botharibotharijesek that is but it was only private uh birthday greetings that one i have illyan noddeddo you you bastard nothing since no sir hm illyan waved a hand at the spare chair sit down miles his voice grew quicker and more businesslike meat at last lets go over a little astrography geography is the mother of strategy they say illyan fiddled with a control on his comconsole a wormhole nexus route map formed in three bright dimensions over the holovid plate it looked rather like a ballandstick model of some weird organic molecule done in colored light balls representing localspace crossings sticks the wormholespace jumps between them schematic compressing information rather than to scale illyan zoomed in on a portion red and blue sparks in the center of an otherwise empty ball with four sticks leading out at crazy angles to more complex balls like some skewed celtic cross look familiar that in the center is the hegen hub isnt it sir good illyan handed him his controller give me a strategic summation of the hegan hub ensign miles cleared his throat its a double star system with no habitable planets a few stations and powersats and very little reason to linger in like many nexus connections its more route than place taking its value by whats around it in this case four adjoining regions of local space with settled planets miles brightened each part of the image as he spoke for emphasis aslund aslund is a culdesac like barrayar the hegen hub is its sole gate to the greater galactic web the hegen hub is as vital to aslund as our gateway komarr is to us jacksons whole the hegen hub is just one of five gates from jacksonian local space beyond jacksons whole lies half the explored galaxy vervain vervain has two exits one to the hub the other into the nexus sectors controlled by the cetagandan empire and fourth of course our ah good neighbor the planet and republic of pol which in turn connects to our own multinexus komarr also from komarr is our one straight jump to the cetagandan sector which route has been either tightly controlled or outright barred to cetagandan traffic ever since we conquered it miles glanced at illyan for approval hoping he was on the right track illyan glanced at ungari who allowed his brows to rise fractionally meaning what wormhole strategy the devils cats cradle illyan muttered editorially he squinted at his glowing schematic four players one gameboard it ought to be simple anyway illyan stretched out his hand for the controller and sat back with a sigh the hegen hub is more than a potential chokepoint for the four adjoining systems twentyfive percent of our own commercial traffic passes through it via pol and although vervain is closed to cetagandan military vessels just as pol is closed to ours the cetas ship significant civilian exchange through the same slot and out past jacksons whole anythinglike a warthat blocks the hegen hub would seem almost as damaging to cetaganda as to us and yet after years of cooperative disinterest and dull neutrality this empty region is suddenly alive with what i can only call an arms race all four neighbors seem to be creating military interests pol has been beefing up the armament on all six of its jump point stations strung toward the hubeven pulling forces from the side toward us which i find a little startling since pol has been extremely wary of us ever since we took komarr the jacksons whole consortium is doing the same on its side vervain has hired a mercenary fleet called randalls rangers all this activity is causing lowgrade panic on aslund whose interest in the hegen hub is for obvious reasons most critical theyre throwing half this years military budget into a major jumppoint stationhell a floating fortressand to cover the gap while they prepare they too have hired guns you may be familiar with them they used to be called the dendarii free mercenary fleet illyan paused and raised an eyebrow watching for miless reaction connections at lastor were there miles blew out his breath they were blockade specialists at one time makes sense i guess ah used to be called the dendarii have they changed lately theyve recently reverted to their original title of oseran mercenaries it seems strange why why indeed illyans lips compressed one of many questions though hardly the most urgent but its the cetagandan connection or lack of itthat bothers me general chaos in the region would be as damaging to cetaganda as to us but if after the chaos passes cetaganda could somehow end up in control of the hegen hubahl then they could block or control barrayaran traffic as we do theirs through komarr indeed if you look at the other side of the komarrcetaganda jump as being under their control that would put them across two out of our four major galactic routes something labyrinthine indirectit smells of cetagandas methods or would if i could spot their sticky hands pulling any of the strings they must be there even if i cant see them yet brooding illyan shook his head if the jacksons whole jump were cut everyone would have to reroute through the cetagandan empire profit there or through us miles pointed out why should cetaganda do us that favor i have thought of one possibility actually ive thought of several but this ones for you miles whats the best way to capture a jump point from both ends at once miles recited automatically which is one reason pol has been careful never to let us amass a military presence in the hegen hub but let us suppose someone on pol stumbles across that nasty rumor i had so much trouble scotching that the dendarii mercenaries are the private army of a certain barrayaran vor lordling what will they think theyll think were getting ready to jump them said miles they might go paranoidpaniceven seek a temporary alliance with say cetaganda very good nodded illyan captain ungari who had been listening with the attentive patience of a man whod been over it all before glanced at miles as though faintly encouraged and approved this hypothesis with a nod of his head but even if perceived as an independent force illyan went on the dendarii are one more destabilizing influence in the region the whole situation is disturbinggrowing tenser by the day for no apparent reason only a little more forceone mistake one lethal incidentcould trigger turbulence classic chaos the real thing unstoppable reasons miles i want information illyan generally wanted information with the same passion that a strungout juba freak craved a spike he turned now to ungari so what do you think captain will he do ungari was slow to reply hes more physically conspicuous than id realized as camouflage thats not necessarily a disadvantage in his company you ought to be nearly invisible the stalking goat and the hunter perhaps but can he carry the load im not going to have much time for babysitting ungaris voice was an urban baritone evidently one of the modern educated officers though he did not wear an academy pin the admiral seems to think so am i to argue ungari glanced at miles are you sure the admirals judgment is not swayed by personal hopes you mean wishful thinking miles mentally translated that delicate hesitancy if so its for the first time illyan shrugged and theres a first time for everything hung unspoken in the air illyan turned now to pin miles with a gaze of grim intensity miles do you think you wouldif requiredbe capable of playing the part of admiral naismith again for a short time hed seen it coming but the words spoken out loud were still a strange cold thrill to activate that suppressed persona again it wasnt just a part illyan i could play naismith again sure its stopping playing naismith that scares me illyan allowed himself a wintry smile taking this for a joke miless smile was a little sicker you dont know you dont know what it was like three parts fakery and flimflam and one part something else zen gestalt delusion uncontrollable moments of alphastate exaltation could he do it again maybe he knew too much now first you freeze and then you fall perhaps it would only be playacting this time illyan leaned back held up his hands palm to palm and let them fell in a releasing gesture very well captain ungari hes all yours use him as you see fit your mission then is to gather information on the current crisis in the hegen hub secondly if possible to use ensign vorkosigan to remove the dendarii mercenaries from the stage if you decide to use a bogus contract to pull them out of the hub you can draw on the covert ops account for a convincing downpayment you know the results i want im sorry i cant make my orders more specific in advance of the intelligence you yourself must obtain i dont mind sir said ungari smiling slightly hm enjoy your independence while it lasts it ends with your first mistake illyans tone was sardonic but his eyes were confident until he turned them toward miles miles youll be traveling as admiral naismith himself traveling incognito returning possibly to the dendarii fleet should captain ungari decide for you to activate the naismith role hell pose as your bodyguard so as to be always in position to control the situation its a little too much to ask ungari to be responsible for his mission and also your safety so youll also have a real bodyguard this setup will give captain ungari unusual freedom of movement because it will account for your possession of a personal shipwe have a jump pilot and a fast courier we obtained fromnever mind where but it has no connection with barrayar its under jacksonian registration at present which fits in nicely with admiral naismiths mysterious background its so obviously bogus no one will look for a second layer of er bogusity illyan paused you will of course obey captain ungaris orders that goes without saying illyans direct stare was chilly as a kyrfli island midnight miles smiled dutifully to show he took the hint ill be good sir let me off planet from ghost to goatwas this a promotion victor rotha procurement agent sounded like a pimp dubiously miles regarded his new persona twinned over the vid plate in his cabin what was wrong with a simple spartan mirror anyway where had illyan gotten this ship of betan manufacture it was stuffed with betan gimmickry of a luxurious order miles entertained himself with a gruesome vision of what could happen if the programming on the elaborate sonic toothcleaner ever went awry rotha was vaguely dressed with respect to his supposed pointoforigin miles had drawn the line at a betan sarong pol station six was not nearly warm enough for it he did wear his loose green trousers held up with a betan sarong rope though and betan style sandals the green shirt was a cheap synthetic silk from escobar the baggy cream jacket an expensive one of like style the eclectic wardrobe of someone originally from beta colony whod been knocking around the galaxy for a while sometimes up sometimes down good he muttered to himself aloud warming up his disused betan accent he pottered about the elaborate owners cabin they had docked here at pol six a day ago without incident the whole threeweek trip from barrayar had passed without incident ungari seemed to like it that way the impsec captain had spent most of the journey counting things taking pictures and counting ships troops security guards both civil and military theyd managed excuses to stop over at four of the six jump point stations on the route between pol and the hegen hub with ungari counting measuring sectioning computerstuffing and calculating the whole way now they had arrived at pols last or first depending on your direction of travel outpost its toehold in the hegen hub itself at one time pol six had merely marked the jump point no more than an emergency stop and communications transfer link no one had yet solved the problem of getting messages through a wormhole jump except by physically transporting them on a jump ship in the most developed regions of the nexus comm ships jumped hourly or even more often to emit a tightbeam burst that traveled at the speed of light to the next jump point in that region of local space where messages were picked up and relayed out in turn the fastest possible flow of information in the less developed regions one simply had to wait sometimes for weeks or months for a ship to happen by and hope theyd remember to drop off your mail j now pol six didnt just mark it frankly guarded ungari had clicked his tongue in excitement identifying and adding up pol navy ships clustered in the area around the new construction theyd managed a spiral flight path into dock that revealed every side of the station and all ships both moored and moving your main job here ungari had told miles will be to giving anyone watching us something more interesting to watch than me circulate i doubt youll need to expend any special effort to conspicuous develop your cover identitywith luck you may even pick up a contact or two wholl be worthy of further study though doubt youll run across anything of great value immediately it doesnt work that way now miles laid his samples case open on his bed and rechecked them just a traveling salesman thats me a dozen hand weapons power packs removed gleamed wickedly back at him a row of vids described larger and more interesting weapons systems an more interestingyou might even say arrestingcollection of tiny disks nestled concealed in miless jacket death i can get it for you wholesale miless bodyguard met him at the docking hatch why oh why had illyan assigned sergeant overkill to this mission same reason hed sent him to kyril island because he was trusted no doubt but it embarrassed miles to be working with a man whod once arrested him what did overholt make of miles by now happily the big man was the silent type overholt was dressed as informally and eclectically as miles himself though with safety boots in place of sandals he looked exactly like somebodys bodyguard trying to look like a tourist much the sort of man smalltime arms dealer victor rotha would logically employ both functional and decorative he slices dices and chops by themselves either miles or overholt would be memorable together well ungari was right they neednt worry about being overlooked miles led the way through that docking tube and into pol six this docking spoke funneled into a customs area where miless sample case and person were carefully examined and overholt had to produce registration for his stunner from there they had free run of the transfer station facilities but for certain guarded corridors leading into the as it were militarized zones those areas ungari had made clear were his business not miless miles in good time for his first appointment strolled slowly enjoying the sensation of being on a space station the place wasnt as freewheeling as beta colony but without question he moved in the midst of mainstream galactic technoculture not like poor halfbackwards barrayar the brittle artificial environment emitted its own whiff of danger a whiff that could balloon instantly into claustrophobic terror in the event of a sudden depressurization emergency a concourse lined with shops hostels and eating facilities made a central meeting area a curious trio idled just across the busy concourse from miles a big man dressed in loose clothing ideal for concealing weapons scanned the area uneasily a professional counterpart of sergeant overkills no doubt he and overholt spotted each other and exchanged grim glances carefully ignored each other after that the bland man he guarded faded into nearinvisibility beside his woman she was short but astonishingly intense slight figure and whiteblonde hair cropped close to her head giving her an odd elfin look her black jumpsuit seemed shot with electric sparks flowing over her skin like water eveningwear in the daycycle thinheeled black shoes boosted her a few futile centimeters her lips were colored woodcarmine to match the shimmering scarf that looped across alabaster collarbones to cascade from each shoulder framing the bare white skin of her back she looked expensive her eye caught miless fascinated stare her chin lifted and she stared back coldly victor rotha the voice at miless elbow made him jump ah mr liga miles wheeling hazarded in return rabbitlike pale features protruding lip black hair this was the man who claimed he wished to improve the armament of his security guards at his asteroid mining facility sure howand wherehad ungari scraped liga up miles was not sure he wanted to know ive arranged a private room for us to talk liga smiled tilting his head toward a nearby hostel entrance eh liga added looks like everybodys doing business this morning he nodded toward the trio across the concourse who were now a quartet and moving off the scarves snapped along like banners floating in the quickstepping blondes wake who was that woman asked miles i dont know said liga but the man theyre following is your main competition here the agent of house fell the jacksonian armaments specialists he looked more like a middleaged businessman type at least from the back pol lets the jacksonians operate here miles asked i thought tensions were high between pol aslund and vervain yes said liga the jacksonian consortium is loudly claiming neutrality they hope to profit from all sides but this isnt the best place to talk politics lets go eh as miles expected liga settled them in what was obviously otherwiseunoccupied hostel room rented for the purpose miles began his memorized pitch working through the handweapons bafflegabbing about available inventory and delivery dates id hoped said liga for something a little more authoritative i have another selection of samples aboard my ship miles explained i didnt want to trouble pol customs with them but i can give you an overview by vid miles trotted out the heavy weapons manuals this vid is educational purposes only of course as these weapons are of a grade illegal for a private person to own in pol local space in pol space yes liga agreed but pols law doesnt run in hegen hub yet all you have to do is cast off from pol six and take little run out beyond the tenthousandkilometer traffic control to conduct any sort of business you want perfectly legally the problem comes in delivering the cargo back in to pol local space difficult deliveries are one of my specialties miles assured him for a small surcharge of course eh good liga flicked fastforward through the vidilogue these heavyduty plasma arcs now how do they compare with the cannongrade nerve disruptors miles shrugged depends entirely upon whether you want to blow away people alone or people and property both i can make you a very good price on the nerve disruptors he named a figure in pol credits i got a better quote than that on a device of the same kilowattage lately liga mentioned disinterestedly ill bet you did miles grinned poison one credit antidote one hundred credits whats that supposed to mean eh asked liga suspiciously miles unrolled his lapel and ran his thumb down the underside and pulled out a tiny vid tab take a look at this he inserted it into the vid viewer a figure sprang to life and pirouetted it was dressed from head to toe and fingertips in what appeared to be glittering skintight netting a bit drafty for long underwear eh said liga sceptically miles flashed him a pained smile what youre looking at is what every armed force in the galaxy would like to get their hands on the perfected singleperson nerve disrupter shield net beta colonys latest technological card ligas eyes widened first id heard they were on the market the open market no these are as it were private advance sales beta colony only advertised its second or third latest advantages staying several steps ahead of everybody else in rd had been the harsh worlds stockintrade for a couple of generations in time beta colony would be marketing its new device galaxywide in the meantime liga licked his pouty lower lip we use nerve disruptors a lot for security guards right sure i have a limited supply of shield nets first come first served the price miles named a figure in betan dollars outrageous liga rocked back in his float chair miles shrugged think about it it could put your organization at a considerable disadvantage not to be the first to upgrade its defenses im sure you can imagine ill have to check it out eh can i have that disk to show my eh supervisor miles pursed his lips dont get caught with it no way liga spun the demo vid through its paces one more time staring in fascination at the sparkling soldierfigure before pocketing the disk there the hook was baited and cast upon dark waters it was going to be very interesting to see what nibbled whether minnows or monstrous leviathans liga was a fish of the ramora underclass miles judged well he had to start somewhere back out on the concourse miles muttered worriedly to overholt did i do all right very smooth sir overholt reassured him well maybe it had felt good running by plan he could almost feel himself submerging into the smarmy personality of victor rotha for lunch miles led overholt to a cafeteria with seating open to the concourse the better for anyone notwatching ungari to observe them he munched a sandwich of vatproduced protein and let his tight nerves unwind a little this act could be all right not nearly as overstimulating as admiral naismith miles nearly choked on a halfchewed bite his head swivelling frantically to identify the source of the surprised voice overholt jerked to fullalert though he managed to keep his hand from flying prematurely to his concealed stunner two men had paused beside his table one miles did not recognize the other damn he knew that face squarejawed brownskinned too neat and fit for his age to pass as anything but a soldier despite his polian civilian clothes the name the name one of tungs commandos a combatdropshuttle squad commander the last time miles had seen him theyd been suiting up together in the triumph s armory preparing for a boarding battle clive chodak that was his name im sorry youre mistaken miless denial was pure spinal reflex my name is victor rotha chodak blinked what oh sorry that isyou look a lot like somebody i used to know he took in overholt his eyes queried miles urgently uh can we join you no said miles sharply panicked no wait he shouldnt throw away a possible contact this was a complication for which he shouldhave been prepared but to activate naismith prematurely without ungaris orders anyway not here he amended hastily i see sir with a short nod chodak immediately withdrew drawing his reluctant companion with him he managed to glance back over his shoulder only once miles restrained the impulse to bite his napkin in half the two men faded into the concourse by their urgent gestures they appeared to be arguing was that smooth miles asked plaintively overholt looked mildly dismayed not very he frowned down the concourse in the direction the two men had disappeared it didnt take chodak more than an hour to track miles down aboard his betan ship in dock ungari was still out he says he wants to talk to you said overholt he and miles studied the vid monitor of the hatchway where chodak shifted impatiently from foot to foot what do you think he really wants probably to talk to me said miles damn me if i dont want to talk to him too how well did you know him asked overholt suspiciously staring at chodaks image not well miles admitted he seemed a competent noncom knew his equipment kept his people moving stood his ground under fire in truth thinking back miless actual contacts with the man had been brief all in the course of business but some of those minutes had been critical in the wild uncertainty of shipboard combat was miless gutfeel really adequate security clearance for a man he hadnt seen for almost four years scan him sure but lets let him in and see what he has to say if you so order it sir said overholt neutrally i do chodak did not seem to resent being scanned he carried only a registered stunner though he had also been an expert at handtohand combat miles recalled a weapon no one could confiscate overholt escorted him to the small ships wardroommessthe betans would have called it the rec room mr rotha chodak nodded i uh hoped we could talk here privately he looked doubtfully at overholt or have you replaced sergeant bothari never miles motioned overholt to follow him into the corridor didnt speak till the doors sighed shut i think you are an inhibiting presence sergeant would you mind waiting outside miles didnt specify whom overholt inhibited you can monitor of course bad idea overholt frowned suppose he jumps you miless fingers tapped nervously on his trouser seam its a possibility but were heading for aslund next where the dendarii are stationed ungari says he may bear useful information if he tells the truth even lies can be revealing with this doubtful argument miles squeezed back into the wardroom shedding overholt he nodded to his visitor now seated at a table corporal chodak chodak brightened you do remember oh yes and ah are you still with the dendarii yes sir its sergeant chodak now very good im not surprised and um the oseran mercenaries so i understand whether its good or not remains to be seen what are you posing as sir victor rotha is an arms dealer thats a good cover chodak nodded judiciously miles tried to put a casual mask on his next words by punching up two coffees so what are you doing on pol six i thought the den the fleet was hired out on aslund at aslund station here in the hub chodak corrected its just a couple days flight acrosssystem what there is of it so far government contractors he shook his head behind schedule and over cost you got it he accepted the coffee without hesitation holding it between lean hands and took a preliminary slurp i cant stay long he turned the cup set it on the table sir i think i may have accidentally done you a bad turn i was so startled to see you there anyway i wanted to to warn you i guess are you on the way back to the fleet im afraid i cant discuss my plans not even with you chodak gave him a penetrating stare from black almond eyes you always were tricky as an experienced combat soldier do you prefer frontal assaults no sir chodak smiled slightly suppose you tell me i take it you areor are oneof the fleet intelligence agents scattered around the hub there had better be more than one of you or the organizations fallen apart sadly in my absence in fact half the inhabitants of pol six at the moment were probably spies of some stripe considering the number of potential players in this game not to mention double agentsought they to be counted twice why have you been gone so long sir chodaks tone was almost accusative it wasnt my intention miles temporized for a portion of time i was a prisoner in a place id rather not describe i escaped about three months back well that was one way of describing kyril island you sir we could have rescued no you couldnt have miles said sharply the situation was one of extreme delicacy it was resolved to my satisfaction but i was then faced with considerable cleanup in areas of my operations other than the dendarii fleet farflung areas sorry but you people are not my only concern nevertheless im worried i should have heard more from commodore jesek indeed he should have commodore jesek no longer commands there was a financial reorganization and command restructuring about a year ago through the committee of captainowners and admiral oser spearheaded by admiral oser where is jesek he was demoted to fleet engineer disturbing but miles could see it not necessarily a bad thing jesek was never as aggressive as say tung and tung chodak shook his head he was demoted from chiefofstaff to personnel officer a nothingjob that seems wasteful oser doesnt trust tung and tung doesnt love oser either osers been trying to force him out for a year but he hangs on despite the humiliation of um its not easy to get rid of him oser cant affordyetto decimate his staff and too may key people are personally loyal to tung miless eyebrow rose including yourself chodak said distantly he got things done i considered him a superior officer so did i chodak nodded shortly sir the thing is the man who was with me in the cafeteria is my senior here and hes one of osers i cant think of any way short of killing him to stop him reporting our encounter i have no desire to start a civil war in my own command structure said miles mildly yet i think its more important that he not suspect you spoke to me privately let him report ive struck deals with admiral oser before to our mutual benefit im not sure oser thinks so sir i think he thinks he was screwed miles barked a realistic laugh what i doubled the size of the fleet during the tau verde war even as third officer he ended up commanding more than he had before a smaller slice of a bigger pie but the side he originally contracted us to lost not so both sides gained from that truce we forced it was a winwin result except for a little lost face what cant oser feel hes won unless somebody else loses chodak looked grim i think that may be the case sir he saysive heard him sayyou ran a scam on us you were never an admiral never an officer of any kind if tung hadnt doublecrossed him hed have kicked your ass to hell chodaks gaze on miles was broodingly thoughtful what were you really miles smiled gently i was the winner remember chodak snorted halfamused yeeah dont let poor osers revisionist history fog your mind you were there chodak shook his head ruefully you didnt really need my warning did you he moved to stand up never assume anything and ah take care of yourself that means cover your ass ill remember you later sir chodak nodded overholt waiting in the corridor in a quasi imperial guardsman pose escorted him firmly to the shuttle hatch miles sat in the wardroom and nibbled gently on the rim of his coffee cup considering certain surprising parallels between command restructuring in a free mercenary fleet and the internecine wars of the barrayaran vor might the mercenaries be thought of as a miniature simplified or laboratory version of the real thing oser should have been around during the vordarians pretendership and seen how the big boys operate still miles had best not underestimate the potential dangers and complexities of the situation his death in a miniature conflict would be just as absolute as his death in a large one hell what death what had he to do with the dendarii or the oserans after all oser was right it had been a scam and the only wonder was how long it had taken the man to wake to the fact miles could see no immediate need to reinvolve himself with the dendarii at all in fact he could be wellrid of a dangerous political embarrasment let oser have them theyd been his in the first place anyway i have three sworn liegepeople in that fleet my own personal politic how easy it had been to slip back into being naismith anyway activating naismith wasnt miles decision it was captain ungaris ungari was the first to point this out when he returned later overholt briefed him a controlled man his fury showed by subtle signs a sharpening of the voice deeper lines of tension around eyes and mouth you violated your cover you never break cover its the first rule of survival in this business sir may i respectfully submit i didnt blow it miles replied steadily chodak did he seemed to realize it too hes not stupid he apologized as best he could chodak indeed might be subtler than first glance would indicate for at this point he had an in with both sides in the putative dendarii command schism whoever came out on top calculation or chance chodak was either smart or lucky in either case he could be a useful addition to miless side what side huh ungari isnt going to let me near the dendarii after this ungari frowned at the vidplate which had just replayed the recording of miless interview with the mercenary it sounds more and more like the naismith cover may be too dangerous to activate at all if your osers little palace coup is anything like what this fellow indicates illyans fantasy of you simply ordering the dendarii to get lost is straight out the airlock i thought it sounded too easy ungari paced the wardroom tapping his right fist into his left palm well we may still get some use out of victor rotha much as id like to confine you to quarters strange how many of his superiors said that liga wants to see rotha again this evening maybe to place an order for some of our fictitious cargo string it outi want you to get past him to the next level of his organization his boss or his bosss boss who owns liga do you suspect ungari stopped pacing and turned his hands palmout the cetagandans jacksons whole any one of halfadozen others impsec is spread thin out here but if it were proved ligas criminal organization are cetagandan puppets it could be worth sending a fulltime agent to penetrate their ranks so find out hint at more goodies in your bag take bribes blend in and move it along im almost finished here and illyan particularly wants to know when aslund station will be fully operational as a defensive base miles punched the door chime of the hostel room his chin ticd up he cleared his throat and straightened his shoulders overholt glanced up and down the empty corridor the door hissed open miles blinked in astonishment ah mr rotha the light cool voice belonged to the brief blonde hed seen in the concourse that morning her jumpsuit was now skinfitting red silk with a downcurving neckline a glittering red ruff rising from the back of the neck to frame her sculptured head and highheeled red suede boots she favored him with a highvoltage smile im sorry said miles automatically i must be in the wrong place not at all a slim hand opened in an expansive welcoming gesture youre right on time i had an appointment with a mr liga here yes and ive taken over the appointment do come in my name is livia nu well she couldnt possibly be carrying any concealed weapons miles stepped within and was unsurprised to see her bodyguard idling in one corner of the hostel room the man nodded to overholt who nodded back both wary as two cats and where was the third man not here evidently she drifted to a liquidfilled settee and arranged herself upon it are you uh mr ligas supervisor miles asked no liga had denied knowing who she was she hesitated fractionally in a sense yes one of them was lyingno not necessarily if she were indeed high in ligas organization he would not have identified her to rotha damn but you may think of me as a procurement agent god pol six really was hipdeep in spies for whom ah she smiled one of the advantages of dealing with small suppliers is always their noquestionsasked policy one of the few advantages noquestionsasked is house fells slogan i believe they have the advantage of a fixed and secure base ive learned to be cautious about selling arms to people who might be shooting at me in the near future her blue eyes widened who would want to shoot at you misguided folk miles tossed off ye gods he was not in control of this conversation he exchanged a harried look with overholt who was being outblanded by his counterpart we must chat she patted the cushion beside her invitingly do sit down victor ah she nodded to her bodyguard why dont you wait outside miles seated himself on the edge of the settee trying to guess womans age her complexion was smooth and white only the skin of her eyelids was soft and faintly puckered miles thought of ungaris orderstake bribes blend in perhaps you should wait outsio also he said to overholt overholt looked torn but of the two he clearly wanted more to keep an eye on the large armed man he nodded apparently in acquiescence actually in approval and followed her man out miles smiled in what he hoped was a friendly way she looked positively seductive miles eased cautiously back in the cushions and tried to look seduceable a veritable espionage fantasy encounter of the sort ungari had told him never happened maybe they just never happened to ungari eh my what sharp teeth you have miss her hand went to her cleavagea riveting gestureand withdrew a tiny familiar vid disk she leaned over to insert it in the vid player on the low table before them and it took miles a moment to shift his attention to the vid the little glittering soldierfigure went through its stylized gestures once again ha so she really was ligas supervisor very good he was getting somewhere now this is really remarkable victor how did you come by it a happy accident how many can you supply a strictly limited number say fifty im not a manufacturer liga did mention the price i thought it high if you can find another supplier who offers these for less i will be happy to match his price and knock off ten percent miles managed to bow sitting down she made a faint amused sound down in her throat the volume offered is too low there are several ways you could profit from even a small number of these if you got into the trade early enough such as selling working models to interested governments i mean to have a share of that profit before the market is saturated and the price drops you could too why dont you sell them directly to governments that is what makes you think i havent miles smiled butconsider my routes out of this area i came in past barrayar and pol i must exit via either jacksons whole or the cetagandan empire unfortunately through either route i run a high risk of being relieved of this particular cargo without any compensation whatsoever for that matter where had barrayar obtained its working model of the shieldsuit was there a real victor rotha and where was he now where had illyan gotten their ship so you carry them with you i didnt say that hm she smiled can you deliver one tonight what size small one longnailed finger traced a line down her body from breast to thigh to indicate exactly how small miles sighed mournfully unfortunately these were sized for the averagetolarge combat soldier cutting one down is a considerable technical challengeone which i am in fact still working on myself how thoughtless of the manufacturer i entirely agree citizen nu she looked at him more carefully did her smile grow slightly more genuine anyway i prefer to sell them in wholesale lots if your organization isnt financially up to it an arrangement might yet be made promptly i trust ill be moving on soon she murmured absently perhaps not then looked up with a quick frown whats your next stop ungari had to file a public flight plan anyway aslund hm yes we must come to some arrangement absolutely were those blue flickers what were called bedroom eyes the effect was lulling almost hypnotic i finally meet a woman whos barely taller than i am and i dont even know which side shes on he of all men ought not to mistake short for weak or helpless can i meet your boss who her brows lowered the man i saw you both with this morning oh so youve already seen him set me up a meeting lets do serious business betan dollars remember pleasure before business surely her breath puffed against his ear a faint spicy fog was she trying to soften him up what for ungari had said dont break cover surely it would be in character for victor rotha to take all he could get plus ten percent you dont have to do this he managed to choke out his heart was beating entirely too fast i dont do everything for business reasons she purred why indeed should she bother to seduce a sleazy little gun runner what pleasure was in it for her what was in it besides pleasure for her maybe she likes me miles winced picturing himself offering that explanation to ungari her arm circled his neck his hand unwilled rose to stroke the fine pelt of her hair a highly aesthetic tactile experience just as hed imagined her hand tightened in pure nervous reflex miles leapt to his feet and stood there feeling like an idiot it had been a caress not incipient strangulation the angle was all wrong for attack leverage she flung herself back in the seat slim arm stretching along the top of the cushions victor her voice was amused her brow arched i wasnt going to bite your neck his face was hot ihavetogonow he cleared his throat to bring his voice back down to its lower register his hand swooped to pluck the vid disk from the player her hand leapt toward it then fell back languidly pretending disinterest miles hit the door comm overholt was there at once in the sliding door aperture miless gut eased if his bodyguard had been gone miles would have known this at once for some kind of setup too late of course maybe later miles gabbled after youve taken delivery we could get together delivery of a nonexistent cargo what was he saying she shook her head in disbelief her laugh followed him down the corridor it had a brittle edge miles lurched awake when the lights snapped on in his cabin ungari fully dressed was in the doorway behind him their jump pilot wearing only his underwear and a sleepstunned expression jittered uncertainly dress later ungari snarled to the pilot just get us free of the dock and run us out beyond the tenthousandkilometer limit ill be up to help set course in a few minutes he added half to himself as soon as i know where the devil were going move the pilot fled ungari strode to miless bedside vorkosigan what the hell happened in that hostel room miles squeezed his eyes against the glares of both the lights and ungari and suppressed an impulse to hide under the covers from both ha his mouth was dry with sleep ive just gotten an advance warningbare minutes advance warningof an arrest order being put out by pol six civil security for victor rotha but i never touched the lady miles protested dizzied ligas body was found murdered in your meeting room what the security lab has just finished timing itto about when you met were to meet the arrest order will be on the net in minutes and well be locked in here but i didnt i never even saw liga only his boss livia nu i meanif id done any such thing id have reported it to you immediately sir thank you said ungari dryly im glad to know that his voice harshened youre being framed of course who yes there could have been another grimmer way for livia nu to have relieved liga of that top secret vid disk but if she wasnt ligas superior or even a member of his polian criminal organization at all who was she we need to know more sir this could be the start of something this could be the end of our mission damn and now we cant retreat back through pol to barrayar cut off where next ungari paced evidently thinking aloud i want to go to aslund its extradition treaty with pol has broken down at present but then there are your mercenary complications now that theyve connected rotha to naismith thanks to your carelessness from what chodak said i dont think admiral naismith would exactly be welcomed back with open arms miles agreed reluctantly jacksons wholes consortium station has no extradition treaty with anyone this covers gone completely sour rotha and naismith both useless it has to be the consortium ill ditch this ship there go underground and double back to aslund on my own what about me sir you and overholt will have to split off and take the long way home home home in disgrace sir running away looks bad suppose we sat tight and cleared rotha of the charges we wouldnt be cut off any more and rotha would still be a viable cover its possible were being hustled into doing just this cutting and running i dont see how anyone could have anticipated my information source in polian civil security i think were meant to be locked up here in dock ungari tapped his right fist into his palm once a gesture of decision this time the consortium it is he wheeled and exited boots tromping down the deck a change of vibration and and pressure and a few muted clanks told miles their ship was now breaking from pol six miles said aloud to the empty cabin but what if they have plans for both contingencies i would he shook his head doubtfully and rose to dress and follow ungari the jacksonian consortiums jump point station miles decided differed from pols mainly in the assortment of things its merchants offered for sale he stood before the bookdisk dispenser in a concourse very like pol sixs and flicked the vid fastforward through a huge catalogue of pornography well mostly fastforward his search was punctuated by a few pauses from bemused to stunned nobly resisting curiosity he reached the military history section only to find a disappointingly thin collection of titles he inserted his credit card and the machine dispensed three wafers not that he was all that interested in the adumbration of trigonial strategy in the wars of minos iv but it was going to be a long dull ride home and sergeant overholt did not promise to be the most sparkling of traveling companions miles pocketed the disks and sighed what a waste of time effort and anticipation this mission had been ungari had arranged for the sale of victor rothas ship pilot and engineer to a front man who would deliver it eventually back to barrayaran imperial security miless pleading suggestions to his superior on how to make more use of rotha naismith or even ensign vorkosigan had then been interrupted by an ultracoded message from impsec hq for ungaris eyes only ungari had withdrawn to decode it and emerged half an hour later deadwhite around the lips he had then moved his timetable up and departed within the hour on a commercial ship to aslund station alone refusing to impart the contents of the message to miles or even to sergeant overholt refusing to take miles along refusing miles permission to at least continue military observations independently on the consortium ungari left overholt to miles or vice versa it was a little hard to tell who had been left in charge of whom overholt seemed to be acting less like a subordinate and more like a nanny all the time discouraging miless attempted explorations of the consortium insisting he keep safely to his hostel room they waited now to board an escobaran commercial liner slated for a nonstop run to escobar where they would report to the barrayaran embassy which would no doubt ship them home home and with nothing to show for it miles checked his chrono another twenty minutes to kill before boarding they might as well go sit with an irritable glance at his shadow overholt miles trudged wearily down the concourse overholt followed frowning general disapproval miles brooded on livia nu in fleeing from her erotic invitation hed surely missed the adventure of his short lifetime yet that hadnt been the look of love on her face anyway hed worry about a woman who could fall madly in love at first sight with victor rotha the light in her eyes had been more on the order of a gourmet contemplating an unusual hors doeuvre just presented by the waiter hed felt like hed had parsley sticking out of his ears she might have been dressed like a courtesan moved like a courtesan but thered been none of the courtesans eagerness to please about her nothing servile the gestures of power in the garments of powerlessness unsettling so beautiful courtesan criminal spy what was she above all who did belong to was she ligas boss or ligas opponent or ligas had she killed the rabbity man herself whatever else she was he was increasingly convinced she was a key piece in the puzzle of hegen hub they should have followed her up not fled from her it wasnt the only opportunity hed missed the meeting with livia was going to bother him for a long time miles looked up to find his way blocked by a pair of consortium goonscivil security officers he corrected his thought ironically he stood feet planted and lifted his chin what now yes gentlemen the big one looked to the enormous one who cleared his throat mr victor rotha if i am then what an arrest order has been purchased for you it charges you with the murder of one sydney liga do you wish to outbid probably miless lip curled in exasperation what a development whos bidding for my arrest the name is cavilo miles shook his head dont even know him is he with polian civil security by chance the officer checked his report panel no he added chattily the polians almost never do business with us they think we ought to trade them criminals for free as if we wanted any back huh thats supply and demand for you miles blew out his breath illyan was not going to be thrilled aboutthis charge on his expense account how much did this cavilo offer for me the officer checked his panel again his brows rose twenty thousand betan dollars he must want you a lot miles made a small leaky noise i dont have that much on me the officer pulled out his comealong stick well then ill have to make arrangements youll have to make arrangements from detention sir but ill miss my ship thats probably the idea the officer agreed considering the timing and all supposeif thats all this cavilo wantshe then withdraws his bid hell lose a substantial deposit jacksonian justice was truly blind theyd sell it to anyone uh may i have a word with my assistant the officer pursed his lips and studied overholt suspiciously make it fast what dyou think sergeant miles turned to overholt and asked lowly they dont seem to have an order for you overholt looked tense tight mouth annoyed and eyes almost panicked if we could make it to the ship the rest hung unspoken the escobarans shared the polian disapproval of jacksonian consortium law once aboard the liner miles would be on escobaran soil the captain would not voluntarily yield him up could would this cavilo be able to bid enough to intern the whole escobaran liner the sum involved would be astronomical try miles turned back toward the consortium officers smiling wrists held out in surrender overholt exploded into action the sergeants first kick sent the enormous goons comealong stick flying overholts momentum flowed into a whirl that brought his double hands up against the second goons head with great force miles was already in motion he dodged a wild grab and sprinted as best he could up the concourse at this point he spotted the third goon in plainclothes miles could tell who he was by the glitter of the tanglefield he tossed in front of miless pistoning legs the man snorted with laughter as miles pitched forward trying to roll and save his brittle bones miles hit the concourse floor with a whump that knocked the air from his lungs he inhaled through clenched if teeth not crying out as the pain in his chest competed with the burn of the tanglenet around his ankles he wrenched himself around on the floor looking back the way he had come the less enormous goon was standing bent over hands to his head dizzied the other was retrieving his comealong stick from where it had skittered to a stop by elimination the stunned heap on the pavement must be sergeant overholt the goon with the stick stared at overholt and shook his head and stepped over him toward miles the dizzied goon pulled out his own stick and gave the downed man a shock to the head and followed without a backward glance nobody apparently wanted to buy overholt there will be a ten percent surcharge for resisting arrest the spokesmangoon remarked coldly down to miles miles squinted up the shiny columns of his boots the shockstick came down like club on the third blazing blow he began screaming on the seventh he passed out he came to consciousness altogether too soon while still being dragged along between the two uniformed men he was shivering uncontrollably his breathing was messed up somehow irregular shallow gasps that didnt give him enough air waves of pinsandneedles pulsed through his nervous system he had a kaleidoscope impression of lift tubes and corridors and more bare functional corridors they jerked to a halt at last when the goons let his arms go he fell to hands and knees then the cold floor another civil security officer peered over a comconsole desk him a hand grasped miless head by the hair and yanked it back the red flicker of a retinal scan blinded him momentarily his eyes seemed extraordinarily sensitive to light his shaking hands were pressed hard against some sort of identification pad released he fell back into his huddle his pockets were stripped out stunner ids tickets cash all dumped pellmell into a plastic bag miles emitted a muffled squeak of dismay as they bundled the white jacket with all its useful secrets into the bag as well the lock was keyed closed with his thumbprint pinched against it the detention officer craned his neck does he want to outbid unh miles managed to respond when his head was pulled back again he said he did the arresting goon said helpfully the detention officer shook his head were going to have to wait till the shock wears off you guys overdid it i think hes only a little runt yeah but he had a big guy with him who gave us trouble the little mutant seemed to be in charge so we let him take payment for both thats fair the detention officer conceded well itll be a while throw him in the cooler till he stops shaking enough to talk sure thats a good idea funnylooking as he is the boyohs might want to play games he might still ransom himself mm the detention officer looked miles over judiciously throw him in the waiting room with mardas techies then theyre a quiet bunch theyll leave him alone and theyll be gone soon miles was dragged againhis legs didnt respond at all to his will only jerking spasmodically the leg braces seemed to have had some amplifying effect on the shocks administered there or maybe it was the combination with the tanglefield a long room like a barracks with a row of cots down each wall swam past his vision the goons heaved him not unkindly onto an empty cot in the lesspopulated end of the room the senior one made a dim sort of effort to straighten him out tossed a light blanket across his still uncontrollablytwitching form and they left him a little time passed with nothing to distract him from the full enjoyment and appreciation of his new array of physical sensations hed thought hed sampled every sort of agony in the catalogue but the goons shocksticks had found out nerves and synapses and ganglial knots hed never known he possessed nothing like pain to concentrate the attention upon the self practically solipsistic it was but it seemed to be easingif only his body would stop these quasiepileptic seizures which were exhausting him a face wavered into view a familiar face gregor am i glad to see you miles burbled inanely he felt his burning eyes widen his hands shot out to clench gregors shirt a pale blue prisoners smock what the hell are you doing here its a long story ah ah miles struggled up onto his elbow and stared around wildly for assassins hallucinations he knew not what god wheres gregor pushed him back down with a hand on his chest calm down and under his breath and shut up you better rest a bit you dont look very good right now actually gregor didnt look so good himself sitting on the edge of miless cot his face was pale and tired peppered with beard stubble his normally militarycut and combed black hair was a tangle his hazel eyes looked nervous miles choked back panic my name is greg bleakman the emperor informed miles urgently i cant remember what my name is right now miles stuttered ohyeah victor rotha i think but how did you get from gregor looked around vaguely the walls have ears i think yes maybe miles subsided slightly the man on the next cot shook his head with a godsavemefromtheseassholes look turned over and put his pillow over his head but uh did you get here like under your own power unfortunately all my own doing you remember that time we were joking about running away from home yeah well gregor took a breath it turned out to be a really bad idea couldnt you have figured that out in advance i gregor broke off to stare up the long room as a guard stuck his head in the door to bawl five minutes oh hell what what theyre coming for us whos coming for who what the hell is going on gregor greg i had a berth on a freighter i thought but they dumped me off here without pay gregor explained rapidly stiffed me i didnt have so much as a halfmark on me i tried to get something on an outbound ship but before i could i got arrested for vagrancy jacksonian law is insane he added reflectively i know then what they were apparently making a deliberate sweep pressgang style seems some enterpreneur is selling techtrained work gangs to the aslunders to work on their hub station which is running behind schedule miles blinked slave labor of a sort the carrot is when the sentence is up were to be discharged on aslund station most of these techs dont seem to mind too much no pay but wetheywill be fed and housed and escape jacksonian security so in the end theyll be no worse off than when they started broke and unemployed most of them seem to think theyll find berths outbound from aslund eventually being without funds is not such a heinous crime there miless head pounded theyre taking you away tension pooled in gregors eyes contained not permitted to seep over into the rest of his stiff face right now i think god i cant let but how did you find me here gregor began in turn then looked in frustration up the room where bluesmocked men and women were grumbling to their feet are you here to miles stared around frantically the blueclad man on the cot next to his now lay on his side watching them with a bored glower he wasnt overtall you miles scrambled overboard and crouched at the mans side you want to get out of this trip the man looked slightly less bored how trade clothes trade ids you take my place i take yours the man looked suspicious whats the catch no catch i got a lot of credit i was going to buy my way out of here in a while miles paused theres going to be a surcharge for my resisting arrest though ah a catch identified the man looked slightly more interested please i have to go withwith my friend right now the babble was rising as the techs assembled in the rooms far end by the exit gregor wandered around behind the mans cot the man pursed his lips naw he decided if whatever youre in for is worse than this i dont want anything to do with it he swung to a sitting position preparing to rise and join the line miles still crouched on the floor raised his hands in supplication please gregor perfectly placed pounced he grabbed the man around the neck in a neat choke and flipped him over the side of his cot out of sight thank god the barrayaran aristocracy still insisted on military training for its scions miles staggered to his feet the better to obscure the view from up the room some small thumping noises came from the floor in a few moments a prisoners blue smock skidded under the cot to fetch up at miless sandaled feet miles squatted and pulled it on over his green silksfortunately it was a bit oversizedthen struggled into the loose trousers that followed some shoving sounds as the mans unconscious body was pushed out of sight under the cot and gregor stood panting slightly very white i cant get these damn belt strings miles said they skittered from his trembling hands gregor tied up miless pants and rolled up his overlong trouser legs you need his id or you cant get food or register your workcredits gregor hissed out of the corner of his mouth and leaned artistically against the end of the cot in an idle pose miles checked his pocket and found the standard computer card all right he stood next to gregor teeth bared in a weird grin im about to pass out gregors hand locked his elbow dont itll draw attention they walked up the room and slipped into the end of the shuffling complaining blueclad line a sleepylooking guard at the door checked them out running a scanner over the ids twentythree twentyfour twentyfive thats it take em away they were turned over to another set of guards not in the uniform of the consortium but some minor jacksonian house livery gold and black miles kept his face down as they were herded out of detention only gregors hand kept him on his feet they passed through a corridor another corridor down a lift tubemiles nearly threw up during the dropanother corridor what if this damned id has a locator miles thought suddenly at the next drop tube he shed it the little card twinkled away into the dim distance silent and unnoticed a docking bay a hatchway the brief weightlessness of the flexible docking tube and they boarded a shipsergeant overholt where are you now it was clearly an intrasystem carrier not a jump ship and not very large the men were separated from the women and directed down opposite ends of a corridor lined with cabin doors leading to fourbunk cubicles the prisoners spread out selecting their quarters without apparent interference from the guards miles make a quick count and multiplication we can get one toourselves if we try he whispered urgently to gregor he ducked into the nearest and they hit the door control quickly another prisoner made to follow them in to be met with a united snarl of back off he withdrew hastily the door did not slide open again the cabin was dirty and lacked such amenities as bedding for the mattresses but the plumbing worked as miles got a drink of lukewarm water he heard and felt the hatch close and the ship undock they were safe for the moment how long when do you think that guy you choked is going to wake up miles asked gregor who sat on the edge of one bunk im not sure ive never choked a man before gregor looked sick i felt something strange under my hand im afraid i might have broken his neck he was still breathing miles said he walked to the opposite lower bunk and prodded it no sign of vermin he seated himself gingerly the severe shakes were passing off leaving only a tremula but he still felt weak in the knees when he wakes upas soon as they find him whether he wakes up or notits not going to take them long to figure out where i went i should have just waited and followed you and bought you back assuming i could bid myself free this was a stupid idea why didnt you stop me gregor stared i thought you knew what you were doing isnt illyan right behind you not as far as i know i thought you were in illyans department now i thought you were sent to find me this isnt some kind of bizarre rescue no miles shook his head and immediately regretted the motion maybe youd better begin at the beginning id been on komarr for a week under the domes highlevel talks on wormhole route treatieswere still trying to get the escobarans to permit passage of our military vessels theres some idea of letting their inspection teams seal our weapons during passage our general staff thinks its too much theirs thinks its too little i signed a couple of agreementswhatever the council of ministers shoved in front of me dad makes you read them surely oh yes anyway there was a military review that afternoon and a state dinner in the evening which broke up early a couple of the negotiators had to catch ships i went back to my quarters some oligarchs old town house big place at the edge of the dome near the shuttleport my suite was high in this building i went out on the balconyit didnt help much still felt claustrophobic under the dome komarrans dont like open air either miles noted in fairness i knew one who had breathing problemslike asthmawhenever he had to go outside strictly psychosomatic gregor shrugged gazing at his shoes anyway i noticed there were no guards in sight for a change i dont know why the hole thered been a man there earlier they thought i was asleep i guess it was after midnight i couldnt sleep i was leaning over the balcony and thinking if i toppled off gregor hesitated it would be quick miles supplied dryly he knew that state of mind oh yes gregor glanced up at him and smiled ironically yes i was a little drunk you were a lot drunk quick yes smash my skull it would hurt a lot but not for long maybe even not a lot maybe just a flash of heat miles shuddered concealed in his shockstick tremula i went overi caught these plants then i realized i could climb down as easily as up more easily i felt free as if i had died i started walking nobody stopped me all the time i expected someone to stop me i ended up in the freightyard end of the shuttleport at a bar i told this fellow the free trader i was a normspace navigator id done that on my ship duty id lost my id and was afraid barrayaran security would rough me up he believed meor believed something anyway he gave me a berth we probably broke orbit before my batman went in to wake me that morning miles chewed his knuckles so from impsecs point of view you evaporated from a fully guarded room no note no traceand on komarr the ship made a straight run through to poli stayed aboardand then nonstop to the consortium i didnt get along too well at first on the freighter i thought i was doing better guess not but i thought illyan was probably right behind me anyway komarr miles rubbed his temples do you realize what has to be happening back there illyan will be convinced its some sort of political kidnapping i bet hes got every security operative and has the army tearing those domes apart bolt by bolt looking for you youre way out ahead of them they wont look beyond komarr till miles counted out days on his fingers still illyan shot have alerted all his outlying agents almost a week ago ha i that was the message that put ungari up in the air just before he left in such a hurry sent to ungari not to me not to me nobodys counting me but it should have been all over the news it was sort of gregor offered there was a sententious announcement that id been ill and retired to rest in seclusion at vorkosigan surleau theyre suppressing miles could just picture it gregor how could you do this theyll be going insane back home im sorry said gregor stiffly i knew it was a mistake almost immediately even before the hangover cut in why didnt you get off at pol then and go to the barrayaran embassy i thought i might still dammit he broke off why should these people own me childish stunt miles gritted through his teeth gregors head jerked up in anger but he said nothing the full realization of his position was just beginning to sink in to miles like lead in his belly im the only man in the universe who knows where the emperor of barrayar is right now if anything happens to gregor i could be his heir in fact if anything happens to gregor quite a lot of people will think i and if the hegen hub found out who gregor really was a freeforall of epic proportions could follow the jacksonians would take him for simple ransom aslund pol vervain any or all might seek some power play the cetagandans most of allif they could gain possession of gregor in secret who knew what subtle psychological programming they might attempt if openly what threats and miles and gregor were both trapped on a ship they didnt controlmiles might be snatched away at any moment by consortium goons or worse miles was an impsec officer now however junior or disgraced and impsecs sworn duty was the emperors safety the emperor barrayarans unifying icon gregor unwilling flesh pressed into the mold icon flesh which claimed miless allegiance both hes mine a prisoner on the run trailed by godknowswhat enemies suicidally depressed and all mine miles choked down a lunatic cackle with a little reflection possible now that the shockstick reverberations were wearing off miles realized that he needed to hide gregor by his place as a contract slave would be warm fed and safe all the way to aslund station if miles did not endanger him maybe miles added it to his lifes lessons list call it rule b never make key tactical decisions while having electroconvulsive seizures miles began by examining the bunk cubicle the vessel was not a prison ship the cabin had originally been designed as cheap transport not a secured cell empty storage cupboards beneath the two bunkstacks were too large and obvious a floor panel lifted for access to betweendecks control coolant and power lines and the grav grid long narrow flat rough voices in the corridor propelled miless decision he squeezed himself into the slice of space face up arms tight to his sides and exhaled you always were good at hideandseek said gregor admiringly and pressed the panel down i was smaller then miles mumbled through squashed cheekspipes and circuit boxes sank into his back and buttocks gregor refastened the catches and all was dark and silent for a few minutes like a coffin like a pressed flower some kind of biological specimen anyway canned ensign the door hissed open footsteps passed over miless body compressing him still further would they notice the muffled echo from this strip of floor on your feet techie a guards voice directed to gregor thumpings and hangings as the mattresses were flipped and the cupboard doors flung open yes hed figured the cupboards for useless where is he techie from the directions of the shufflings miles placed gregor as now near the wall probably with an arm twisted up behind his back where is who said gregor in a smeary tone face against the wall all right your little mutant buddy the weird little guy who followed me in hes no buddy of mine he left more shufflingow the emperors arm had just been lifted another five centimeters miles gauged whered he go i dont know he didnt look so good somebodyd worked him over with a shock stick recently i wasnt about to get involved he took off again a few minutes before we undocked good gregor depressed maybe stupid no miless lips drew back his head was turned with one cheek against the floor above and the other pressing against something that resembled a cheese grater more thumps all right he left dont hit me unintelligible guard growls the crackle of a shock stick a sharp intake of breath a thump as of a body curling up on a lower bunk a second guards voice edged with uncertainty he must have doubled back onto the consortium before we cast off their problem good but wed better search the whole ship to be sure detention sounded ready to chew ass on this one chew or be chewed hah im taking no bets the booted feetfour of them miles estimatedstalked toward the cabin door the door hissed closed silence he was going to have a truly remarkable collection of bruises on his backside miles decided by the time gregor got around to popping the lid he could get about half a breath with each pulse of his lungs he needed to pee come on gregor he must certainly free gregor from his slave labor contract as soon as possible after their arrival at aslund station contract laborers of this order were bound to be stuck with the dirtiest and most dangerous jobs the most exposure to radiation to dubious lifesupport systems to long exhausting accidentprone hours thoughtrueit was also an incognito no enemy would quickly penetrate once free to move they must find ungari the man with the credit cards and the contacts after thatwell after that gregor would be ungaris problem eh yes all simple right and tight no need to panic at all had they taken gregor away dare he release himself and risk shuffling footsteps a widening line of light as his lid was raised theyre gone gregor whispered miles unmolded himself centimeter by painful centimeter and climbed onto the floor a suitable staging area he would attempt to stand up very soon now gregor had one hand pressed to a red mark on his cheek selfconsciously he lowered his hand to his side they tapped me with a shock stick it wasnt as bad as id imagined if anything he looked faintly proud of himself they were using low power miles growled up at him gregors face grew more masked he offered miles a hand up miles took it and grunted to his feet and sat heavily on a bunk he told gregor about his plans for finding ungari gregor shrugged dully acquiescent very well it will be quicker than my plan your plan i was going to contact the barrayaran counsel on aslund oh good miles subsided guess you didnt really need my rescue at that i could have made it on my own i got this far but then there was my other plan oh not to contact the barrayaran consul maybe its just as well you came along when you did gregor lay back on his bunk staring blindly upward one thing is certain an opportunity like this will never come again to escape and just how many would die back home to buy your freedom gregor pursed his lips taking vordarians pretendership as a benchmark for palace coupssay seven or eight thousand youre not counting in komarr ah yes adding in komarr would inflate the figure gregory conceded his mouth twitched in an irony altogether devoid of humor dont worry im not serious i just wanted to know i could have made it on my own dont you think of course thats not the question it was for me gregor miless fingers tapped in frustration against his knee youre doing this to yourself you have real power dad fought through the whole regency to preserve it just be more assertive and ensign if i your supreme commander ordered you to leave this ship at aslund station and forget you ever saw me would you miles swallowed major cecil said i had a problem with subordination gregor almost grinned good old cecil i remember him his grin faded to nothing he rolled up onto one elbow but if i cant even control one rather short ensign how much less an army or a government power isnt the question ive had all your dads lectures on power its illusions and uses it will come to me in time whether i want it or not but do i have the strength to handle it think about the bad showing i made during vordrozda and hessmans plot four years ago will you make that mistake again trust a flatterer not that one no well then but i must do better or i might be as bad for barrayar as no emperor at all just how unintentional had that topple off the balcony been miles gritted his teeth i didnt answer your questionabout ordersas an ensign i answered it as lord vorkosigan and as a friend ah look you dont need my rescue such as it is illyans maybe not mine but it makes me feel better its always nice to feel useful gregor agreed they mirrored edged smiles gregors smile lost its bitter bite and its nice to have company miles nodded that truly miles spent quite a lot of time over the next two days squashed under the deck or crouched in the cupboards but their cabin was searched only once and that very early on twice other prisoners wandered in to chat with gregor and once on miless suggestion gregor returned the visit gregor divided his rations with miles automatically without complaint or even comment and would not accept a larger portion although miles urged it on him gregor was herded out with the rest of the labor crew soon after tile ship docked at aslund station miles waited nervously trying to give as long as possible for the ship to quiet down for the crew to go offguard yet not so long as to risk the ship undocking and thrusting off with him still aboard the corridor when miles cautiously poked his head out was dark and deserted the docking hatch was unguarded on this side miles still wore the blue smock and pants over his other clothes on the calculated risk the work gangs were treated as trustys with the run of the station and he would at least blend in at a distance he stepped out firmly and nearly panicked when he found a man in the gold and black house livery idling around the hatchs exit his stunner was bolstered his hands cradled a steaming plastic cup his squinting red eyes regarded miles incuriously miles favored him with a brief smile not breaking stride the guard returned a sour grimace evidently his charge was to prevent strange people from entering not leaving the ship the stationside loading bay beyond the hatch proved to contain half a dozen coveralled maintenance personnel working quietly down on one end miles took a deep breath and walked casually across the bay without looking around as if he knew just where he was going just an errand boy no one hailed him reassured miles marched off purposefully at random a wide ramp led to a great chamber raucous with new construction and busy work crews in all sorts of dressa fightershuttle refueling and repairs bay judging by the halfassembled equipment just the sort of thing to interest ungari miles didnt suppose hed be so lucky as to no no sign of ungari camouflaged among these crews there were a number of men and women in dark blue aslunder military uniforms but they appeared to be overworked and absorbed engineertypes not suspicious guards miles kept walking briskly nonetheless out another corridor he found a portal its transparent plexi bellied out to offer passersby a wideangle view he put one foot on the lower edge and leaned outcasuallyand bit back a few choice swear words glittering a few kilometers off was the commercial transfer station a tiny glint of a ship was docking even now the military station was apparently being designed as a separate facility or at least not connected yet no wonder bluesmocks could wander at will miles stared across the gap in mild frustration well hed search this place first for ungari the other later somehow he turned and started hey you little techie miles froze controlling a reflexive urge to sprintthat tactic hadnt worked last timeand turned trying for an expression of polite inquiry the man whod hailed him was big but unarmed wearing tan supervisors coveralls he looked harried yes sir said miles youre just what i need the mans hand fell heavily on miless shoulder come with me miles perforce followed trying to stay calm maybe project a little bored annoyance whats your specialization the man asked drains miles intoned perfect dismayed miles followed the man to where two halffinished corridors intersected an archway gaped raw and uncapped by molding though the molding lay ready to install the super pointed to a narrow space between walls see this pipe sewage by the grey colorcoding air and grav pumped it disappeared in darkness yeah theres a leak somewhere behind this corridor wall crawl in and find it sos we dont have to tear out all the damn paneling we just put up got a light the man fished in his pocketed coverall and produced a hand light right sighed miles is it hooked up yet about to be damn thing failed the final pressure test only air would be spewing out miles brightened slightly maybe his luck was changing he slid in and inched along the smooth round surface listening and feeling about seven meters in he found it a rush of cool air from a crack under his hands quite marked he shook his head attempted to turn in the constricted space and put his foot through the paneling he stuck his head out the hole in astonishment and glanced up and down the corridor he wriggled a chunk of paneling from the edge and stared at it turning it in his hands two men putting up light fixtures their tools sparking turned to stare what the hell are you doing said the one in tan coveralls sounding outraged quality control inspection said miles glibly and boy do you have a problem miles considered kicking the hole wider and just walking back to his starting point but turned and inched instead he emerged by the anxiously waiting super your leaks in section six miles reported he handed the man his panel chunk if those corridor panels are supposed to be made of flammable fiberboard instead of spun silica on a military installation planned to withstand enemy fire somebodys hired a real poor designer if theyre noti suggest you take a couple of those big goons with the shock sticks and go pay a visit to your supplier the super swore lips compressed he grasped the nearest panel edge fronting the wall and twisted hard a fistsized segment cracked and tore off bitchen how much of this stuffs been installed already lots miles suggested cheerfully he turned to escape before the super worrying off fragments and muttering under his breath thought of another chore flushed and sweating miles skittered off and didnt relax till hed rounded the second corner he passed a pair of armed men in greyandwhite uniforms one turned to stare miles kept walking teeth clenching his lower lip and did not look back dendarii or oserans here aboard this stationhow many where those two were the first hed seen shouldnt they be out on patrol somewhere he wished he were back in the walls like a rat in the wainscotting but if most of the mercenaries here were a danger to him there was onedendarii truly not oseranwho might be a help if he could make contact if he dared make contact elena he could seek out elena his imagination outraced him miles had left elena four years ago as baz jeseks wife as tungs military apprentice as much protection as he could get her at the time but he hadnt had any messages from baz since osers command coupcould oser be intercepting them now baz was demoted tung apparently disgracedwhat position in the mercenary fleet did elena hold now what position in his heart he paused in grave doubt hed loved her passionately once once shed known him better than any other human being yet her daily hold on his mind had passed like his grief for her dead father sergeant bothari fading in the rush of his new life but for an occasional twinge like an old bonebreak he wanteddid not want to see her again to talk to her again to touch her again but more to the practical point she would recognize gregor theyd all been playmates in their youth a second line of defense for the emperor reopening contact with elena might be emotionally awkwardall right emotionally searing but it was better than this ineffectual and dangerous wandering around now that hed scouted the layout he must somehow get into position to bring his resources to bear how much human credit did admiral naismith still have interesting question he needed to find a place to watch without being seen there were all sorts of ways to be invisible while in plain sight as his blue smock was presently demonstrating but his unusual heightwell shortnessmade him reluctant to rely on clothes alone he neededha tools such as the case a tancoveralled man had just set down in the corridor while he ducked into a lavatory miles had the case in hand and was around the corner in a blink a couple of levels away he found a corridor leading to a cafeteria hm everyone must eat therefore everyone must pass this way in time the food smells excited his stomach which protested halfrations or less for the past three days by gurgling he ignored it he pulled a panel off the wall donned a pair of protective goggles from the tool case by way of a modest facial disguise climbed into the wall to halfconceal his height and began pretending to work on a control box and some pipes diagnostic scanners placed decoratively to hand his view up the corridor was excellent from the wafting odors he judged they were serving an unusually good grade of vatgrown beef in there though they were also doing something nasty to vegetables he tried not to salivate into the beam of the tiny lasersolderer he manipulated while he studied passersby very few were civilianclothed rothas wear would clearly have been more conspicuous than the blue smock lots of colorcoded coveralls blue smocks some similar green smocks not a few aslunder military blues mostly lower ranks did the dendariioseransmercenariesaboard eat elsewhere he was considering abandoning his outposthed about repaired the control boxes to death by nowwhen a duo of greyandwhites passed not faces he knew he let them go by unhailed he contemplated the odds reluctantly of all the couple thousand mercenaries now present around the aslunders wormhole jump he might know a few hundred by sight fewer by name only some of the mercenary fleets ships were now docked at this halfbuilt military station and of the portion of a portion how many people could he trust absolutely five he let another quartet of greyandwhites pass though he was certain that older blonde woman was an engineering tech from the triumph once loyal to tung once he was getting ravenous but the leathercolored face topping the next set of greyandwhites to pass down the corridor made miles forget his stomach it was sergeant chodak his luck had turnedmaybe for himself hed take the chance but to risk gregor too late to waffle now chodak had spotted miles in turn the sergeants eyes widened in astonishment before his face grew swiftly blank oh sergeant miles caroled tapping a control box would you take a look at this please ill be along in a minute chodak waved on his companion a man in the uniform of an aslunder ranker when their heads were together and their backs to the corridor chodak hissed are you insane what are you doing here it was a mark of his agitation that he omitted his habitual sir its a long story for now i need your help but how did you get in here admiral oser has guards all over the transfer station on the lookout for you you couldnt smuggle in a sandflea miles smirked convincingly i have my methods and his next plan had been to scheme his way across to that very transfer station truly god protected fools and madmen for now i need to make contact with commander elena botharijesek urgently or failing her engineering commodore jesek is she here she should be the triumphs in dock commodore jesek is out with the repairs tender i know well if not elena tung or arde mayhew or lieutenant elli quinn but i prefer elena tell herbut no one elsethat i have our old friend greg with me tell her to meet me in an hour in the contractlaborers quarters greg bleakmans cubicle can do can do sir chodak hurried off looking worried miles patched up his poor battered wall replaced the panel picked up his tool box and marched casually away trying not to feel like he had a flashing red light atop his head he kept his goggles on and his face down and chose the leastpopulated corridors he could find his stomach growled elena will feed you he told it firmly later a rising population of blue and green smocks told miles he was nearing the contract laborers quarters there was a directory he hesitated then punched up bleakman g module b cubicle he found the module checked his chronogregor should be offshift by nowand knocked the door sighed open and miles slipped within gregor was there sitting up sleepily on his bunk it was a oneman cubicle offering privacy though barely room to turn around privacy was a greater psychological luxury than space even slavetechs must be kept minimally happy they had too much power for potential sabotage to risk driving them over the edge were saved miles announced ive just made contact with elena he sat down heavily on the end of the bunk weak with the sudden release of tension in this safe pocket elenas here gregor scrubbed a hand through his hair i thought you wanted your captain ungari elenas the first step to ungari or failing ungari to smuggling us out of here if ungari hadnt been so damn insistent on the left hand not knowing what the right was doing it would be a lot easier but this will do he studied gregor in worry have you been all right a few hours putting up light fixtures isnt going to break my health i assure you said gregor dryly is that what they had you doing not what id pictured somehow gregor seemed all right anyway indeed the emperor was acting almost cheerful about his stint as a slave laborer as gregors morose standards of cheer went maybe we ought to send him to the salt mines for two weeks every year to keep him happy and content with his regular job miles relaxed a little its hard to imagine elena bothari as a mercenary gregor added reflectively dont underestimate her miles concealed a moment of raw doubt almost four years he knew how much he had changed in four years what of elena her years could have been hardly less hectic times change people change with them no as well doubt himself as elena the halfhour wait for his chrono to creep to the appointed moment was a bad interval enough to loosen miless driving tension and wash him in weariness but not enough to rest or refresh him he was miserably conscious of losing his edge of a crying need for alertness when alertness and straightthinking escaped like sand between his fingers he rechecked his chrono an hour had been too vague he should have named the minute but who knew what difficulties or delays elena must overcome from her end miles blinked hard realizing from his wavering and disconnected thoughts that he was falling asleep sitting up the door hissed open without gregors having released the lock here he is men a halfsquad of greyandwhite clad mercenaries filled the aperture and the corridor beyond it hardly needed the stunners and shocksticks in their hands the purposive descent on his person to tell miles this hairy crew was not elenas the surge of adrenalin scarcely cleared the fatiguefog from his head and what do i pretend to be now a moving target he sagged against the wall not even bothering though gregor lurched to his feet and made a valiant try in the constricted space an accurate karatekick sending a stunner flying from the hand of a closing mercenary two men smashed gregor against the wall for his effort miles winced then miles himself was jerked from the bunk to be coiled tripledcoiled in a tanglenet the field burned against him they were using enough power to immobilize a plunging horse what do you think i am boys the excited squad leader cried into his wrist comm i got him sir miles raised an ironic brow the squad leader flushed and straightened his hand twitching in the effort not to salute miles smiled slightly the squad leaders lips tightened ha almost got you going didnt i take them away ordered the squad leader miles was carried out the door between two men his bound feet dangling ridiculous inches from the floor a groaning gregor was dragged in his wake as they passed a crosscorridor miles saw chodaks strained face from the corner of his eye floating in the shadows he damned his own judgment then you thought you could read people your one demonstrable talent right sure should have should have should have mocked his mind like the caw of some vile scavenging bird surprised at a carcass when they were dragged across a large docking bay and through a small personnel hatch miles knew at once where he was the triumph the pocket dreadnought that had occasionally served as the fleets flagship was doing that duty again now tung of the dubious current status had been captainowner of the triumph once before tau verde oser had used to favor his own peregrine as flagwas this some deliberate political statement the corridors of the ship had a strange painful powerful familiarity the odors of men metal and machinery that crooked archway legacy of the lunatic ramming that had captured her on miless first encounter still not properly straightened out i thought i had forgotten more they were hustled along swiftly and secretly a pair of squadmen going ahead to clear the corridor of witnesses before them this was going to be a very private chat then fine that suited miles he would have preferred to avoid oser altogether but if they must meet again he would simply have to find some way of turning it to use he ordered his persona as if adjusting his cuffsmiles naismith space mercenary and mystery entrepreneur come to the hegen hub for what and his glum if faithful sidekick greg of coursehe would have to think of some particularly benign explanation for gregor they clattered down the corridor past the tactics room the triumphs combat nerve center and fetched up at the smaller of the two briefing rooms across from it the holovid plate in the center of the gleaming conference table was dark and silent admiral oser sat equally dark and silent at the tables head flanked by a pale blond man miles presumed to be a loyal lieutenant not anyone miles knew from before miles and gregor were forcibly seated in two chairs pulled back and distanced from the table that their hands and feet might be unconcealed oser dismissed all but one guard to the corridor outside osers appearance hadnt changed much in four years miles decided still lean and hawkfaced dark hair maybe a little greyer at the temples miles had remembered him as taller but he was actually shorter than metzov oser reminded miles somehow of the general was it the age the build the hostile glower the murderous pinpricks of red light in the eye miles gregor muttered out of the corner of his mouth what did you do to piss this guy off nothing miles protested back sotto voce nothing on purpose anyway gregor looked less than reassured oser placed his palms flat on the table before him and leaned forward staring at miles with predatory intensity if oserd had a tail miles fancied its end would be flicking back and forth what are you doing here oser opened bluntly without preamble you brought me didnt you know not the time to get cute no miles was highly conscious of the fact that he did not precisely look his best but admiral naismith wouldnt care he was too goaldirected naismith would carry on painted blue if he had to he answered equally bluntly i was hired to do a military evaluation of the hegen hub for an interested noncombatant who ships through here there the truth up front where it was sure to be disbelieved since they dont care for mounting rescue expeditions they wanted enough warning to clear the hub of their citizens before hostilities break out im doing a little arms dealing on the side a cover that pays for itself osers eyes narrowed not barrayar barrayar has its own operatives so does cetaganda aslund fears cetagandan ambitions as well they should barrayar is equidistant in my professional opinion fighting the tanglefield miles favored oser with a small bow sitting downoser almost nodded back but caught himselfbarrayar is no threat to aslund in this generation to control the hegen hub barrayar must control pol with the terraforming of their own second continent plus the opening of the planet sergyar barrayar is rather oversupplied with frontiers at present and then there is the problem of holding restive komarr a military adventure toward pol would be a serious overextension of barrayars human resources just now cheaper to be friends or at least neutral aslund also fears pol they are unlikely to fight unless attacked first keeping peace with pol is cheap and easy just do nothing any vervain i havent evaluated vervain yet its next on my list is it oser leaned back in his chair crossing his arms it was not a relaxed gesture as a spy i could have you executed but im not an enemy spy miles answered simulating easiness a friendly neutral orwho knowspotential ally and what is your interest in my fleet my interest in the dendain the mercenaries is purely academic i assure you you are simply part of the picture tell me whats your contract with aslund like miles cocked his head talking shop oser almost answered then his lips thinned in annoyance if miles had been a ticking bomb he could not have more thoroughly commanded the mercenarys attention oh come on miles scoffed in the lengthening silence what could i do by myself with one man i remember the last time you entered tau verde local space with a staff of four four months later you were dictating terms so what are you planning now you overestimate my impact i merely helped people along in the direction they wished to go an expediter so to speak not for me i spent three years recovering the ground i lost in my own fleet its hard to please everyone miles intercepted gregors look of mute horror and toned himself down come to think gregor had never met admiral naismith had he even you were not seriously damaged osers jaw compressed further and whos he he jerked a thumb at gregor greg hes just my batman miles cut across gregors opening mouth he doesnt look like a batman he looks like an officer gregor looked insensibly cheered at this unbiased encomium you cant go by looks commodore tung looks like a wrestler osers eyes were suddenly freezing indeed and how long have you been in correspondence with captain tung by the sick lurch in his belly miles realized mentioning tung has been a major mistake he tried to keep his features cooly ironic not reflecting his unease if id been in correspondence with tung i should not have been troubled with making this personal evaluation of aslund station oser elbows on table hands clasped studied miles in silence for a full minute at last one hand fell open to point at the guard who straightened attentively space them oser ordered what yelped miles you the pointing finger collected osers silent lieutenant go with them see that its done use the portside access lock its closest if he pointing to miles starts to talk stop his tongue its his most dangerous organ the guard released the tangle field from miless legs and pulled him to his feet arent you even going to have me chemically interrogated asked miles dizzied by this sudden downturn and contaminate my interrogators the last thing i want is to give you rein to talk to anyone i can think of nothing more fatal than for the rot of disloyalty to start in my own intelligence section whatever your planned speech removing your air will neutralize it you nearly convince me oser almost shuddered we were getting on so well yes but i they were hoisting gregor to his feet too but you dont need to two waiting members of the halfsquad fell in as they were bunked out the door frogmarching miles and gregor rapidly down the corridor but the conference room door hissed closed this is not going well miles gregor observed his pale face a weird compound of detachment exasperation and dismay any more bright ideas youre the man who was experimenting with wingless flight is this any worse than say plummeting at my own hand gregor began to drag his feet to struggle as the airlock chamber heaved into view not at the whim of a bunch of it took three guards to wrestle him now bloody peasants miles was getting seriously frantic screw the damn cover you know he called out loudly you fellows are about to throw a fortune in ransom out the airlock two guards kept wrestling with gregor but the third paused how big a fortune huge miles promised buy your own fleet the lieutenant abandoned gregor and closed on miles drawing a vibraknife the lieutenant was interpreting his orders with horrific literality miles realized when the man went for a grip on his tongue he almost got itthe evil insect whine of the knife dopplered centimeters from miless nosemiles bit the thick thrusting fingers and twisted against the grip of the guard holding him the tangle field binding miless arms to his torso whined and crackled unbreakable miles jammed backward against the crotch of the man behind who yipped at the fields bite his grip slipped and miles dropped rolling and banging into the lieutenants knees it wasnt exactly a judo throw the lieutenant moreorless tripped over him gregors two opponents were distracted as much by the bloody barbaric promise of the vibraknife show as by miless ultimately futile struggles they did not see the leatherfaced man step out from a crosscorridor aim his stunner and spray they arched convulsively as the buzzing charges struck their backs and dropped heap fashion to the deck the man whod been holding miles and was now trying to grab him again as he flopped around evasively as a fish whirled just in time to intersect a beam square in the face miles flung himself across the blond lieutenants head pinning himonly momentarily alasto the deck miles wriggled to press the tanglefield into the mans face then was heaved off with a curse the lieutenant had one knee under himself preparing to launch an attack and wobbling around in search of his target when gregor hopped over and kicked him in the jaw a stunner charge hit the lieutenant in the back of the head and he went down damn fine soldiering miles panted to sergeant chodak in sudden silence i dont think they even saw what hit them so i called him straight the first time havent lost my touch after all bless you sergeant you two arent so bad yourselves for men with both hands tied behind their backs chodak shook his head in harried amusement and trod forward to release the tanglefields what a team said miles a quick ring of boots from further up the corridor drew miless eye he exhaled a longheld breath and stood elena she wore a mercenary officers undress uniform greyandwhite pocketed jacket trousers ankletopping boots gleaming on her long long legs still tall still slim still with pale pure skin emberbrown eyes arched aristocratic nose and long sculptured jaw shes cut her hair miles thought stupidstunned gone was the straightshining black cascade to her waist now it was clipped out over her ears only little dark points gracenoting her high cheekbones and forehead a similar point echoed at the nape of her neck severe practical very smart soldierly she strode up eyes taking in miles gregor the four oserans good work chodak she dropped to one knee beside the nearest body and probed its neck for a pulse are they dead no just stunned miles explained she regarded the open inner airlock door with some regret i dont suppose we can space them they were going to space us but no but we probably ought to get them out of sight while we run said miles right she rose and nodded to chodak who began helping gregor drag the stunned bodies into the airlock she frowned at blond lieutenant going past feetfirst not that spacing wouldnt improve some personalities can you give us a bolthole thats what we came for she turned to the three soldiers who had followed her cautiously into view a fourth stood guard at the nearest crosscorridor it seems we just got lucky she told them scout ahead and clear the aisles on our escape routesubtly then disappear you werent here and didnt see this they nodded and withdrew miles heard a retreating mutter was that him yeah miles gregor and elena with the bodies piled cozily into the lock and closed the inner door temporarily chodak stood guard outside elena helped gregor pull the boots from the oseran nearest his size while miles stripped off his blue prisoners outfit and stood revealing victor rothas wrinkled clothing much the worse for four days wear sleep and sweat miles wished for boots to replace the vulnerable sandals but none here came close to his size gregor and elena exchanged looks each warily amazed at the other as gregor yanked on greyandwhites and plunged his feet into the boots its really you elena shook her head in dismay what are you doing here it was by mistake said gregor no lie whose mine im afraid said miles somewhat to his annoyance gregor did not gainsay this a peculiar smile her first quirked elenas lips miles decided not to ask her to explain it this hurried practical exchange did not in the least resemble any of the dozens of conversations he had rehearsed in his head for this first poignant meeting with her the search will be up in minutes when these guys dont report back miles jittered he collected two stunners the tanglefield and the vibraknife and stuck them in his waistband on second thought he swiftly relieved the four oserans of credit cards pass chits ids and odd cash stuffing his pockets and gregors and made sure gregor ditched his prisoners traceable id to his secret delight he also found a halfeaten ration bar and bit into it there and then he chewed as elena led the way back out the lock he conscientiously offered a bite to gregor who shook his head gregord probably had dinner in that cafeteria chodak hastily straightened gregors uniform and they all marched off miles to the center halfconcealed halfguarded before he could go halfparanoid at his conspicuousness they took to a droptube emerged several decks down and found themselves at a large cargolock engaged to a shuttle one of elenas scout squad leaning as if idle against the wall nodded with a halfsalute to elena chodak split off and they hurried away miles and gregor followed elena across the flexseal of the shuttle hatch and into the empty cargo hold of one of the triumphs shuttles stepping from the artificial gravity field of the mother ship abruptly into the vertigo of free fall they floated forward to the pilots compartment elena sealed the compartment hatch behind them and anxiously gestured gregor to the vacant seat at the engineeringcomm station the pilots and copilots seats were filled arde mayhew grinned cheerfully over his shoulder at miles and wavedsaluted hello miles recognized the shaved bullethead of the second man even before he turned hello son ky tungs smile was far more ironic than cheerful welcome back you took your sweet time tung arms folded did not salute hello ky miles nodded to the eurasian tung had not changed anyway still looked any age between forty and sixty still built like an ancient tank still seemed to see more than he spoke most uncomfortable for the guilty of conscience mayhew the pilot spoke into his comm traffic control ive traced that red light on my panel now defective pressure reading all fixed were ready to break away about time c a disembodied voice returned youre clear the pilots swift hands activated hatch seal controls aimed attitude jets some hissing and clanks and the shuttle popped away from its mothership and started on its trajectory mayhew killed the comlink and breathed a long sigh of relief safe for now elena wedged herself across the aisle behind miles long legs locking miles hooked an arm around a handhold to anchor against mayhews current mild accelerations i hope youre right said miles but what makes you think so he means safe to talk said elena not safe in any cosmic sense this is a routine scheduled run except for us unlisted passengers iknow you havent been missed yet or traffic control would have stopped us oser will search the triumph and the military station for you first we may even be able to slip you back aboard the triumph after the search has passed to wider areas this is plan b tung explained swiveling around to halfface miles or maybe plan c plan a on the assumption that your rescue was going to be a lot noisier was to flee at once to the ariel now on picketstation and declare the revolution im grateful for the chance to bring things off a little er less spontaneously miles choked god that would have been worse than the first time pitched into an interlocking chain of events he did not control drafted gonfalonier to some mercenary military mutiny thrust to the lead of its parade with all the free will of a head on a pike no no spontaneity thanks definitely not so tung steepled his thick fingers what is your plan my what plan tung pronounced the word with sardonic care in other words why are you here oser asked me that same question sighed miles would you believe im here by accident oser wouldnt you wouldnt happen to know why he wouldnt would you tung pursed his lips accident maybe your accidents i once noticed have ways of entangling your enemies that are the green envy of mature and careful strategists far too consistent for chance i concluded it had to be unconscious will if only youd stuck with me son between us we couldve or maybe you are simply a supreme opportunist in which case i direct your attention to the opportunity now before you to retake the dendarii mercenaries you didnt answer my question miles noted you didnt answer mine tung countered i dont want the dendarii mercenaries i do oh miles paused why dont you split off with the personnel who are loyal to you and start your own then its been done shall we swim through space tung imitated fish fins with his waving fingers and puffed his cheeks oser controls the equipment including my ship the triumph is everything ive accumulated in a thirtyyear career which i lost through your machinations somebody owes me another if not oser then tung glowered significantly at miles i tried to give you a fleet in trade said miles harried howd you lose control of itold strategist tung tapped a finger to his left breast to indicate a touche things went well at first for a year year and a half after we departed tau verde got two sweet little contracts in a row out toward the eastnet smallscale commando operations sure things well not too sure kept us on our toes but we brought them off miles glanced at elena id heard about those yes on the third we got into troubles baz jesek had gotten more and more involved with equipment and maintenancehe is a good engineer ill give him thati was tactical commander and oseri thought by default but now i think designtook up the administrative slack could have been good each doing what he did best if oserd been working with and not against us in the same situation id have sent assassins oser employed guerrilla accountants we took a bit of a beating on that third contract baz was up to his ears in engineering and repairs and by the time i got out of sickbay oserd lined up one of his nocombat specialswormhole guard duty work longterm contract seemed like a good idea at the time but it gave him a wedge with no actual combat going on i tung cleared his throat got bored didnt pay attention oserd outflanked me before i realized there was a war on he sprang the financial reorganization on us i told you not to trust him six months before that elena put in with a frown after he tried to seduce me tung shrugged uncomfortably it seemed like an understandable temptation to bang his commanders wife elenas eyes sparked anyones wife i knew then he wasnt level if my oaths meant nothing to him how little did his own he did take no for an answer you said tung excused himself if hed kept leaning on you id have been willing to step in i thought you ought to be flattered ignore it and go on overtures of that sort contain a judgment of my character that i find anything but flattering thank you elena snapped miles bit his knuckles hard and secretly remembering his own longings it might just have been an early move in his powerplay he put in probing for weaknesses in his enemies defenses and in this case not finding them hm elena seemed faintly comforted by this view anyway ky was no help and i got tired of playing cassandra naturally i couldnt tell baz but osers doubledealing didnt come as a complete surprise to all of us tung frowned frustrated given the nucleus of his own surviving ships all he had to do was swing the votes of half the other captainowners auson voted with him i could have strangled the bastard you lost auson yourself with your moaning about the triumph elena put in still acerb he thought you threatened his captaincy of it tung shrugged as long as i was chiefofstafftactical in charge during actual combat i didnt think he could really hurt my ship i was content to let the triumph ride along as if owned by the fleet corporation i could waittill you got back his dark eyes glinted at miles and we found out what was going on and then you never came back the king will return eh murmured gregor who had been listening with fascination he raised an eyebrow at miles let it be a lesson to you miles murmured back through set teeth gregor subsided less humorous miles turned to tung surely elena disabused you of any such immediate expectation i tried muttered elena although i suppose i couldnt help hoping a bit myself maybe youd quit your other project come back to us if i flunked out of the academy eh it wasnt a project i could quit short of death i know that now in five minutes max put in arde mayhew ive either got to lock into the transfer station traffic control for docking or else cut for the ariel which is it going to be folks i can put over a hundred loyal officers and noncoms at your back at a word said tung to miles four ships why not at your own back if i could i would have already but im not going to tear the fleet apart unless i can be certain of putting it back together again all of it but with you as leader with your reputationwhich has grown in the retelling leader or figurehead the image of that pike bobbed in miless minds eye again tungs hands opened noncommittally as you wish the bulk of the officer cadre will go for the winning side that means we must appear to be winning quickly if we move at all oser has about another hundred personally loyal to himself which were going to have to physically overpower if he insists on holding outwhich suggests to my mind that a welltimed assassination could save a lot of lives jolly i think you and oser have been working together too long ky youre starting to think alike again i did not come here to seize command of a mercenary fleet i have other priorities he schooled himself not to glance at gregor what higher priorities how about preventing a planetary civil war maybe an interstellar one i have no professional interest in that it almost succeeded in being a joke indeed what were barrayars agonies to tung you do if youre on the doomed side you only get paid for winning and only get to spend your pay if you live mercenary tungs narrow eyes narrowed further what do you know that i dont are we on the doomed side i am if i don t get gregor back miles shook his head sorry i cant talk about that ive got to get to pol closed to him the consortium station blocked and now aslund become even more dangerous vervain he glanced at elena get us both to vervain you working for the vervani tung asked no who then tungs hands twitched so tense with his curiosity they seemed to want to squeeze out information by main force elena noticed the unconscious gesture too ky back off she said sharply if miles wants vervain vervain he shall have tung looked at elena at mayhew do you back him or me elenas chin lifted were both oathsworn to miles baz too and you have to ask why i need you said tung in exasperation to miles gesturing at the pair what is this larger game that you all seem to know all about and i nothing i dont know anything chirped mayhew im just going by elena is this a chain of command or a chain of credulity theres a difference miles grinned youve exposed us by coming here tung argued think we help you you leave were left naked to osers wrath theres too many witnesses already there might be safety in victory none in halfmeasure miles looked with anguish at elena picturing her quite vividly inl light of his recent experiences being shoved out an airlock by evil witless goons tung noted with satisfaction the effect of his plea on miles and sat smugly back elena glared at tung gregor stirred uneasily i think should you become refugees on our behalf elena miles saw heard that official capital o too as tung and mayhew of course could not we can see that you do not suffer financially at least elena nodded understanding and acceptance tung leaned toward elena jerking his thumb at gregor all right who is this guy elena shook her head mutely tung vented a small hiss youve no means of support visible to me son what if we become corpses on your behalf elena remarked weve risked becoming corpses for much less less than what snapped tung mayhew his eyes going briefly distant touched the communications plug in his ear decision time folks can this ship go acrosssystem asked miles no not fueled up for it mayhew shrugged apology not fast enough or armored for it either said tung youll have to smuggle us out on commercial transport past aslunder security miles said unhappily tung stared around at his recalcitrant little committee and sighed securitys tighter for incoming than outgoing i think it can be done take us in arde after mayhew had docked the cargo shuttle at its assigned loading niche at the aslunders transfer station miles gregor and elena lay low locked in the pilots compartment tung and mayhew went off to see what we can do as tung put it rather airily to miless mind miles sat and nibbled his knuckles nervously and tried not to jump with each thump clink or hiss of the robotic loaders placing supplies for the mercenaries on the other side of the bulkhead elenas steady profile did not twitch at every little noise miles noticed enviously i loved her once who is she now could one choose not to fall in love all over again with this new person a chance to choose she seemed tougher more willing to speak her mindthis was goodyet her thoughts had a bitter tang not good that bitterness made him ache have you been all right he asked her hesitantly apart from this command structure mess that is tung treating you right he was supposed to be your mentor onthejob for you the training i was getting in the classroom oh hes a good mentor he stuffs me with military information tactics history i can run every phase of a combat drop patrol now logistics mapping assault withdrawal even emergency shuttle takeoffs and landings if you dont mind a few bumps im almost up to really handling my fictional rank at least on fleet equipment he likes teaching it seemed to me you were a little tense with him she tossed her head everything is tense just now its not possible to be apart from this command structure mess thank you although i suppose i havent quite forgiven tung for not being infallible about it i thought he was at first yeah well theres a lot of fallibility going around these days miles said uncomfortably uh hows baz is your husband treating you right he wanted to demand but didnt hes well she replied not looking happy but discouraged this power struggle was alien to him repugnant i think hes a tech at heart he sees a job that needs doing he does it tung hints that if baz hadnt buried himself in engineering he might have foreseen preventedfought the takeover but i think it was the other way around he couldnt lower himself to fight on osers backstabbing level so he withdrew to where he could keep his own standards of honesty for a little while longer this schisms affected morale all up and down the line im sorry said miles you should be her voice cracked steadied harshened baz felt hed failed you but you failed us first when you never came back you couldnt expect us to keep up the illusion forever illusion said miles i knew it would be difficult but i thought you might grow into your roles make the mercenaries your own the mercenaries may be enough for tung i thought they might be for me too till we came to the killing i hate barrayar but better to serve barrayar than nothing or your own ego what does oser serve gregor asked curiously brows raised at this mixed declamation about their homeworld oser serves oser the fleet he says but the fleet serves oser so its just a short circuit said elena the fleet is no homecountry no building no children sterile i dont mind helping out the aslunders though they need it a poor planet and scared you and bazand ardecould have left gone off on your own began miles how said elena you gave us the dendarii in charge baz was a deserter once never again all my fault right thought miles great elena turned to gregor who had acquired a strange guarded expression on his face while listening to her charges of abandonment you still havent said what youre doing here in the first place besides putting your feet in things was this supposed to be some son of secret diplomatic mission you explain it said miles to gregor trying not to grit his teeth tell her about the balcony eh gregor shrugged eyes sliding aside from elenas level look like baz i deserted like baz i found it was not the improvement id hoped for you can see why its urgent to get gregor back home as quickly as possible miles put in they think hes missing maybe kidnapped miles gave elena a quick edited version of their chance meeting in consortium detention god elenas lips pursed i see why its urgent to you to get him off your hands anyway if anything happened to him in your company fifteen factions would cry treason plot that thought has occurred to me yes growled miles your fathers centrist coalition government would be the first thing to fall elena continued the military right would get behind count vorinnis i suppose and square off with the anticentralization liberals the french speakers would want vorville the russian vortugalovor has he died yet the farright blowupthewormhole isolationist loonie faction would field count vortrifrani against the antivor progalactic faction who want a written constitution put in miles glumly and i do mean field count vortrifrani scares me elena shivered ive heard him speak its the suave way he mops the foam from his lips said miles the greek minorists would seize the moment to attempt secession stop it gregor who had propped his forehead on his hands said from behind the barrier of his arms i thought that was your job said elena tartly at his bleak look raising his head she softened her mouth twisting up too bad i cant offer you a job with the fleet we can always use formallytrained officers to train the rest if nothing else a mercenary said gregor theres a thought oh sure a lot of our people are former regular military folk some are even legitimately discharged fantasy lit gregors eye with brief amusement he sighted down his greyandwhite jacket sleeve if only you were in charge here aye miles no miles cried in a suffused voice the light died it was a joke not funny miles breathed carefully praying it would not occur to gregor to make that an order anyway were now trying to make it to the barrayaran consul on vervain station its still there i hope i havent heard news for dayswhats going on with the vervani as far as i know its business as usual except for the heightened paranoia said elena vervains putting its resources into ships not stations makes sense when youve got more than one wormlike to guard miles conceded but it makes aslund perceive the vervani as potential aggressors theres an aslunder faction thats actually urging a first strike before the new vervani fleet comes online fortunately the defensive strategists have prevailed so far oser has set the price for a strike by us prohibitively high hes not stupid he knows the aslunders couldnt back us up vervain hired a mercenary fleet as a stopgap tooin fact thats what gave the aslunders the idea to hire us theyre called randalls rangers though i understand randall is no more we shall avoid them miles asserted fervently i hear their new second officer is a barrayaran you might be able to swing some help there gregors brows rose in speculation one of illyans plants sounds like his work was that where ungari had gone approach with caution anyway miles allowed about time gregor commented under his breath the rangers commanders name is cavilo what yelped miles elenas winged brows rose just cavilo nobody seems to know if its the given or surname cavilo is the person who tried to buy meor victor rothaat the consortium station for twenty thousand betan dollars elenas brows stayed up why i dont know why miles rethought their goal pol the censortium aslund no it still came up vervain but we definitely avoid the vervanis meres we step off the ship and go straight to the consul go to ground and dont even squeak till illyans men arrive to take us home momma right gregor sighed right no more playing secret agent his best efforts had only served to get gregor nearly murdered it was time to try less hard miles decided strange said gregor looking at elenaat the new elena guessedto think youve had more combat experience than either of us than both of you elena corrected dryly yes well actual combat is a lot stupider than id imagined if two groups can cooperate to the incredible extent it takes to meet in battle why not put in a tenth that effort to talk thats not true of guerilla wars though elena went on thoughtfully a guerilla is an enemy who wont play the game makes more sense to me if youre going to be vile why not be totally vile that third contractif i ever get involved in another guerilla war i want to be on the side of the guerillas harder to make peace between totally vile enemies miles reflected war is not its own end except in some catastrophic slide into absolute damnation its peace thats wanted some better peace than the one you started with whoever can be the most vile longest wins gregor posited not historically true i dont think if what you do during the war so degrades you that the next peace is worse human noises from the cargo bay froze miles in midsentence but it was tung and mayhew returning come on tung urged if arde doesnt keep to schedule hell draw attention they filed into the cargo hold where mayhew held the control leash of a float pallet with a couple of plastic packing crates attached your friend can pass as a fleet soldier tung told miles for you i found a box it would have been classier to roll you up in a carpet but since the freighter captain is male im afraid the historical reference would be wasted dubiously miles regarded the box it seemed to lack air holes where are you taking me we have a regular irregular arrangement for getting fleet intelligence officers in and out quietly got this innersystem freighter captain an independent ownerhes vervani but hes been on the payroll three times before hell take you across get you through vervani customs after that youre on your own how much danger is this arrangement to you all miles worried not a lot said tung all things considered hell think hes delivering more mercenary agents for a price and naturally keep his mouth shut itll be days before he gets back to even be questioned i arranged it all myself elena and arde didnt appear so he cant give them away thank you miles said quietly tung nodded and sighed if only youd stayed on with us what a soldier i couldve made of you these last three years if you do find yourselves out of a job as a consequence of helping us gregor added elena will know how to put you in touch tung grimaced in touch with what eh better not to know said elena helping miles position himself in the packing crate all right grumbled tung but all right miles found himself face to face with elena for the last time tillwhen she hugged him but then gave gregor an identical sisterly embrace give my love to your mother she told miles i often think of her right uh give my best to baz tell him its all right your personal safety comes first yours and his the dendarii are are were he could not quite bring himself to say not important or a naive dream or an illusion though that last came closest a good try he finished lamely the look she gave him was cool edged indecipherableno readily decodable he feared idiot or stronger words to that effect he sat down his head to his knees and let mayhew affix the lid feeling like a zoological specimen being crated for shipment to the lab the transfer went smoothly miles and gregor found themselves installed in a small but decent cabin designed for the freighters occasional supercargo the ship undocked free of aslund station and danger of discovery some three hours after they boarded no oseran search parties no uproars tung miles had to admit still did good work miles was intensely grateful for a wash a chance to clean his remaining clothes a real meal and sleep in safety the ships tiny crew seemed allergic to their corridor he and gregor were left strictly alone safe for three days as he chugged across the hegen hub yet again in yet another identity next stop the barrayaran consulate of vervain station oh god he was going to have to write a report on all this when they got there true confessions in the approved impsec official style dry as dust judging from samples hed read ungari now given the same tour would have produced columns of concrete objective data all ready to be reanalyzed six different ways what had miles counted nothing i was in a box he had little to offer but gut feel based on a limited view snatched while dodging what seemed every security goon in the system maybe he should center his report on the security forces eh one ensigns opinion the general staff would be so impressed so what was his opinion by now well pol didnt seem to be the source of the troubles in the hegen hub they were reacting not acting the consortium seemed supremely uninterested in military adventures the only party weak enough for the eclectic jacksonians to take on and beat was aslund and there would be little profit in conquering aslund a barely terraformed agricultural world aslund was paranoid enough to be dangerous but only halfprepared and shielded by a mercenary force waiting only the right spark to itself split into warring factions no sustained threat there the action the energy for this destabilization by elimination must be coming from or via vervain how could one find out no hed sworn off secret agenting vervain was somebody elses problem miles wondered wanly if he could persuade gregor to give him an imperial pardon from writing a report and if illyan would accept it probably not gregor was very quiet miles stretched out on his bunk tucked his hands behind his head and smiled to conceal worry as gregor somewhat regretfully it seemed to milesput aside his stolen dendarii uniform and donned civilian clothes contributed by arde mayhew the shabby trousers shirt and jacket hung a little short and loose on gregors spare frame so dressed he seemed a downonhisluck drifter with hollow eyes miles secretly resolved to keep him away from high places gregor regarded him back you were weird as admiral naismith you know almost like a different person miles shrugged himself up onto one elbow i guess naismith is me with no brakes no constraints he doesnt have to be a good little vor or any kind of a vor he doesnt have a problem with subordination he isnt subordinate to anyone i noticed gregor ordered the dendarii uniform in barrayaran regulation folds do you regret having to duck out on the dendarii yes no i dont know deeply the chain of command it seemed pulled both ways on a middle link pull hard enough and that link must twist and snap i trust you dont regret escaping contract slavery no it wasnt what id pictured it was peculiar that fight at the airlock though total strangers wanting to kill me without even who i was total strangers trying to kill the emperor of barrayar i can understand this im going to have to think about this one miles allowed himself a brief crooked grin like being loved for yourself only different gregor gave him a sharp glance it was strange to see elena again too botharis dutiful daughter shes changed id meant her to miles avowed she seems quite attached to her deserter husband yes miles said shortly had you meant that too not mine to choose lt follows logically from the integrity of her character i might have foreseen it since her convictions about loyalty just saved both our lives i can hardly hardly regret them eh gregors brow rose an oblique gloss miles bit down irritation anyway i hope shell be all right osers proved himself dangerous she and baz seem to be protected only by tungs admittedly eroding power base im surprised you didnt take up tungs offer gregor grinned as briefly as miles had instant admiralty skip all those tedious barrayaran intervening steps tungs offer miles snorted didnt you hear him i thought you said dad made you read all those treaties tung didnt offer command he offered a fight at five to one odds against he sought an ally frontman or cannonfodder not a boss oh hm gregor settled back on his bunk thats so yet i still wonder if youd have chosen something other than this prudent retreat if i hadnt been along his lids were hooded over a sharp glance miles choked on visions a sufficiently liberal interpretation of illyans vague use ensign vorkosigan to clear the dendarii mercenaries from the hub might be stretched to include no no if i hadnt run into you id be on my way to escobar with sergeantnanny overholt you i suppose would still be installing lights depending of course on what the mysterious cavilocommander cavilohad planned for miles once hed caught up with him at consortium detention so where was overholt by now had he reported to hq tried to contact ungari been picked off by cavilo or followed miles too bad miles couldnt have followed overholt to ungarino that was circular reasoning it was all very weird and they were well out of it were well out of it miles opined to gregor gregor rubbed the pale grey mark on his face fading shadow of his shockstick encounter yeah probably i was getting good at the lights though almost over miles thought as he and gregor followed the freighter captain through the hatch tube into the vervain station docking bay well maybe not quite the vervani captain was nervous obsequious clearly tense still if the man had managed this spy transfer three times before he should know what he was doing by now the docking bay with its harsh lighting was the usual chilly echoing cavern arranged to the rigid gridpattern taste of robots not human curves it was in fact empty of humans its machinery silent their path had been cleared before them miles supposed though if hed been doing it hed have picked the busiest chaotic period of loading or unloading to slip something past the captains eyes darted from corner to corner miles could not help following his glance they stopped near a deserted control booth we wait here the freighter captain said there are some men coming who will take you the rest of the way he leaned against the booth wall and kicked it gently with one heel in an idle compulsive rhythm for several minutes then he stopped kicking and straightened head turning footsteps half a dozen men emerged from a nearby corridor miles stiffened uniformed men with an officer judging by their posture but they werent wearing the garb of either vervani civil or military security unfamiliar shortsleeved tan fatigues with black tabs and trim and short black boots they carried stunners drawn and ready but if it walks like an arrest squad and talks like an arrest squad and quacks like an arrest squad miles muttered gregor doubtfully talking in the same cues is this in the script the stunners were pointed their way now hes pulled this off three times miles offered in unfelt reassurance why not a fourth the freighter captain smiled thinly and stepped away from the wall out of the line of fire i pulled it off twice he informed them the third time i got caught miless hands twitched he held them carefully away from his sides biting back swear words slowly gregor raised his hands as well face wonderfully blank score one for gregors selfcontrol as always the one virtue his constrained life had surely inculcated tung had set this up all by himself had tung known sold by tung no tung said you were reliable miles grated to the freighter captain whats tung to me the man snarled back i have a family mister under the stunners aim twogod goons againsoldiers stepped forward to lean miles and gregor hands to the wall and shake them down relieving them of all their hardwon oseran weapons equipment and multiple ids the officer examined the cache yeah these are osers men all right he spoke into his wrist comm we have them carry on a thin voice returned well be right down cavilo out randalls rangers evidently hence the unfamiliar uniforms but why no vervani in sight pardon me miles said mildly to the officer but are you people acting under the misapprehension we are aslunder agents the officer stared down at him and snorted i wonder if it might not be time to establish our real identity gregor murmured tentatively to miles interesting dilemma miles returned out of the corner of his mouth we better find out if they shoot spies a brisk tapping of boots heralded a new arrival the squad braced as the sound rounded the corner gregor came to attention too in automatic military courtesy his straightness looking very strange hung about with arde mayhews clothes miles no doubt looked least military of all with his mouth gaping open in shock he closed it before something flew in such as his foot five feet tall and a bit added by black books with higherthanregulation heels cropped blonde hair like a dandelion aureole on that sculptured head crisp tanandblack rankgilded uniform that fit her body language in perfect complement livia nu the officer saluted commander cavilo maam very good lieutenant her blue eyes falling on miles widened in unfeigned surprise instantly covered why victor dahling her voice went syrupy with exaggerated amusement and delight fancy meeting you here still selling miracle suits to the unwitting miles spread his empty hands this is the totality of me maam you should have bought when you could i wonder her smile was tight and speculative miles found glitter in her eyes disturbing gregor silent looked frantically bewildered so your name wasnt livia nu and you werent a procurement agent so why the devil was the commandant of vervains mercenary force meeting incognito on pol station with a representative of the most powerful house of the jacksonian consortium that was no mere arms deal darling cavilolivia nu raised her wrist comm to her lips sickbay kurin s hand cavilo here im sending you up a couple of prisoners for questioning i may sit in on this one myself she keyed off the freighter captain stepped forward halffearful halfpugnacious my wife and son now you prove theyre safe judiciously she looked him over you may be good for another run all right she gestured to a soldier take this man to the kurins brig and let him have a look on the monitors then bring him back to me youre a fortunate traitor captain i have another job for you by which you may earn them their freedom the freighter captain demanded she frowned slightly at the interruption why should i inflate your salary another week of life he trailed off after the soldier hands clenched angrily teeth clenched prudently what the hell miles thought he didnt know much about vervain but he was pretty sure not even their martial law made provisions for holding innocent relatives hostage against the good behavior of unconvicted traitors the freighter captain gone cavilo keyed her wristcom again kurins hand security ah good im sending you my pet double agent run the recording we made last week of cell six for his motivation aye dont let him know its not realtime right cavilo out so was the mans family free already dead being held elsewhere what were they getting into here more boots rounded the corner a heavy regulation tread cavilo smiled sourly but smoothed the expression into something sweeter as she turned to greet the newcomer stanis darling look what we netted this time its that little renegade betan who was trying to deal stolen arms on pol station it appears he isnt an independent after all the tan and black rangers uniform looked just fine on general too miles noted crazily now would be a wonderful time to roll up his eyes and pass out if only he had the trick of it general metzov stood equally riveted his irongrey eyes ablaze sudden unholy joy hes no betan cavie hes a barrayaran and not just any barrayaran weve got to get him out of sight quickly metzov went on who sent him then cavilo stared anew at miles her lip in a dubious curl god metzov avowed fervently god has delivered him into my hand metzov that cheerful was an unusual and alarming sight even cavilo raised her brow metzov glanced at gregor for the first time well take him and his bodyguard i suppose metzov slowed the pictures on the marknotes didnt look much like gregory being several years out of date but the emperor had appeared in enough vidcastsnot dressed like this of course miles could almost see metzov thinking the face is familiar just cant place the name maybe he wouldnt recognize gregor maybe he wouldnt believe it gregor drawn up in a dignity concealing dismay spoke for the first time is this yet another of your old friends miles it was the measured cultured voice that triggered the connection metzovs face reddened with excitement drained white he looked around involuntarilyfor illyan miles guessed uh this is general stanis metzov miles explained the kyril island metzov yeah oh gregor maintained his closed reserve nearly expressionless where is your security sir metzov demanded of gregor his voice harsh with unacknowledged fear youre looking at it miles mourned not far behind i imagine gregor essayed cool let us go our way and they will not trouble you who is this fellow cavilo tapped a boot impatiently what miles couldnt help asking metzov what are you doing here metzov went grim how shall a man my age stripped of his imperial pensionhis life savingslive did you hope i would sit down and quietly starve not i inopportune to remind metzov of his grudge miles realized this looks like an improvement over kyril island miles suggested hopefully his mind still boggled metzov working under a woman the internal dynamics of this command chain must be fascinating stanis darling metzov did not look amused who are they cavilo demanded again power money strategic leverage more than you can imagine metzov answered trouble miles put in more than you can imagine you are a separate matter mutant metzov said i beg to differ general said gregor in his best imperial tones feeling for footing in this floating conversation though concealing his confusion well we must take them to the kurins hand at once out of sight said metzov to cavilo he glanced at the arrest squad out of hearing well continue this in private they marched off escorted by the patrol metzovs gaze felt like a knife blade in miless back prodding and probing they passed through several deserted docking bays till they arrived at a major one actively servicing a ship the command ship judging by the number and formality of duty guards take them to medical for questioning cavilo ordered the squad as they were saluted through a personnel hatch by the officer in charge hold on that said metzov he stared around the crosscorridors almost jittering do you have a guard whos deaf and mute hardly cavilo stared indignantly at her mysteriously agitated subordinate to the brig then no said metzov sharply hesitating to throw the emperor into a cell miles realized metzov turned to gregor and said with perfect seriousness may i have your parole siresir what cried cavilo have you stripped a gear stanis a parole gregor noted gravely is a promise given between honorable enemies your honor i am willing to assume but are you thus declaring yourself our enemy excellent bit of weaseling miles approved metzovs eye fell on miles his lips thinned perhaps not yours but you have a poor choice of favorites not to mention advisors gregor was now very hard to read some acquaintances are imposed on me also some advisors to my cabin metzov held up his hand as cavilo opened her mouth to object for now for our initial conversation without witnesses or security recordings after that we decide cavie cavilo eyes narrowing closed her mouth all right stanis lead off her hand curved open ironically and gestured them onward metzov posted two guards outside his cabin door and dismissed the rest when the door had sealed behind them he tied miles with a tanglecord and sat him on the floor with helplessly ingrained deference he then seated gregor in the padded station chair at his cornconsole desk the best the spartan chamber had to offer cavilo seated crosslegged on the bed watching the play objected to the logic of this why tie up the little one and leave the big one loose keep your stunner drawn then if he worries you metzov advised breathing heavily he stood hands on hips and studied gregor he shook his head as if still not believing his eyes why not your stunner i have not yet decided whether to draw a weapon in his presence were alone now stanis cavilo said in a sarcastic lilt would you kindly explain this insanity and it had better be good oh yes that he pointed to miles is lord miles vorkosigan the son of the prime minister of barrayar admiral aral vorkosigani trust youve heard of him cavilos brows lowered what was he doing on pol six in the guise of a betan gunrunner then im not sure the last id heard he was under arrest by imperial security though of course no one believed they were serious about it detainment miles corrected technically and he metzov swung to point to gregor is the emperor of barrayar gregor vorbarra what hes doing here i cannot imagine are you sure even cavilo was taken aback at metzovs stern nod her eye lit with speculation she looked at gregor as if for the first time really how interesting but where is his security we must tread very cautiously cavie whats he worth to them or for that matter to the highest bidder gregor smiled at her im vor maam in a sense the vor risk in service is the vorish trade i wouldnt assume my value was infinite if i were you gregors complaint had some truth to it miles thought when he wasnt being emperor he seemed hardly anyone at all but he sure did the role well an opportunity yes said metzov but if we create an enemy we cant handle if we hold him hostage we ought to be able to handle them with ease cavilo commented thoughtfully an alternate and more prudent course miles interjected would be to help us swiftly and safely on our way and collect a lucrative and honorable thankyou an as it were winwin strategy honorable metzovs eyes burned he fell into a brooding silence then muttered but what are they doing here and wheres the snake illyan i want the mutant in any case damn it must be played boldly or not at all he stared malignantly at miles vorkosigan so and what is barrayar to me now a service that stabbed me in the back after thirtyfive years he straightened decisively but still did not miles noticed draw a weapon in the emperors presence yes take them to the brig cavie not so fast said cavilo looking newly pensive send the little one to the brig if you like hes nothing you say the only son of the most powerful military leader on barrayar kept his mouth shut for a change if if if by comparison metzov temporized looking suddenly fearful of being cheated of his prey very well cavilo slid her stunner which she had stopped aiming and started playing with some time back soundlessly into her holster she moved to unseal the door and beckon to the guards put him she gestured to gregor in cabin nine g deck cut the outgoing comm lock the door and post a guard with a stunner but supply him with any reasonable comfort he may request she added aside to gregor its the most comfortable visiting officers quarters the kurins hand can supply ah call me greg gregor sighed greg nice name cabin nine is next to my own we will continue this conversation shortly after you ah freshen up perhaps over dinner oversee his arrival there will you stanis she favored both men with an impartial glittering smile and wafted out a neat trick in boots she stuck her head back in and indicated miles bring him along to the brig miles was removed by the second guard with a wave of a stunner and the prod of a blessedly inactivated shockstick to follow in her wake the kurins hand judging from his passing glimpses was a much larger command ship than the triumph able to field bigger and punchier combat drop or boarding forces but correspondingly sluggish in maneuver its brig was larger too miles discovered shortly and more formidably secured a single entrance opened onto an elaborate guard monitor station from which led two deadend cell bays the freighter captain was just leaving the guard station under the watchful eye of the squadman detailed to escort him he exchanged a hostile look with cavilo as you see they remain in good health cavilo said to him my half of the bargain captain see that you continue to complete your own part lets see what happens you saw a recording miles piped up demand to see em in the flesh cavilos white teeth clenched rigidly but her annoyed grimace melted seamlessly into a vulpine smile as the freighter captain jerked around what you he planted himself mulishly all right which of you is lying captain thats all the guarantee you get said cavilo gesturing to the monitors you chose to gamble gamble you shall then that he pointed to miles is the last result you get a subtle hand motion down by her trouser seam brought the guards to the alert stunners drawn take him out she ordered no very well her eyes widened in exasperation take him to cell six and lock him in as the freighter captain turned torn between resistance and eagerness cavilo motioned the guard to open distance from his prisoner he fell away brows rising in question cavilo glanced at miles and smiled very sourly as if to say all right smartass watch me in a cold smooth motion cavilo flipped open her left side holster seal brought up a nerve disrupter took careful aim and fried the back of the captains head he convulsed once and dropped dead before he hit the deck she walked over and pensively prodded the body with the pointed toe of her boot then glanced up at miles whose jaw was gaping open you will keep your mouth shut next time wont you little man miless mouth shut with a snap you had to experiment at least now he knew whod killed liga the rabbity polians reported death seemed suddenly real and vivid the exalted look flashing over cavilos face as she blew the freighter captain away fascinated even as it horrified miles who did you really see in your gunsights darling yes maam he choked trying to conceal his shakes delayed reaction to this shocking turn damn his tongue she stepped down to the security monitoring station and spoke to the tech atfrozen ather post unload the recording of general metzovs cabin that includes the last halfhour and give it to me start a fresh one no dont play it back she placed the disk in a breast pocket and carefully sealed the flap put this one in cell fourteen she nodded toward miles or ahif its empty make that cell thirteen her teeth bared briefly the guards researched miles and took id scans cavilo blandly informed them that his name should be entered as victor rotha as he was pulled to his feet two men with medical insignia arrived with a floatpallet to remove the body cavilo watching without expression now remarked tiredly to miles you chose to damage my doubleagents utility a vandals prank he had better uses than as an objectlesson for a fool i do not warehouse nonuseful items i suggest you start thinking of how you can make yourself more useful to me than as merely general metzovs catnip toy she smiled faintly into some invisible distance though he does jump for you doesnt he i shall have to explore that motivation what is the use of stanisdarling to you miles dared pigheadeddefiant in his wash of angry guilt metzov as her paramour revolting thought hes an experienced ground combat commander whats a fleet on allspace wormhole guard duty want with a ground commander well then she smiled sweetly he amuses me that was supposed to have been the first answer no accounting for taste miles muttered inanely careful not to be heard should he warn her about metzov on second thought should he warn metzov about her his head was still spinning with this new dilemma when the blank door of his solitary cell sealed him in it didnt take long for miles to exhaust the novelties of his new quarters a space a little larger than two by two meters furnished only with two padded benches and a foldout lavatory no library viewer no relief from the wheel of his thoughts mired in the quag of his selfrecriminations a ranger fieldration bar inserted some time later through a forceshielded aperture in the door proved even more repellent than the barrayaran imperial version resembling a rawhide dog chew wetted with spit it softened slightly enough to tear off gummy shreds if your teeth were in good health more than a temporary distraction it promised to last till the next issue probably nutritious as hell miles wondered what cavilo was serving gregor for dinner was it as scientifically vitaminbalanced theyd been so close to their goal even now the barrayaran consulate was only a few locks and levels away less than a kilometer if only he could get there from here if a chance came on the other hand how long would cavilo hesitate to disregard diplomatic custom and violate the consulate if she saw some utility in it about as long as shed hesitated to shoot the freighter captain in the back miles gauged she would surely have ordered the consulate and all known barrayaran agents on vervain station watched by now miles unstuck his teeth from a fragment of rationleather and hissed a beeping from the codelock warned miles he was about to have a visitor interrogation so soon hed expected cavilo to wine dine and evaluate gregor first then get back to him or was he to be amere project for underlings he swallowed throat tight on a ration blob and sat up trying to look stern and not scared the door slid back to reveal general metzov still looking highly military and efficient in the tan and black ranger fatigues sure you dont need me sir the guard at his elbow asked as metzov shouldered through the opening metzov glanced contemptuously at miles looking low and unmilitary in victor rothas now limp and grimy green silk shirt baggy trousers and bare feetthe processing guards had taken his sandals hardly hes not going to jump me damn straight miles agreed with regret metzov tapped his wrist comm ill call you when im done very well sir the door sighed closed the cell seemed suddenly very tiny indeed miles drew his legs up sitting in a small defensive ball on his pallet metzov stood at ease contemplating miles for a long satisfied moment then settled himself comfortably on the bench opposite well well said metzov his mouth twisting what a turn of fate i thought youd be dining with the emperor said miles commander cavilo being female can get a little scattered under stress when she calms down again shell see the need for my expertise in barrayaran matters said metzov in measured tones in other words you werent invited you left the emperor alone with her gregor watch your step gregors no threat i fear his upbringing has made him altogether weak miles choked metzov sat back allowed his fingers to tap gently on his knee so tell me ensign vorkosiganif it is still ensign vorkosigan there being no justice in the world i suppose youve retained your rank and pay what are you doing here with him miles was tempted to confine himself to name rank and serial number except metzov knew all those already was metzov an enemy exactly of barrayar that is not of miles personally did metzov divide the two in his own mind the emperor became separated from his security we hoped to regain contact with them via the barrayaran consulate here there nothing in that that wasnt perfectly obvious and where did you come from aslund dont bother playing the idiot vorkosigan i know aslund who sent you there in the first place and dont bother lying i can crossquestion the freighter captain no you cant cavilo killed him oh a flicker of surprise suppressed clever of her he was the only witness to know where you went had that been part of cavilos calculation when shed raised her nerve disrupter probably and yet the freighter captain was also the only corroborating witness who knew where theyd come from maybe cavilo was not so formidable as she seemed at first glance again metzov said patientlymiles could see he felt he had all the time in the worldhow did you come to be in the emperors company how do you think miles countered buying time some plot of course metzov shrugged miles groaned oh of course he uncurled in his indignation and what saneor insane for that matterchain of conspiracy do you imagine accounts for our arrival here alone from aslund i mean i know what it really was i lived it but what does it look like to a professional paranoid that is id just love to hear it well metzov was drawn out in spite of himself you have somehow separated the emperor from his security you must either be setting up an elaborate assassination or planning to implement some form of personalitycontrol thats what just springs to mind huh miles thumped his back against the wall with a frustrated growl and slumped or perhaps youre on some secretand therefore dishonorable diplomatic mission some sellout if so wheres gregors security miles sang better watch out so my first hypothesis is proved in that case wheres my security miles snarled where indeed a vorkosigan plotno perhaps not the admirals he controls gregor at home thank you i was about to point that out a twisted plot from a twisted mind do you dream of making yourself emperor of barrayar mutant a nightmare i assure you ask gregor it scarcely matters the medical staff will squeeze out your secrets as soon as cavilo gives the goahead in a way its a shame fastpente was ever invented id enjoy breaking every bone in your body till you talked or screamed you wont be able to hide behind your fathers he grinned briefly skirts out here vorkosigan he grew thoughtful maybe i will anyway one bone a day for as long as they last bones in the human body days illyan ought to be able to catch up with us in days miles smiled bleakly metzov looked too comfortable to arise and initiate this plan immediately though this speculative conversation scarcely constituted serious interrogation but if not for interrogation nor revengetortures why was the man here i his lover threw him out he felt lonely and strange and someone familiar to talk to even a familiar enemy it was was understandable but for the komarr invasion metzov had probably never set foot off barrayar in his life a life spent mostly in the constrained ordered predictable worldwithinaworld of the imperial military now the rigid man was adrift and faced with more freewill choices than hed ever imagined god the maniacs homesick chilling insight im beginning to think i may have accidentally done you a good turn miles began if metzov was in a talking mood why not encourage him cavilos certainly betterlooking than your last commander she is that is the pay higher everyone pays more than the imperial service metzov snorted not boring either on kyril island every day was like every other day here you dont know whats going to happen next or does she confide in you im essential to her plans metzov practically smirked as a bedroom warrior thought you were infantry switching specialties at your age metzov merely smiled now youre getting obvious vorkosigan miles shrugged if so im the only obvious thing here as i recall you didnt think much of women soldiers cavilo seems to have made you change your tune not at all metzov sat back smugly i expect to be in command of randalls rangers in six months isnt this cell monitored miles asked startled not that he cared how much trouble metzovs mouth bought him but still not at present cavilo planning to retire is she there are a number of ways her retirement might be expedited the fatal accident cavilo arranged for randall might easily be repeated or i might even work out a way to charge her with it since she was stupid enough to brag about murder in bed that was no boast that was a warning dunderhead miless eyes nearly crossed imagining pillowtalk between metzov and cavilo you two must have a lot in common no wonder you get on so well metzovs amusement thinned i have nothing in common with that mercenary slut i was an imperial officer metzov glowered thirtyfive years and they wasted me well theyll discover their mistake metzov glanced at his chrono i still dont understand your presence here are you sure there isnt something else you want to say to me now privately before you say everything tomorrow to cavilo under fastpenta cavilo and metzov miles decided had set up the old interrogation game of goodguybadguy except theyd gotten their signals mixed and both accidentally taken the part of badguy if you really want to be helpful get gregor to the barrayaran consul or even just get out a message that hes here in good time we may given suitable terms metzovs eyes were narrowed studying miles as puzzled by miles as miles by him after a stretched silence metzov called the guard on his wristcom and withdrew with no more violent parting threat than see you tomorrow vorkosigan sinister enough i dont understand your presence here either miles thought as the door hissed closed and the lock beeped clearly some kind of planetary groundattack was in the planning stage were randalls rangers to spearhead a vervani invasion force cavilo had met secretly with a highranking jacksons consortium representative why to guarantee consortium neutrality during the coming attack that made excellent sense but why hadnt the vervani dealt directly so they could disavow cavilos arrangements if the balloon went up too early and who or what was the target not the consortium station obviously nor its distant parent jacksons whole that left aslund and pol aslund a culdesac was not strategically tempting better to take pol first cut aslund off from the hub with consortium cooperation and mop up the weak planet at leisure but pol had barrayar behind it who would like nothing better than an alliance with its nervous neighbor that would give the imperium a toehold in the hegen hub an open attack must drive pol into barrayars waiting arms that left aslund but this makes no sense it was almost more disturbing than the thought of gregor supping unguarded with cavilo or the fear of the promised chemical interrogation im not seeing something this makes no sense the hegen hub turned in his head in all its strategic complexity all the lightdimmed night cycle the hub and pictures of gregor was cavilo feeding him mindaltering drugs doggie chews like miless steak and champagne was gregor being tortured being seduced visions of cavilolivia nus dramatic red eveningwear undulated in miless minds eye was gregor having a wonderful time miles thought gregord had little more experience with women than he had but hed been out of touch with the emperor these last few years for all he knew gregor was keeping a harem now no that couldnt be or ivan would have picked up the scent and commented at length how susceptible was gregor to a very oldfashioned form of mindcontrol the daycycle crept by with miles anticipating every moment being taken out for his very first experience of fastpenta interrogation from the wrong end of the hypospray what would cavilo and metzov make of the bizarre truth of his and gregors odyssey three rationchews arrived at interminable intervals and the lights dimmed again marking another shipnight three meals and no interrogation what was keeping them out there no noises or subtle gravitic vibrations suggested the ship had left dock they were still locked to vervain station miles tried to exercise himself weary pacing two steps turn two steps turn two steps but merely succeeded in increasing his personal stink and making himself dizzy another day writhed by and another lightdimmed night another breakfast chew fell through onto the floor were they artificially stretching or compressing time confusing his biological clock to soften him up for interrogation why bother he bit his fingernails he bit his toenails he pulled tiny green threads from his shirt and tried flossing his teeth then he tried making little green designs with tiny tiny knots then he hit on the idea of weaving messages could he macrame help i am a prisoner and plant it on the back of someones jacket by static charge if someone ever came back that is he got as far as a delicate gossamer h e l caught the thread on a hangnail while rubbing his stubbled chin and reduced his plea to an illegible green wad he pulled another thread and started over the lock twinkled and beeped miles snapped alert realizing only then that he had fallen into an almost hypnotic fugue in his mumbling isolation how much time had passed his visitor was cavilo crisp and businesslike in her rangers fatigues a guard took up station just outside the cell door which closed behind her another private chat it seemed miles struggled to pull his thoughts together to remember what he was about cavilo settled herself opposite miles in the same spot metzov had chosen in somewhat the same leisurely posture leaning forward hands clasped loosely on her knees attentive assured miles sat crosslegged back to the wall feeling distinctly at the disadvantage lord vorkosigan ah she cocked her head interrupting herself aside you dont look at all well solitary confinement doesnt suit me his disused voice came out raspy and he had to stop and clear his throat perhaps a library viewer his brain grated into gearor better an exercise period which would get him out of this cell and in contact with subornable humans my medical problems compel me to a selfdisciplined lifestyle if theyre not to flare up and impede me i definitely need an exercise period or im going to get really sick hm well see she ran a hand through her short hair and refocused so lord vorkosigan tell me about your mother huh a most dizzying sharp left turn for a military interrogation why she smiled ingratiatingly gregs tales have interested me gregs tales had the emperor been fastpentad what do you want to know well i understand countess vorkosigan is an offworlder a betan who married into your aristocracy the vor are a military caste but yes how was she received by the powerclasswhatever they choose to call themselves id thought barrayarans were totally provincial prejudiced against offworlders we are miles admitted cheerfully the first contact most barrayaransof all classeshad with offworlders after the end of the time of isolation when barrayar was rediscovered was with the cetagandan invasion forces they left a bad impression that lingers even now three four generations after we threw them off yet no one questioned your fathers choice miles jerked up his chin in bafflement he was in his forties and and he was lord vorkosigan so am i now why doesnt it work for me like that her background made no difference she was betan is betan in the astronomical survey first but then a combat officer beta colony had just helped beat us soundly in that stupid attempt we made to invade escobar so despite being an enemy her military background actually helped gain her respect and acceptance among the vor i guess so plus she established quite a local military reputation in the fighting of vordarians pretendership the year i was born twice led loyal troops oh several times when my father couldnt be two places at once and had been personally responsible for the fiveyearold emperorinhidings safety more successfully than her son was doing so far for the twentyfiveyearold gregor total screwup was the phrase that sprang to mind actually nobodys messed with her since hm cavilo sat back murmuring half to herself so it has been done therefore it can be done what what can be done miles rubbed a hand over his face trying to wake up and concentrate how is gregor quite amusing gregor the lugubrious amusing but then if it matched the rest of her personality cavilos sense of humor was probably vile i meant his health rather better than yours from the look of you i trust hes been better fed what a taste of real military life too strong for you lord vorkosigan youve been fed the same as my troops cant be miles held up a ragged halfgnawed breakfast chew theyd have mutinied by now oh dear she regarded the repellent morsel with a sympathetic frown those i thought theyd been condemned how did they end up here someone must be economizing shall i order you a regular menu yes thank you said miles immediately and paused she had neatly misdirected his attention from gregor to himself he must keep his mind on the emperor how much useful information had gregor spilled by now you realize miles said carefully you are creating a massive interplanetary incident between vervain and barrayar not at all said cavilo reasonably im gregs friend ive rescued him from falling into the hands of the vervani secret police hes now under my protection until the opportunity arises to restore him to his rightful place miles blinked do the vervani have a secret police as such close enough cavilo shrugged barrayar of course definitely does stanis seems quite worried about them they must be very embarrassed back in impsec to have so thoroughly mislaid their charge i fear their reputation is exaggerated not quite im impsec and i know where gregor is so technically impsec is right on top of the situation miles wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry or right under it if were all such good friends said miles why am i locked in this cell for your protection too of course after all general metzov has openly threatened to ahwhat was itbreak every bone in your body she sighed im afraid dear stanis is about to lose his utility miles blanched remembering what else metzov had said in that conversation for disloyalty not at all disloyalty can be very useful at times under proper management but the overall strategic situation may be about to change drastically unimaginably and after all the time i wasted cultivating him too i hope all barrayarans are not so tedious as stanis she smiled briefly i very much hope it she leaned forward growing more intent is it true that gregor ah ran away from home to evade pressure from his advisors to marry a woman he loathed he hadnt mentioned it to me said miles startled waitwhat was gregor about out there hed better be careful not to step on his lines though there is concern if he were to die without an heir any time soon many fear a factional struggle would follow he has no heir the factions cant agree except on gregor so his advisors would be glad to see him marry overjoyed i expect uh miless unease at this turn of the conversation bloomed into sudden light like the flash before the shockwave commander caviloyoure not imagining you could make yourself empress of barrayar are you her smile grew sharp of course i couldnt but greg could she straightened evidently annoyed by miless stunned expression why not im the right sex and apparently of the right military background how old are you lord vorkosigan really what a rude question her blue eyes glinted if we were on the same side we could work together commander cavilo i dont think you understand barrayar or barrayarans actually thered been eras in barrayaran history where cavilos command style would have fit right in mad emperor yuris reign of terror for example but theyd spent the last twenty years trying to get away from all that i need your cooperation cavilo said or at any rate it could be very useful to both of us your neutrality would be tolerable your active opposition however would be a problem for you but we should avoid getting caught in negative attitude traps at this early stage i think whatever did happen to that freighter captains wife and child widow and orphan rather miles inquired through his teeth cavilo hesitated fractionally the man was a traitor of the worst sort sold out his planet for money he was caught in an act of espionage there is no moral difference between ordering an execution and carrying it out i agree so do a lot of legal codes how about a difference between execution and murder vervain is not at war his actions may have been illegal warranting arrest trial jail or sociopath therapy where did the trial part drop out a barrayaran arguing legalities how strange and what happened to his family shed had a moment to think blast it the tedious vervani demanded their release naturally i didnt want him to know they were out of my hands or id lose my only hold on his actions at a distance lie or truth no way to tell but she backpedals from her mistake she let establishing her dominance through terror rule her reactions before she was sure of her ground because she was unsure of her ground i know the look that was on her face homicidal paranoids are as familiar as breakfast i had one for a bodyguard for seventeen years cavilo for a brief instant seemed homey and routine if no less dangerous but he should strive to appear convinced nonthreatening even if it made him gag its true he conceded its rank cowardice to give an order youre not willing to carry out yourself and youre no coward commander ill grant you that there that was the right tone persuadable but not changing his stance too suspiciously fast her brow rose sardonically as if to say who are you to judge but her tension eased slightly she glanced at her chrono and rose ill leave you now to think about the advantages of cooperation youre theoretically familiar with the mathematics of the prisoners dilemma i hope it will be an interesting test of your wits to see if you can connect theory with practice miles managed a weird return smile her beauty her energy even her flaring ego did exert a real fascination had gregor indeed been activated by cavilo gregor after all hadnt watched her raise her nerve disruptor and what weapon was a good impsec man to use in the face of this personal assault on gregor try and seduce her back to sacrifice himself for the emperor by flinging himself on cavilo had about as much appeal as bellysmothering a live sonic grenade besides he doubted he could work it the door slid closed eclipsing her scimitar smile too late he raised a hand to remind her other promise to change his rations but she remembered anyway lunch arrived on a trolley with an experienced if expressionless batman to serve it in five elegant courses with two wines and espresso coffee for an antidote miles didnt think cavilos troops ate like this either he envisioned a platoon of smiling replete obese gourmets strolling happily into battle the dog chews would be much more effective for raising aggression levels a chance remark to his waiter brought a package along with the next mealtrolley which proved to contain clean underwear a set of insignialess ranger fatigues cut down to his fit and a pair of soft felt slippers also a tube of depilatory and assorted toiletries miles was inspired to wash by sections in the foldout lavatory basin and shave before dressing he felt almost human ah the virtues of cooperation cavilo was not exactly subtle god where had she come from a mercenary veteran she had to have been around for a while to have risen this far even with shortcuts tung might know i think she must have lost bad at least once he wished tung were here now hell he wished illyan were here now her flamboyance miles increasingly felt was an effective act meant to be viewed at a distance like stage makeup to dazzle her troops at the right range it might work rather well like the popular barrayaran general of his grandfathers generation whod gained visibility by carrying a plasma rifle like a swagger stick usually uncharged miles had heard privatelythe man wasnt stupid or a vorish ensign who wore a certain antique dagger at every opportunity a trademark a banner a calculated bit of mass psychology cavilos public persona pushed the envelope of that strategy surely was she scared inside knowing herself for overextendedyou wish alas after a dose of cavilo one thought of cavilo fogging ones tactical calculations focus ensign had she forgotten victor rotha had gregor concocted some bullshit explanation to account for their pol station encounter gregor seemed to be feeding cavilo skewed factsor were they maybe there really was a loathed proposed bride and gregor had not trusted miles enough to mention it miles began to regret being quite so acerbic to gregor his thoughts were still running like a hypedup rat on an exercise wheel spinning to nowhere when the door codelock beeped again yes he would fake cooperation promise anything if only shed give him a chance to check on gregor cavilo appeared with a soldier in tow the man looked vaguely familiarone of the arresting goons no the man ducked his head through the cell door stared at miles a moment in bemusement and turned to cavilo yeah thats him all right admiral naismith of the tau verde ring war id recognize the little runt anywhere he added aside to miles what are you doing here sir miles mentally transmuted the mans tan and blacks to grey and white yeah thered been several thousand mercenaries involved in the tau verde war they all had to have gone somewhere thank you that will be all sergeant cavilo took the man by the arm and firmly pulled him away the noncoms fading advice drifted back down the cell bay you ought to try and hire him maam hes a military genius cavilo reappeared after a moment to stand in the aperture with her hands on her hips and her chin outthrust in exasperated disbelief how many people are you anyway miles opened his hands and smiled weakly just as hed been about to talk his way out of this hole huh she spun on her heel the closing door cutting off her sputter now what hed slam his fist into the wall in frustration but the wall was sure to slam back with greater devastation however all three of his identities were granted an exercise period that afternoon a small onboard gymnasium was cleared for his exclusive use he studied the setup sharply for the hour as he tried out various pieces of equipment checking distances and trajectories to guarded exits he could see a couple of ways ivan might succeed in jumping a guard and making a break for it not fragile shortlegged miles for a moment he found himself actually wishing he had ivan along on the way back to cell with his escort miles passed another prisoner being checked in at the guard station he was a shambling wildeyed man his blond hair damped to brown with sweat miless shock of recognition was the greater for the changes it had to encompass osers lieutenant the blandfaced killer was transformed he wore only grey trousers his torso was bare livid shockstick marks dappled his skin recent hypospray injection points marched like little pink paw prints up his arm he mumbled continuously through wet lips shivered and giggled just coming back from interrogation it seemed miles was so startled he reached over to grasp the mans left hand to checkyes there were his own scabbedover teeth marks across the knuckles souvenir of last weeks fight at the triumph s airlock across the system the silent lieutenant wasnt silent any more miless guards motioned him sternly along miles almost tripped staring back over his shoulder till the door of cell sighed shut imprisoning him once more what are you doing here that had to be the mostasked leastanswered question in the hegen hub miles decided though he bet the oseran lieutenant had answered itcavilo must command one of the sharpest counterintelligence departments in the hub how fast had the oseran mercenary traced miles and gregor here how soon had cavilos people spotted him and picked him up the marks on his body were not over a day old most important question of all had the oseran come to vervain station as part of a general systematic sweep or had he followed specific clueswas tung compromised elena arrested miles shuddered and paced frenetically helplessly have i just killed my friends so what oser knew cavilo now knew the whole silly mix of truth lies rumors and mistakes so the identification of miles as admiral naismith hadnt necessarily come from gregor as miles had first assumed the tau verde veteran had clearly been scrounged up as an unbiased crosscheck if gregor was systematically withholding information from her cavilo would now realize it if he was withholding anything maybe he was in love by now miless head throbbed feeling on the verge of exploding the guards came for him in the middle of the nightcycle and made him dress interrogation at last eh he thought of the drooling oseran and cringed he insisted on washing up and adjusted every burrseam and cuff of his ranger fatigues with slow deliberation till the guards began to shift impatiently and tap fingers suggestively on shock sticks he too would shortly be a drooling fool on the other hand what could he possibly say under fastpenta at this point that could make things worse cavilo had it all as far as he could tell he shrugged off the guards grasps and marched out of the brig between them with all the forlorn dignity he could muster they led him through the nightdimmed ship and exited a lifttube at something marked gdeck miles snapped alert gregor was supposed to be around here somewhere they arrived at an otherwiseblank cabin door marked a where the guards beeped the codelock for permission to enter the door slid aside cavilo sat at a comconsole desk a pool of light in the somber room making her blondwhite hair gleam and glow they had arrived at the commanders personal office apparently adjoining her quarters miles strained his eyes and ears for signs of the emperor cavilo was fullydressed in her neat fatigues at least miles wasnt the only one going short on sleep these days he fancied optimistically that she looked a little tired she placed a stunner out on her desk ominously ready to her right hand and dismissed the guards miles craned his neck looking for the hypospray she stretched and sat back the scent of her perfume a greener sharper less musky scent than shed worn as livia nu sublimated from her white skin and tickled miless nose he swallowed sit down lord vorkosigan he took the indicated chair and waited she watched him with calculating eyes the insides of his nostrils began to itch abominably he kept his hands down and still the first question of this interview would not catch him with his fingers shoved up his nose your emperor is in terrible trouble little vor lord to save him you must return to the oseran mercenaries and retake them when you are back in command we will communicate further instructions miles boggled danger from what he choked you not at all greg is my best friend the love of my life at last id do anything for him id even give up my career she smirked piously miless lip curled in repelled response she grinned if any other course of action occurs to you besides following your instructions to the letter well it could land greg in unimaginable troubles at the hands of worse enemies worse than you not possible is it why do you want me in charge of the dendarii mercenaries i cant tell you her eyes widened positively sparkling at her private ironic joke its a surprise what would you give me to support this enterprise transportation to aslund station what else troops guns ships money im told you could do it with your wits alone this i wish to see oser will kill me hes already tried once thats a chance i must take i really like that i lady you mean me to be killed miles deduced what if i succeed instead his eyes were starting to water he sniffed he would have to rub his madlyitching nose soon the key of strategy little vor she explained kindly is not to choose a path to victory but to choose so that all paths lead to a victory ideally your death has one use your success another i will emphasize that any premature attempt to contact the barrayaran could be very counterproductive very a nice aphorism on strategy hed have to remember that one let me hear my marching orders from my own supreme commander then let me talk to gregor ah that will be your reward for success the last guy who bought that line got shot in the back of his head for his credulity what say we save steps and you just shoot me now he blinked and sniffed tears now running down the inside of his nose i dont wish to shoot you she actually batted her eyelashes at him then straightened frowning really lord vorkosigan i hardly expected you to dissolve into tears he inhaled his hands made a helpless pleading gesture startled she tossed him a handkerchief from her breast pocket a greenscented handkerchief without other recourse he pressed it to his face stop crying you cowar her sharp order was interrupted by his first mighty sneeze followed by a rapid volley of repeats im not crying you bitch im allergic to your goddamn perfume miles managed to choke out between paroxysms she held her hand to her forehead and broke into giggles real ones not mannered ploys for a change the real spontaneous cavilo at last hed been right her sense of humor was vile oh dear she gasped this gives me the most marvelous idea for a gas grenade a pity ill never ah well his sinuses throbbed like kettle drums she shook her head helplessly and tapped out something on her comconsole i think i had best speed you on your way before you explode she told him bent over in his seat wheezing his waterclouded gaze fell on his brown felt slippers can i at least have a pair of boots for this trip she pursed her lips in a moment of thought no she decided it will be more interesting to see you carry on just as you are in this uniform on aslund ill be like a cat in a dog suit he protested shot on sight by mistake by mistake on purpose goodness youre going to have an exciting time she keyed the door lock open he was still sneezing and gasping as the guards came in to take him away cavilo was still laughing the effects of her poisonous perfume took half an hour to wear off by which time he was locked in a tiny cabin aboard an innersystem ship they had boarded via a lock on the kurin s hand he hadnt even set foot on vervain station again not a chance of a break for it he checked out the cabin its bed and lavatory arrangements were highly reminiscent of his last cell space duty hah the vast vistas of the wide universe hah the glory of the imperial serviceunhah hed lost gregor i may be small but i screw up big because im standing on the shoulders of giants he tried pounding on the door and screaming into the intercom no one came its a surprise he could surprise them all by hanging himself a briefly attractive notion but there was nothing up high to hook his belt on all right this couriertype ship was swifter than the lumbering freighter in which he and gregor had taken three days to cross the system last time but it wasnt instantaneous he had at least a day and a half to do some serious thinking he and admiral naismith its a surprise god an officer and a guard came for him very close to the time miles estimated they would arrive back at aslund stations defense perimeter but we havent docked yet this seems premature his nervous exhaustion still responded to a shot of adrenalin he inhaled trying to clear his frenzyfogged brain back to alertness again much more of this though and no amount of adrenalin would do him any good the officer led him through the short corridors of the little ship to nav and com the ranger captain was present leaning over the communication console manned by his second officer the pilot and flight engineer were busy at their stations if they board theyll arrest him and hell be automatically delivered as ordered the second officer was saying if they arrest him they could arrest us too she said to plant him and she didnt care if it was head or feet first she didnt order us to get ourselves interned said the captain a voice from the comm this is the picket ship ariel aslund navy contract auxiliary calling the cwg out of vervain hubside station cease accelerating and clear your portside lock for boarding for predocking inspection aslund station reserves the right to deny you docking privileges if you fail to cooperate in predocking inspectionthe voice took on a cheery tone i reserve the right to open fire if you dont stand and deliver in one minute thats enough stalling boys the voice once gone ironic was suddenly intensely familiar bel cease accelerating the captain ordered and motioned the second to close the comm channel hey you rotha he called to miles come over here so im rothaagain miles mustered a smarmy smile and sidled closer he eyed the viewer striving to conceal his hungry interest the ariel yes there it was in the vid display the sleek illyricanbuilt cruiser did bel thorne still command her how can i get myself onto that ship dont throw me out there miles protested urgently the oserans are after my hide i swear i didnt know the plasma arcs were defective what plasma arcs asked the captain im an arms dealer i sold them some plasma arcs cheap turns out they had a tendency to lock on overload and blow their users hand off i didnt know i got them wholesale the ranger captains right hand opened and closed in sympathetic identification he rubbed his palm unconsciously on his trousers back of his plasma arc holster he studied miles frowning sourly headfirst it is he said after a moment lieutenant you and the corporal take this little mutant to the portside personnel lock pack him in a bodpod and eject him were going home no said miles weakly as they each took an arm yes he dragged his feet careful not to offer enough resistance to risk his bones youre not going to space me the ariel my god oh the aslunder mercll pick you up said the captain maybe if they dont decide youre a bomb and try to set you off in space with plasma fire from their ship or something smiling slightly at this vision he turned back to the comm and intoned in a bored trafficcontrol singsong ariel ah this is the cwg we chose to ah change our filed flight plan and return to vervain station we therefore have no need for predocking inspection we are going to leave you a ah small parting gift though quite small what you choose to do with it is your problem the door to nav and com closed behind them a few meters of corridor and a sharp turn brought miles and his handlers to a personnel hatch the corporal held miles who struggled the lieutenant opened a locker and shook out a bodpod the bodpod was a cheap inflatable lifesupport unit designed to be entered in seconds by endangered passengers suitable either for pressurization emergencies or abandoning ship they were also dubbed idiotballoons they required no knowledge to operate because they had no controls merely a few hours of recyclable air and a locatorbeeper passive foolproof and not recommended for claustrophobes they were very costeffective in saving liveswhen adequate pickup ships arrived in time miles emitted a realistic wail as he was stuffed into the bodpods dank plasticsmelling interior a jerk of the rip cord and it sealed and inflated automatically he had a brief horrible flashback to the mudsunken bubbleshelter on kyril island and choked back a real scream he was tumbled as his captors rolled the pod into the airlock a whoosh a thump a lurch and he was freefalling in pitch darkness the spherical pod was little more than a meter in diameter miles halfdoubledup felt around his stomach and inner ear protesting the spin imparted by the ejecting kick outward till his shaking fingers found what he hoped was a coldlight tube he squeezed it and was rewarded with a nauseous greenish glow the silence was profound broken only by the tiny hiss of the air recycler and his ragged breathing well its better than the last time somebody tried to shove me out an airlock he had several minutes in which to imagine all the possible courses of action the ariel might take instead of picking him up he had just discarded skincrawling anticipation of the ship opening fire on him in favor of abandonment to cold dark asphyxiation when he and his pod were wrenched by a tractor beam the tractor beams operator clearly had ham hands and palsy but after a few minutes of juggling the return of gravity and outside sound reassured miles hed been safely stowed in a working airlock the swish of the inner door garbled human voices another moment and the idiot balloon began to roll he yelped loudly and curled up into a protective ball to roll with the flow till the motion stopped he sat up and took a deep breath and tried to straighten his uniform muffled thumps against the bodpods fabric somebody in there yeah miles called back just a minute squeaks clinks and a rending grind as the seals were broken the bodpod began to collapse as the air sighed out miles fought his way clear of its folds and stood shakily with all the gracelessness and indignity of a newlyhatched chick he was in a small cargo bay three greyandwhite uniformed soldiers stood in a circle around him aiming stunners and nerve disrupters at his head a slim officer with captains insignia leaned with one foot on a canister watching miles emerge the officers neat uniform and soft brown hair gave no clue whether one was looking at a delicate man or an unusually determined woman this ambiguity was deliberately cultivated bel thorne was a betan hermaphrodite minority descendant of a centurypast socialgenetic experiment that had not caught on thornes expression melted from scepticism to astonishment as miles rose into view miles grinned back hello pandora the gods send you a gift but theres a catch isnt there always face lighting with delight thorne strode forward to grasp miless waist with bubbling enthusiasm miles thorne held miles away again and gazed avidly down into his face what are you doing here somehow i figured that might be your first question miles sighed and what are you doing in the rangersuit goodness im glad youre not of the shootfirstandaskquestionslater school miles kicked his slippered feet clear of the deflated bodpod the soldiers somewhat uncertainly held their aim ah miles gestured toward them stand down men thorne ordered its all right i wish that were true miles said bel weve got to talk thornes cabin aboard the ariel was the same wrenching mix of familiarity and change miles had encountered in all the mercenary matters the shapes the sounds the smells of the ariels interior triggered cascades of memory the captains cabin was now overlaid with bels personal possessions vid library weapons campaign souvenirs including a halfmelted spacearmor helmet that had been slagged saving thornes life now made into a lamp a small cage housing an exotic pet from earth thorne called ahamster between sips of a cup of thornes private stock of nonsynthetic tea miles gave thorne the admiralnaismith version of reality closely related to the one hed given oser and tung the hub evaluation assignment the mystery employer etc gregor of course was edited out together with any mention of barrayar miles naismith spoke with a pure betan accent otherwise miles stuck as close as he could to the facts of his sojourn with randalls rangers so lieutenant lakes been captured by our competitors thorne mused upon miless description of the blond lieutenant hed passed in the kurin s hands brig couldnt happen to a nicer fellow but wed better change our codes again quite miles set down his cup and leaned forward i was authorized by my employer not only to observe but to prevent war in the hegen hub if possible well sort of im afraid it may no longer be possible what does it look like from your end thorne frowned we were last indock five days ago thats when the aslunders concocted this predocking inspection routine all the smaller ships were pressed into roundtheclock service on it with their military station nearing completion our employers are getting jumpier about sabotagebombs biologicals i wont argue with that what about ah fleet internal matters you mean rumors of your death life andor resurrection theyre all over fourteen garbled versions id have discounted em youve been sighted before yknowbut then suddenly oser arrested tung what miles bit his lip only tung not elena mayhew chodak only tung that makes no sense if hed arrested tung hed have fastpentad him and hed have to have spilled on elena unless shes been left free as bait things got real tense when tung was taken ready to explode i think if oserd moved on elena and baz it would have sparked the war right then yet he hasnt backed down and reinstated tung very unstable osers taking care to keep the old inner circle separated thats why ive been out here for nearly a bloody week but last time i saw baz he was damn near edgy enough to commit to fight and that was the last thing hed wanted to do miles exhaled slowly a fight is exactly what commander cavilo wants its why she shipped me back giftwrapped in that undignified package the bodpod of discord she doesnt care if i win or lose as long as her enemys forces are thrown into chaos just as she springs her surprise have you figured out what her surprise is yet no the rangers were setting up for some sort of groundattack at one point sending me here suggests theyre aiming for aslund against all strategic logic or something else the womans mind is incredibly twisted gah he slapped his fist gently into his palm in nervous rhythm ive got to talk to oser and hes got to listen this time ive thought it over cooperation between us may be the one and only course of action cavilo doesnt expect doesnt have a halfsawnthrough branch of her strategytree ready and waiting for me are you willing to put it all on the line for me bel thorne pursed lips judiciously from here yeah the ariels the fleets fastest ship i can outrun retribution if i have to thorne grinned should we run to barrayar nocavilo still held gregor better appear to be following instructions for a time yet miles took a long breath and settled himself firmly in the station chair in the ariels nav and com room hed cleaned up and borrowed a mercenarys greyandwhite uniform from the smallest woman on the ship the rolledup pant cuffs were stuffed neatly out of sight down boots that almost fit a belt covered the fastener gaping open at the toonarrow waistband the loose jacket looked all right sitting down permanent alterations later he nodded to thorne all right open your channel a buzz a glitter and admiral osers hawk face materialized over the vid plate yes what is ityou his teeth shut with a beaks snap his hand a vague unfocused blur to the side tapped on intercom keys and vid controls he cant throw me out the airlock this time but he can cut me off time to talk fast miles leaned forward and smiled hello admiral oser ive completed my evaluation of vervani forces in the hegen hub and my conclusion is you are in deep trouble how did you get on this secured channel snarled oser tightbeam doubleencodecomm officer trace this how you will be able to determine in a few minutes youll have to keep me online till you do said miles but your enemy is at vervain station not here not pol not jacksons whole and most certainly not me note i said vervain station not vervain you know cavilo your opposite number acrosssystem ive encountered her once or twice osers face was guarded now waiting for his scrambling tech team to report face like an angel mind like a rabid mongoose osers lips twitched very slightly youve met her oh yes she and i had several hearttoheart talks they were educational information is the most valuable tradegood in the hub right now at any rate mine is i want to deal oser held up his hand for a pause and keyed offline briefly when his face retuned its expression was black captain thorne this is mutiny thorne leaned into the range of the vid pickup and said brightly no sir its not we are trying to save your ungrateful neck if you will permit it listen to the man he has lines we dont he has lines all right and under his breath damn betans sticking together whether you fight me or i fight you admiral oser we both lose said miles rapidly you cant win said oser you cannot take my fleet not with the ariel the ariels just a starterset if it comes to that but no i probably cant win what i can do is make an unholy mess divide your forcesscrew you with your employerevery weaponcharge you expend every piece of equipment thats damaged every soldier hurt or killed is pure loss in an infight like this nobody wins but cavilo who expends nothing which is precisely what she sent me back here for how much profit do you foresee in doing precisely what your enemy wishes you to eh miles waited breathless osers jaw worked chewing over this impassioned argument whats your profit he asked at last ah im afraid im the dangerous variable in that calculation admiral im not in it for profit miles grinned so i dont care what i wreck any information you had from cavilo is worth shit said oser he begins to barterhes hooked hes hooked miles tamped down exultation cultivated a serious expression anything cavilo says must certainly be sifted with great care but ah beauty is as beauty does and ive found her vulnerable side cavilo has no vulnerable side yes she does her passion for utility her selfinterest i fail to see how that makes her vulnerable precisely why you need to add me to your staff at once you need my vision hire you oser recoiled in astonishment well hed achieved surprise anyway a military objective of sorts i understand the post of chiefofstafftactical is now empty osers expression flowed from astonished to stunned to a kind of amused fury youre insane no just in a tearing hurry admiral theres nothing irrevocable gone wrong between us yet you attacked menot the other way aroundand now you expect me to attack you back but im not on holiday and i dont have time to waste on personal amusements like revenge osers eyes narrowed what about tung miles shrugged keep him locked up for now if you insist unharmed of course just dont tell him i said so suppose i hang him ah that would be irrevocable miles paused i will point out jailing tung is like cutting off your right hand before heading into battle what battle with whom its a surprise cavilos surprise though ive developed an idea or two on the problem that id be willing to share would you oser had that same mansuckingalemon expression miles had now and then surprised on illyans face it seemed almost homey miles continued as an alternative to my becoming your employee im willing to become your employer im authorized to offer a bona fide contract all the usual perqs equipment replacement insurance from my sponsor illyan hear my plea not in conflict with aslunds interests you can collect twice for the same fight and you dont even have to switch sides a mercenarys dream what guarantees can you offer up front it seems to me that im the one whos owed a guarantee sir let us begin with small steps i wont start a mutiny you stop trying to thrust me out airlocks i will join you openlyeveryone to know ive arrivedi will make my information available to you how thin his information seemed in the breeze of these airy promises no numbers no troop movements all intentions shifting mental topographies of loyalty ambition and betrayal we will confer you may even have an angle i lack then we go on from there oser thinned his lips bemused halfpersuaded deeply suspicious the risk i would point out said miles the personal risk is more mine than yours i think miles hung suspended on the mercenarys words i think im going to regret this oser sighed the detailed negotiations just to bring theariel into dock took another half day as the initial excitement wore off thorne became more thoughtful as the ariel actually maneuvered into its clamps thorne grew positively meditative im still not exactly sure whats supposed to keep oser from bringing us in stunning us and hanging us at leisure thorne said buckling on a sidearm thorne kept the complaint to an undertone in care for the tender ears of the escort squad kitting up nearby in the ariels shuttle hatch corridor curiosity said miles firmly all right stun fastpenta and hang then if he fastpentas me ill tell him exactly the facts i was going to tell him anyway and a few more besides alas and hell have fewer doubts so much the better miles was rescued from further hollow flummery by the clank and hiss of the flextubes sealing thornes sergeant undogged the hatch without hesitation though he was also careful not to stand silhouetted in the aperture miles noted squad form up the sergeant ordered his six people checked their stunners thorne and the sergeant in addition bore nerve disruptors a nicelycalculated mix of weapons stunners to allow for human error the nerve disruptors to encourage the other side not to risk mistakes miles went unarmed with a mental salute to cavilo well a rude gesture actuallyhed put his felt slippers back on thorne at his side he took the lead of the little procession and marched through the flex tube into one of the aslunder military stations almostfinished docking bays true to his word oser had a party of witnesses lined up and waiting the squad of twenty or so bore a mix of weapons almost identical to the ariels group were outnumbered muttered thorne its all in the mind miles muttered in return march like you had an empire at your back and dont look over your shoulder they may be gaining on us theyd better be gaining on us the more people who see me the better oser himself stood waiting in parade rest looking highly dyspeptic elenaelena stood at his side unarmed face frozen her tightlipped stare at miles was tense with suspicion not of his motives perhaps but certainly of his methods now what foolishness her eyes asked miles gave her the briefest of ironic nods before saluting oser reluctantly oser returned the military courtesy nowadmirallet us return to the triumph and get down to business he grated indeed yes but lets have a little tour of this station on the way eh the nontopsecured areas of course my last view was so rudely cut short after all after you admiral oser gritted his teeth oh after you admiral it became a parade miles led them around for a good fortyfive minutes including a march through the cafeteria during the dinner rush with several noisy stops to greet by name the few old dendarii he recognized and favor the others with blinding smiles he left babble in his wake those in the dark demanding explanation from those in the know an aslunder work crew was busy tearing out fiberboard paneling and he paused to compliment them on their labors elena seized an opportunity of osers distraction to bend down and breathe fiercely in miless ear wheres gregor thereby hangsme if i fail to get him back miles whispered too complicated tell you later oh god she rolled her eyes when he had judging from the admirals darkening complexion just about reached the limits of osers strained tolerance miles suffered himself to be led triumphward again there obedient to cavilos orders miles had made no attempt to contact barrayar but if ungari couldnt find him after this it was time to fire the man a prairie bird thrumming out a mad mating dance could scarcely have put on a more conspicuous display finishing touches on construction were still in progress around the triumphs docking bay as miles marched his parade across it a few aslunder workers in tan light blue and green leaned over to goggle down from catwalks military techs in their dark blue uniforms paused in midinstallation to stare then had to resort connections and realign bolts miles refrained from smiling and waving lest osers set jaw crack no more baiting time to get serious the thirty or so mercenaries could change from honor guard to prison guard with his next roll of the dice thornes tall sergeant marching beside miles gazed around the bay noting new construction the robotic loaders should be fully automated by this time tomorrow he noted thatll be an improvementcrap his hand descended abruptly on miless head shoving him downward the sergeant halfspun clawed hand arcing toward his holster when the crackling blue bolt of a nerve disrupter charge struck him square in the chest at the level miless head had been he spasmed his breath stopping the smell of ozone hot plastic and blistered meat slapped miless nose miles kept on diving hitting the deck rolling a second bolt splattered on the deck its outwashing field stinging like twenty wasps up miless outstretched arm he jerked his hand back as the sergeants corpse collapsed miles grabbed at the mans jacket and jerked himself underneath burrowing his head and spine under where the meat was thickest the sergeants torso he drew his arms and legs in as tight as he could another bolt crackled into the deck nearby then two struck the body in close succession even with the absorbing mass between it was worse than the blow of a shockstick on high power miless ringing ears heard screaming thumping yelling running chaos the chirping buzz of stunner fire a voice hes up there go get him and another voice high and hoarse you spotted himhes yours you go get him another bolt hit the decking the weight of the big man the stench of his fatal injury pressed into miless face he wished the fellowd massed another fifty kilos no wonder cavilo had been willing to front twenty thousand betan dollars toward a line on a shieldsuit of all the loathsome weapons miles had ever faced this had to be the most personally terrifying a head injury that didnt quite kill him but stole his humanity and left him animal or vegetable was the worst nightmare his intellect was surely his sole justification for existence without it the crackle of a nerve disrupter not aimed his way penetrated his hearing miles turned his head to scream cloth and meatmuffled stunners stunners we want him alive for questioning hes yours you go get him he should shove out from under this body and join the fight but if he was the assassins special target and why else pump charges into a corpse perhaps he ought to stay right here he squirmed trying to draw his hands and legs in tighter the shouting died down the firing stopped someone kneeling beside him tried to roll the sergeants body off miles it took miles a moment to realize he had to unclutch the dead mans uniform jacket before he could be rescued he straightened his fingers with difficulty thornes face wavered over him white and breathing openmouthed urgent are you all right admiral i think miles panted he was aiming at you thorne reported only i noticed miles stuttered im only lightly fried thorne helped him sit up he was shaking as badly as after the shockstick beating he regarded his spasming hands lowered one to touch the corpse beside him in morbid wonder every day of the rest of my life will be your gift and i dont even know your name your sergeantwhat was his name collins collins thanks good man i saw oser came up looking strained admiral naismith this was not my doing oh miles blinked help me up bel that might have been a mistake thorne then had to help him keep standing as his muscles twitched he felt weak washedout as a sick man elena where she had no weapon there she was with another female mercenary they were dragging a man in the dark blue uniform of an aslunder ranker toward miles and oser each woman held a booted foot the mans arms trailed nervelessly across the deck stunned dead they dropped the feet with a thump beside miles with the matteroffact air of lionesses delivering prey to their cubs miles stared down at a very familiar face indeed general metzov what are you doing here do you recognize this man oser asked an aslunder officer who had hurried up to join them is he one of yours i dont know him the aslunder knelt to check for ids he had a valid pass he could have had me and gotten away said elena to miles but he kept firing at you you were bright to stay put a triumph of wit or a failure of nerve yes quite miles made another attempt to stand on his own gave up and leaned on thorne i hope you didnt kill him just stunned said elena holding up the weapon as evidence some intelligent person must have tossed it to her when the melee began he probably has a broken wrist who is he asked oser quite sincerely miles judged why admiral miles bared his teeth i told you i was going to deliver you more intelligence data than your section could collect in a month may i present rather like an entree at thathe made a gesture designed to evoke a waiter lifting a domed cover from a silver platter but which probably looked like another muscle spasm general stanis metzov secondincommand randalls rangers since when do senior staff officers undertake field assassinations excuse me secondincommand as of three days ago that may have changed he was up to his stringy neck in cavilos schemes you i and he have an appointment with a hypospray oser stared you planned this why do you think i spent the last hour flitting around the station if not to smoke him out miles said brightly he must have been stalking me this whole time i think im going to throw up have i just claimed to be brilliant or incredibly stupid oser looked like he was trying in figure out the answer to that same question miles stared down at metzovs unconscious form trying to think had metzov been sent by cavilo or was this murder attempt entirely on his own time if sent by cavilohad she planned him to fall alive into her enemies hands if not was there a backup assassin around here somewhere and if so was his target metzov if metzov succeeded or miles if metzov failed or both i need to sit down and draw a flowchart medical squads had arrived yes sickbay said miles faintly till my old friend here wakes up ill agree to that said oser shaking his head in something akin to dismay better put a protective as well as holding guard on our prisoner im not sure if he was meant to survive capture right oser agreed bemusedly thorne supporting one arm and elena the other miles staggered home into the triumphs hatchway miles sat trembling on a bench in a glassedin cubicle normally used for bioisolation in the triumphs sickbay and watched elena tie general metzov to a chair with a tanglecord it would have given miles a smug sense of turnabout if the interrogation upon which they were about to embark was not so fraught with dangerous complications elena was disarmed again two stunnerarmed men stood guard beyond the soundproof transparent door glancing in occasionally it had taken all miless eloquence to keep the audience for this initial questioning limited to himself oser and elena how hot can this mans information be oser had inquired irritably they let him go out in the field hot enough that i think you should have a chance to think about it before broadcasting it to a committee miles had argued youll still have the recording metzov looked sick and silent tightmouthed and unresponsive his right wrist was neatly bandaged awakening from stun accounted for the sick the silence was futile and everyone knew it it was a kind of strange courtesy not to badger him with questions before the fastpenta cut in now oser frowned at miles are you up to this yet miles glanced down at his stillshaking hands as long as no one asks me to do brain surgery yes proceed i have reason to suspect that time is of the essence oser nodded to elena who held up a hypospray to calibrate the dose and pressed it to metzovs neck metzovs eyes shut briefly in despair after a moment his clenched hands relaxed the muscles of his face unlocked to sag into a loose idiotic smile the transformation was most unpleasant to watch without the tension his face looked aged elena checked metzovs pulse and pupils all right hes all yours gentlemen she stepped back to lean against the doorframe with folded arms her expression almost as closed as metzovs had been miles opened his hand after you admiral osers mouth twisted thank you admiral he walked over to stare speculatively into metzovs face general metzov is your name stanis metzov metzov grinned yeah thats me presently secondincommand randalfs rangers yeah who sent you to assassinate admiral naismith metzovs face took on an expression of sunny bewilderment who call me miles miles suggested he knows me under a pseudonym his chance of getting through this interview with his identity undisclosed equalled that of a snowball surviving a wormhole jump to the center of a sun but why rush the complications who sent you to kill miles cavie did of course he escaped you see i was the only one she could trust trust the bitch miless brow twitched in fact cavilo shipped me back here herself he informed oser general metzov was therefore set up but to what end my turn now i think oser made the afteryou gesture and stepped back miles tottered off his bench and into metzovs lineofsight metzov breathed rage even through the fastpenta euphoria then grinned vilely miles decided to start with the question that had driven him most nuts the longest whowhat targetwas your groundattack planned to be upon vervain said metzov even osers jaw dropped the blood thudded in miless ears in the stunned silence vervain is your employer oser choked godgodfinally it adds up miles almost capered it came out a stagger which elena lurched away from the wall to catch yes yes yes its insane said oser so thats cavilos surprise thats not the end of it ill bet cavilos drop forces are bigger than ours by far but no way are they big enough to take on a fullysettled planet like vervain on the ground they can only raid and run raid and run right smiled metzov equably what was your particular target then asked miles urgently banks art museums gene banks hostages thats a pirate raid said oser what the hell were you going to do with the loot drop it off on jacksons whole on the way out they fence it how did you figure to escape the irate vervani navy then asked miles hit them just before the new fleet comes online cetagandan invasion fleetll catch em in orbital dock sitting targets easy the silence this time was utter thats cavilos surprise miles whispered at last yeah that ones worthy of her cetagandan invasion oser unconsciously began to chew a fingernail god it fits it fits miles began to pace the cubicle with uneven steps whats the only way to take a wormhole jump from both sides at once the vervani arent cavilos employersthe cetagandans are he turned to point at the slacklipped nodding general and now i see metzovs place clear as day pirate shrugged oser nogoat what this manyou apparently dont knowwas cashiered from the barrayaran imperial service for brutality oser blinked from the barrayaran service that must have taken some doing miles bit down a twinge of irritation well yes he ah took on the wrong victim but anyway dont you see it the cetagandan invasion fleet jumps through into vervani local space on cavilos invitationprobably on cavilos signal the rangers raid do a fast trash of vervain the cetagandans out of the kindness of their hearts rescue the planet from the treacherous mercenaries the rangers run metzov is left behind as goatjust like throwing the guy out of the troika to the wolves oops that wasnt a very betan metaphor to be publicly hung by the cetagandans to demonstrate their good faith see this evil barrayaran harmed you you need our imperial protection from the barrayaran imperial threat and here we are and cavilo gets paid three times once by the vervani once by the cetagandans and the third time by jacksons whole when she fences her loot on the way out everybody profits except the vervani of course he paused to catch his breath oser was beginning to look convinced and worried do you think the cetagandans plan to punch through into the hub or will they stop at vervain of course theyll punch through the hub is the strategic target vervain is just a stepping stone to it hence the bad mercenary setup the cetagandans want to expend as little energy as possible pacifying vervani theyll probably label them an allied satrapy hold the space routes and barely touch down on the planet absorb them economically over a generation the question is will the cetagandans stop at pol will they try to take it on this one move or leave it as a buffer between them and barrayar conquest or wooing if they can bait the barrayarans into attacking through pol without permission it might even drive the polians into a cetagandan allianceagh he paced again oser looked like hed bitten into something nasty with half a worm in it i wasnt hired to take on the cetagandan empire i expected to be fighting the vervanis mercenaries at most if the whole thing didnt just fizzle out if the cetagandans arrive here in force in the hub well be trapped penned up with a culdesac at our backs and in a trailing mutter maybe we ought to think about getting out while the gettings good but admiral oser dont you realize miles pointed to metzov shed never have let him out of her sight with all this in his head if it was still an active plan she may have meant him to die trying to kill me but there was always the chance he might notthat just this sort of interrogation might result all this is the old plan there must be a new plan and i think i know what it is there is another factor a new x in the equation gregor unless i miss my guess the cetagandan invasion is now a considerable embarrassment to cavilo admiral naismith i would believe that cavilo would doublecross anyone you care to nameexcept the cetagandans theyd spend a generation pursuing their revenge she couldnt run far enough she wouldnt live to spend her profits incidentally what conceivable profit outweighs triple pay but if she expects to have the barrayaran empire to defend her from retributionall our security resources i see one way she could expect to get away with it said miles if it works out like she wants shell have all the protection she wants and all the profits it could work it really could if gregor were indeed under her spell and if two embarrassingly hostile character witnesses miles and general metzov conveniently killed each other abandoning her fleet she could take gregor and flee before the oncoming cetagandans presenting herself to barrayar as gregors rescuer at great personal cost if in addition a smitten gregor urged her as his fiancee worthy mother to a future scion of the military castethe romantic appeal of the drama could swing popular support enough to overwhelm cooler advisors judgments god knew miless own mother had laid the groundwork for that scenario she could really bring this off empress cavilo of barrayar it even scans and she could cap her career by betraying absolutely everybody even her own forces miles the look on your face said elena in worry when said oser when will the cetagandans attack he got metzovs wandering attention and repeated the question only cavie knows metzov snickered cavie knows everything it has to be imminent miles argued it may even be starting now guessing from cavilos timing of my return here she meant the dethe fleet to be paralyzed with our infighting right now if thats true murmured oser what to do were too far away a day and a half from the action which will be at the vervain station wormhole and beyond in vervani local space we have to get closer we have to move the fleet acrosssystempin cavilo up against the cetagandans blockade her whoa im not mounting a headlong attack against the cetagandan empire interrupted oser sharply you must youll have to fight them sooner or later you pick the time or they will the only chance of stopping them is at the wormhole once theyre through it will be impossible if i moved my fleet away from aslund the vervani would think we were attacking them and mobilize go on the alert good but in the wrong direction not good we would end up being a feint for cavilo damn no doubt another branch of her strategytree supposeif the cetagandans are now such an embarrassment to cavilo as you claimshe doesnt send her code oh she still needs them but for a different purpose she needs them to flee from and to massmurder her witnesses for her but she doesnt need them to succeed in fact she now needs their invasion to bog down if shes really thinking as longterm as she should be in her new plan oser shook his head as if to clear it why our only hopeaslunds only hopeis to capture cavilo and fight the cetagandans to a standstill at the vervain station wormhole no waitwe have to hold both sides of the hubvervain jump until reinforcements arrive what reinforcements aslund polonce the cetagandans actually materialize in force theyll see their threat and if pol comes in on barrayars side instead of cetagandas barrayar can pour forces through via them the cetagandans can be stopped if everything occurs in the right order but could gregor be rescued alive not a path to victory but all paths would the barrayarans come in oh i think so your counterintelligence must keep track of these thingshavent they noticed a sudden increase in barrayaran intelligence activity here in the hub the last few days now that you mention it yes their coded traffic has quadrupled thank god maybe relief was closer than hed dared hope have you broken any of their codes miles asked brightly while he was at it only the least sensitive one so far ah good that is too bad oser stood with his arms folded gnawing at his lip intensely inward for a full minute it reminded miles uncomfortably of the meditative expression the admirald had just before ordering him shoved out the nearest airlock barely more than a week back no oser said at last thanks for the information in return i suppose i will spare your life but were pulling out its not a fight we can possibly win only some propagandablinded planetary force with a planets resources behind it can afford that sort of insane selfsacrifice i designed my fleet to be a fine tactical tool not a a damn doorstop made of dead bodies im not aas you saygoat not a goat a spearhead your spearhead has no spear behind it no is that your last word sir asked miles in a thin voice yes oser reached to key his wristcom to call in the waiting guards corporal this partys going to the brig call down and notify them the guard saluted through the glass as oser keyed off but sir elena approached him her arms raised in pleading with a snakestrike sideways flick of her wrist she jabbed the hypospray against the side of osers neck his eyes widened his pulse beat once twice three times as his lips drew back in rage he tensed to strike her his blow sagged in midarc the guards beyond the glass snapped alert at osers sudden movement drawing their stunners elena caught osers hand and kissed it smiling gratefully the guards relaxed one nudged the other and said something pretty nasty judging from their grins but miless wits were too momentarily scattered to try and read lips oser swayed and panted fighting the drug elena sidled up the captured arm and slipped a hand cozily around his waist halfturning him so they stood with their backs to the door the sterotypical stupid fastpenta smile slipped across and receded from osers face then fixed itself at last he acted like i was unarmed elena shook her head in exasperation and slipped the hypospray into her jacket pocket now what miles hissed frantically as the guardcorporal bent over the doors codelock we all go to the brig i guess tungs there said elena ah ohhellwellneverbringthisoff had to try miles smiled cheerily at the entering guards and helped them release metzov largely getting in their way and keeping their attention off the peculiarly happylooking oser at a moment when their eyes were elsewhere he tripped metzov who staggered youd better each take one of his arms hes not too steady miles told the guards he was none too steady himself but he managed to block the doorway so the guards and metzov led the way himself second and elena arminarm with oser followed last come love come he heard elena intone behind him like a woman coaxing a cat to her lap it was the longest short walk hed ever taken he dropped back to growl out of the corner of his mouth to elena all right we get to the brig it will be stocked with osers finest what then she bit her lip dont know thats what i was afraid of turn right here they swung around the next corner a guard looked back over his shoulder sir carry on boys miles called when youve got that spy locked up report back to us at the admirals cabin very good sir keep walking breathed miles keep smiling the guards footsteps faded where now asked elena oser stumbled this is untenable admirals cabin why not miles decided his grin was fixed and fey elenas inspired mutinous gesture had given him the best break of the day he had the momentum now he wouldnt stop till he was brought down bodily his head spun with the unutterable relief of at last getting the shifting writhing chittering mightbemightbemightbe nailed to a fixed is this time is now the word is go maybe if they passed a few oseran techs oser was sort of nodding miles hoped it would pass as casual acknowledgment of their salutes nobody turned and cried hey anyway two levels and another turn brought them to the wellremembered corridors of officers country they passed the captains cabin god hed have to deal with auson and soon osers palm pressed by elena against the lock admitted them to the quarters oser had made his flag office when the door slipped shut behind them miles realized hed been holding his breath were in it now said elena sagging for a moment with her back to the door you going to run out on us again not this time miles replied grimly you may have noticed one item i didnt bring up for discussion down in sickbay gregor just so cavilo holds him hostage aboard her flagship right now elenas neck bent in dismay she means to sell him to the cetagandans for a bonus then no weirder than that she means to marry him elenas lip curled in astonishment what miles theres no way she could have got such an impossible notion in her head unless unless gregor planted it which i believe he did watered and fertilized it too what i dont know is whether he was serious or playing for time she was very careful to keep us separated you knew gregor almost as well as i do what do you think its hard to imagine gregor lovestruck to idiocy he was always rather quiet almost well undersexed compared to say ivan im not sure thats a fair comparison no youre right well compared to you then miles wondered just how to take that gregor never had much in the way of opportunities when we were younger i mean no privacy security always in his back pocket that that can inhibit a man unless hes a bit of an exhibitionist her hand turned as if measuring out gregors smooth gripless surface he was not that certainly cavilo must be taking care to present only her most attractive side elena licked her lips in thought is she pretty yeah if you happen to like blonde powermad homicidal maniacs i suppose she could be quite overwhelming his hand closed the texture of cavilos pelted hair remembered like an itch on his palm he rubbed it on his trouser seam elena brightened slightly ah you dont like her miles gazed up at elenas valkyrie face shes too short for my taste elena grinned that i believe she guided the shambling oser to a chair and sat him down were going to have to tie him up soon or something the comm buzzed miles went to osers desk console to answer it yes he said in his calmest bored voice corporal meddis here sir weve put the vervani agent in cell nine thank you corporal ah it was worth a try we still have some fastpenta left would you two please bring captain tung up here for questioning beyond range of the vid pickup elenas dark brows rose in hope tung sir the guards voice was doubtful uh may i add a couple of reinforcements to my squad then sure see if sergeant chodaks around he may have some people up for extra duties in fact isnt he on the extraduty roster himself he glanced up to see elena hold up her thumb and forefinger in an o i think so sir fine whatever carry on naismith out he keyed off the comm and stared at it as if it had transmuted into aladdins lamp i dont think im destined to die today i must be being saved for day after tomorrow you think oh yes ill have a much bigger more public and spectacular chance to blow it all away then be able to take thousands more lives down with me dont you fall into one of your stupid funks now you havent got time for it she rapped the hypospray smartly across his knuckles youve got to think us out of this hole yes maam miles said meekly rubbing his hand whatever happened to my lord no respect none but he was strangely comforted by the way when oser arrested tung for arranging my getaway why didnt he go on to take you and arde and chodak and the rest of your cadre he didnt arrest tung for that at least i dont think so he was baiting tung which is his habit they were both on the bridge at the same timethat was unusualand tung finally lost his temper and tried to deck him did deck him i heard and was part way to strangling him when security pulled him off it had nothing to do with us then that was a relief im not sure i wasnt there it might have been an emergency diversion to get osers attention away from making just that connection elena nodded to the stillblandlysmiling oser and now leave him loose till tung is delivered were all just happy allies here miles grimaced but for the love of god dont let anybody try to talk to him the door comm buzzed elena went to stand behind osers chair with one hand on his shoulder trying to look as allied as possible miles went to the door and keyed the lock the door slid open six nervous squadmen surrounded a hostilelooking ky tung tung wore prisoners bright yellow pajamas and radiated malice like a small prenova sun his teeth clenched in utter confusion when he saw miles ah thank you corporal said miles we will be having a little informal staff conference after this interrogation id appreciate it if you and your squad would stand guard out here and in case captain tung gets violent again wed better haveoh sergeant chodak and a couple of your people inside he emphasized the your with no change of voice but only a direct look into chodaks eyes chodak made the catch yes sir you private come with me im promoting you to lieutenant miles thought and stood aside to let the sergeant and his chosen man guide tung within oser looking cheerful was quite clearly visible to the squad for a moment before the door hissed closed again oser was clearly visible to tung too tung shrugged off his guards and stalked toward the admiral what now you sonofabitch do you think you tung paused as oser continued to smile dimly up at him whats wrong with him nothing shrugged elena i think that dose of fastpenta made a real improvement in his personality too bad its only temporary tung threw back his head and barked a laugh and whirled to shake miles by the shoulders you did it you littleyou came back were in business chodaks man twitched as if uncertain which way or whom to jump chodak caught him by the arm shook his head silently and indicated the wall by the door chodak holstered his stunner and leaned against the doorframe with his arms folded after a startled moment his man followed suit flanking the other side fly on the wall chodak grinned out of the corner of his mouth to him consider it a gift it wasnt exactly voluntary said miles through his teeth to tung only in part to keep from biting his tongue in the blast of the eurasians enthusiasm and were not in business yet sorry ky i cant be your front man this time youve got to follow me miles kept his face stern and removed tungs hands from his shoulders with icy deliberation that vervani freighter captain you found delivered me straight to commander cavilo and ive been wondering ever since if it was an accident ah tung fell back looking as if miles had just hit him in the stomach miles felt like he had no tung was no traitor but miles dared not give up the only edge he had betrayal or botchery ky and have you stopped beating your wife botchery whispered tung gone sallowpale dammit im going to kill the triplecrossing thats already been done said miles coldly tungs brows rose in surprised respect i came to the hegen hub on a contract continued miles which is now in disarray almost beyond repair i havent come back here to put you in operational combat command of the dendarii a beat as tungs worried features attempted to settle on an expression unless you are prepared to serve my ends priorities and targets are to be my choice only the how is yours and just who was going to put whom in command of the dendarii as long as that question didnt occur to tung as my ally began tung not ally your commander or nothing said miles tung stood stockily his brows struggling to find their level in a mild tone he finally said daddy kys little boy is growing up it seems thats not the half of it are you in or out the other half of this is something ive got to hear tung sucked on his lower lip in miles stuck out his hand done tung took it done his grip was determined miles let out a long breath all right i gave you some halftruths last time heres whats really going on he began to pace his shaking not all from the nerve disruptor nimbus i do have a contract with an interested outsider but it wasnt for military evaluation which is the smoke screen i gave oser the part i told you about preventing a planetary civil war was not smoke i was hired by the barrayarans they dont normally hire mercenaries said tung im not a normal mercenary im being paid by barrayaran imperial security god at least one wholetruth to find and rescue a hostage on the side i hope to stop a nowimminent cetagandan invasion fleet from taking over the hub our second strategic priority will be to hold both sides of the vervain wormhole jump and as much else as we can till barrayaran reinforcements arrive tung cleared his throat second priority what if they dont arrive theres pol to cross and ah hostagerescue does not normally take precedence over fleetwide strattac ops eh given the identity of this hostage i guarantee their arrival the barrayaran emperor gregor vorbarra was kidnapped i found him lost him and now ive got to get him back as you can imagine i expect the reward for his safe return to be substantial tungs face was a study in appalled enlightenment that skinny neurasthenic git you had in tow beforethat wasnt him was it yes it was and between us you and i managed to deliver him straight to commander cavilo oh shit tung rubbed his burrhaired skull shell sell him straight to the cetagandans no she means to collect her reward from barrayar tung opened his mouth closed it held up a finger wait a minute its complicated miles conceded helplessly thats why im going to delegate the simple part holding the wormhole to you the hostagerescue part will be my responsibility simple the dendarii mercenaries all five thousand of us singlehanded against the cetagandan empire have you forgotten how to count in the last four years think of the glory think of your reputation think how great itll look on your next resume on my cenotaph you mean nobody will be able to collect enough of my scattered atoms to bury you going to cover my funeral expenses son splendidly banners dancing girls and enough beer to float your coffin to valhalla tung sighed make it plum wine to float the boat eh drink the beer well he stood silent a moment rubbing his lips the first step is to put the fleet on onehouralert status instead of twentyfour theyre not already miles frowned we were defensive we figured we had at least thirtysix hours to study anything coming at us across the hub or so oser figured it itll take about six hours to bring us up to onehour readiness right thats the second step then your first step will be to kiss and make up with captain auson kiss my ass cried tung that vacuumhead is needed to command the triumph while you run fleet tac you cant do both i cant reorganize the fleet this close to the action if i had a week to weed outwell i dont osers people must be persuaded to stay on their jobs if i have auson miless upheld hand closed cagelike i can run the rest one way or another tung growled frustrated acquiescence all right his glower faded to a slow grin id pay money to watch you make him kiss thorne though one miracle at a time captain auson a big man four years ago had put on a little more weight but seemed otherwise unchanged he stepped into osers cabin took in the stunners aimed his way and stood hands clenching when he saw miles sitting on the edge of osers comconsole desk a psychological ploy to put his head level with everyone elses in the station chair miles feared he looked like a child in need of a booster seat at the dinner table ausons expression melted from anger to horror oh hell not you again but of course shrugged miles the stunnerarmed flies on the wall chodak and his man suppressed grins of happy anticipation the actions about to start you cant take this auson broke off to peer at oser what did you do to him lets just say we adjusted his attitude as for the fleet its already mine well he was working on it anyway the question is will you choose to be on the winning side pocket a combat bonus or shall i give command of the triumph to auson bared his teeth to tung in a silent snarl bel thorne what auson yelped tung flinched wincing you cant miles cut over him do you happen to recall how you graduated from command of the ariel to command of the triumph yes auson pointed to tung what about him my contractor will contribute value equal to the triumph which will become tungs vested share in the fleet corporation in return commodore tung will relinquish all claim on the ship itself i will confirm tungs rank as chief of stafftactical and yours as captain of the flagship triumph your original contribution equal to the value of the ariel less liens will be confirmed as your vested share in the fleet corporation both ships will be listed as owned by the fleet do you go along with this auson demanded of tung miles prodded tung with a steely look yeah said tung grudgingly auson frowned over this it isnt just the money he paused brow wrinkling what combat bonus what combat he who hesitates is had are you in or out ausons moon face took on a cunning look im inif he apologizes what this meatmind thinks apologize to the man tung dear miles sang through his teeth and lets get on or the triumph gets a captain who can be its own first mate who among other manifold virtues doesnt argue with me of course not the little betan flipsiders in love snapped auson ive never been able to figure out if it wants to get screwed or bugger you miles smiled and held up a restraining hand now now he nodded toward elena who had holstered her stunner in favor of a nerve disrupter pointed steadily at ausons head her smile reminded miles unsettlingly of one of sergeant botharis or worse of cavilos have i ever mentioned auson how much the sound of your voice irritates me she inquired you wouldnt fire said auson uncertainly i wouldnt stop her miles lied i need your ship it would be convenientbut not necessaryif you would command her for me his gaze flicked like a knife toward his putative chief of stafftac tung with illgrace tung mouthed a noblyworded if vague apology to auson for past slurs on his character intelligence ancestry appearanceas ausons face darkened miles stopped tungs catalogue in midlist and made him start over keep it simpler tung took a breath auson you can be a real shithead sometimes but dammit you can fight when you have to ive seen you in the tight and the bad and the crazy ill take you at my back before any other captain in the fleet one side of ausons mouth curled up now thats sincere thank you so much i really appreciate your concern for my safety how tight and bad and crazy do you think this is going to get tung miles decided had a most unsavory chuckle the captainowners were brought in one by one to be persuaded bribed blackmailed and bedazzled till miless mouth was dry throat raw voice hoarse only the peregrines captain tried to physically fight he was stunned and bound and his secondincommand given the immediate choice between brevet promotion and a long walk out a short airlock he chose promotion though his eyes said another day as long as that other day came after the cetagandans miles was satisfied they moved to the larger conference chamber across from the tactics room for the strangest staff conference miles had ever attended oser was fortified with a booster shot of fastpenta and propped up at the head of the table like a stuffed and smiling corpse at least two others were tied to their chairs gagged tung traded his yellow pajamas for undress greys commodores insignia pinned hastily over his captains tags the reaction of the audience to tungs initial tactical presentation ranged from dubious to appalled overcome almost by the pelting headlong pace of the actions demanded of them tungs most compelling argument was the sinister suggestion that if they didnt set themselves up as the wormholes defenders they might be required to attack through it later against a prepared cetagandan defense a vision that generated shudders all around the table it could be worse was always an unassailable assertion partway through miles massaged his temples and leaned over to whisper to elena was it always this bad or have i just forgotten she pursed her lips thoughtfully and murmured back no the insults were better in the old days miles muffled a grin miles made a hundred unauthorized claims and unsupported promises and at last things broke up each to their duty stations oser and the peregrines captain were marched away under guard to the brig tung paused only to frown down at the brown felt slippers if youre going to command my outfit son would you please do an old soldier a favor and get a pair of regulation boots at last only elena remained i want you to reinterrogate general metzov miles told her pull out all the ranger tactical disposition data you cancodes ships online offline last known positions personnel oddities plus whatever he may know about the vervani edit out any unfortunate references he may make to my real identity and pass it on to ops with the warning that not everything metzov thinks is true necessarily is it may help right miles sighed slumping wearily on his elbows at the empty conference table you know the planetary patriots like the barrayaransus barrayaranshave it wrong our officer cadre thinks that mercenaries have no honor because they can be bought and sold but honor is a luxury only a free man can afford a good imperial officer like me isnt honorbound hes just bound how many of these honest people have i just lied to their deaths its a strange game would you change anything today everything nothing id have lied twice as fast if id had to you do talk faster in your betan accent she allowed you understand am i doing the right thing if i can bring it off failure being automatically wrong not a path to disaster but all paths her brows rose certainly his lips twisted up so you whom i love my barrayaran lady who hates barrayar are the only person in the hub i can honestly sacrifice she tilted her head in consideration of this thank you my lord she touched her hand to the top of his head passing out of the chamber miles shivered miles returned to osers cabin for a fast perusal of the admirals comconsole files trying to get a handle on all the changes in equipment and personnel that had occurred since hed last commanded and to assimilate the dendariiaslunder intelligence picture of events in the hub somebody brought him a sandwich and coffee which he consumed without tasting the coffee was no longer working to keep him alert though he was still keyed to an almost unbearable tension as soon as we undock ill crash in osers bed hed better spend at least some of the thirtysix hours transit time sleeping or hed be more liability than asset upon arrival when he would have to deal with cavilo who made him feel like the proverbial unarmed man in the battle of wits even when he was at his best not to mention the cetagandans miles considered the historical threeleggedrace between weapons development and tactics projectile weapons for shiptoship combat in space had early been made obsolete by mass shielding and laser weapons mass shielding designed to protect moving ships from space debris encountered at normalspace speeds up to halfcee shrugged off missiles without even trying laser weapons in turn had been rendered useless by the arrival of the swordswallower a betandeveloped defense that actually used the enemy fire as its own power source a similar principle in the plasma mirror developed in miless parents generation promised to do the same to the shorterrange plasma weapons another decade might see plasma all phased out the upandcoming weapon for shiptoship fighting in the last couple of years seemed to be the gravitic imploder lance a modification of tractorbeam technology variouslydesigned artificialgravity shields were still lagging behind in protection from it the imploder beam made ugly twisty wreckage where it hit mass what it did to a human body was a horror but the energysucking imploder lances range was insanely short in terms of space speeds and distances barely a dozen kilometers now ships had to cooperate to grapple to slow and close up to maneuver given also the small scale of wormhole volumes fighting looked like it might suddenly become tight and intimate once again except that tootight formations invited sun wall attacks of massed nuclears round and round it was hinted that ramming and boarding could actually become practical popular tactics once again till the next surprise arrived from the devils workshops anyway miles longed briefly for the good old days of his grandfathers generation when people could kill each other from a clean fifty thousand kilometers just bright sparks the effect of the new imploders on concentration of firepower promised to be curious especially where a wormhole was involved it was now possible that a small force in a small area could apply as much power per cubic whatever as a large force which could not squeeze its largeness down to the effective range although the difference in reserves still held good of course a large force willing to make sacrifices could keep beating away till sheer numbers overcame the smaller concentration the cetagandan ghemlords were not allergic to sacrifice though generally preferring to start with subordinates or better still allies miles rubbed his knotted neck muscles the cabin buzzer blatted miles reached across the comconsole desk to key the door open a lean darkhaired man in his early thirties wearing mercenary greyandwhites with tech insignia stood uncertainly in the aperture my lord he said in a soft voice baz jesek fleet engineering officer once barrayaran imperial service deserter on the run subsequently liegesworn as a private armsman to miles in his identity as lord vorkosigan and finally husband to the woman miles loved once loved still loved damn miles cleared his throat uncomfortably come in commodore jesek baz trod soundlessly across the deck matting looking defensive and guilty i just got in off the repairs tender and heard the word that you were back his barrayaran accent was polished thin and smooth by his years of galactic exile significantly less pronounced than four years ago temporarily anyway im sorry you didnt find things as youd left them my lord i feel like ive squandered elenas dowry that you bestowed i didnt realize the implications of osers economic maneuvers until well no excuses the man finessed tung too miles pointed out he cringed inwardly to hear baz apologize to him i gather it wasnt exactly a fair fight it wasnt a fight at all my lord baz said slowly that was the problem baz stood to parade rest ive come to offer you my resignation my lord offer rejected said miles promptly in the first place liegesworn armsmen cant resign in the second place where am i going to get a competent fleet engineer on he glanced at his chrono two hours notice and in the third place in the third place i need a witness to clear my name if things go wrong wronger youve got to fill me in on fleet equipment capabilities then help get it all in motion and ive got to fill you in on whats really going on youre the only one besides elena i can trust with the secret half of this with difficulty miles persuaded the hesitant engineer to sit down miles poured out a speededited precis of his adventures in the hegen hub leaving out only mention of gregors halfhearted suicide attempt that was gregors private shame miles was not altogether surprised to learn elena had not confided his earlier brief and ignominious return rescue and departure from the dendarii baz seemed to think the presence of the incognito emperor obvious and sufficient reason for her silence by the time miles finished bazs inner guilt was quite thoroughly displaced by outer alarm if the emperor is killedif he doesnt returnthe mess at home could go on for years baz said maybe you should let cavilo rescue him rather than risk up to a point thats just what i intend to do said miles if only i knew gregors mind he paused if we lose both gregor and the wormhole battle the cetagandans will arrive on our doorstep just at the point we will be in maximum internal disarray what a temptation to themwhat a luretheyve always wanted komarrwe could be looking down the throat of the second cetagandan invasion almost as much a surprise to them as to us they may prefer deeplaid plans but theyre not above a little opportunismnot an opportunity this overwhelming determinedly driven by this vision they turned to the tech specs miles reminding himself about the ancient saying about the want of a nail they had nearly completed an overview when the comm officer on duty paged miles through his comconsole admiral naismith sir the comm officer stared with interest at miless face then went on theres a man in the docking bay who wants to see you he claims to have important information miles bethought himself of the theorized backup assassin whats his id he says to tell you his names ungari thats all hell say miles caught his breath the cavalry at last or a clever ploy to gain admittance can you give me a look at him without letting him know hes being scanned right sir the comm officers face was replaced on the vid by a view of the triumphs docking bay the vid zoomed down to focus on a pair of men in aslunder tech coveralls miles melted with relief captain ungari and blessed sergeant overholt thank you comm officer have a squad escort the two men to my cabin he glanced at baz in uh about ten minutes he keyed off and explained its my impsec boss thank god butim not sure id be able to explain to him the peculiar status of your desertion charges i mean hes impsec not service security and i dont imagine your old arrest order is exactly at the top of his list of concerns right now but it might be simpler if you avoid him eh mm baz grimaced in agreement i believe i have duties to attend to no lie baz for a wild moment he longed to tell baz to take elena and run safe away from the coming danger its going to get real crazy soon with mad miles back in charge how could it be otherwise baz shrugged smiling he started for the door im not as crazy as tunggood god nobody calls me that do they ahits an old joke only among a few old dendarii bazs step quickened and there are very few old dendarii that unfortunately was not a funny joke the door hissed closed behind the engineer ungari ungari somebody in charge at lastif only i had gregor with me i could be done right now but at least i can find out what our side has been up to all this time exhausted he laid his head down on his arms on osers comconsole desk and smiled help finally some wriggling dream was fogging his mind he snatched himself back from toolongdelayed sleep as the cabin buzzer blatted again he rubbed his numb face and hit the lock control on the desk enter he glanced at the chrono hed lost only four minutes on that downward slide of consciousness it was definitely time for a break chodak and two dendarii guards escorted captain ungari and sergeant overholt into the room ungari and overholt were both dressed in tan aslunder supervisors coveralls no doubt with ids and passes to match miles smiled happily at them sergeant chodak you and your men wait outside chodak looked sadly disappointed at this exclusion and if shes finished with her current task ask commander elena botharijesek to attend on us here thanks ungari waited impatiently till the door had hissed closed behind chodak to stride forward miles stood up and saluted him smartly glad to see y to miless surprise ungari did not return the salute instead his hands clenched on miless uniform jacket and lifted miles sensed that it was only with the greatest restraint that ungaris grip had closed on his lapels and not his neck vorkosigan you idiot what the hell kind of game have you been up to i found gregor sir i dont say lost him im mounting an expedition to recover him right now im so glad you made contact with me another hour and youd have missed the boat if we pool our information and resources ungaris clutch did not loosen nor did his peeledback lips relax we know you found the emperor we traced you both here from consortium detention then you both vanished utterly didnt you ask elena i thought you wouldlook sir sit down please and put me down dammit ungari seemed not to notice that miless toes were stretched to the floor and tell me what all this looked like from your point of view its very important ungari breathing heavily released miles and sat in the indicated station chair or at least on its edge at a hand signal overholt took up a pose of parade rest at his shoulder miles gazed with some relief at overholt whom hed last seen facedown unconscious on the consortium station concourse the sergeant appeared fully recovered if tired and strained ungari said when he finally woke up sergeant overholt followed you to consortium detention but by then youd disappeared he thought theyd done it they thought hed done it he spent bribemoney like water finally got the story from the contractslave youd beaten upa day later when the man could finally talk he lived then said miles good grewe were worried about that yes but overholt didnt recognize the emperor at first in the contractslave recordsthe sergeant hadnt been on the needtoknow list about his disappearance a faint irate look passed over the sergeants face as if in memory of great injustices it wasnt until hed made contact with me here we deadended and we retraced all the steps in hopes of finding some clue about you wed overlooked that i identified the missing contractslave as emperor gregor days lost i was sure youd make contact with elena botharijesek sir she knew where wed gone you knew she was my sworn liegewoman its in my files ungari shot him a flatlipped glare but did not otherwise offer explanation for this gaffe when the first wave of barrayaran agents hit the hub we finally had enough reinforcements to mount a serious search good so they know gregors in the hub back home i was afraid illyan would still be squandering all his resources on komarr or worse towards escobar ungaris fingers clenched again vorkosigan what did you do with the emperor hes safe but in great danger miles thought that one over a second that is hes all right for the moment i think but that will change with the tactical we know where he is he was spotted three days ago by an agent in randalls rangers must have been just after i left miles calculated not that he could have spotted me i was in the brigwhat are we doing about it rescue forces are being scrambled i dont know how large a fleet what about permission to cross pol i doubt theyll wait for it weve got to alert them not to offend pol the ensign vervain holds the emperor ungari snarled in exasperation im not going to tell the vervain doesnt hold gregor commander cavilo does miles interrupted urgently its strictly nonpolitical a plot for her personal gain i thinkin fact im dead certainthe vervani government doesnt know the first thing about her guest our rescue forces must be warned to commit no hostile act until the cetagandan invasion shows up the what miles faltered and said in a smaller voice you mean you dont know anything about the cetagandan invasion he paused well just because you dont have the word yet doesnt mean illyan hasnt figured it out even if we havent spotted where theyre massing inside the empire as soon as impsec adds up how many cetagandan warships have disappeared from their home bases theyll realize something must be up somebody must still be keeping track of such things even in the current flap over gregor ungari was still sitting there looking stunned so miles kept explaining i expect a cetagandan force to invade vervani local space and continue on to secure the hegen hub with commander cavilos connivance very shortly i plan to take the dendarii fleet acrosssystem and fight them at the vervani wormhole hold it till gregors rescue fleet arrives i hope theyre sending more than a diplomatic negotiation team by the way do you still have that blank mercenary contract credit chit illyan gave you i need it you mister ungari began when he had mastered his voice again are going nowhere but to our safehouse on aslund station where you will wait quietlyvery quietlyuntil illyans reinforcements arrive to take you off my hands miles politely ignored this impractical outburst you have to have been collecting data for your report to illyan got anything i can use i have a complete report on aslund station its naval and mercenary dispositions and strengths but i have all that now miles tapped his fingers impatiently on osers comconsole damn i wish youd spent the last two weeks on vervain station instead ungari gritted vorkosigan you will stand up now and come with sergeant overholt and me or so help me i will have overholt carry you bodily overholt was eyeing him with cool calculation miles realized that could be a serious mistake sir worse than your failure to contact elena if you will just let me explain the overall strategic situation goaded beyond endurance ungari snapped overholt grab him miles hit the alarm on his comconsole desk as overholt swooped down on him he dodged around his station chair knocking it loose from its clamps as overholt missed his first grab the cabin door hissed open chodak and his two guards pelted through followed by elena overholt chasing miles around the end of the comconsole desk skidded straight into chodaks stunner fire overholt dropped with a massive thud miles winced ungari lurched to his feet and stopped bracketed by the aim of four dendarii stunners miles felt like bursting into tears or possibly cackles neither would be useful he got control of his breath and voice sergeant chodak take these two men to the triumphs brig put them put them next to metzov and oser i guess yes admiral ungari went bravely silent as befit a captured spy and suffered himself to be led out though the veins in his neck pulsed with suppressed fury as he glared back at miles and i cant even fastpenta him miles thought mournfully an agent of ungaris level was certain to have been implanted with an induced allergic reaction to fastpenta not euphoria but anaphylactic shock and death would result from such a dose in a moment two more dendarii appeared with a float pallet and removed the inert overholt as the door closed behind them elena asked all right what was all that about miles sighed deeply that unfortunately was my impsec superior captain ungari he was not in a listening mood elenas eye lit with a skewed enthusiasm dear god miles metzovoserungariall in a rowyou sure are hard on your commanding officers what are you going to do when the time comes to let them all out miles shook his head mutely i dont know the fleet disengaged from aslund station within the hour maintaining strict comm silence the aslunders naturally were thrown into a panic miles sat in the triumphs comm center and monitored their frantic queries resolved not to interfere with the natural course of events unless the aslunders opened fire until he again laid hands on gregor he must at all costs present the correct profile to cavilo let her think she was getting what she wanted or at least what shed asked for in fact the natural course of events promised to deliver more of the results miles wanted than he could have gained through planning and persuasion the aslunders had three main theories miles deduced from their comm chatter the mercenaries were fleeing from the hub altogether at secret word of some impending attack the mercenaries were off to join one or more of aslunds enemies or worst of all the mercenaries were opening an unprovoked attack on said enemies with subsequent retribution to recoil on the aslunders heads aslunder forces went to maximum alert status reinforcements were called for mobile forces shifted into the hub reserves brought online as the sudden departure of their faithless mercenaries stripped them of assumed defenses miles breathed relief as the last of the dendarii fleet cleared the aslunders region and headed into open space delayed by the confusion no aslunder naval pursuit force could catch them now till they decelerated near the vervain wormhole where with the arrival of the cetagandans it should not be hard to persuade the aslunders to reclassify themselves as dendarii reserves timing was if not everything a lot suppose cavilo hadnt already transmitted her gocode to the cetagandans the sudden movement of the dendarii fleet might well spook her into aborting the plot fine miles decided in that case he would have stopped the cetagandan invasion without a shot being fired a perfect war of maneuver by admiral aral vorkosigans own definition of course ill have political egg on my face and a lynch mob after me from three sides but dad will understand i hope that would leave staying alive and rescuing gregor as his only tactical goals which in present contrast seemed absurdly delightfully simple unless of course gregor didnt want to be rescued further finer branches of the strategytree must await events miles decided blearily he staggered off to osers cabin to fall into bed and sleep for twelve solid sodden hours the triumph s comm officer woke miles paging him on the vid miles in his underwear padded across to the comconsole and slung himself into the station chair yes you asked to be apprised of messages from vervain station sir yes thank you miles rubbed amber grains of sleep from his eyes and checked the time twelve hours flighttime left till their arrival at target any signs of abnormal activity levels at vervain station or their wormhole yet not yet sir all right continue to monitor record and track any outbound traffic whats the transmission time lag from us to them at present thirtysix minutes sir mm very well pipe the message down here yawning he leaned his elbows on osers comconsole and studied the vid a highranking vervani officer appeared over the plate and demanded explanation for the oserandendarii fleets movements he sounded a lot like the aslunders no sign of cavilo miles keyed the comm officer transmit back that their important message was hopelessly garbled by static and a malfunction in our descrambler urgently request a repeat with amplification yes sir in the ensuing seventy minutes miles took a leisurely shower dressed in a properly fitting uniform and boots that had been provided while he slept and ate a balanced breakfast he strolled into the triumphs nav and com just in time for the second transmission this time commander cavilo stood arms crossed at the vervani officers shoulder the vervani repeated himself literally with amplification his voice was louder and sharper this time around cavilo added explain yourselves at once or we will regard you as a hostile force and respond accordingly that was the amplification hed wanted miles settled himself in the comm station chair and adjusted his dendarii uniform as neatly as possible he made sure the admirals rank insignia was clearly visible in the vid ready to transmit he nodded to the comm officer he smoothed his features into as straightfaced and deadserious an expression as he could manage admiral miles naismith commanding dendarii free mercenary fleet speaking to commander cavilo randalls rangers eyes only maam i have accomplished my mission precisely as you ordered i remind you of the reward you promised me for my success what are your next instructions naismith out the comm officer logged the recording into the tightbeam scrambler sir she said uncertainly if thats for commander cavilos eyes only should we be sending it on the vervain command channel the vervani will have to deprocess it before sending it on it will be seen by a lot of eyes besides hers just so lieutenant said miles go ahead and transmit oh and whenifthey respond what do you want me to do miles checked his chrono by the time of their next response our line of travel should take us behind the twin suns interference corona we should be out of communications for a good oh three hours i can boost the gain sir and cut through no no lieutenant the interference is going to be something terrible in fact if you can stretch that to four hours so much the better but make it look real until were in range for a tightbeam conference between myself and cavilo in nearrealtime i want you to think of yourself as a noncommunications officer yes sir she grinned now i understand carry on remember i want maximum inefficiency incompetence and error on the vervani channels that is youve worked with trainees surely be creative yes sir miles went off to find tung he and tung were deeply engrossed in the tactical computer display in the triumphs tactics room running projected wormhole scenarios when the comm officer paged again changes at vervain station sir all outgoing commercial ship traffic has been halted incoming are being denied permission to dock encoded transmissions on all military channels have just about tripled and four large warships just jumped into the hub or out to vervain out to vervain sir tung leaned forward dump data into the tactics display as you confirm it lieutenant yes sir thank you said miles continue to keep us advised and monitor civilian clearcode messages too any you can pick up i want to keep tabs on the rumors as they start to fly right sir out tung keyed up what was laughingly called the realtime tactics display a colorful schematic as the comm officer shunted the new data he studied the identity of the four departing warships its starting he said grimly you called it you dont think its something were causing not those four ships they wouldnt have moved offstation if they werent badly wanted elsewhere better get your ass over tothat is transfer your flag to the ariel son miles rubbed his lips nervously and eyed what hed mentally dubbed his little fleet in the schematic display in the ariels tactics room the equipment was now displaying the ariel itself plus the two nextfastest ships in the dendarii forces his own personal attackgroup fast maneuverable amenable to violent coursechanges requiring less turningroom than any other possible combination admittedly they were low in firepower but if things went as miles projected firing was not going to be a desirable option anyway the ariels tac room was manned now by a mere skeleton crew miles elena as his personal communications officer arde mayhew for all other systems inner circle all in anticipation of this next mostprivate conversation if it came to actual combat hed turn the chamber over to thorne presently exiled to nav and com and then perhaps retire to his cabin and slit his belly open lets see vervain station now he told elena in her comm station chair the main holovid display in the center of the room whirled dizzyingly at her touch on the controls the schematic representation of their target area seemed to boil with shifting lines and colors representing ship movements power shunts to various weapons systems and shieldings and communications transmissions the dendarii were now barely a million kilometers out a little more than three lightseconds the rate of closure was slowing as the little fleet fully two hours ahead of the slower ships of the main dendarii fleet decelerated theyre sure stirred up now elena commented her hand went to her earbug theyre reiterating their demands that we communicate but still not launching a counterattack miles observed studying the schematic im glad they realize where the true danger lies all right tell them that weve got our comm problems straightened outfinallybut say again that i will speak first only to commander cavilo theyahi think theyre finally putting her through ive got a tightbeam coming in on the dedicated channel trace it miles hung over her shoulder as she coaxed this information from the comm net the source is moving miles closed his eyes in prayer snapped them open again at elenas triumphant got it there that little ship give me its course and energy profile is she heading toward the wormhole no away ha its a fast shipsmallits a falconclass courier elena reported if her goal is poland barrayarshe must intersect our triangle miles exhaled right right she waited to speak on a line her vervani bosses couldnt monitor i thought she might wonder what lies shes told them shes past the point of no return does she know it he opened his arms to the new short vector line in the schematic come love come to me elena raised her brow sardonically at him coming through your sweetheart is about to appear on monitor three miles swung into the indicated station chair settling himself before the holovid plate which began to sparkle now was the time to muster every bit of selfcontrol hed ever owned he smoothed his face to an expression of cool ironic interest as cavilos fine features formed before him out of range of the vid pickup he rubbed his sweating palms on his trouser knees cavilos blue eyes were alight with triumph constrained by her tight mouth and tense brows as if in echo of miless ships constraining her flightpath lord vorkosigan what are you doing here following your orders maam you told me to go get the dendarii and ive transmitted nothing to barrayar a sixsecond timelag as the tightbeam flew from ship to ship and returned her answer alas that it gave her as much time to think as it did him i didnt order you to cross the hub miles wrinkled his brow in puzzlement but where else would you need my fleet except at the point of action im not dense cavilos pause this time was longer than accounted for by the transmission lag you mean you didnt get metzovs message she asked damn near what a fabulous array of double meanings there why did you send him as a courier lag yes a palpable lie for a palpable lie i never saw him maybe he deserted he must have realized hed lost your love to another perhaps hes holed up in some spaceport bar right now drowning his sorrows miles sighed deeply at this sad scenario cavilos concerned attentive expression melted to rage when this one arrived idiot i know you took him prisoner yes and ive been wondering ever since why you allowed that to happen if that accident was undesired you should have taken precautions against it cavilos eyes narrowed she shifted her ground i feared staniss emotions made him unreliable i wanted to give him one more chance to prove himself i gave my backup man orders to kill him if he tried to kill you but when metzov missed the dolt waited substitute as soon assucceeded for that iftried and the statement was probably neartruth miles wished he had a recording of that ranger agents field report and cavilos blistering reply there you see you do want subordinates who can think for themselves like me cavilos head jerked back you for a subordinate id sooner sleep with a snake interesting image that youd better get used to me youre seeking entry into a world strange to you familiar to me the vorkosigans are an integral part of barrayars powerclass you could use a native guide lag exactly im tryingi mustget your emperor to safety youre blocking his flight path out of my way miles spared a glance for the tactics display yes just so good come to me commander cavilo i feel certain you are missing an important datum in your calculations about me lag let me clarify my position little barrayaran i hold your emperor i control him absolutely fine let me hear those orders from him then lag fractionally briefer yes i can have his throat cut before your eyes let me pass go ahead miles shrugged itll make an awful mess on your deck though she grinned sourly after the lag you bluff badly i bluff not at all gregor is far more valuable alive to you than to me you can do nothing where youre going except through him hes your meal ticket but has anyone mentioned to you yet that if gregor dies i could become the next emperor of barrayar well arguably but this was hardly time to go into the finer details of the six competing barrayaran succession theories cavilos face froze he said he had no heir you said so too none named because my father refuses to be named not because he lacks the bloodlines but ignoring the bloodlines doesnt erase them and i am my fathers only child and he cant live forever ergo so resist my boarding parties by all means threaten away carry out your threats give me the imperiumi shall thank you prettily before i have you summarily executed emperor miles the first how does it sound as good as empress cavilo miles gave it an intense beat or we could work together the vorkosigans have traditionally felt that the substance was better than the name the power behind the throne as my father before mewho has held just that power as gregor has doubtless told you for far too longyoure not going to dislodge him by batting your eyelashes hes immune to women but i know his every weakness ive thought it through this could be my big chance one way or another by the waymiladydo you care which emperor you wed the time lag allowed him to fully savor her changes of expression as his plausible calumnies thudded home alarm revulsion finally reluctant respect i underestimated you it seems very well your ships may escort us to safety whereclearlywe must confer further i will transport you to safety aboard the ariel where we will confer immediately cavilo straightened nostrils flaring no way all right lets compromise i will abide by gregors orders and gregors orders only as i said milady youd better get used to this no barrayaran will take orders from you directly at first till youve established yourself if thats the game youre choosing to play youd better start practicing it only gets more complicated after this or you can choose to resist in which case i get it all play for time cavilo bite ill get gregor the vid went to the grey haze of a holdingsignal miles flung himself back in his station chair rubbed his neck and rolled his head trying to relieve his screaming nerves he was shaking mayhew was staring at him in alarm damn said elena in a hushed voice if i didnt know you id think you were mad yuris understudy the look on your face am i reading too much into all that innuendo or did you in fact just connive to assassinate gregor in one breath offer to cuckold him in the next accuse your father of homosexuality suggest a patricidal plot against him and league yourself with cavilowhat are you going to do for an encore depends on the straight lines i can hardly wait to find out miles panted was i convincing you were scary good he wiped his palms on his trousers again its mindtomind between cavilo and me before it ever becomes shiptoship shes a compulsive plotter if i can smoke her wind her in with words with whatifs with all the bifurcations of her strategytree just long enough to get her eye off the one real now signal elena warned miles straightened waited the next face to form over the vid plate was gregors gregor alive and well gregors eyes widened then his face went very still cavilo hovered behind his shoulder just slightly out of focus tell him what we want love miles bowed sitting down as profoundly as physically possible sire i present you with the emperors own dendarii free mercenary fleet do with us as you will gregor glanced aside evidently as some tactical readout analogous to the ariels own by god youve even got them with you miles you are supernatural the flash of humor was instantly muffled in sere formality thank you lord vorkosigan i accept your vassaloffering of troops if you would care to step aboard the ariel sire you can take personal command of your forces cavilo leaned forward interrupting and now his treachery is made plain let me play a portion of his last words for you greg cavilo reached past gregor to touch a control and miles was treated to an instant replay of his breathless sedition beginning withnaturallythe flimflam about the named heir and ending with his offer of himself as a substitute imperial groom very nicely selected clearly unedited gregor listened with his head in a thoughtful tilt his face perfectly controlled as the milesimage stammered to its damning conclusion but does this surprise you cavie asked gregor in an innocent tone taking her hand and looking over his shoulder at her from the expression on her face something was surprising her lord vorkosigans mutations have driven him mad everyone knows that hes been sulking around muttering like that for years of course i trust him no further than i can throw him thanks gregor ill remember that line but as long as he feels he can further his interests by furthering ours hell be a valuable ally house vorkosigan has always been powerful in barrayaran affairs his grandfather count piotr put my grandfather emperor ezar on the throne theyd make an equally powerful enemy i should prefer us to rule barrayar with their cooperation their extermination would do as well surely cavilo glared at miles time is on our side love his father is an old man he is a mutant his bloodlinethreat is empty barrayar would never accept a mutant as emperor as count aral well knows and as even miles realizes in his saner moments but he can trouble us if he chooses an interesting balance of power eh lord vorkosigan miles bowed again i think much on it so have you apparently he spared a quelling glance at elena who had fallen off her station chair somewhere around gregors wordpicture of miless mad soliloquies aside at state banquets no doubt and was now sitting on the floor with her sleeve jammed in her mouth to muffle the shrieks of laughter her eyes blazed over the grey cloth she got control of her stifled giggles and scrambled back into her seat close your mouth arde then cavie lets join my wouldbe grand vizier at that point i will control his ships and your wish he turned his head to kiss her hand still resting in his grasp on his shoulder will be my command do you really think its safe if hes as psycho as you say brilliantnervousskittishbut hes all right as long as his medications are adjusted properly i promise you i expect his dose is a little off at the moment due to our irregular travels the transmission timelag was much reduced now twenty minutes to rendezvous sir elena reported offsides will you transfer in your shuttle or ours sire miles inquired politely gregor shrugged carelessly commander cavilos choice ours said cavilo immediately i will be waiting and ready cavilo broke transmission miles watched through the vid link as the first spacearmored ranger stepped into the ariels shuttle hatch corridor the wary pointman was followed immediately by four more who scanned the empty passageway converted into a chamber by the closed blast doors sealing each end no enemies no targets not even automatic weapons threatened them an utterly deserted chamber bewildered the rangers took up a defensive stance around the shuttle hatch gregor stepped through miles was unsurprised to see that cavilo had not provided the emperor with space armor gregor wore neatlypressed set of ranger fatigues minus insignia his only protection was his boots even they would be quite inadequate if one of those heavyarmored monsters stepped on his toe battle armorwas lovely stuff proof against stunners and nerve disrupters most poisons and biologicals resistant to a degree to plasma fire and radioactivity stuffed with clever builtin weaponry tac comps and telemetry very suitable for a boarding expedition though in fact miles had once captured theariel himself with fewer personnel less formidably armed and totally unarmored hed had surprise on his side though cavilo came through behind gregor she wore space armor though for the moment she carried her helmet tucked under her arm like a decapitated head she stared around the empty corridor and frowned all right whats the trick she demanded loudly to answer your question miles pressed the button on the remotecontrol box in his hand a muffled explosion made the corridor reverberate the flextube tore violently away from the shuttle hatch the automatic doors sensing the pressure drop clapped shut instantly a bare breath of air escaped good system miles had made the techs make sure it was working properly before theyd inserted the directional mines in the shuttle clamps he checked his monitors cavilos combat shuttle was tumbling away from the side of the ariel now thrusters and sensors damaged in the same blast that propelled it outward its weapons and reserve rangers useless until the nodoubtfrantic pilot regained attitude control if he could keep an eye on him bel i dont want him coming back to haunt us miles spoke into his comm link to thorne on deck in the ariels tactics room i can blow him up now if you like wait a little were a long way from sorted out down here god help us now cavilo was snapping her helmet on her startled troops in defensive formation around her all dressed up and nothing to shoot let them settle down for just a moment enough to prevent spinalreflexive fusilades but not enough to think miles glanced around at his own spacearmored troops six in number and closed his own helmet not that numbers mattered a million troops with nuclears one guy with a club either would suffice when the target was one unarmed hostage miniaturizing the situation miles realized sadly had made no qualitative difference he could still screw up just as big the main difference was his plasma cannon sighted down the corridor he nodded to elena manning the big weapon not normally an indoor toy it would stop charging space armor and blow out the hull beyond miles figured that theoretically they could blow away oh one out of cavilos five at this range if they came on at a dead run before all became handtohand or glovetoglove here we go miles warned through his command channel remember the drill he pressed another control the blast doors between his group and cavilos began to draw back slowly not suddenly at a rate carefully calculated to inspire dread without startling pull broadcast on all channels plus loudspeaker it was absolutely essential to miless plan that he get in the first word cavilo he shouted deactivate your weapons and freeze or ill blow gregor to atoms body language was a wonderful thing it was amazing how much expression could come through the blank shining surface of space armor the littlest armored figure stood openhanded stunned bereft of words bereft for precious seconds of reactions because of course miles had just stolen her opening line now what do you have to say for yourself love it was a desperate ploy miles had judged the hostageproblem logically insoluble therefore clearly the only thing to do was make it cavilos problem instead of his own well hed obtained as much as the freeze part anyway but he dared not let the standoff stand drop it cavilo it only takes one nervous twitch to convert you from imperial fiancee to no one of importance at all and then to no one at all and youre making mereal tense you said he was safe cavilo hissed to gregor his meds must be further offdose than i thought gregor replied looking anxious no watchhes bluffing ill prove it hands held out open to his sides gregor walked straight toward the plasma cannon miless jaw fell open behind his faceplate gregor gregor gregor gregor gazed steadily into elenas faceplate his step never quickened or faltered he stopped only when his chest touched the beaded tip of the cannon it was an enormously dramatic and arresting moment miles was so lost in appreciation it took him that long to move his finger an imperceptible few centimeters and hit the button on his control box that closed the blast doors the shield hadnt been programmed for slowclosure it banged shut faster than the eye could follow brief noises from the other side of plasma fire shouts cavilo screaming at one of her men just in time to stop him from the fatal error of firing a mine at the wall of a closed chamber he himself occupied then silence miles dropped his plasma rifle tore off his helmet god almighty i wasnt expecting that gregor youre a genius gently gregor raised a finger and moved the tip of the plasma cannon aside dont worry said miles none of our weapons are charged i didnt want to risk any accidents i was almost certain that was the case gregor murmured he stared back over his shoulder at the blast doors what would you have done if id been asleep on my feet kept talking tried for various compromises i had a trick or two yet but behind the other blast door theres a squad with live weapons in the end if she didnt bite i was prepared to surrender thats what i was afraid of some peculiar muffled noises penetrated the blast doors elena take over said miles mop up take cavilo alive if possible but i dont want any dendarii to die trying take no chances trust nothing she says i have the picture elena waved a salute and motioned to her squad which broke up to insert weaponscharges elena began to confer over the commandchannel headset with the leader of the twin squad waiting on cavilos other side and with the commander of the ariels combat shuttle closing in from space miles motioned gregor along the corridor removing him as swiftly as possible from the region of potential messiness to the tactics room and ill fill you in you have some decisions to make they entered a lifttube and rose miles breathed easier with every meter he increased the range between gregor and cavilo my biggest worry miles said till we spoke facetoface was that cavilo really had done what she thought she had fogged your mind i didnt see where she could be getting her ideas except from you wasnt sure what i could do in that case except play along till i could hand you over to higher experts on barrayar if i survived i didnt know how fast youd see through her oh at once shrugged gregor she had the same hungry smile vordrozda used to get and a dozen lesser cannibals since i can smell a powerhungry flatterer at a thousand meters now i yield to my master in strategy miless armored hand made a genuflecting motion do you know you rescued yourself shed have taken you all the way home even if i hadnt come along it was easy gregor frowned all that was required was that i have no personal honor at all gregors eyes miles realized were deathly devoid of triumph you cant cheat an honest man said miles uncertainly or woman what would you have done if shed got you home depends gregor stared into the middle distance if shed managed to get you killed i suppose id have had her executed gregor glanced back as they stepped out of the tube this is better maybe maybe theres some way to give her a fair chance miles blinked id be very careful about giving cavilo any kind of a chance at all if i were you even with tongs does she deserve it do you realize whats going on how many shes betrayed in part and yet yet what gregors tone was so low as to be nearly inaudible i wish she had been real and thats the present tactical situation in the hub and vervain local space as far as my information goes miles concluded his presentation to gregor they had the ariels briefing room all to themselves arde mayhew stood guard in the corridor miles had begun his speedprecis as soon as elena reported that the hostile boarders had been successfully secured hed paused only to peel out of his illfitting armor and back into his dendarii greys the armor had been hastily borrowed from the same female soldier whod lent him kit before and the plumbing perforce left unconnected miles froze the holovid display in the center of the table would that he could freeze real time and events the same way at the touch of a keypad that he might halt their terrible rush youll notice our biggest intelligence holes are in precise information about the cetagandan forces im hoping the vervani will plug some of those gaps if we can persuade them were their allies and the rangers may yield more one way or another nowsirethe decision lands on you fight or flight i can detach the ariel from the dendarii right now to run you home with little loss to this hot and dirty wormhole fight firepower and armor not speed are going to be at a premium there theres not much doubt which course my father and illyan would vote for no gregor stirred on the other hand they arent here true alternately going to the opposite extreme do you wish to be commanderinchief of this mess in fact as well as name gregor smiled softly what a temptation but dont you think theres a certain hubris in undertaking field leadership without a prior apprenticing in field followership miles reddened slightly iahemface a similar dilemma youve met the solution his names ky tung well be conferring with him when we transfer back to the triumph later miles paused there are a couple of other things you might do for us if you choose real things gregor rubbed his chin watching miles as he might a play trot them out lord vorkosigan legitimatize the dendarii present them to the vervani as the barrayaran pickup force i can only bluff your breath is law you can conclude a legally binding defensive treaty between barrayar and vervainaslund too if we can bring them in your greatest value issorrydiplomatic not military go to vervain station and deal with these people and i do mean deal safely behind the lines gregor noted dryly only if we win on the other side of the jump if we lose the lines will come to you i would i could be a soldier some lowly lieutenant with only a handful of men to care for theres no moral difference between one and ten thousand i assure you youre just as thoroughly damned however many you get killed i want to be in on the fight probably the only chance ill have in my life for real risk what the risk you run every day from lunatic assassins isnt enough thrill for you you want more active not passive real service ifin your judgmentthe best and most vital service you can give everyone else risking their lives here is as a minor field officer i will of course support you to the best of my ability said miles bleakly ouch murmured gregor you can turn a phrase like a knife you know he paused treaties eh if you would be so kind sire oh stop it gregor sighed i will play my assigned part as always thank you miles thought of offering some apology some solace then thought better of it the other wild card is randalls rangers who are now unless i miss my guess in considerable disarray their secondincommand has vanished their commander has deserted at the start of the actionhow was it the vervani let her make an exit by the way she told them she was going out to confer with youimplied shed somehow added you to her forces she was going to jump her fast courier to the hot side immediately thereafter supposedly hm she may have inadvertently paved our wayis she denying involvement with the cetagandans i dont think the vervani have caught on yet about the rangers opening the door to the cetagandans at the time we left vervain station they were still putting the rangers failures to defend the cetagandanside jump down to incompetence probably with considerable supporting evidence i doubt the bulk of the rangers knew about the betrayal or it couldnt have stayed secret this long and whatever inner cadre that was working with the cetas were left in the dark when cavilo took off on her imperial tangent you realize gregor you did this sabotaged the cetagandan invasion singlehandedly oh breathed gregor it took both hands miles decided not to touch that one anywayif we canwe need to lock the rangers down get them under control or at least out from behind everyones backs very well i suggest a round of goodguybadguy ill be happy to take the part of bad guy cavilo was brought in between two men with hand tractors she still wore her space armor now marred and scarred her helmet was gone the armors weapons packs had been removed control systems disconnected and joints locked turning it into a hundredkilo prison tight as a sarcophagus the two dendarii soldiers set her upright near the end of the conference table and stepped back with a flourish a statue with a live head some pygmalionlike metamorphosis interrupted and horribly incomplete thank you gentlemen dismissed said miles commander botharijesek please stay cavilo rolled her shortcropped blonde head in futile resistance the limit of physically possible motion she glared furiously at gregor as the soldiers exited you snake she snarled you bastard gregor sat with his elbows on the conference table chin resting in his hands he raised his head to say tiredly commander cavilo both my parents died violently in political intrigue before i was six years old a fact you might have researched did you think you were dealing with an amateur you were out of your league from the beginning cavilo said miles walking slowly around her as if inspecting his prize her head turned to follow him then had to swivel to pick up his orbit on the other side you should have stuck to your original contract or your second plan or your third you should in fact have stuck to something anything your total selfinterest didnt make you strong it made you a rag in the wind anybodys to pick up now gregorthough not ithinks you should be given a chance to earn your worthless life you havent got the balls to shove me out the airlock her eyes were slitted with her rage i wasnt planning to since it clearly made her skin crawl miles circled her again no looking aheadwhen this is overi thought i might give you to the cetagandans a treaty tidbit that will cost us nothing and help turn them up sweet i imagine theyll be looking for you dont you he fetched up before her and smiled her face drained the tendons stood out on her slender neck gregor spoke but if you do as we ask i will grant you safe passage out of the hegen hub via barrayar when this is over together with any surviving remnant of your forces that will still follow you it will give you a twomonth head start on the cetagandan vengeance for this debacle in fact put in miles if you play your part you could even come out of this a heroine what fun gregors glower at him was not entirely feigned ill get you cavilo breathed to miles its the best deal youll get today life salvage a new start far from herevery far from here that simon illyan will assure far away but not unwatched calculation began to edge out the rage in her eyes what do you want me to do not much yield up what control you still have of your forces to an officer of our choice probably a vervani liaison theyre paying for you after all you will introduce your replacement to your chain of command and retire to the safety of the triumphs brig for the duration there wont be any surviving remnant of the rangers when this is done there is that chance miles conceded you were going to throw them all away note please im not offering a choice between this and some better deal its this or the cetagandans whose approval of treason is strictly limited to those who deal in their favor cavilo looked like she wanted to spit but said very well i yield you have your deal thank you but you her eyes were chips of blue ice her voice low and venomous you will learn little man youre riding high today but time will bring you down id say just wait twenty years but i doubt youre going to live that long time will teach you how much nothing your loyalties will buy you the day they finally grind you up and spit you out im just sorry i wont be there to watch cause youre gonna be hamburger miles called the soldiers back in take her away it was almost a plea as the door closed behind the prisoner and her porters he turned to find elenas eyes upon him god that woman makes me cold he shivered ah gregor remarked elbows still planted yet in a weird way you seem to get along with each other you think alike gregor miles protested elena he called for a countervote youre both very twisty said elena doubtfully and er short at miless tightlipped look of outrage she explained its more a matter of pattern than content if you were powercrazy instead of of some other kind of crazy yes go on you could plot like that you seemed to kind of enjoy figuring her out thankyouithink he hunched his shoulders was it true could that be himself in twenty years sick with cynicism and unvented rage a shelled self thrilled only by mastery power games control armorplate with a wounded beast inside lets get back to the triumph he said shortly weve all got work to do miles paced impatiently across the short breadth of admiral osers cabin aboard triumph gregor leaned hipslung on the edge of the comconsole desk watching him oscillate naturally the vervani will be suspicious but with the cetagandans breathing down their necks theyll have a real will to believe and deal youll want to make it as attractive as possible to close things up quickly but of course dont give away any more than you have to gregor said dryly perhaps youd like to come along and operate my holoprompter miles stopped cleared his throat sorry i know you know more about treaties than i do i babble when im nervous sometimes yes i know miles managed to keep his mouth shut though not his feet still until the cabin buzzer blatted prisoners as ordered sir came sergeant chodaks voice over the intercom thank you enter miles leaned across the desk and hit the door control chodak and a squad marched captain ungari and sergeant overholt into the cabin the prisoners were indeed just as miles had ordered washed shaved combed and provided with fresh pressed dendarii greys with equivalent rank insignia they also looked palpably surly and hostile about it thank you sergeant you and your squad are dismissed dismissed chodaks eyebrows questioned the wisdom of this sure you dont want us to at least standto in the corridor sir remember the last time it wont be necessary this time ungaris glare denied that airy assertion chodak withdrew doubtfully keeping his stunneraim steady on the pair until the doors closed across his view ungari inhaled deeply vorkosigan you mutinous little mutant im going to have you courtmartialed skinned stuffed and mounted for this they had not yet noticed quiet gregor still leaning on the comconsole and also wearing courtesy dendarii greys though without insignia there being no dendarii equivalent for emperor uh sir miles motioned the darkfaced captains eye toward gregor those are such widely shared sentiments captain ungari that im afraid you might have to stand in line and wait your turn gregor remarked smiling slightly the remaining air went out of ungari unvoiced he braced to attention to his credit the uppermost of the wildly mixed emotions on his face was profound relief sire my apologies captain said miles for my highhanded treatment of you and sergeant overholt but i judged my plan for retrieving gregor too uh delicate for for your nerves i thought id better take personal responsibility you were happier not watching really and i was happier not having my elbow jogged ensigns dont have personal responsibility for operations of this magnitude their commanders do ungari snarled as simon illyan would have been the first to point out to me if your planhowever delicatehad failed well then congratulations sir you have just rescued the emperor snapped miles who as your commanderinchief has a few orders for you if you will permit him to get a word in edgewise ungaris teeth closed with visible effort he dismissed miles from his attention and focused on gregor sire gregor spoke as the only members of impsec within a couple million kilometersexcept for ensign vorkosigan who has other choresim attaching you and sergeant overholt to my person until we make contact with our reinforcements i may also require courier duties of you before we leave the triumph please share any pertinent intelligence you may possess with dendarii ops theyre now my imperial uh most obedient servants suggested miles under his breath forces gregor concluded consider that grey suit ungari glanced down at his with loathing regulation wear and respect it accordingly youll doubtless get your greens back when i get mine miles put in ill be detaching the dendarii light cruiser ariel and the faster of our two fast couriers to gregors personal service when you depart for vervain station if you have to split off on courier duties i suggest you take the smaller ship and leave the ariel with gregor its captain bel thorne is my most trusted dendarii shipmaster still thinking about my line of retreat eh miles gregor raised a brow at him miles bowed slightly if things go very wrong someone must live to avenge us not to mention to make damn sure the dendarii survivors get paid we owe them that much i think yes gregor agreed softly i also have my personal report on recent events for you to deliver to simon illyan miles went on in case iin case you see him before i do miles handed ungari a data disk ungari looked dizzy at this rapid reordering of his priorities vervain station pol six is where your safety lies surely sire vervain station is where my duty lies captain and perforce yours come along ill explain it all as we go are you leaving vorkosigan loose ungari frowned at miles with these mercenaries i have a problem with that sire im sorry sir said miles to ungari that i cannot cannot obey you but miles left that unsaid i have a deeper problem with arranging a battle for these mercenaries and then not showing up for it a difference between myself and the rangers former commander there must be some difference between us maybe thats it grethe emperor understands hm said gregor yes captain ungari i officially detach ensign vorkosigan as our dendarii liaison on my personal responsibility which should be sufficient even for you its not me that it has to be sufficient for sire gregor hesitated fractionally for barrayars best interests then a sufficient argument even for simon let us go captain sergeant overholt miles added you will be the emperors personal bodyguard and batman until relieved overholt looked anything but relieved at this abrupt field promotion sir he whispered aside to miles i havent had the advanced course he referred to simon illyans mandatory personallyconducted impsec course for the palace guard that gave gregors usual crew that hardpolished edge we all have a similar problem here sergeant believe me miles murmured back do your best the triumphs tactics room was alive with activity every station chair occupied every holovid display bright with the flow of ship and fleet tactical changes miles stood at tungs elbow and felt doubly redundant he bethought of the jape back at the academy rule only overrule the tactical computer if you know something it doesnt rule the tac comp always knows more than you do this was combat this muffled chamber swirl of lights these padded chairs maybe the detachment was a good thing for commanders his heart hammered even now a tac room of this caliber could cause information overload and mindlock if you let it the trick was to pick out what was important and never ever to forget that the map was not the territory his job here miles reminded himself was not to command it was to watch tung command and learn how he did it his alternate modes of thinking to barrayaran academy standard miless only legitimate point of overrule might come if some external politicalstrategic need took precedence over internal tactical logic miles prayed that event would not arise because a shorter and uglier name for it was betraying your troops miless attention sharpened as a little jumpscout winked into existence at the throat of the wormhole on the tactics display it was a pink point of light in a slowly moving whirlpool of darkness on a telescreen it was a slim ship against fixed and distant stars from its own wiredin pilots point of view it was some strange extension of his own body in yet another vid display it was a collection of telemetry readouts numerology some platonic ideal what is truth all none sharkbait one reporting to fleet one the pilots voice came over tungs console you have ten minutes clearance stand by for tightbeam burst tung spoke into his comm fleet commence jump tight by the numbers the first dendarii ship waiting by the wormhole jockeyed into place glowed brightly in the tac display though it appeared to do nothing in the televid and vanished a second ship followed in thirty seconds pushing the safety limit of time margins between jumps two ships trying to rematerialize in the same place at the same time would result in no ships and a very large explosion as the sharkbaits tightbeam telemetry was digested by the tac comp the image rotated so that the dark vortex representing but in no way picturing the wormhole was suddenly mirrored by an exit vortex beyond that exit vortex an array of dots and specks and lines represented ships in flight maneuvering firing fleeing the hardened homeside battle station of the vervani twin to the hubside station where miles had left gregor the cetagandan attackers a view of their destination at last all lies of course it was minutes out of date yech tung commented what a mess here we go the jump klaxon sounded it was the triumphs turn miles gripped the back of tungs chair though intellectually he knew the feeling of motion was illusory a whirl of dreams seemed to cloud his mind for a moment for an hour it was unmeasurable the wrench in his stomach and the godawful wave of nausea that followed were anything but dreamlike jump over a moment of silence throughout the room as others struggled to overcome their disorientation then the murmur picked up where it had left off welcome to vervain take a wormhole jump to hell the tac display spun and shifted shunting in new data recentering its little universe their wormhole was presently guarded by its beleaguered station and a thin and battered string of vervani navy and vervanicommanded ranger ships the cetagandans had hit it once already been driven off and now hovered out of range awaiting reinforcements for the next strike cetagandan resupply was streaming across the vervain system from the other wormhole the other wormhole had fallen fast the only way to fly from the attackers viewpoint even with complete surprise on the cetagandans side for their massive first strike the vervani might have stopped them had not three ranger ships apparently misunderstood their orders and broken off when they should have counterattacked but the cetagandans had secured their bridgehead and begun to pour through the second wormhole miless wormhole had been better equipped for defenseuntil the panicked vervani had pulled everything that could be spared back to guard the high orbitals of the homeworld miles could scarcely blame them it was a hard strategic choice either way but now the cetagandans boiled across the system practically unimpeded hopscotching the heavily guarded planet in a bold attempt to take the hegen wormhole if not by surprise at least at speed the first method of choice for attacking a wormhole was by subterfuge subornment and infiltration ie to cheat the second also preferring subterfuge in its execution was by an endrun sending forces around by another route if there was one into the contested local space the third was to open the attack with a sacrifice ship laying down a sun wall a massive blanket of nuclear missilettes deployed as a unit creating a planar wave that cleared nearspace of everything including frequently the attack ship but sun walls were costly rapidly dissipated and only locally effective the cetagandans had attempted to combine all three methods as the rangers disarray and the filthy radioactive fog still outgassing from the vicinity of their first conquest testified the fourth approved approach for the problem of frontally attacking a guarded wormhole was to shoot the officer who suggested it miles trusted the cetagandans would work around to that one too by the time he was done time passed miles hooked a station chair into clamps and studied the central display till his eyes watered and his mind threatened to fall into a hypnotic fugue then rose and shook himself and circulated among the duty stations kibbitzing the cetagandans maneuvered the sudden and unexpected arrival of the dendarii force during the lull had thrown them into temporary confusion their planned final attack on the strained vervani must needs be converted on the fly into yet another softeningup round of hitandrun expensive at this point the cetagandans had few ways of concealing their numbers or movements the defending dendarii had the implication of hidden reserves who knew how unlimited not miles certainly concealed on the other side of the jump a brief hope flared in miles that this threat alone might be enough to make the cetagandans break off the attack naw sighed tung when miles confided this optimistic thought theyre too far into it now the butchers bills too high already for them to pretend they were only fooling even to themselves a cetagandan commander who packed it in now would go home to a court martial theyll keep going long after its hopeless as their brass tries desperately to cover their bleeding asses with a flag of victory that is vile that is the system son and not just for the cetagandans one of the systems several builtin defects and besides tung grinned briefly its not as hopeless as all that yet a fact we will try to conceal from them the cetagandan forces began to move their directions and accelerations telegraphing their intention for a pounding pass the trick was to try for local concentrations of force three or four ships ganging up on one overwhelming the defenders plasma mirrors the dendarii and vervani would attempt an identical strategy against cetagandan stragglers but for a few bravura captains on both sides equipped with the new imploder lances playing an insane game of chicken trying to put a target within the weapons short range miles also tried to keep one eye on the rangers dispositions not every ranger ship had vervani advisors aboard and battle arrays that put the rangers in front of the cetagandans were much to be preferred to ones that put rangers behind dendarii backs the quiet murmur of techs and computers within the tactics room scarcely changed pace there ought to be a flourish of drums bagpipes something to herald this dance with death but if reality broke in at all to this upholstered bubble it would be sudden absolute and over a vidcomm message interrupted intrashipyes there was still a real ship encasing thema breathless officer reporting to tung brig sir watch yourselves up there weve had a breakout admiral osers escaped and he let all the other prisoners out too dammit said tung glared at miles and pointed to the comm handle that jack up auson he turned his attention back to his tactics display muttering this wouldnt have happened in my day miles slipped into the comm chair and paged the triumphs bridge auson did you get the word on oser ausons irritated face appeared yeah were working on it order extra commando guards to the tactics room engineering and your own bridge this is a real bad time for interruptions down here tell me we can see the ceta bastards coming auson punched off miles began monitoring internal security channels pausing only to note the arrival of wellarmed guards in the corridor oser had clearly had help in his escape some loyal oseran officer or officers which made miles wonder in turn about the security of the security guards and would oser try to combine with metzov and cavilo a couple of dendarii imprisoned for disciplinary infractions were found wandering the corridors and returned to the brig another came back on his own a suspected spy was cornered in a storeroom no sign yet of the truly dangerous there he goes miles keyed in the channel a cargo shuttle was breaking out of its clamps away from the side of the triumph and into space miles overrode channels found fire control dont repeat do not open fire on that shuttle uh came the reply yes sir do not open fire why did miles get the subliminal impression that tech hadnt been planning to open fire in the first place clearly a wellcoordinated escape the witchhunt later was going to be nasty patch me through to that shuttle miles demanded of the comm officer and oh yes send a guard to the shuttle hatch corridors too late ill try sir but theyre not answering how many aboard several but were not sure exactly patch me through theyve got to listen even if they wont reply i have a channel sir but i have no idea if theyre listening ill try it miles took a breath admiral oser turn your shuttle around and come back to the triumph its too dangerous out there youre running headlong into a fire zone return and i will personally guarantee your safety tung was looking down over miless shoulder hes trying to make it to the peregrine dammit if that ship pulls out our defensive array will collapse miles glanced back at the tac comp surely not i thought we put the peregrine in the reserve area precisely because we doubted its reliability yes but if the peregrine pulls out i can name three other captainowners who will follow it and if four ships pull out the rangers will break despite their vervani commander and well be cooked right i see miles glanced again at the tac comp i dont think hes going to make itadmiral oser can you read me yike tung returned to his seat absorbed in the cetagandans once again four cetagandan ships were combining against the edge of the dendarii formation while another attempted to penetrate the center clearly trying to close the range for a lance attack casually in passing a cetagandan plasma gunner from it picked off the stray shuttle just bright sparks he didnt know the cetagandans were making their attack run till his stolen shuttle cleared the triumph miles whispered good plan rotten timing he could have turned around he chose to try and run for it oser chose his death was that the comforting argument the cetagandans did not so much break off their attack run as complete it in depressingly good order the score was slightly in the dendariis favor a number of cetagandan ships had been badly chewed and one blown up entirely dendarii and ranger damage control channels were frantic the dendarii had not lost ships yet but had lost firepower engines flight control life support shielding the next attack run would be more devastating they can afford to lose three to our one if they keep coming keep nibbling they must inevitably win miles reflected coldly unless we are reinforced hours passed while the cetagandans formed up again miles took short breaks in the wardroom provided for that purpose off the tactics room but was too keyed up to emulate tungs amazing fifteenminute instant naps miles knew tung wasnt faking relaxation for morale effect nobody could simulate such a disgusting snore it was possible to watch the cetagandan reinforcements coming on across the vervain system in the televid that was the time tradeoff the risk the longer the cetas waited the betterequipped they could be but the longer they waited the better the chance that their enemies would recover too there was doubtless a tac comp aboard the cetagandan command ship that had generated a probability curve marking the optimum intersection of us and them if only the damned vervani would be more aggressive in attacking that supply stream from their planetary base and here they came on again tung watched his displays his hands unconsciously clenching and unclenching in his lap between jerky thickfingered dances on his control panel sending orders correcting anticipating miless fingers twitched in tiny echoes his mind trying to get around tungs thought to absorb everything their picture of reality was getting lacy with hidden holes as data points dropped out due to damaged sensors or senders on various ships the cetagandans flew through the dendarii formation pounding a dendarii ship blew apart another weapons dead tried to scramble out of range three ranger ships broke away as a unit it looked bad sharkbait three reporting an abrupt voice overrode all other comm channels making miles jump in his seat hold this wormhole clear help coming not now snarled tung but began to attempt a rapid redeployment to cover the tiny volume of space keep it clear of debris missiles enemy fire and most of all enemy ships with imploder lances those cetagandan ships that were in position to respond seemed almost to prick their ears hesitating as dendarii ship movements telegraphed changes coming the dendarii might be in retreat some exploitable opportunity might be about to open up whatinhells that tung said as something huge and temporarily indecipherable appeared in the throat of the wormhole and began instantly to accelerate he punched up readouts its too big to be that fast ks too fast to be that big miles recognized the energy profile even before the televiewer yielded up a visual what a shakedown cruise theyre having its the prince serg our barrayaran imperial reinforcements have just arrived he took a dizzy breath did i not promise you tung swore horribly in pure aesthetic admiration other ships followed aslunder polian navy spreading out rapidly into attack not defensiveformation the ripple in the cetagandan formations was like a silent cry of dismay an imploderarmed cetagandan ship dove bravely at the prince serg and was sliced in half discovering that the sergs imploder lances had been improved to triple the cetagandans range that was the first mortal blow the second came over the commlink a call to the cetagandan aggressors to surrender or be destroyedin the name of the hegen alliance navy emperor gregor vorbarra and admiral count aral vorkosigan joint commanders for a moment miles thought tung was about to faint tung inhaled alarmingly and bellowed with delight aral vorkosigan here hot damn and in an only slightly more private whisper howd they lure him out of retirement maybe ill get to meet him tung the military history nut was one of miless fathers most fanatical fans miles recalled and until and unless firmly suppressed could rattle off every public detail of the barrayaran admirals early campaigns ill see what i can arrange miles promised if you can arrange that son with an effort tung pulled his mind away from his beloved hobby of studying military history and back to his admittedly closely related job of making it the cetagandan ships were breaking first in panicked singles and then in more coordinated groups trying to organize a properly covered retreat the prince serg and its support group did not waste a millisecond but followed up instantly attacking and disordering attempted selfcovering arrays of enemy ships worrying the resulting stragglers in the ensuing hours the retreat became a true rout when the vervani ships protecting their high planetary orbitals encouraged at last broke orbit and joined the attack the vervani reserve was merciless in the terror for their homes the cetagandans had instilled in them the moppingup detail the appalling damage control problems the personnel rescues were so absorbing that it took miles those several hours to gradually realize the war was over for the dendarii fleet they had done their job before departing the tactics room miles prudently checked with the triumphs security to determine how their roundup of escaped prisoners was progressing missing and still unaccounted for remained oser the peregrines captain and two other loyal oseran officers commander cavilo and general metzov miles was fairly certain he had witnessed oser and his officers converted to radioactive ash in his monitors had metzov and cavilo been aboard that fleeing shuttle too fine irony for cavilo to die at the hands of the cetagandans after all thoughadmittedlyit would have been equally ironic had she died at the hands of the vervani randalls rangers the aslunders the barrayarans or anyone else shed doublecrossed in her brief cometary career in the hegen hub her end was neat and convenient if true buthe didnt like to think that her last savage remarks to him had now acquired the prophetic weight of a dying curse he ought to fear metzov more than cavilo he ought to but he didnt he shuddered and borrowed a commando guard for the walk back to his cabin on the way he encountered a shuttleload of wounded being transferred to the triumphs sickbay the triumph in the reserve group such as it was had taken no hits its shields couldnt handle but other ships had not been so fortunate space battle casualty lists usually had the proportions reversed from planetary the dead outnumbering the wounded yet in lucky circumstances where the artificial environment was preserved soldiers might survive their injuries uncertainly miles changed course and followed the procession along what good could he do in sickbay the triage people had not sent minor cases to the triumph three hideous burns and a massive head injury went to the head of the line and were whisked off by the anxiously waiting staff a few soldiers were conscious quietly waiting their turns immobilized with air bag braces on their float pallets eyes cloudy with pain and painkillers miles tried to say a few words to each some stared uncomprehendingly some seemed to appreciate it he lingered a little longer with these giving what encouragement he could he then withdrew and stood dumbly by the door for several minutes awash in the familiar terrifying odors of a sickbay after a battle disinfectants and blood burnt meat urine and electronics until he realized exhaustion was making him thoroughly stupid and useless shaky and neartears he pushed off from the wall and stumped out bed if anyone really wanted his command presence they could come find him he hit the code lock on osers cabin now that hed inherited it he supposed he ought to change the numbers he sighed and entered as he stepped inside he became conscious of two unfortunate facts first although he had dismissed his commando guard upon entering sickbay he had forgotten to call him back and second he was not alone the door closed behind him before he could recoil into the corridor and he banged into it backing up the dusky red hue of general metzovs face was even more arresting to the eye than the silver gleam of the nerve disrupter parabola in his hand aim centered on miless head metzov had somehow acquired a set of dendarii greys a little small for him commando cavilo standing behind metzov had acquired a similar set a little large for her metzov looked huge and furious cavilo looked strange bitter ironic weirdly amused bruises marred her neck she bore no weapon got you metzov whispered triumphantly at last with a rictus smile he advanced stepwise on miles till he could pin him to the wall by his neck with one big hand he dropped the nerve disrupter with a clatter and wrapped the other hand around miless neck not to break but to squeeze it youll never survive was all miles managed to choke out before his air pinched off he could feel his trachea begin to crunch purpling his head felt on the verge of dark explosion as his blood supply was cut off no talking metzov out of this murder cavilo slipped forward crouching soundless and unnoticed as a cat to take up the dropped nerve disrupter then step back around to miless left stanis darling she cooed metzov obsessed with miless lingering strangulation did not turn his head cavilo clearly imitating metzovs cadences recited open your legs to me you bitch or ill blow your brains out metzovs head twisted round then his eyes widening she blew his brains out the crackling blue bolt hit him square between the eyes he almost snapped miless neck plasticreinforced though those bones were in his last convulsion before he dropped to the deck the blistering electrochemical smell of nervedisruptor death slapped miles in the face miles sagged frozen against the wall not daring to move he raised his eyes from the corpse to cavilo her lips were curved in a smile of immense satisfaction satiated had cavilos line been a direct and recent quote what had they been doing all the long hours they must have been waiting in the hunters blind of osers cabin the silence lengthened not miles swallowed trying to clear his bruised throat and croaked not that im complaining mind you but why arent you going ahead and shooting me too cavilo smirked a quick revenge is better than none a slow and lingering one is better still but to savor it fully i must survive it another day kid she tilted the nerve disrupter up as if to flourish it into a holster then let it hang pointed down by her side in her relaxed hand youve sworn youll see me safe out of the hegen hub vor lord and ive come to believe you are actually stupid enough to keep your word not that im complaining mind you now if oser had issued more than one weapon between us or if hed given the nerve disrupter to me and the code to his cabin to stanis and not the other way around or if oserd taken us with him as i begged things might have worked out differently very differently very slowly and very very carefully miles inched over to the comconsole and called security cavilo watched him thoughtfully after a few moments coming up on the time they might expect the reinforcements to storm in she strolled over to his side i underestimated you you know i never underestimated you i know im not used to that thank you contemptuously she tossed the nerve disrupter onto metzovs body then with a sudden baring of her teeth she wheeled wrapped an arm around miless neck and kissed him vigorously her timing was perfect security elena and sergeant chodak in the lead burst through the door just before miles managed to fight her off miles stepped from the triumphs shuttle through the short flex tube and on board the prince serg he stared around enviously at the clean spacious beautifullylit corridor at the row of smart and gleaming honor guards snapping to attention at the polished officers waiting in their barrayaran imperial dress greens he stole an anxious glance down at his own dendarii greyandwhites the triumph key and pride of the dendarii fleet seemed to shrink into something small and gritty and battered and used yeah but you guys would not look so pretty now if we had not used ourselves so hard miles consoled himself tung elena and chodak were all goggling like tourists too miles called them firmly to attention to receive and return the crisp welcoming salutes of their hosts im commander natochini executive officer of the prince serg the senior barrayaran introduced himself lieutenant yegorov here will escort you and commander botharijesek to admiral vorkosigan for your meeting admiral naismith commodore tung i will be personally conducting your tour of the prince serg and will be pleased to answer any of your questions if the answers arent classified of course of course tungs broad face looked immensely pleased in fact if tung grew any smugger he might implode we will join admiral vorkosigan for lunch in the senior officers mess after your meeting and our tour commander natochini continued to miles our last dinner guest there was the president of pol and his entourage twelve days ago certain that the mercenaries understood the magnitude of the privilege they were being granted the barrayaran exec led the happy tung and chodak off down the corridor miles heard tung chuckle under his breath lunch with admiral vorkosigan heh heh lieutenant yegorov motioned miles and elena in the opposite direction you are barrayaran maam he inquired of elena my father was liegesworn armsman to the late count piotr for eighteen years elena stated he died in the counts service i see said the lieutenant respectfully you are acquainted with the family then that explains you miles could almost see him thinking ah yes the lieutenant glanced down a little more dubiously at admiral naismith and uh i understand you are betan sir originally said miles in his flattest betan accent you may find the way we barrayarans do things to be a little more formal than what youre used to the lieutenant warned the count you understand is accustomed to the respect and deference due his rank miles watched delighted as the earnest officer sought a polite way of saying call him sir dont wipe your nose on your sleeve and none of your damned betan egalitarian backchat either you may find him rather formidable yegorov concluded a real stuffed shirt eh the lieutenant frowned he is a great man aw i bet if we pour enough wine into him at lunch hell loosen up and tell dirty stories with the best of em yegorovs polite smile became fixed elena eyes dancing leaned down and whispered forcefully admiral behave oh all right miles sighed regretfully the lieutenant glanced gratefully at elena over miless head miles admired the spit and polish in passing besides just being new the prince serg had been designed with diplomacy as well as war in mind a ship fit to carry the emperor on state visits without loss of military efficiency he saw a young ensign down a crosscorridor that had a wall panel apart directing some tech crew on minor repairsno by god it was original installation the prince serg had broken orbit with work crews still aboard miles had heard he glanced back over his shoulder there but for the grace of god and general metzov go i if hed kept his nose clean on kyril island for just six months he felt an illogical twinge of envy for that busy ensign they entered officers country lieutenant yegorov led them through an antechamber and into a spartanlyappointed flag office twice the size of anything miles had seen on a barrayaran ship before admiral count aral vorkosigan looked up from his comconsole desk as the doors slid silently back miles stepped through his belly suddenly shaking inside to conceal and control his emotion he tossed off hey you imperial snails are going to go all fat and soft lolling around in this kind of luxury yknow ha admiral vorkosigan stumbled out of his chair and banged around the corner of his desk in his haste well no wonder how can he see with all that water standing in his eyes he enfolded miles in a hard embrace miles grinned and blinked and swallowed face smashed against that cool green sleeve and almost had control of his features again when count vorkosigan held him out at arms length for an anxious searching inspection you all right boy just fine howd you like your wormhole jump just fine breathed count vorkosigan back mind you there were moments when certain of my advisors wanted to have you shot and there were moments when i agreed with em lieutenant yegorov cut off in midannouncement of their arrival miles hadnt heard him speaking and he doubted his father had either was standing with his mouth still open looking perfectly stunned lieutenant jole suppressing a grin himself arose from the other side of the comconsole desk and guided yegorov gently and mercifully back out the door thank you lieutenant the admiral appreciates your services that will be all jole glanced back over his shoulder quirked a pensive brow and followed yegorov out miles just glimpsed the blond lieutenant drape himself across a chair in the antechamber head back in the relaxed posture of a man anticipating a long wait before the door slid closed jole could be supernaturally courteous at times elena with an effort count vorkosigan broke away from miles to take both elenas hands in a firm brief grip you are well yes sir that pleases me more than i can say cordelia sends her love and her best hopes if i saw you i was to remind you ahi must get the phrase exact it was one of her betan crackshome is where when you have to go there they have to take you in i can hear her voice smiled elena tell her thank you tell her i will remember good count vorkosigan pressed her no further sit sit he waved them at chairs which he snugged up closed to the comconsole desk and sat himself for an instant changing gears his features relaxed then concentrated with attention once again god he looks tired miles realized for a split second almost ghastly gregor you have much to answer for but gregor knew that whats the latest word on the ceasefire miles asked still holding nicely thank you the only cetagandan ships that havent jumped back where they came from had damaged necklin rods or control systems or injured pilots or all three were letting them repair two of them and jump them out with skeleton crews the rest are not salvageable i estimate controlled commercial travel could resume in six weeks miles shook his head so ends the fiveday war i never once saw a cetagandan facetoface all that effort and bloodshed just to return to the status quo ante not quite for everyone a number of cetagandan senior officers have been recalled to their capital to explain their unauthorized adventure to their emperor their apologies are expected to be fatal miles snorted expiate their failure rather unauthorized adventure does anyone believe that why do they even bother finesse boy a retreating enemy should be offered all the face he can carry off just dont let him carry off anything else i understand you finessed the polians all this time i expected it would be simon illyan to show up in person to haul us lost boys home he longed to come but there was no way we could both leave home at the same time the wobbly cover wed put over gregors absence could have collapsed at any moment how did you pull that one off by the way picked out a young officer who looked a lot like gregor told him there was an assassination plot afoot against the emperor and that he was to be the bait bless him he volunteered at once heand his security who had the same tale told themspent the next several weeks leading a life of ease down at vorkosigan surleau eating off the best platesbut with indigestion we finally sent him off on a rustic camping trip as inquiries from the capital were getting pressing people will twig soon im sure if they havent already but now weve got gregor back we can explain it away any way we like any way he likes count vorkosigan frowned an odd brief frown odd because not wholly displeased i was surprised said miles though very happy that you got your forces past pol so fast i was afraid they wouldnt let you through till the cetagandans were in the hub and then it would be too late yes well thats the other reason you got me instead of simon as prime minister and former regent it was perfectly reasonable for me to make a state visit to pol we came up with a quick list of the top five diplomatic concessions theyve been wanting from us for years and suggested it for an agenda it being all formal and official and aboveboard it was then perfectly reasonable for us to combine my visit with the prince sergs shakedown cruise we were in orbit at pol shuttling up and down to official receptions and parties his hand unconsciously rubbed his abdomen in a painwarding motion with me still trying desperately to talk our way into the hub without shooting anybody when word of the cetagandan surprise attack on vervain broke at that point getting permission to proceed was suddenly expedited and we were only days not weeks away from the action getting the aslunders to lie down with the polians was a trickier matter gregor astonished me handling that the vervani were no problem they were highly motivated to seek allies by then i hear gregor is now quite popular on vervain hes being feted in their capital even as we speak i believe count vorkosigan glanced at his chrono theyve gone wild over him letting him ride shotgun in the prince sergs tac room may have been a better idea that i thought purely from a diplomatic standpoint count vorkosigan looked rather abstracted it astonished me that you permitted him to jump with you into the fire zone i hadnt expected that well when you came down to it the prince sergs fleet tac room had to have been among the most tightly defended few cubic meters anywhere in vervain local space it was it was miles watched with fascination as his father tried to spit out the words perfectly safe and gagged on them instead light dawned it wasnt your idea was it gregor ordered himself aboard he had several good arguments to support his position court vorkosigan said the propaganda angle certainly seems to be bearing fruit i thought youd be too prudent to permit him the risk count vorkosigan studied his own square hands i was not in love with the idea no but i once swore an oath to serve an emperor the most morally dangerous moment for a guardian is when the temptation to become a puppetmaster seems most rational i always knew the moment must no i knew that if the moment never came i should have failed my oath most profoundly he paused it was still a shock to the system though the lettinggo gregor faced you down oh to have been a fly on the wall of that chamber even with you to practice on all these years count vorkosigan added meditatively ah hows your ulcers count vorkosigan grimaced dont ask he brightened slightlybetter the last three days i may actually demand food for lunch instead of that miserable medical mush miles cleared his throat hows captain ungari count vorkosigan twitched a lip hes not overly pleased with you i cannot apologize i made a lot of mistakes but disobeying his order to wait on aslund station wasnt one of them apparently not count vorkosigan frowned at the far wall and yet im more than ever convinced the regular service is not the place for you its like trying to fit a square pegno worse than that like trying to fit a tesseract into a round hole miles suppressed a twinge of panic i wont be discharged will i elena regarded her fingernails and put in if you were you could get a job as a mercenary just like general metzov i understand commander cavilo is looking for a few good men miles nearly meowed at her she traded a smirk for his exasperated look i was almost sorry to learn that metzov was killed remarked count vorkosigan wed been planning to try and extradite him before things went crazy with gregors disappearance ah did you finally decide the death of that komarran prisoner way back when during their revolt was murder i thought it might be count vorkosigan held up two fingers two murders miles paused my god he didnt try and track down poor ahn before he left did he hed almost forgotten ahn no but we tracked him down though not alas before metzov had left barrayar and yes the komarran rebel had been tortured to death not wholly intentionally he apparently had had some hidden medical weakness but it was not as the original investigator had suspected in revenge for the death of the guard it was the other way around the barrayaran guard corporal who had participated in or at least acquiesced to the torture though over some feeble protest according to ahnthe corporal suffered a revulsion of feeling and threatened to turn metzov in metzov murdered him in one of his panicrages then made ahn help him cook up and vouch for the cover story about the escape so ahn was twice tainted with the thing metzov kept ahn in terror yet was equally in ahns power if the facts ever came out a kind of strange lock on each other which ahn at last escaped ahn seemed almost relieved and volunteered to be fastpentad when illyans agents came for him miles thought of the weatherman with regret will anything bad happen to ahn now wed planned to make him testify at metzovs trial illyan thought we might even turn it to our favor with respect to the komarrans present that poor idiot guard corporal to them as an unsung hero hang metzov as proof of the emperors good faith and commitment to justice for barrayarans and komarrans alike nice scenario count vorkosigan frowned bitterly i think we will quietly drop it now again miles puffed out his breath metzov a goat to the end must be some bad karma clinging to him not that he didnt earn it beware of wishing for justice you might get it ive already learned that sir already count vorkosigan cocked an eyebrow at him hm speaking of justice miles seized the opening im concerned over the matter of dendarii pay they took a lot of damage more than a mercenary fleet will usually tolerate their only contract was my breath and voice if if the imperium does not back me i will be forsworn count vorkosigan smiled slightly we have already considered the matter will illyans covert ops budget stretch to cover this illyans budget would burst trying to cover this but you ah seem to have a friend in a high place we will draw you an emergency credit chit from impsec this fleets fund and the emperors privy purse and hope to recoup it all later from a special appropriation rammed through the council of ministers and the council of counts submit a bill miles fished a data disk from his pocket here sir from the dendarii fleet accountant she was up all night some damage estimates are still preliminary he set it on the comconsole desk one corner of count vorkosigans mouth twisted up youre learning boy he inserted the disk in his desk for a fast scan ill have a credit chit prepared over lunch you can take it with you when you depart thank you sir sir elena put in leaning forward earnestly what will happen to the dendarii fleet now whatever it chooses i presume though they cannot linger this close to barrayar are we to be abandoned again asked elena abandoned you made us an imperial force once i thought baz thought then miles left us and then nothing just like kyril island miles remarked out of sight out of mind he shrugged dolefully i gather they suffered a similar deterioration of morale count vorkosigan gave him a sharp look the fate of the dendarii like your future military career milesis a matter still under discussion do i get to be in on that discussion do they well let you know count vorkosigan planted his hands on his desktop and rose thats all i can say now even to you lunch officers miles and elena perforce rose too commodore tung knows nothing of our real relationship yet miles cautioned if you wish to keep that covert im going to have to play admiral naismith when we rejoin him count vorkosigans smile turned peculiar illyan and captain ungari must certainly favor not breaking a potentially useful cover identity by all means should be fascinating i should warn you admiral naismith is not very deferential elena and count vorkosigan looked at each other and both broke into laughter miles waited wrapped in what dignity he could muster till they subsided finally admiral naismith was painfully polite during lunch even lieutenant yegorov could have found no fault the vervani government courier handed the credit chit across the homeside station commandants comconsole desk miles testified receipt of it with thumbprint retina scan and admiral naismiths flourishing illegible scrawl nothing at all like ensign vorkosigans careful signature its a pleasure doing business with you honorable gentlemen miles said pocketing the chit with satisfaction and carefully sealing the pocket its the least we can do said the jumppoint station commandant i cannot tell you my emotions knowing that the next pass the cetagandans made was going to be their last nerving to fight to the end when the dendarii materialized to reinforce us the dendarii couldnt have done it alone said miles modestly all we did was help you hold the bridgehead till the real big guns arrived and if it had not been held the hegen alliance forcesthe big guns as you saycould not have jumped into vervani local space not without great cost certainly miles conceded the station commandant glanced at his chrono well my planet will be expressing its opinion of that in more tangible form quite shortly may i escort you to the ceremony admiral its time thank you miles rose and preceded him out of his office his hand rechecking the tangible thanks in his pocket medals huh medals buy no fleet repairs he paused at a transparent portal caught half by the vista from the jump station and half by his own reflection oserandendarii dress greys were all right he decided soft grey velvet tunic set off with blinding white trim and silver buttons on the shoulders matching trousers and grey synthasuede boots he fancied the outfit made him look taller perhaps he would keep the design beyond the portal floated a scattering of ships dendarii ranger vervani and alliance the prince serg was not among them being now in orbit above the vervani homeworld while highlevelliterallytalks continued hammering out the details of the permanent treaty of friendship commerce tariff reduction mutual defense pact etc among barrayar vervain aslund and pol gregor miles had heard was being quite luminous in both the public relations and the actual nuts and bolts part of the business better you than me boy the vervani jumppoint station was letting its own repairs schedule slacken to lend aid to the dendarii baz was working around the clock miles tore himself away from the vista and followed the station commandant they paused in the corridor outside the large briefing room where the ceremony was to take place waiting for the attendees to settle the vervani apparently wished the principals to make a grand entrance the commandant went in to prepare the audience was not largetoo much vital work going onbut the vervani had scraped up enough warm bodies to make it look respectable and miles had contributed a platoon of convalescent dendarii to fluff up the crowd he would accept on their behalf in his speech he decided as miles waited he saw commander cavilo arrive with her barrayaran honor guard as far as he knew the vervani were not yet aware that the honorguards weapons were lethally charged and they had orders to shoot to kill if their prisoner attempted escape two hardfaced women in barrayaran auxiliary uniforms made sure cavilo was watched both night and day cavilo did a good job of ignoring their presence the ranger dress uniform was a neater version of their fatigues in tan black and white subliminally reminding miles of a guard dogs fur this bitch bites he reminded himself cavilo smiled and drifted up to miles she reeked of her poisonous greenscented perfume she must have bathed in it miles tilted his head in salute reached into a pocket and took out two nose filters he thrust one up each nostril where they expanded softly to create a seal and inhaled deeply to test them working fine they would filter out much smaller molecules than the vile organics of that damned perfume miles breathed out through his mouth cavilo watched this performance with an expression of thwarted fury damn you she muttered miles shrugged palms out as if to say what would you have of me are you and your survivors about ready to move out right after this idiot charade i have to abandon six ships too damaged to jump sensible of you if the vervani dont catch on to you soon the cetagandans when they realize they cant get at you themselves will probably tell them the ugly truth you shouldnt linger in these parts i dont intend to if i never see this place again it will be too soon that goes double for you mutant if not for you she shook her head bitterly by the way miles added the dendarii have now been paid three times for this operation once by our original contractors the aslunders once by the barrayarans and once by the grateful vervani each agreed to cover all our expenses in full leaves a very tidy profit she actually hissed you better pray we never meet again goodbye then they entered the chamber to collect their honors would cavilo have the iron nerve to accept hers on behalf of the rangers her twisted plots had destroyed yes it turned out miles gagged quietly the first medal i ever won miles thought as the station commandant pinned his on him with embarrassingly fulsome praise and i cant even wear it at home the medal the uniform and admiral naismith himself must soon return to the closet forever the life of ensign vorkosigan was not too attractive by comparison and yet the mechanics of soldiering was the same from side to side if there was any difference between himself and cavilo it must be in what they chose to serve and how they chose to serve itnot all paths but one path when miles arrived back on barrayar for home leave a few weeks later gregor invited him for lunch at the imperial residence they sat at a wroughtiron table in the north gardens which were famous for having been designed by emperor ezar gregors grandfather in summer the spot would be deeply shaded now it was laced with light filtering through young leaves rippling in the soft airs of spring the guards did their guarding out of sight and servants waited out of earshot unless gregor touched his pager replete with the first three courses miles sipped scalding coffee and plotted an assault on a second pastry which cowered across the table linen under a thick camouflage of cream or would that overmatch his forces this had it all over the contract slave rations theyd once divided not to mention cavilos doggie chews even gregor seemed to be seeing it all with new eyes space stations are really boring yknow all those corridors he commented staring out past a fountain eye following a curving brick path that dove into a riot of flowers i stopped seeing how beautiful barrayar was looking at it every day had to forget to remember strange there were moments i couldnt remember which space station i was on miles agreed around a mouthful of pastry and cream the luxury trades another matter but the hegen hub stations did tend to the utilitarian he grimaced at the association of that last word the conversation wandered over the recent events in the hegen hub gregor brightened upon learning that miles had never issued an actual battle order in the triumphs fleet tac room either except to handle the internal security crisis as delegated by tung most officers have finished their jobs when the action begins because the battle transpires too rapidly for the officers to affect it miles assured him once you set up a good tac compand if youre lucky a man with a magic noseits better to keep your hands in your pockets i had tung you had ahem and nice deep pockets said gregor im still thinking about it it seemed almost unreal till i visited sickbay afterwards and realized suchandsuch a point of light meant this mans arm lost that mans lungs frozen gotta watch out for those little lights they tell such soothing lies miles agreed if you let them he chased another gooey bite with coffee paused and remarked you didnt tell illyan the truth about your topple off the balcony did you it was observation not question i told him i was drunk and climbed down gregor watched the flowers how did you know he doesnt talk about you with secret terror in his eyes ive just got him giving a little i dont want to screw it up now you didnt tell him eitherfor that i thank you youre welcome miles drank more coffee do me a favor in return talk to someone who not illyan not your father how about my mother hm gregor bit into his torte upon which he had been making furrows with his fork for the first time she could be the only person on barrayar to automatically put gregor the man before gregor the emperor all our ranks look like optical illusions to her i think and you know she can keep her own counsel ill think about it i dont want to be the only one who the only one i know when im out of my depth you do gregor raised his brows one corner of his mouth crooking up oh yes i just dont normally let on all right i will said gregor miles waited my word gregor added miles relaxed immeasurably relieved thank you he eyed a third pastry the portions were sort of dainty are you feeling better these days much thank you gregor went back to plowing furrows in his cream really crosshatches i dont know unlike that poor sod they had parading around playing me while i was gone i didnt exactly volunteer for this all vor are draftees in that sense any other vor could run away and not be missed wouldnt you miss me a little said miles plaintively gregor snickered miles glanced around the garden it doesnt look like such a tough post compared to kyril island try it alone in bed at midnight wondering when your genes are going to start generating monsters in your mind like great uncle mad yuri or prince serg his glance at miles was secretly sharp i know about prince sergs uh problems said miles carefully everyone seems to have known except me so that had been the trigger of depressive gregors first real suicide attempt key and lock click miles tried not to look triumphant at this sudden feat of insight when did you find out during the komarr conference id run across hints before put them down to enemy propaganda then the ballet on the balcony had been an immediate response to the shock gregord had no one to vent it to was it true that he really got off torturing not everything rumored about crown prince serg is true miles cut hastily across this though the true core is bad enough mother knows she was eyewitness to crazy things even i dont know about the escobar invasion but shell tell you ask her straight shell tell you straight back that seems to run in the family gregor allowed too shell tell you how different you are from himnothing wrong with your mothers blood that i ever heardanyway i probably carry almost as many of mad yuris genes as you do through one line of descent or another gregor actually grinned is that supposed to be reassuring mm more on the theory that misery loves company im afraid of power gregors voice went low contemplative you arent afraid of power youre afraid of hurting people if you wield that power miles deduced suddenly huh close guess not deadon im afraid i might enjoy it the hurting like him prince serg he meant his father rubbish said miles i watched my grandfather try and get you to enjoy hunting for years you got good i suppose because you thought it was your vorish duty but you damn near threw up every time you halfmissed and we had to chase down some wounded beastie you may harbor some other perversion but not sadism what ive read and heard said gregor is so horribly fascinating i cant help thinking about it cant put it out of my mind your head is full of horrors because the world is full of horrors look at the horrors cavilo caused in the hegen hub if id strangled her while she sleptwhich i had a chance to do none of those horrors would have come to pass if none of those horrors had come to pass she wouldnt have deserved to be strangled some kind of timetravel paradox im afraid the arrow of justice flies one way only you cant regret not strangling her first though i suppose you can regret not strangling her after no no ill leave that to the cetagandans if they can catch her now that she has her head start gregor im sorry but i just dont think mad emperor gregor is in the cards its your advisors who are going to go crazy gregor stared at the pastry tray and sighed i suppose it would disturb the guards if i tried to shove a cream torte up your nose deeply you should have done it when we were eight and twelve you could have gotten away with it then the cream pie of justice flies one way miles snickered several unnatural and sophomoric things to do with a tray full of pastry were then suggested by both principals which left them laughing gregor needed a good cream pie fight miles judged even if only verbal and imaginary when the laughter finally died down and the coffee was cooling miles said i know flattery sends you straight up a wall but dammit youre actually good at your job you have to know that on some level inside after the vervain talks stay on it huh i think i will gregors fork dove more forcefully into his last bite of dessert youre going to stay on yours too right whatever it may be i am to meet with simon illyan on just that topic later this afternoon said miles he decided to forgo that third pastry after all you dont sound exactly excited about it i dont suppose he can demote me there is no rank below ensign hes pleased with you what else he didnt look pleased when i gave him my debriefing report he looked dyspeptic didnt say much he glanced at gregor in sudden suspicion you know dont you give mustnt interfere in the chain of command said gregor sententiously maybe youll move up it i hear the command at kyril island is open miles shuddered spring in the barrayaran capital city of vorbarr sultana was as beautiful as the autumn miles decided he paused a moment before turning in to the front entrance to the big blocky building that was impsec hq the earth maple still stood down the street and around the corner its tender leaves backlit to a delicate green glow by the afternoon sun barrayaran native vegetation ran to dull reds and browns mostly would he ever visit earth maybe miles produced proper passes for the door guards their faces were familiar they were the same crew hed helped supervise for that interminable period last winteronly a few months ago it seemed longer he could still rattle off their payrates they exchanged pleasantries but being good impsec men they did not ask the question alight in their eyes where have you been sir miles was not issued a security escort to illyans office a good sign it wasnt like he didnt know the way by now he followed the familiar turns into the labyrinth up the lift tubes the captain in illyans outer office merely waved him through barely glancing up from his comconsole the inner office was unchanged illyans oversized comconsole desk was unchanged illyan himself was rather tirederlooking paler he ought to get out and catch some of that spring sun eh at least his hair hadnt all turned white it was still about the same browngrey mix his taste in clothes was still bland to the point of camouflage illyan pointed to a seatanother good sign miles took it promptly finished whatever had been absorbing him and at last looked up he leaned forward to put his elbows on the comconsole and lace his fingers together and regarded miles with a kind of clinical disapproval as if he were a data point that messed up the curve and illyan was deciding if he could still save the theory by reclassifying him as experimental error ensign vorkosigan illyan sighed it seems you still have a little problem with subordination i know sir im sorry do you ever intend to do anything about it besides feel sorry i cant help it sir if people give me the wrong orders if you cant obey my orders i dont want you in my section well i thought i had you wanted a military evaluation of the hegen hub i made one you wanted to know where the destabilization was coming from i found out you wanted the dendarii mercenaries out of the hub theyll be leaving in about three more weeks i understand you asked for results you got them lots of them illyan murmured i admit i didnt have a direct order to rescue gregor i just assumed youd want it done sir illyan searched him for irony lips thinning as he apparently found it miles tried to keep his face bland though outblanding illyan was a major effort as i recall said illyan and illyans memory was eiditic thanks to an illyrican biochip i gave those orders to captain ungari i gave you just one order can you remember what it was this inquiry was in the same encouraging tone one might use on a sixyearold just learning to tie his shoes trying to outirony illyan was as dangerous as trying to outbland him obey captain ungaris orders miles recalled reluctantly just so illyan leaned back ungari was a good reliable operative if youd botched it youd have taken him down with you the man is now halfruined miles made little negative motions with his hands he made the correct decisions for his level you cant fault him its just things got too important for me to go on playing ensign when the man who was needed was lord vorkosigan or admiral naismith hm illyan said and yet who shall i assign you to now which loyal officer gets his career destroyed next miles thought this over why dont you assign me directly to yourself sir thanks said illyan dryly i didnt mean miles began to sputter protest stopped detecting the oblique gleam of humor in illyans brown eyes roasting me for your sport are you in fact just that proposal has been floated not needless to say by me but a galactic operative must function with a high degree of independence were considering making a virtue of necessity a light on illyans comconsole distracted him he checked something and touched a control the door on the wall to the right of his desk slid open and gregor stepped through the emperor shed one guard who stayed in the passageway the other trod silently through the office to take up station beyond the antechamber all doors slid shut illyan rose to pull up a chair for the emperor and gave him a nod a sort of vestigial bow before reseating himself miles who had also risen sketched a salute and sat too did you tell him about the dendarii yet gregor asked illyan i was working around to it said illyan gradually what about the dendarii miles asked unable to keep the eagerness out of his voice try though he might for a junior version of illyans impassive surface weve decided to put them on a permanent retainer said illyan you in your cover identity as admiral naismith will be our liaison officer consulting mercenaries miles blinked naismith lives gregor grinned the emperors own we owe them i think something more than just their base pay for their services to usand to usin the hegen hub and they have certainly demonstrated the er utility of being able to reach places cut off to our regular forces by political barriers miles interpreted the expression on illyans face as deep mourning for his section budget rather than disapproval as such simon shall be alert for and pursue opportunities to use them actively gregor went on well need to justify that retainer after all i see them as more use in espionage than covert ops illyan put in hastily this isnt a license to go adventuring or worse some kind of letter of marque and reprisal in fact the first thing i want you to do is beef up your intelligence department i know youre in funds for it ill lend you a couple of my experts not bodyguardpuppeteers again sir miles asked nervously shall i ask captain ungari if he wants to volunteer inquired illyan with a repressed ripple of his lips no you will operate independently god help us after all if i dont send you someplace else youll be right here so the scheme has that much merit even if the dendarii never do anything i fear it is primarily your youth which is the cause of simons lack of confidence murmured twentyfiveyearold gregor we feel it is time he gave up that prejudice yes that had been an imperial we miless barrayarantuned ears did not deceive him illyan had heard it as clearly the chief leaner leaned upon illyans irony this time was tinged with underlying approval aral and i have labored twenty years to put ourselves out of work we may live long enough to retire after all he paused thats called success in my business boys i wouldnt object and under his breath get this hellish chip taken out of my head at last mm dont go scouting surfside retirement cottages just yet said gregor not caving or backpedaling or submission merely an expression of confidence in illyan no more no less gregor glanced at miless neck the deep bruises from metzovs grip were almost gone by now surely were you still working around to the other thing too he asked illyan illyan opened a hand be my guest he rummaged in a drawer underneath his comconsole weand wethought we owed you something more too miles said gregor miles hesitated between a shuckstwerentnothin speech and a whatdidyoubringme and settled on an expression of alert inquiry illyan reemerged and tossed miles something small that flashed red in the air here youre a lieutenant whatever that means to you miles caught them between his hands the plastic collar rectangles of his new rank he was so surprised he said the first thing that came into his head which was well thats a start on the subordination problem illyan favored him with a driven glower dont get carried away about ten percent of ensigns are promoted after their first year of service your vorish social circle will think its all nepotism anyway i know said miles bleakly but he opened his collar and began switching tabs on the spot illyan softened slightly your father will know better though and gregor and er myself miles looked up to catch his eye direct for almost the first time this interview thank you you earned it you wont get anything from me you dont earn that includes the dressingdowns ill look forward to them sir
